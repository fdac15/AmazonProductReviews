"This is a nice product, but could be better.It's sturdy and it's a nice size. The tab for the cap is a great addition for anyone who's likely to drop or lose the cap. The cap can be removed from the tab if it annoys you. I wouldn't do this too many times, though, because the rubber tab is thin where it connects to the cap and I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks eventually.The stainless steel is a nice look, but it is not perfectly applied on the flask I got. Around one of the bottom corners of both sides of the flask, it's slightly rippled. This doesn't at all affect the function, and it's not sharp or anything, but it's the sort of thing that will drive a perfectionist nuts. Also, the stainless steel will show your fingerprints.It would have been nice to have a back-pocket curve to the flask. There is no curve at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AB8K2EV7WXPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV7BO#wasThisHelpful","R2AB8K2EV7WXPI","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these glasses for my husband who drinks bourbon on the rocks every night. When they arrived, they didn't inspire much confidence right from the start. Though they were packaged in two boxes, and each glass was individually wrapped in bubble wrap and brown paper, one of the glasses was broken and emitting a chemical smell. Into the garbage it went. The other glass was washed and placed in the freezer. Then my husband had the flu and didn't drink any bourbon for nearly a week, so the glass got a nice long sojourn in the freezer before being tested.After he poured the bourbon in, it took about 4 minutes for it to get cold enough, which he thought was far too long. By this time, the glass was frosty and not particularly comfortable to hold. Even the silicone base was cold and moist. The glass was so cold and frosty that you wouldn't want to hold it there, so you're limited in where you can hold it. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you realize that you're not really used to having to plan how to position your hand in order to pick up your glass.It's winter time and the house is 65 degrees inside. Even so, before long (well before he finished the drink), the chemical inside the glass began to melt and look kind of unsightly (photo attached). He didn't like that at all. It looks messy and sloppy. Instead of looking at your pretty amber liquid, you're looking at black silicone and partially melted trapped ice.The concept is cool (sorry) but it didn't really translate to an enjoyable experience. My husband said he'll throw the glass out. He would just prefer to have his bourbon in a regular low-ball glass with one of those huge slow-melting ice balls. It looks better and feels better that way.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8B1XC7WF7W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M72R7QY#wasThisHelpful","R2K8B1XC7WF7W7","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When these arrived in the mail, my 12 year old daughter (who didn't know they were coming) intercepted them before I even noticed and built a castle in the family room. When I walked in, the sunshine coming through the windows lit up her castle in sparkly jewel tones. It was beautiful!I was surprised at how large some of the tiles were. I examined them and they seem extremely durable. My daughter mentioned that she'd played with a different brand somewhere else and that these differ because the magnets move around just a bit and rattle. That didn't bother either one of us, it was just a difference she noted.For now I'm planning to leave these out in our family room in a basket so that we can play with them while talking or watching TV.

"I live in Florida (high humidity!) and have thick wavy hair that tends to be frizzy because I don't have time (or inclination) to style it in a way that might tame it (and I don't know how anyway). I'm a professor, so I can get away with this. (I hope I just look eccentric.)This product feels like a silicone gel. It goes on very lightly and does a great job controlling the frizz. I put a tiny amount on my hair when it's damp after a shower at night. Then I go to bed with my hair wet. (Honestly, this is how I manage my hair styling. It actually gets frizzier if I try to blowdry it, so I have to wash it at night and let it dry while I sleep). In the morning my hair is softer and much less frizzy than if I use a regular conditioner. I won't say ""more manageable"" because I don't even try to manage it. This product makes it look like I did try to manage it, though. There is no stickiness or flakiness or residue. You can't tell it's there.The smell doesn't bother me at all and it's not at all noticeable on dry hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6C673SB4Q5WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCGZ0KA#wasThisHelpful","R6C673SB4Q5WR","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great idea and I got it because I thought it would save space in our small at-home bar area. Just one jigger, right?In reality, though, there are trade-offs. It takes more time to use this than regular jiggers. You spend time adjusting this thing to make sure it's level. It's a little hard to see the numbers (for these 45 year old eyes) and you have to put it at eye level to check that you've got it set right. Then you have to hand wash. That means taking it apart and washing two parts. Since it has plastic with grooves, I feel like I need to really make sure it's clean. Whereas with a regular metal jigger, I feel like just a rinse will do it. So.... it saves space in the bar but takes more time to actually use when making drinks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBD8JGYW1MYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV796#wasThisHelpful","REBD8JGYW1MYM","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm thinking of this as a kind of fancy space heater. Honestly, when it arrived and I unpacked it, my husband balked. There was no way he wanted a fake fire with an electrical cord coming out of the fireplace. So I tried it there (looks great except for the cord), but basically I'm now using it as a glorified space heater in a different room where I work jigsaw puzzles at night. It gives me the illusion that I'm sitting next to a cozy fire, but I don't have to worry about smoke. I like it.The look of this thing is quite convincing, and the fire looks fairly real, but it does have a sort of medieval dungeon style to it. (A medieval dungeon with electricity.... )I haven't had any issues with sound. The heat works well. I'm going to continue using it as a space heater.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWFYNZQBF6UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0NMFX2#wasThisHelpful","R2JWFYNZQBF6UY","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works as promised and emits a steady stream of steam and aroma. I like all the different ways you can do the settings (no light, cycling light, one color light, continual mist, 30 second mist, etc). think the cycling lights is a little tacky, but it looks fine if you stop it on one color.This would make a nice light and fragrance for a guest bathroom.

"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.The Robots of Dawn is the third book in Isaac Asimov’s trilogy about investigator Elijah Bailey and his robot sidekick R Daneel Olivaw. In the first book, The Caves of Steel, the pair met and solved a murder mystery on Earth. In this far-future Earth, a fearful populace lives in domed cities and never ventures outside. In the second book, The Naked Sun, Elijah faces his fears and actually leaves Earth to solve a murder that occurred on a planet that has such low population density that the inhabitants have evolved a disgust for their fellow humans. When Elijah returns to Earth, he’s determined to use his new-found courage to inspire others to go outside the domes and even think about leaving Earth someday. He thinks that colonizing other planets is the only way that the human race on Earth can survive.In this final volume, The Robots of Dawn, we find Elijah working outside the dome and hoping that his son will be one of the pioneers who will lead humans out into the galaxy again. Then Elijah gets called into headquarters where he’s told he has to go to another colonized planet (Aurora) to solve yet another murder mystery. This time, however, it’s a robot who has been murdered. The prime suspect, a famous roboticist, admits that he’s the only person who could have committed the crime, yet he claims he’s innocent. If Elijah and R Daneel can’t prove him innocent, it will have bad consequences for Elijah’s career and for Earth’s ability to launch themselves into the galaxy. Daneel is also in mortal (if I can say that) danger.As was the case with the previous novels in this trilogy, I enjoyed the murder mystery. It’s complicated and takes a lot of effort to solve, especially because Elijah is working in a political and social culture that he doesn’t understand. (Although this actually lets him see some things more clearly.) I also appreciated some of Asimov’s inventions (virtual reality bathrooms — cool!) and the discussions about language (e.g., how specific words can change our perception of events), art, affection (e.g., the importance of human touch), sex, jealousy and love (e.g., how cultural attitudes about sex change how we feel about love — very interesting). By the way, The Robots of Dawn was written in 1983, 27 years after The Naked Sun, and this frank discussion of sex is new for Asimov (and not at all romantic).Asimov fans will be particularly interested in how this novel connects with his earlier robot stories (Susan Calvin is mentioned) and his famous FOUNDATION series. The accused roboticist is motivated to build a model of the human brain so that he can pursue the concept of “psychohistory” that underlies the FOUNDATION novels. Asimov is interested in the evolution of the human brain and the resulting changes in human behavior. As a neuroscientist and psychologist, I love to think about these things but I just can’t believe in any of Asimov’s ideas about the future of humanity. This has been a problem for me with this entire series and the FOUNDATION series, too. I find it interesting, but I just can’t believe it. However, I realize that I’m probably just taking it too seriously because it happens to be my area of expertise. So maybe shame on me. Maybe I just need to chill.I listened to the audio version read by William Dufris who, again, does a great job. He always does a great job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22TZ4A5PNLSLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024NP57Y#wasThisHelpful","R22TZ4A5PNLSLA","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.There is no way that any review I write about Monster Hunter Nemesis is going to have any sort of effect on anybody’s decision to read it. If you’re a fan of the extremely popular MONSTER HUNTER series, then you’re going to read Monster Hunter Nemesis, the fifth book. If you’re not, you won’t. And if you’re not in one of those two camps, you have no reason to be reading this review. But still I have to write it, because that’s my job.So, for those of you who ARE fans, what you can expect here is exactly what Correia has given us so far: great characters, a fascinating story, witty dialogue, and brutal violence. This particular installment features my favorite character: AGENT FRANKS! He’s a huge indestructible man(?) who works for the U.S. Monster Control Bureau, a government agency that fights monsters and sometimes works with or against Monster Hunter International. In Monster Hunter Nemesis we get his backstory. How old is he? Where did he come from? Why does he work for MCB? Why is he so loyal to the United States? How is he indestructible? You’ll find out in Monster Hunter Nemesis as Agent Franks takes on a bureaucrat who’s also a mad scientist. I have to say that I was completely surprised by the revelations and what they may mean for the ongoing MONSTER HUNTER story.Fans will be happy to see a little bit of our old friends at MHI, the gangsta gnomes, and Heather the werewolf. Several new intriguing characters are introduced, too, and I look forward to seeing them in future installments. One main character is tragically killed and there is a delightfully promising plot twist at the end.For those of you who haven’t yet started the MONSTER HUNTER series, I can highly recommend it if you love monsters, guns, engaging heroes, tons of action, clever plotting, and just the right amount of humor. I must warn you that it’s gory and violent (a little too much for me, honestly) and that Larry Correia’s libertarian views are occasionally on display, especially when he disrespects the government and the president of the United States (who is obviously President Obama).If you’re going to try MONSTER HUNTER, start with the first book (Monster Hunter International) and continue in publication order. I also highly recommend Audible Studios’ versions which are brilliantly narrated by Oliver Wyman who totally “gets” this series and gives us a perfect performance for each character, and especially for Agent Franks. If you’re not an audio reader, this one could definitely change your mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Q3LFIZ0W5G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476736553#wasThisHelpful","R21Q3LFIZ0W5G0","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.Warrior is the second installment in Jennifer Fallon’s WOLFBLADE trilogy, a prequel to her DEMON CHILD trilogy. Both trilogies make up the HYTHRUN CHRONICLES. In the first book, Wolfblade, which you’ll definitely want to read before picking up Warrior, we were introduced to Marla Wolfblade, sister to Lernen Wolfblade, the High Prince of Hythria. When we first met Marla, she was a bubble-headed blonde teenager dreaming of marrying a handsome warlord. At the end of the very long (600 pages, 25 hours in audio format) story, Marla had become a cynical and savvy politician and the most powerful woman in Hythria, thanks to her dwarf slave and a series of unfortunate politically-motivated disasters including adultery, betrayals, kidnappings, and assassinations.Warrior picks up eight years later. Marla, the richest woman in Hythria, is now basically running the country while her brother, the High Prince, debauches himself. Marla’s one goal is to keep Hythria and its throne safe for her son Damin. Her greatest enemy is Alija Eaglespike, the High Arrion, who wants her own son to be High Prince. In an attempt to discover Marla’s secrets and plans, Alija tries to get Elezaar, the dwarf who is Marla’s tutor and confidante, to betray Marla.Meanwhile Mahkas, who’s acting as regent of Krakandar province until Damin is 25, is doing his own scheming. He plans to raise his family to nobility by marrying his daughter to Damin, despite the fact that they don’t love each other. Mahkas has been a good regent so far, but as we saw in the first book, he can be brutal when something gets in his way. Marla’s other children and stepchildren are also growing up, of course, and she wants to make sure that each is placed in a position that’s powerful enough to help Damin. They are tools, but she loves them and wants them to be happy tools. Much of the story focuses on these kids, which is a nice change of pace. The story spans about twelve years, so we see each of them grow up.In addition to all of the political intrigue in Hythria, Marla also has to worry about the plague that is devastating the populace. Across the border, the Fardohnian king has his own reasons for bringing down the Wolfblade family, and this seems to be an opportune time to attack. At the end of Warrior, the political landscape has been completely changed, Marla’s family has another major tragedy that will have far-reaching consequences, and Marla begins to wonder if her love for her children, and especially her desire to protect Damin, have turned her into a monster.Readers who loved the characters and political drama of Wolfblade will be happy with Warrior. It’s just as brutal, twisty, and tragic. It’s a big (26 hours on audio!) epic soap opera. It’s Dynasty with swords and magic. For the most part, I was absorbed in the story, but I found myself occasionally getting impatient with the slow pace. Also, as I’ve mentioned before, I don’t completely believe in the Hythrun society’s gods and guilds. I won’t give the particulars again, because I’ve done that in other reviews, but my skepticism about the society means that I have a hard time believing some of the plot. For example, why didn’t Elezaar just lie? Why can’t Marla just pay to have Alija assassinated? (Or vice versa?) It seems like that’d be easier, faster and more effective than setting up these convoluted schemes to bring each other down.I listened to Audible Studio’s version of Warrior. Maggie Mash, the narrator, has an attractive and suitable voice. Her pace is too slow, but I was able to fix that by tripling the playback speed (this has no effect on the pitch). Her reading of some of her dialogue is choppy and stilted, which is slightly annoying, but not enough to keep me from recommending this version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397HEZCUR5HSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765348705#wasThisHelpful","R397HEZCUR5HSV","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.Warlord is the last book in Jennifer Fallon’s WOLFBLADE trilogy which is a prequel to her DEMON CHILD trilogy and part of her HYTHRUN CHRONICLES. Like its predecessors, Wolfblade and Warrior, it’s a huge sprawling epic (26 hours on audio). The story starts immediately after the tragic events of Warrior (which you really must read first). Marla is still the wealthiest and most powerful woman in the country, but she has taken a major hit and, in some ways, feels alone, despite her large family.Hablet, the Fardohnian king, is planning to take advantage of Hythria’s weakness while the country is recovering from a plague and while their high prince, Lernen, a useless wastrel, is still ruling. Hablet is massing his army for an invasion and hoping that his independently-minded daughter Adrina won’t ruin things for him. (Hint: She is an important character in the DEMON CHILD trilogy.) Both Marla and her nemesis, Alija Eaglespike, want their own sons to lead Hythria’s army against Hablet. Because of what happened in the previous book, the publically cordial relationship between Marla and Alija has broken down and both women are openly plotting against each other.Meanwhile, back in Krakandar, Mahkas has become paranoid because Damin is nearing his age of majority. Mahkas is frantically trying to hold on to his rule of the province, and he’s desperate to keep certain secrets that he’s been hiding since book one. He has turned into a mad despot while Damin is away with the Hythrun army. It will take all of our protagonists — Marla, Damin, Marla’s other children’s families, and several friends and allies — to set things to right in Hythria. Most importantly, Damin, who has been trying to fly under the radar by pretending to be just as much of a wastrel as his uncle is, can now show the world that he’s ready to be a warlord.Several other subplots are going on, too, of course. A couple of these involve women’s issues — one woman is being beaten by her husband and wants a divorce. Another wants to be able to rule her own province instead of being forced to marry a man who can rule it for her. Even Marla, the most powerful woman in the country, has no authority of her own. Her power only comes from her ability to influence the men in her life. How will the various power struggles going on in Hythria and Fardonyha affect how women will be treated now and in the future?Fans of the WOLFBLADE trilogy are sure to be satisfied with this final installment. It’s got everything we expect from Jennifer Fallon: murder, treachery, love, hate, jealousy, adultery, schemes, revenge, tragedies, triumphs, twists. Fallon keeps us guessing about how things will turn out. While we expect the Wolfblade family to eventually triumph, what we don’t know is how much they’ll have to lose to do so.My complaints are minor and the same as before — mainly an inability to get completely absorbed because some of the culture and plot seems contrived for dramatic effect. Also, I just didn’t think Marla and Damin were as clever as the other characters thought they were. Some of their brilliant tactics seemed either obvious or unnecessarily elaborate or risky to me. A few of the characters (especially Lernen and Mahkas) go over the top in this installment and some of the dialogue is inappropriately modern. But readers who’ve overlooked these minor details before shouldn’t have any trouble doing so this time either, and most will be eager to move on to the DEMON CHILD trilogy, if they haven’t already read it (or maybe even if they have). It features Damin and Adrina in later years.Maggie Mash narrates Audible’s version of Warlord. As I mentioned in my review of Warrior, she has a lovely voice but her pace is slow (but it’s easy to increase the speed with Audible’s app) and her reading of the dialogue tends to be choppy at times. Still, I’d recommend WOLFBLADE on audio for readers who enjoy character-driven political dramas and revenge fantasies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RF2NRXHYELN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765309912#wasThisHelpful","R3RF2NRXHYELN3","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.In several equatorial regions of the earth, an alien plant has been growing. The “Chaga,” as it is called, came from outer space and destroys anything manmade that comes near it. Scientists are worried about what it might do to humans. They have not been able to kill it and it is advancing slowly but steadily each day, changing the landscape and covering villages and cities as it progresses. Not only are people’s lives being disrupted as they have to flee their homes and become refugees, but they’re also worried about what the Chaga is doing here in the first place. Is it benign? Is there an intelligence behind it? Is it a precursor to an alien invasion? Nobody knows.The mystery of the Chaga and its effect on humanity have inspired Gaby McAslin, a feisty red-headed green-eyed Irish woman, to become a journalist so she can go to Nairobi and try to figure out what the Chaga is doing as it descends from Mount Kilimanjaro. She goes to college, gets a degree in journalism (though it seems like a biology degree would have served her better), gets a job, and manages to get a series of promotions that allow her to go to Nairobi to report on the Chaga. While she’s there she’s immersed in Kenyan culture (including all its beauty and its corruption), manages to sneak into the Chaga area (which is guarded by soldiers), meets people who have been physically affected by the Chaga, exposes the activities of crooked U.N. troops, and gets sexually involved with a few men.The best part of Evolution’s Shore, which is the first book in a trilogy, is the Chaga itself, and what it represents. At the beginning of the book, it’s a complete mystery as the story focuses more on developing Gaby’s character. The Chaga area has a dark sinister feel like Area X in Jeff Vandermeer’s SOUTHERN REACH series. (It also reminded me of Downward to the Earth by Robert Silverberg and, believe it or not, George R.R. Martin’s WILD CARDS anthologies). As we learn additional information about the Chaga, it becomes even more intriguing. I’d love to talk about McDonald’s science fiction ideas here, because I think they’re really cool, but I don’t want to ruin the story for you, so I won’t. The slow reveal was my favorite part of the book. By the end, we don’t have all the answers, so I look forward to reading more in book 2, Kirinya.The most important theme is, as the title suggests, human evolution. Have we come to an evolutionary dead-end because we are able to use technology to control our environment? And, if so, can we use our advances in technology and science, especially in the areas of genetics, neuroscience, organic chemistry, space exploration and communication, to change ourselves? Is it possible that our society could evolve into one that has no poverty or market pressures? Could we evolve to live in space? What will a post-humanity look like? McDonald adds poignancy to these questions by setting his story in Africa, humanity’s birthplace.Besides the cool science fiction, Evolution’s Shore focuses on important earthly problems such as poverty, HIV, organized crime, government corruption, discrimination, and Eurocentrism. The book also has something to say about the importance of home (many of the characters, including Gaby herself, are displaced temporarily or permanently).Unfortunately, I wasn’t too fond of McDonald’s protagonist, Gaby McAslin. She’s self-absorbed and immature, her personality is abrasive, she takes some stupid risks, and she’s a bit slutty. (I do like her sense of social justice, though.) Much of the plot focuses on Gaby’s career and her relationships. I loved the sections where she was making discoveries about the Chaga, and I also enjoyed the Kenya setting (this was well done). I would have appreciated Evolution’s Shore even more if I had liked Gaby.I listened to Audible Studio’s version of Evolution’s Shore which is 17.5 hours long. Narrator Melanie McHugh (who, I’m assuming, is Irish) was perfect for this role. Her pacing was nice and her voices were believable except that she has the guy from the American Midwest pronounce the letter H as “haitch” instead of “aitch.” But that’s hardly worth mentioning. I liked the audio version so much that I’ll be reading Kirinya on audio, too. Today, in fact.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9OPQ93OL6C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553374354#wasThisHelpful","RT9OPQ93OL6C1","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.The Lady of Han-Gilen is the second novel in Judith Tarr’s AVARYAN saga. In the first book, The Hall of the Mountain King, we met Mirain, supposedly the son of the sun god Avaryan and a human princess. Mirain appeared in Ianon, where his grandfather rules, became his heir, and fought for control of the kingdom. The story wasn’t particularly original, but I enjoyed Tarr’s style and Jonathan Davis’s audio performance.This second installment, which can stand alone fairly well, takes place several  years later and focuses on a new character: Princess Elian of Han-Gilen, foster sister of Mirain. Red-haired and independently-minded, Elian has left a trail of spurned suitors in her wake, but now she’s getting older and feeling the pressure to marry. When she finally meets a man who is good enough to match her in wits and martial skills, it’s time to finally make the choice she knew she’d someday have to make. Instead of marrying the perfect suitor, and probably being a happy wife, she decides to go find Mirain, the boy she promised herself to when she was a little girl. But he’s traveling around the continent, trying to peacefully unite neighboring kingdoms under the sun god’s rule. So, Elian disguises herself as a boy and sets out to find him. If she succeeds, will he be the same person he was when she knew him? Will he want to marry her?In The Lady of Han-Gilen we learn some of Mirain’s backstory, we find out what happened to his mother (the king of Ianon’s daughter), and we learn about the sun god’s enemy and why Mirain wants to unite the kingdoms. (This, of course, is viewed by the other kings as Mirain’s lust for power.) We also become reacquainted with Mirain’s squire and we learn that Elian has some powers of her own which might be useful to Mirain’s kingdom.The story started off well. Elian is easy to like, at first, when she’s knocking off the suitors who aren’t smart or strong enough for her. But once she finds Mirain and he doesn’t act like the rest of her suitors (apparently he has no idea how to woo a woman, which is surprising, because he knows how to charm everyone else), her confidence dwindles and this fiercely independent red-head devolves into a spineless ninny who can’t decide who she loves and what she should do. “I love Mirain! No, I hate Mirain! I love the other guy! Damn Mirain for not helping me make up my mind! Does he love me? Does the other guy love me? I love Mirain! I hate him!” This got boring fairly quickly, yet it went on for hours. Unfortunately, not even the immensely talented Jonathan Davis could make it interesting, though he tried valiantly, contributing lots of emotion and angst to Elian’s indecision. But, really, how much pleasure can you get out of one fickle girl’s waffling? There’s plenty of fist clenching, smoldering, and glaring that goes along with all this, but not enough to make me care. There’s more to the story than the romance, of course, but by the time important events started happening, I was annoyed and ready to be done. It was too little too late.I mentioned in my review of the The Hall of the Mountain King that Judith Tarr’s style elevated that novel above most standard epic fantasies. That style is present here, too, and it’s often lovely, filled with old-fashioned sentence structures, interesting imagery and vivid metaphors. But with all of the repetitive emotional outbursts, it mostly feels heavy and overblown.I’m so thankful to Audible Studios for bringing out so much middle-aged SFF in the last few years (this one’s from 1987) and recruiting excellent narrators like Jonathan Davis (one of my top five favorite narrators) to bring these stories to life. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much he could do with The Lady of Han-Gilen, despite his best effort. It’s just boring.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4S6C2HYMM3YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812556216#wasThisHelpful","R4S6C2HYMM3YA","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.In this third novel of Judith Tarr’s AVARYAN RISING trilogy (which probably could stand alone), it’s been 15 years since the events of the previous book, The Lady of Han-Gilen. Mirain and Elian now have a teenage son named Saraven who is heir to the throne of his country. One day Saraven saves the life of Hirel, the son of the king of a neighboring kingdom. At first they have nothing in common and even despise each other, but after enduring a series of accidental adventures which include being captured and escaping a few times, the boys eventually overcome their prejudices and become friends. When they make several unsuccessful attempts to stop their fathers from destroying each others’ kingdoms, they end up resorting to a bizarre solution that shocks everybody (including me). As young leaders, they make a sacrifice to save their people, but the path they choose turns out to be even more dangerous than they expected.A Fall of Princes has a couple of likeable protagonists, a unique plot, and a totally unexpected plot twist. Like The Hall of the Mountain King (the first book in the trilogy) and unlike The Lady of Han-Gilen (the second book), it also has several touching moments and produces some thought-provoking scenarios. I don’t want to give too many specifics, for fear of spoiling the plot twist, but one thing A Fall of Princes does well is to explore the nature of prejudice. According to psychologists, the fastest and most effective way to reduce prejudice is to spend time (preferably working together) with the people you have prejudiced attitudes about. In A Fall of Princes, Tarr forces her protagonists to work together and shows us how they come to understand and appreciate their differences.Unfortunately (and like the previous novel), the plot moves at a glacial pace. Characters are given intense focus as they think, talk, or otherwise interact with each other. There are many moments where, for example, one character touches another, that take minutes to describe. We see a lot of riding, bathing, eating, and braiding of hair. Also lots of slapping, glaring, scowling, shivering, and fist clenching. The characters spend hours waffling over their feelings for each other. Do they hate each other? Do they love each other? Are they enemies, brothers, or lovers? There’s so much talking and SO MUCH DRAMA! Repetitive drama. The same kind of repetitive drama as in the last book. Oh, I already said that.Again, Jonathan Davis gives a wonderful performance in Audible Studio’s version of A Fall of Princes, but he can’t save it from being another mostly boring angst-fest. A Fall of Princes is over 18 hours long on audio, but only about 5 of those hours are actually entertaining.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPI9U3E5V62Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812556445#wasThisHelpful","RZPI9U3E5V62Y","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. We review SFF, horror, and comics for adults and kids, in print and audio daily.After recently enjoying Ian McDonald’s Evolution’s Shore, the first book in his CHAGA series, I was eager to proceed with book two, Kirinya. I wanted to know where McDonald was going with the fascinating ideas he presented in that first novel. What is the goal of the Chaga, the alien evolution machine that has landed on Earth in the form of a ground-covering jungle that changes the landscape and its human inhabitants as it slowly progresses across equatorial regions? What is in the BDO (Big Dumb Object) that came from Saturn and hovers in Earth’s orbit? How will our world’s societies and cultures be affected by these otherworldly intrusions?As Kirinya begins we learn that Gaby, the famous feisty Irish journalist, has had Shepherd’s baby. Because their daughter Serena was affected by the Chaga, Gaby and Serena are sent to live in the Chaga and not allowed out. People who live in the Northern Hemisphere don’t want to be infected by those who’ve been changed by the Chaga because of the weird genetic mutations it causes. Deprived of her career and her connection to Shepherd (who’s in the BDO), Gaby sinks into obscurity and lives, for many years, as a whore and a drug addict who neglects her daughter.Eventually Oksana, the Siberian pilot, shows up and Serena leaves home and joins a terrorist group. After a tragedy strikes, Gaby is finally shaken up enough to decide to make some life changes. With some help from Faraway, a former lover, she gets back on her feet and becomes a spokesperson for a group that wants to put together a world peace summit to address the way the Northern countries are treating the Chaga-infested South. Meanwhile Serena is involved in a terrorist plot to wrest control of the BDO from the American military. Some of Serena’s action scenes are quite exciting and would make great movie scenes.We learn very little about the things I wanted to learn about in Kirinya. We get only a few chapters from Shepherd’s point of view in the BDO. These consist of his diary entries and they only hint at the big picture. Fortunately, Shepherd talks a lot more like a poet than a scientist. (I know dozens of scientists and not one of them talks like Shepherd does.) Shepherd tells us about some of the intriguing findings in the BDO, but these updates stop just when they get interesting and we never learn more.We also don’t see nearly as much of the Chaga-induced changes as I was hoping to see and most of what we do see is quite a bit different than I was expecting after reading Evolution’s Shore. It seemed like the Chaga was a benign influence that would provide people with their daily necessities and allow humans to live in peace and prosperity rather than conflict and competition. Or it might have been a vehicle for Africans to empower themselves, overthrow their oppressors, and transform their role in the global economy. But that is not what Gaby’s new world is like which, I suppose, may be Ian McDonald’s commentary on human nature and the way developed nations suppress  undeveloped nations rather than an abandonment of his original ideas. The AIDS theme, which I found fascinating, seems to be completely dropped, though.There are a few glimpses of how the Chaga has changed life in the South, such as the bus driver who has no legs and whose nerves connect directly from his spine to his bus’s electrical system. Or the immensely huge woman who remembers everything she experiences by storing the memories as fat. Or the way everyone who lives in the Chaga can tune their brain to receive radio signals. There was an interesting speculation about the development of human consciousness and a cool idea about whale song and computer language, but most of the story focused on Gaby’s depravity and Serena’s rebellion rather than the effects of a world being overrun by an unknown alien presence that’s trying to remake the human race.I mentioned in my review for Evolution’s Shore that I didn’t like Gaby because she’s abrasive, immature, selfish and slutty. Well, she’s even worse in Kirinya. She’s more abrasive, immature, selfish and slutty than ever, and to top it all off with a cherry on top, she’s a really bad mom. There are far too many scenes which narrate the particular details of what Gaby calls her “filthy” sex life. We learn much more about what she does in bed (or wherever) than how she does her job (which is more important to the plot). Most of the characters seem obsessed with their (and everyone else’s) sex organs and bodily orifices and a lot of the dialogue is unnecessarily vulgar. I’m not a prude, but I was disappointed that this was more prominent in the plot than Gaby’s job or new information about the Chaga.I didn’t get what I wanted out of Kirinya, but I still admire Ian McDonald’s style and I look forward to reading more of his work. The audio version of Kirinya was produced by Audible Studios and is 17.5 hours long. Narrator Melanie McHugh is superb. Her voices for each of the characters are distinct and fitting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EDBGIBZZ6P99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857988760#wasThisHelpful","R1EDBGIBZZ6P99","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simple is best.In 1963 Alex Graham's comic strip ""Fred Basset"" first appeared in London newspapers and the hound was an instant hit with readers in the UK and in many other parts of the world. In the early days Fred was a strange looking chap but he was a basset in every way and from his viewpoint  life was about food, relaxing and getting into trouble he wasn't even looking for.This hardbound book is a sample of the 18,000 comic strips published over  the course of the last fifty years and it gives a fair glimse into one hound's life. Three strips are featured from all of the years starting with 1963 through to 2013. Fred's world hasn't changed that much and he deals with the same issues as always (Bassets, are not happy with changes of any sort!) and the strip still retains it's charm and wit with a hound's heart after all these years.Fred Basset, is a family affair as after Alex Graham passed away in the 1990's his daughter Arran Graham and her husband Alistair provide the ideas Michael Martin finishes it up with his artwork. The quality of this great comic has never faltered and it remains a wonderful treasure for it's humble readers.Here's to another 50 years Fred!Four Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFNT9MXOGEV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849534098#wasThisHelpful","RSFNT9MXOGEV1","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been 11 years between Poco's last studio effort: ""Running Horse"" (2002) and this new one entitled: ""All Fired Up"" and in the past decade a few things have happened: George Grantham suffered a stroke and is no longer a part of the band. Paul Cotton, a member of the band since replacing Jim Messina in 1971 has left the band (I don't know any details as to WHY Paul has left) and longtime bass player Jack Sundrud has stepped up in his role in Poco and is writing more and singing a bit differently from the way he was earlier.The new edition of Poco is: Rusty Young and Jack Sundrud joined by George Lawrence on drums and percussion and Michael Webb on keyboards, vocals and a variety of stringed instruments. The sound of the band is very different without Paul Cotton and his guitars not being a part of this. Paul,  always gave Poco a harder edge due to his playing skills as a writer he was very essential as he wrote some big hits and fan favorites for this band that leave with him. George, was an amazing singer and solid drummer and the harmonies aren't as strong without George and Paul.That said the songs found on this one are way better than the material that was selected for ""Running Horse"" in 2002. The biggest difference in the songs found on: All Fired Up"" are Jack's songs as they are some of the best things on this record. The new and improved writing and singing from Jack Sundrud brings this new CD up higher by at least a few notches.The Title track: ""All Fired Up"" sounds like it could have found a place on: ""Pickin' Up The Pieces"" way back in 1968 as it really has the ol' time Poco feel and fire. Michael Webb contributes: ""That's What Rock 'N' Roll Will Do"" with some great saxophone from guest player Bobby Keys that rocks out in good style. ""Regret"" is one of those Rusty Young ballads that ooze like honey, ""Neil Young"" is about a guy that shares the same last name as Rusty but comes from a different family. ""Rusty Huddle Stomp"" is a brisk acoustic instrumental from that will be a showcase at the live gigs to prove just how great R. Young can play anything with strings attached to it.At first play I wasn't sure about this new record from Poco and I still miss Paul Cotton as he and Rusty kept this magicial thing called Poco alive for decades together. But, with more plays on the CD machine this one has really won me over as a migthy fine Poco record.

"After all the releases from 1977 that have come forth lately you may of thought that was the only year that The Grateful Dead played concerts but here we go into 1978 to a town called ""Normal"" and a nice Bettyboard of the band's show at the Horton Field House in April of 1978. This is known as the year that The Grateful Dead made it to Egypt and performed three shows at the foot of the Sphinx and those shows and the return to San Francisco and the shows there at Winterland (""From Egypt With Love"") have already been let loose to the public. Another thing noteworthy of 1978 is that Drums>Space became a regular center  of the band's 2nd set in February of this year and remained in place until the end in 1995.The ""Dave's Picks"" series has been really great as Dave and his pals have turned out some really great moments of live Dead and Vol. 1 - Vol. 6 have been really fantastic. When I received this latest 'Pick' I played disc two first as I had a feeling (rightfully so) that this was going to be the right place to dive into this one. There are three selections found on the middle disc and they are ""Scarlet Begonias>Fire On The Mountain>Good Lovin"" and this is the meat of the show as Jerry, Bobby and Phil blaze throw 31 minute sequence like a house on fire. The drums are all chunk and thump throughout this and both Bob and Jerry are pumping their wah-wah pedals making noises that sound just like MIDI effects (that hadn't been invented yet!) and Bobby throws in some slide guitar and more wah and it is like nothing anybody else was creating in the seventies on any stage. My wife heard me listening to this and about 7 minutes into ""Fire"" she exclaimed: ""That Goat's Got Gas"" and I cracked-up as all the honking outta those two guitars did sound like goats on a rampage.Disc one is a standard 1st set with ""Big River"" and ""Passenger"" being the standouts with a bit of jamming in them to increase the X-Factor a bit higher. The tease before ""Me & My Uncle"" is only a few seconds long and I won't pop the balloon here and it shall remain a secret until you hear it.Disc three has a long ""Rhythm Devils"" at almost 14 minutes in length and ""Space"" is weird (as it should be) and that morphs into a layed-back ""Not Fade Away"" that is just like the 77 editions and then a very soulful ""Black Peter"" features Jerry in peak form as a singer and this version of Peter has a huge build up at the end that drops right into ""Around And Around"" that bookends the show with Chuck Berry (""Promised Land"" opens set one) and it's a high-energy finish all the way.""Werewolves Of London"" is the encore and it's a howl-fest and one of the band's best cover tunes ever performed.I Like this show and I hope more from 1978 does see the light of day as future releases.Three & 1/2 Stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3BX53OZY687/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAA6A32#wasThisHelpful","R1H3BX53OZY687","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the very first bootleg LP's I bought way back in 1972 was one by The Who from The Swinging Pig label of a famous gig the band played at the Fillmore East in New York City in April, 1968 and it started me down a dark path of collecting bootlegs of many rock bands and acts over the next four decades and as The Who had only one live album available in the early 1970's I scooped up every concert disc and tape I could find of my favorite band doing what they do best...Playing live.On June 27th, 2002 John Entwistle joined Keith Moon to play in that great gig in the sky and this tragic event happened within days of a forthcoming Who tour of America.

Without John the sound of The Who would forever be altered and Pete has stated no one can replace John but the show did indeed go on and this authorized bootleg is from two months later as the tour of the USA rolled on.Chicago, Illinois - September 23, 2002:DISC ONE:1. I Can't Explain2. Substitute3. Anyway Anyhow AnywherePete introduces the band4. Who Are You5. I Don't Even Know Myself6. Baba O' Riley7. Sea & Sand8. 5:159. Love Reign O'er Me10. Eminence FrontThere is no information found on this set other than the band's name and the location and date of the gig. Zak Starkey, has been the band's drummer since the mid-1990's and he is pretty damn great and a real good fit for The Who. Ringo, has great genes! Pete's little brother Simon plays guitar and sings and Rabbit is in the keyboard spot. Sound quality, is about what you would find on a medium quality bootleg and it has the sound of a two-track recording so if sound quality is your major concern these discs may not be of your liking as the sound is indeed rough and when you crank this puppy up it goes into an area of major distortion quite like you would experience at an actual rock concert.Pete plays as much electric guitar at this show as he does in his normal role as an acoustic player and Pete is having a good night as the power chords are HUGE and the leads blister outta the gate like a swarm of angry wasps. Pete Townshend has improved with age and is indeed quite a great guitarist. Roger, is in fine voice on this and not having the problems with his vocals that would effect his singing later in this same decade. Pino, is heard well in this mix and he plays some great runs and he doesn't go with Entwistle's raw power (John, was often a lot louder than Pete!) but he is a first-class player that knows this music very well. Again, I am a fan of Zak's playing and he is playing a storm on this night in Chicago.DISC TWO:1. Behind Blue Eyes2. The Kids Are Alright3. My Generation4. Won't Get Fooled AgainENCORE5. Pinball Wizard6. Amazing Journey/Sparks7. See Me Feel Me/Listening To YouThe set list speaks volumes as these songs are bigger, louder and more jammed out than anything the band ever layed down in a studio and for geezers of this advanced age to play like this is really special. (The band always plays a great show in Chicago) These two CD's contain one of the best live concerts you are gonna hear from anybody still threading the boards these days. There is still a lot of magic to be found on this bus and only because of the sound quality (the performance is an 11) I rate this one:Four Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0FSCDRH66P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMCLLFC#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0FSCDRH66P","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The backstory of this set has happened over and over again as people really do find boxes of tapes of vintage Grateful Dead shows in storage and for some strange reasons they are delivered to the band's doorstep in Marin County. When Dave got his hands on this box of tapes of complete shows from late 1969 and early 1970 he had found lost treasure and he was wise enough to share his booty with other misfits that live for this sorta adventure.An interesting thing is presented over the course of 4 CD's as many tunes are found here that are played in each night of live music performed and now we are able to compare just what happens from night to night with the same song. There are two different versions of: ""Hard To Handle"" ""New Speedway Boogie"" ""Lovelight"" ""Black Peter"" ""China>Rider"" ""Good Lovin"" ""Cumberland Blues"" ""St. Stephen"" & ""Dark Star."" A new song (that was only played a handful of times) is featured on this set three times and that one is entitled: ""Mason's Children.""DISC ONE: This St. Louis set of 2/2/70 is an amazing find as Jerry Garcia has the turbos going in full force and is playing like he was glued to his guitar. Somehow, I know if a ""Dark Star"" is gonna be a favorite of mine right from the opening notes and with this one it happened again. This: ""Dark Star"" is a very pretty one and there are some delicate lines played with Phil and Bobby countering perfectly every note Jerry plays. ""Dark Star"" isn't the only reason that Dave picked this show but it's a stunning center piece in St. Louis in 1970. The only crowd noise I detected early on here was a cheer that goes up with the opening notes of: ""St.Stephen"" and I found this fan favorite to be slightly off and I had my answer why it was different when it suddenly blasted perfectly smack into: ""Mason's Children"" before it had arrived at it's normal ending. We got lucky with this treasure being found as this is a classic night from 43 years past.DISC TWO: The ending of the St. Louis show and we are back in San Francisco for a Fillmore West show from 12/20/69. Pigpen tells you to: ""Get yer' hands outta yer' pockets"" in fine fashion and a touch of gospel sends the happy hippies of the Midwest home to dream about all of this and then it's back to the city by the bay. ""Dark Star"" is good this time up but St. Louis got the better one. ""St.Stephen>The Eleven"" is a monster and again it's Jerry playing every note in the book with the power of a forest fire and it's great to hear huge lightning bolts of energy from these youngsters.DISC THREE: Pure Pigpen for your pleasure! The huge (35 minute) ""Lovelight"" is Pigpen's spotlight and this will soon be regarded by all that witness it as one of Pigpen's finest moments. ""China Cat>Rider"" is fine but what I would like to see is the look of some of the hippies faces when the band played ""High Time"" and ""Me And My Uncle"" as there is no way that they could have expected these romps through the rodeo while trippin' on Orange Sunshine.BONUS DISC: Some folks didn't get one of these and they missed out as it's my favorite of the 4 CD's found here. ""Smokestack>New Speedway Boogie"" is a wonderful pairing done proper as the band is turning on a dime making big things...Well...BIGGER! A sweet: ""Dire Wolf"" is one of the best I have heard and if there is such a thing as ""Acid-Folk"" it would sound like this in your head. ""Black Peter"" is again so fine to my ears it is very welcome to hear two fantastic Peter's played so close together from these special times. The meat of the Bonus Disc is this version of: ""The Other One"" that goes right in Dark Star territories like a pyscho-safari looking for the biggest game.The Packaging: The cover of the Bonus Disc sure does look like a tee-shirt to me and I hope to see it over at the band's official website real soon. The essays from Tom Constanten and Dave are excellent and the story of the tapes is included in great detail. The newspaper clippings added to the flavor of the times in right good fashion.This set sold out faster than anything that came before and it's contents are golden.FIVE STARS!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WVUVNUTI7Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMBUOJW#wasThisHelpful","R38WVUVNUTI7Y2","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was 1979 and Hot Tuna was doing some down-time so Jorma headed back to the studio with his speed skates and some very short hair (for racing) and a wonderful batch of songs. Without Jack Casady and Bob Steeler, Jorma was on his own and he brought along his acoustic and electric guitars, spoons and his voice and quickly put this record together.The artwork found here is very close to the original Hot Tuna album as if Jorma was on his way back to the begining. A powerful opener of: ""Straight Ahead"" sets the tone of Jorma and his guitars that are mixed with the leads lower than the slashing chords that carry the tune. Low key it is but it sounds very nice. Also right here you will discover some of Jorma's greatest vocal work of his long career. ""Roads & Roads &"" was in Jorma's live set for decades and in it's original glory you will hear it on this disc. ""Valley Of Tears"" ""Song For The High Mountains"" ""Wolves & Lambs"" are all gems and Jorma is cranking out one sparkler right after another on this.With: ""Too Long Out/Too Long In"" Jorma recreates an electric Hot Tuna moment without a care and you won't bust out all the windows in your house with Jack sitting out this set. ""Vampire Woman"" was another popular part of live Hot Tuna and Jorma shows for years to come but I have not heard the other fantastic material on this CD performed live and it should be out there as these songs are really fine. Everybody knows ""Quah"" and all the Hot Tuna records but don't forget this one ""Jorma"" as it's one of his very best. I only wish it was longer.Four & 1/2 Stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BH0J1L26J1VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000053ZQB#wasThisHelpful","R3BH0J1L26J1VY","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was early 1970 and I was in my favorite bookstore in downtown Hayward, Ca. where I spotted this 50 cent Fawcett paperback of my favorite Basset, the one and only Fred Basset. Already a legend in the UK but also an international star that was featured in the San Francisco Chronicle I was then and  still today a big fan of Fred.This was the very first assembled volume of Fred's adventures in a paperback edition released in America and I found my two quarters and grabbed up this glorious treasure and headed home. This book was a favorite of my mother that discovered Fred long before I did and she introduced my to this Basset's tales in the mid-sixties. This book features a strip per page and Fred's stories are told in two, three and four panels in glorious black and white.Fred's adventures have stayed the same over the last 50 years and I'm thankful that this winning formula hasn't changed and our hound is still good ol' Fred. Hungry or howling but never heeling at the leash, Alex Graham has created an icon that with any luck will still be in print 100 years from now. This is the hound that's more than human.I still collect Fred Basset books but, this was the first of so very many that sit in my library today. Long live this great hound!FIVE STARS!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWN9SM9WIAPIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XBGQNG#wasThisHelpful","RWN9SM9WIAPIJ","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far there are two of these volumes that collect a year ""Wizard Of Id"" newspaper strips (dailies and Sundays) and as they may not be around forever I say if you want a good sample of a comic strip when it was riding the crest of the wave jump into the waters right here.  This is a wonderful introduction to the best 'gag' strip ever printed. Johnny Hart, wrote these short tales of a kooky kingdom of characters that keep the laughs pointed in your direction. Brent Parker, provides the art and it fits the looseness of the gags as a perfect compliment.This is stand-up comedy of the highest fashion and even the prisoner in the darkest hole under the castle keeps his wit and has a sense of flair (even if he doesn't smell very fresh!) There is The King (Rat Fink!) The Wizard, The Court Jester, Rodney (a Knight afraid of the dark) and The Peasants, that grubby mass of rabble that get's in the last-word everytime. In this world of Id all of the folks have a sharp sense of humor that lights up The Dark Ages in fine fashion.These li'l books are of fine quality and such a nice way to take a peek into the works of two cartoon masters. ""Wizard Of Id"" is still one of the greatest comic strips that has ever been out there for us to enjoy.Have a laugh!FIVE STARS!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6DS0F0HIQE3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848566832#wasThisHelpful","R6DS0F0HIQE3Q","A1AMUJB81XGXD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AMUJB81XGXD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Christmas Curse is one of those stories that is going to grab your heart and not let go.  Both Emily and Griff feel cursed around Christmas.  Things have happened to them both during what should be the happiest season of the year that just brings back sad, unhappy memories.  Ironically, they have both decided to run away for Christmas this year.  Emily to a mountain cabin that promises to let her disappear if that’s what she wants.  Griff to the cabin he keeps where no one will venture anywhere near him.  What they actually got was a bit of both their wishes and a whole lot more.The last thing Emily had expected was to be stranded at the inn, during an ice storm with a total stranger – a totally gruff and rude stranger.  Yes, maybe she’d turned her cell phone off a bit too early in her attempt to hide from Christmas and missed some important messages.  And maybe she should have checked the weather predictions for the location in the mountains she was heading for, but she didn’t.  All too soon she realized that those small things that she had thought unimportant were really deal breakers right now.  Snow was one thing, but an ice storm that coated everything in a shimmering glow that looked beautiful from behind the window curtains, but held deadly consequences if you ventured out in it…  was just not something she had planned for this trip.During their time of isolation, Emily and Griff did their best to cope with the situation and each other, if a bit grudgingly.  Griff was reliving memories of a past Christmas that had taken place at this very house.  He had been running away to try to escape those memories.  Now here he was babysitting another young woman who has no clue how to survive outside of town.  And she’s opening up parts of his emotions that he really isn’t ready to deal with  Emily was left with time to compare Griff to her current boyfriend (the one she is sure intended to breakup with her) Phillip.  The comparison didn’t come out very good on Phillip’s side of the coin..  On one of the rare times when she and Griff actually talked civilly to each other, he had made some very good points about her so called curse.  And thinking about them and the effect Griff is having on her heart is bringing some very strong, hard truths to Emily.I really enjoyed The Christmas Curse.  What’s the saying?  Bad things happen to good people.  And eventually those good people get their act together and make changes in their lives that will enrich and satisfy them instead of waiting for the fallout from a feeling of being cursed.  While they were definitely attracted to each other, and maybe a romance had its beginnings during those few days of isolation both Emily and Griff made changes.  The kind that make you ready for the love of your life to walk back into your life and bring that happy ever after with them.*I received an e-ARC of The Christmas Curse from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Chloe had no intention of finding a completely fake, pretend girlfriend for the arrogant alpha shifter, Kieran.  She believed in love and truly mated love and to set that belief aside in order to keep a client just grated on her nerves.  Unfortunately for Chloe, her boss had other ideas.  When absolutely none of the females she’d tried to match him up with worked – she was forced to take on the role of temporary mate herself.  She was not a happy witch.Kieran has no belief in love, mates nor happy ever afters.  He did however believe in the power of his wealth, and had no problem simply buying this pretend mate or maybe rent might be a better term since he intended to return her as soon as possible.  His intention is to pull the wool over the eyes of the shifters at the retreat – maybe if they believed his mate thing was taken care of they’d back off their political moves.  Kieran hadn’t really counted on the attraction for the fiery, stubborn, beautiful witch he chose as his temporary mate… perhaps that status could be changed.The Alpha’s Temporary Mate was an intriguing and seductive story.  At first these two were like oil and water – the witch and the shifter.  But fate doesn’t care about the details and this couple was obviously meant for each other.  Someone just had to get them to accept that simple fact.  Chloe wasn’t intimidated by Kieran and gave as good as she got from him.  If he thought she was going to back down and be a docile pretend girlfriend he was very mistaken.  Kieran is one stubborn alpha, just because they have a scorching hot sexual attraction doesn’t mean that he’s giving in to the mate thing – or so he tells himself.  While this couple is fighting their attraction pack politics is trying to make this whole mate situation fall to pieces.  It’s up to Chloe and Kieran to save each other for the long haul.I enjoyed this story very much and would definitely recommend it for any reader who loves paranormal romance and hot, stubborn shifters who meet their match in a fiery witch.*I received an e-ARC of The Alpha’s Temporary Mate from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"The safe world she’s created has just fallen out from under Alex’s feet.  Millionaire Hayden Brooks is claiming that her adopted daughter, Cassy is in fact his biological daughter.  He wants a paternity test to prove it and when it comes back positive he intends to take Cassy home.. his home across the country.  The second blow of the day, while nowhere near the panic of losing her daughter still kills the idea of buying the bakery she had set her heart on as a way to secure the future for herself and her daughter.Hayden was blindsided by the obviously slutty bid for money from the woman standing at his door.  But… if there was the slightest chance that she wasn’t lying through her teeth he had to know for certain.  When he made the decision to go to Still Harbor a day early and catch the woman who had adopted the little girl that might be his, it was with a combination of goals.  He couldn’t sit around any longer wondering he had to see this child.  And by arriving a day early he’d put this woman off balance.  As a successful businessman he knew that any advantage was a good one.  The last thing he expected was the flash of attraction when he met Alex or for the absolute terror on her face that she quickly tried to cover up.  Until that moment he hadn’t really thought what it would mean to the woman who had raised Cassy if it turned out that he was in fact her father.  His mission had been to get to his daughter, save her from whatever situation she was in and bring her home.  He never actually considered that she was in a loving home with a woman who was her mother in every sense of the word.In the last weeks leading up to Christmas, Cassy will work her magical charm on Hayden as they each seem to find a special bond between them.  Hayden and Alex will spend time together, unwillingly on Alex’s part while they wait out the paternity test results.  As they begin to get to know each other walls come down, slightly and Alex begins to fight a true attraction to this man who could destroy her so easily… in so many ways.Falling For Her Enemy is an emotional and intriguing story.  Alexandra is certainly a multi-layered woman with a history that is as heartbreaking as it is inspiring.  Hayden isn’t truly the bad guy, he’s a man who simply wants his daughter in his life.  If he went about that the wrong way at first, at least he learns quickly.  I enjoyed Alex and Hayden’s romance as they and Alex’s extended unique family gather around to be certain that one little girl gets the best possible results from this situation.  I enjoyed meeting up with the couple from the first story in this series… and a hint about the next to come.If you enjoy a romance with an almost instant attraction but a slow build up to acknowledging that, if the magic of Christmas working its unique spell on a purely business minded man and if a strong, determined, wounded woman who will fight for her daughter intrigues you – then you should pick up Falling For Her Enemy right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LDINYQ46DNB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PC4BR6#wasThisHelpful","R3LDINYQ46DNB6","A16TE56LP5NUL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16TE56LP5NUL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say this up front – it is going to be a miracle if I can complete this review without giving away any spoilers – which I try not to do, ever.  But it’s going to be difficult because this is such an emotional story with valid reasons as to why Daniel and Shannon act in the way that they do.Shannon has secrets.  Huge secrets, the kind that have her leaving town in the middle of the night – the kind that has two suitcases, one summer the other winter, for when she has to run – now.  It’s not the kind of life that leads to settling down in one town forever,  nor the kind that would allow a special man into her life to share in its dangers.But here in Eternity Springs she’s building a new life.  One that includes friends, and plans for more than a week at a time.  She wants so desperately to simply settle down and live.  But she will always be looking over her shoulder.At one time Daniel hat it all – the perfect job for him, the loving wife and rambunctious son at home, even the silly puppy who chased squirrels.  All it took was for one evil man to change everything.  A moment for that life to be stolen from him forever.  Now he’s left the police force and gone private.  Now he searches for missing children in the hopes of giving their grieving parents something he will never find… peace at last.On this trip to a friend’s wedding in Eternity Springs, Daniel’s life is about to change.  Oh, it’s not going to be easy.  It’s going to be painful.  But at the end of the road lies a happiness that he thought to never experience again.  He just has to slay a few dragons and win the damsel – he can do that, if he can fight off his own demons along the way.Heartsong Cottage is such an emotional gripping story.  A small town where people know their neighbors, a place where miracles are said to happen, maybe even a place to heal.  The attraction between Daniel and Shannon is immediate and strong.  Yet they both have major baggage from their pasts and it’s going to be an uphill battle for them to get to that happy ever after that they so richly deserve.If you are looking for a story that will give you a solid storyline, believable characters as familiar as your neighbor down the street, the satisfaction of seeing two wounded  people find peace and love after a long, long journey – then Heartsong Cottage is a novel that you are going to want to pick up.This was my first trip to Eternity Springs.  Now that I’ve had a taste of this charming town and it’s intriguing and entertain citizens I’m heading out to start from the very beginning.

"The Sheikh’s Purrfect Lover hits every single check mark for what I consider an amazing story and a captivating start to a new shifter series.  So let’s look at those reasons.We have tiger shifters in a part of the world where one would never, ever expect to find tigers.  That leads to the far away country of Saudi Arabia which in itself is full of mystery and intrigue.Then we have a feud within a shifter clan that caused one portion of that clan to break off to form their own.  The reason for that split is shrouded in mystery and legend.. but the truth may be stranger than any fiction imaginable.We’ve got super hot Alpha men on the good side of this shifter war.  Men with honor and pride.  Men who will do anything possible to protect their clam and the women they love.An absolute evil, crazed villain that even his mother would have been hard pressed to like.And an incredible woman who has faced demons in her past, and now is in extreme danger herself.So, come on – what is not to be fascinated with that concept?Mel and Karim make such a believable couple.  His protection mode began at the first scent he caught of her.  And it will continue for the rest of their lives together.  There really isn’t a mystery of who is harming the Khazi brothers or their clan – but the reasons behind the attacks sets up an amazing premise for the series to continue.I simply liked the way all the parts of this story came together in a believable and exciting fashion.  I had no trouble falling into this story and quickly turning pages to find out what happens next.  And while the ending closed off this part of the series, it also left the way open as to how it would continue in the next story without giving much of anything away except a small tantalizing scene… that gave me goosebumps.I enjoyed The Sheikh’s Purrfect Lover very much and I’m looking forward to the next story – soon, I hope.*I received an e-ARC of The Sheikh’s Purrfect Lover from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Kissing The Werewolf was such a hilarious, snarky joyride for me.  Izzy is a natural born witch who gets herself killed in, let’s be honest here, the stupidest fashion.  Given a chance to return to life… a life slightly altered is the premise of the Izzy Cooper stories.Izzy is a badass, she’s also full of sarcasm and snark and I absolutely adored her.  Izzy gets herself assigned to an FBI secret agency (can we hum the X-Files theme here?) of paranormal investigators with power.  And just about everyone in the small island town of Storm Cove has some supernatural ability or connection.When grizzly murders begin to happen, and many of the witches on the island begin to lose their powers Izzy and her unit step in to investigate.  What they find is actually even more questions than answers.And we are off on an amazing journey with Izzy in the lead in this truly fun and captivating start to the Izzy Cooper stories.

"Allie is having a weekend away with the man she is going to marry – dictated by her father, a marriage that will join two wealthy, prominent families.  The fact that she doesn’t love James is beside the point to both him and her father.  On this snowy winter night Allie is heading to a remote cabin on the ranch – supposedly for a weekend away with girlfriends, but in reality she wants a chance to be with James alone to hopefully figure out what to do about this arranged marriage that is supposed to be happening soon.  Because of the weather and a possible storm heading in she isn’t able to go by herself on one of the ranch snowmobiles.  Instead she is being driven there by Finn.  A bear shifter ranch hand, and a man who she has secretly checked out on many occasions.Finn keeps his head down and just does his job.  He knows how the humans at the ranch feel about him… well, maybe not everyone but his boss for one can’t stand the sight of him.  He’s watched Allie – and watched her watching him as well.  There’s attraction there, but he won’t act on it.  That would mean being fired faster than he could blink.  But tonight he has the chance to drive her to a remote cabin and for a while at least feel her arms around him and do a bit of dreaming… even if her tight grip is only to keep her from falling off of the snowmobile.When the weather worsens and Finn can’t make it back to the ranch safely he and Allie will be stranded at the cabin.  Alone, where just about anything is possible.I’ve been on a shifter binge lately it seems.  So I’ve read a lot of shifter stories over the past few months and every author has a slightly different slant on the shifter legend.  Roped By The Bear seemed to have very little to do with a shifter – and more involved with a rich girl who comes to realize that Finn is the man for her.  Allie has been ignored by her father most of her life.  She may have wealth but she has very little love at home.  She knows that the marriage to James is one of business convenience.  And while she and Finn could work – those people around them won’t let it happen.  And soon Allie and Finn have to deal with that situation… and to say more would be giving away major spoilers.I liked Roped By The Bear and would pick up other works of the author – but I wasn’t blown away by it.  Maybe I’ve just gotten so deep into the lifestyle of shifters that I expect to have that paranormal aspect be more of the focus of the story.  Perhaps I’ve become used to the insta-lust or the knowledge of knowing a person is a mate.  But I didn’t get the sense that Allie and Finn would fight hell and high water for the right to be together.  Like I said, I liked it but it was missing a shifter something that it seems I need to believe in the everlasting fated love.  I simply never felt that these two people were mates… sexual partners, yes – but not fated mates.  And that reaction is on me, not the author.*I received an e-ARC of Roped By The Bear from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

She is a very strong woman who has had to face a reality that was not her life plan.  She is intelligent, snarky at times and really needs for her family to let her go and live her life.  No one can change what happened.  But everyone can and should allow her to know her own independence.  Isaac is that man who once he loves its for life.. no matter what life tosses at him.

"It’s amazing what kind of adventures a pair of magic slippers can get you into.  Bella has raised her twin siblings practically from birth.  With her father’s recent death come a lot of additional responsibilities and challenges.  Most importantly how to keep them out of the poor house.  Her love of history is a marketable ability, so with a little help she makes her way to a job that fits perfectly with the plan to find hidden treasure.  Treasure that is partially her’s.  Only trouble is, she has to find it before she can lay claim to it.Bella and the Beast is an enjoyable romance that is slightly an adventure story and slightly a retelling of the beauty and the beast legend.  I enjoyed the story but I also had some major issues with the hero.  I simply could not like this arrogant, insufferable piece of the nobility.  Did he soften a bit from when I first met him?  Yes, in many ways he did.  Yet… for me I could not like him and that colored the entire story.

"Marietta, Montana – Josiah never thought he’d be back in his home town.  Yet here he was condemned to at least a month of rest and relaxation, doctor’s orders.  This overworked CEO has been overruled by his board -it’s either take a vacation and heal up or you’re fired.  It seems even billionaires can’t always get their way.  To be fair to Josiah’s friends both at work and at the Bar V5 Ranch he had come down with a serious blood infection from a cut he refused to get treated.  Now weak as a kitten he needs to heal, rest and let himself relax enough to recuperate.  He is far from a happy camper.Oh and one other little detail – Josiah hates Christmas.Ellie’s love of Christmas is second only to her passion for helping kids, specifically the siblings of kids with serious, terminal illnesses.  The kids who often have to put on a brave face as their family goes through some of the most difficult times imaginable.  She knows firsthand how that feels.  Her job at the Bar V5 Ranch involves many things, but perhaps she is best at spreading Christmas cheer to the guests and employees.  She knows Josiah or knew him back when he was a teenager and friend to her brother.  So she’s taken it on as a personal commitment to ensure that Josiah takes care of himself and heals.  She never expected him to actually get her, to see her for the person she is behind the smiling face.  It was perhaps that knowledge that was the first step in falling in love with the man who didn’t plan to stay longer than a month.A Christmas Homecoming is a charming story of a man who exists only for his work and a woman who needs to finally be seen as someone beyond her brother’s sister.  This Christmas Ellie will help Josiah to see that there is more to life than work and letting in some Christmas spirit isn’t a bad thing.  And Josiah will fall for a woman who has spent her life in the shadow of her dead brother.  Letting her understand that he sees her, not Buck’s sister.  That is perhaps the greatest gift anyone has ever given her.Their romance won’t be smooth sailing, they both will have issues to deal with.  But it is a sweet romance highlighting the power of love when it’s given and accepted by the right couple.I enjoyed A Christmas Homecoming very much and would not hesitate to recommend this story for any romance reader who loves a good story, a sweet romance and likeable characters… and perhaps a bit of Christmas magic.*I received an e-ARC of A Christmas Homecoming from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Hot Toy is a really short story so do not look for a lot of character development in these few pages.  But… do expect to laugh yourself silly, snort embarrassingly and maybe even belly laugh a bit.Trudy had no idea that trying to find one of the most popular toys for this Christmas season for her nephew would be so difficult – or so cutthroat either.

And as Sera slowly finds herself falling deeper into love with him there seems to be no happy ending for them.  Murdoch is one stubborn man whose met his match in an equally stubborn woman.The past can hold onto us in the most illogical ways.  This is what has happened to Murdoch.

"Blair never, ever expected to find the jerk, her husband in her home… naked in her home.  After all these years he’s finally shown up again.  Too bad she never got around to divorcing the idiot man.Nathan and Blair had such a messed up relationship.  She’d loved him forever it seemed.  And he’d just taken off with a post-it note for a goodbye.  So yeah – quite a marriage they had.  She was so sure that she’d gotten over him, that his leaving had been the final closed door.  Yet, here he was, as hot and sexy as ever and she… she was tempted again.Return of the Jerk is written in different points of view.  When we finally get Nathan’s point of view of the events in his and Blair’s lives the feeling toward Nathan shifts, changes more than just a bit.  And then we learn what he’s been doing these years away – yeah, a whole different twist to the same story.  I know I’m being vague here, but in order to avoid spoilers I have to be.Let me say this then.  Return of the Jerk is an intense, twisting, winding story of two people who should work fine together – if they can ever get themselves together enough to air out the past, come clean and simply tell the truth to each other, the whole truth and let the hearts fall where they will from that point on.Told through laughter, humor, tears of sadness and frustration and a deep burning desire and love for each other that time has never changed.  I would recommend this story to any reader who enjoys a story that goes below the surface to the deep, dark places that people will fall into.  It’s a story of redemption, of love reclaimed.

"I have been a longtime reader of Jane Ashford’s Regency romances.  And I was delighted to see The Bargain reissued as a prequel to The Duke’s Sons which premiers in January of 2016, which gives me more of her stories to look forward to.Admittedly, there are times when our hero, Lord Alan Gresham is very difficult to warm up to let alone root for in this romance.  He is a scientist and a man of his times – which means his opinion of women’s brain power is rather belittling at times.  And truth be told, since he is completely society wise inept, it is quite possible that he simply doesn’t know any better as his brain is lost in science and not out here in the real world which includes other members of the same species… aka men and women.The true heroine of this story is Ariel Harding.  She has no idea who is “haunting” Carlton House, but she is convinced it’s not her mother.  Yet, Ariel is determined to find out what exactly was the reason or cause behind her mother’s apparent suicide.  Who better to help her in that endeavor than the handsome, maddening man of logic?Ariel saved this story for me, as I never could quite like Alan overly much.  He had his moments, granted.  But even with the love of a very good, intelligent, woman he still comes off as… not the hero I wanted him to be.  And that is on me, not the author.  Alan was written as he needed to be for the story – it was up to me to like him or not and I chose … not so much.  But that does not mean that I didn’t enjoy this story.  The mystery, intrigue and Ariel provided what I personally need for a really good story that kept my attention until the end.And… we’re looking at the beginning of a new series which I am looking forward to.  In all, The Bargain was a good story, one I enjoyed reading.  And that’s the bottom line anyways, the enjoyment factor.  If you haven’t had the chance to read this story when it first came out, now is a good time to get in on the prequel to a new Regency Romance series.*I received an e-ARC of The Bargain from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Sometimes a story comes along that simply touches on every single thing that makes a person a reader, a romance addict even.  For me, A Royal Christmas Gift had that ability.We have a prince in Prince Royal Nicholas Worthington aka Nick Worth, who puts aside his royalty to become just another guy because putting his country and his people’s safety ahead of his own self-interests is more important for him than his crown.We have a princess in need of rescuing in Anna Lee, a Southern belle who is facing a difficult Christmas season with the recent death of her beloved Gramps – as well as an even more devastating heartache looming should our prince not have stepped in.  Add an adoring sister, and a well intended at times meddling, pure Southern Belle mamma and that charming family is complete.When Nick comes to Anna Lee’s home it is a reconnaissance type of move in a way.  Yes, it sets up the grant and it gives Nick some time to decide if this is where he will hide in plain sight once the final action of turning his country into a U S Territory takes place.  Yet it is also the beginning of a love between two people who on the surface couldn’t be more different – but in the heart, simply fit like two pieces of a broken heart necklace.  They make each other whole.I absolutely loved this beginning story in the Happily Ever After series by LuAnn McLane.  In spite of their differences, the characters sparkle on the page from the first meeting.  It becomes so easy to invest ourselves in the happiness of this couple, even when we know more than Anna Lee does about what is to come.  Anna Lee is fiesty, spunky, adorable and likeable.  Nick is charming, handsome, sexy as sin and for a prince quite a down to earth kind of guy.  The love that blooms between them will face some tough challenges in the near future, but with the foundation they have been given I have every expectation that their own happily ever after will arrive just in the nick of time.Normally I am not a huge fan of the fade away into the next book.  Yet, I have to declare that it works very well for this particular series.  This will be a continuing, ongoing, developing storyline over several books.  And because of that plan, and mainly because of how this story and the characters have been introduced to me, I want, no, make that need to continue to know what happens and how the characters handle what I as a reader know is coming.  It was very well done – I actually care about what happens to Anna Lee and Nick next – and I need to know how Amber’s love life will play out in this epic adventure.  So you see, this is a series that I will lovingly follow to get to the happily ever after that I know is in store for everyone (including me) involved.I would highly recommend A Royal Christmas Gift for any romance reader.  And while it’s not a true cliffhanger ending because we know there is more to come – I’m almost begging romance lovers to read this first story and let it captivate, spark your interest and touch your heart with well thought out characters and a heartwarming storyline.  Lose your heart to a prince and a Southern belle this Christmas, I believe you’ll find the rewarded lovingly touching story will be worth any risk.*I received an e-ARC of A Royal Christmas Gift from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Selena was back in Jumbuck Springs.  Back in the hometown she ran away from fifteen years ago to chase a dream.  She and Jarrod had been so in love and so young.  She had a dream and in order to grab that dream she had left his in the dark of night without a word.  Now years later, she’s back in town and it’s long past time to make up for the past between them.  Jarrod never thought to lay eyes on Selena again.  He’d believed that he had moved on, but knew deep down that he’d forever be haunted by the love that had left him behind for a dream she could not share.  They may have come together for a short time, but reality still steps in as Selena returns to her job once more.Some Girls Don’t is an intense story of love never truly lost but set aside for a time.  While the love between Selena and Jarrod works its way through time, trials and mistakes – it is not the only story within Some Girls Don’t.  The bushfires that plague the Outback also will touch your emotions throughout this story as they are in a way a unique character as well.  The bravery of the men and women who fight the fires and the families who are affected by the devastation of the fires is a riveting part of this story – and central to the plot.I enjoyed this story and would recommend it highly for any romance reader.  The love story is satisfying and so very realistic.  The story of an act of nature puts such a human touch onto this story as lives are changed in an instant as a fire moves direction.

The one thing they had in common was getting to his brother’s and her best friend’s wedding.

"Wolf from the Past is an intense, compelling and I would even say captivating story of the love between mates – even when they are denied each other by outside forces.  Even when one has to “die” in order to escape the constant, unimaginable abuse, only to come alive once again when it’s safe to no longer be in hiding for her life.Sylvie knew that returning to her brother’s new pack would not be easy.  Especially since he had thought her dead.  The only way she could survive the abuse of her forced mating was to find the way to die convincingly and to stay hidden until the danger had passed – her former mate’s death.  She also knew that running here was bringing danger onto this pack.  But she couldn’t live hidden any longer.  She deserved the freedom of any member of the pack, she knew that she’d have to earn it as well.Gator had loved Sylvie, his mate.  And had seen her mated off to another.  The abuse that she had gone through was obvious, even now long after she had hidden herself through her faked death.  She may want him as her natural mate, but that didn’t stop her from still being afraid.  Even though he could understand the lingering fear, Gator hoped that in time Sylvie would realize that he only wanted to protect her and care for her as his mate.  He would fight for her, even fight her in order to gain the love of his life.  Nothing would stop him this time.  Nothing.Even though Wolf from the Past is part of an ongoing series, Salvation Pack, you do not have to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one.  Of course it helps, but you will get enough of the history within the story to fill in the spots that are important for this story.  It will, however, probably tempt you to go back and read the series from the start.Sylvie is truly a wounded soul.  Proud, strong and wounded.  She will need Gator’s patience, affection, and presence in her life in order to heal once again.  Gator isn’t known for his patience.  But he will do what he feels necessary to protect Sylvie.  She is his mate and nothing will keep him from her ever again.I enjoyed this story very much.  The main characters were intense, believable and drew me into their situation easily.  The secondary characters always make a huge difference for me in an ongoing story and I found everyone in Wolf from the Past to strengthen the story along the way.  At times it is not an easy story to read because of the abuse.  Yet, it is an empowering story that even in the paranormal world, we do what we must to survive and go on to live a better life.  If you enjoy shifters, if you love a solid story with action, romance and an engaging couple then you would enjoy Wolf from the Past.*I received an e-ARC of Wolf from the Past from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Christmas was a difficult time for Lainey.  There had been a time when she loved every single moment of this blessed and magical season.  She’d gone so far as to plan a Christmas wedding to combine her personal memories with the season.  The wedding never happened, cancelled just days before Christmas.  Now this season is a reminder of what never was, of how love could turn on you at a moment and leave you alone and yes, bitter.  But since Lainey’s business meant that she was surrounded by the joy and excitement of this holiday she’d learned to pretend a happiness that she never felt.  If this season wasn’t one of the most profitable ones she would have been happy to hibernate through the winter months.Todd firmly believes in his job to protect and serve – and if that means that his day off is spent helping out travelers caught in the snowstorm, so be it.  It’s Christmas after all and no one wants to be stuck out in the weather and far from their destination.  Yet that is exactly what will happen to Todd this wintery storm night.  Unable to make it back home safely, Todd is ironically turned away from the fully booked Evergreen Inn.  Thanks to the kindness of Lainey, he’s at least got a spot on the couch of her tiny cabin for the night… and maybe a future that’s magical as well.Christmas at Evergreen Inn is a sweet, charming holiday romance between two people who know of each other, but come together with no real past – aside from the memories they bring with them.  Sometimes memories, especially bad ones are the most difficult things to fight when one person sees the possibilities of a lasting love and the other only has reminders of what can be lost, again.  Todd and Lainey have that special spark, now he just has to convince her that love is always worth a second try, that the gain is worth the risks with the right person.I enjoyed this Christmas novella very much.  Even though it is part of an ongoing series, I don’t feel you have to have followed Jewell Cove to enjoy this romance… of course, it’s better if you have but not totally necessary.  The romance is charming and believable, the secondary characters always delightful.  This is one that will warm up that special Christmas reading spot for you this year and many years to come.*I received an e-ARC of Christmas at Evergreen Inn from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Emerson and Dax’s romance is rocky from the get go.  While they definitely enjoyed an amazing one night stand the night of Dax’s brother’s wedding – that’s all it was supposed to be a one time thing.  Then it was done because Emi simply doesn’t have time for romance, she barely has time to breathe let alone maintain a relationship.  Between her business, doing as many catering and odd jobs as possible and tending to her father and her much younger sister there is simply no time or energy for a romance that matters.  Besides she’s done that and gotten the heartache to remind her of the experience, not willing to take that risk again any time soon.Dax always believed his life would be military from boot camp to his final forced retirement enlistment.  He was damned good at what he did in the special ops, surviving more than he ever expected to, he was at home with his team.  Much more so than at home with his brothers and a very small, small town mentality.  But life sucks basically, and Dax learned that first hand when a nearby explosion tore up his knee and his military life was over.  He came home, not because family was here in St. Helena, but because the best doctor in the nation called this small town home.  He had a plan B, but its success depended on getting his knee in peak condition along with some help from Emi, he’d take reluctant help but he would have her in his life again.Need You For Always is a tender love story of two extremely stubborn people.  This novel, just as the first one in this series, is heavy on secondary characters.  This is not a series about a few random people falling in love, but it’s also about the small town community of St. Helena.  Any story will be enhanced by really good secondary characters, in my opinion.  They bring the believability level up a few notches.I enjoyed Dax and Emi’s romance.  It was involved, at times slow moving as they each had so much going on in their lives.  Yet the rightness of them fitting together, in spite of their stubbornness made them a very realistic couple.  Not everything is fairy wings and rainbows, and this couple has so much on their plates that fitting in that romance isn’t the easiest thing, but when the other person is worth it you make it happen.I would recommend Need You For Always for any romance reader, especially those that enjoy the details and characters that a small town brings.*I received an e-ARC of Need You For Always from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Shay and Jonah’s romance depends so much on her animals, and his bid for the election as the next Sheriff.  With a bashing campaign against Shay’s pet limited home and her new pet shop on the rise, and the folks against her getting down and dirty she’s in some real trouble.Ever since Shay’s move to St. Helena two things have been on her radar – the pets that she fosters in order for them to finally get their forever homes, and the handsome deputy who most often is the one who gets to call on her when something goes wrong.  And things always go wrong for Shay.  While having Jonah as a neighbor is a bonus, always finding herself on the shaky side of the legal fence isn’t as fun.  But if rescuing adorable kittens and three legged dogs is illegal, well sign Shay up… even if it means that she has gone over the max pets allowed per house for St. Helena.Need You For Keeps is an adorable love story, one not only between the main characters but also the lovable adoptable pets this story highlights.  While the romance moves slowly, once Jonah and Shay decide that they are worth the risk, the pages heat up.  There are misunderstandings, stubbornness and some extremely nasty townsfolk involved, but then it’s a small town and everyone knows about everything.  Shay is a charming lady, she’s had a rough life and doesn’t trust very well so for her to open up to Jonah is huge.  Jonah has been carrying the world around on his shoulders, or so it seems.  When he finally sees what he has done with his life, it’s time for a big change for him.The story is charming and interesting, the characters believable.  I would definitely recommend Need You For Keeps for any romance reader.  It’s just the start for the Heroes of St. Helena series, be sure to follow it as the townsfolk are simply charming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJ414AV9WX9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU73A6A#wasThisHelpful","R2UJ414AV9WX9X","A16TE56LP5NUL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16TE56LP5NUL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jordan has had a crush on her best friend Ellie’s older brother since she first met him as a young teen. Of course, she never expected Aric to look twice in her direction but that didn’t stop the fantasies or the wishes. Aric knew the moment he laid eyes on the 13 year old, frightened yet courageous friend of his sister that he had met his mate. He also knew, instinctively that he couldn’t press the issue, that there would be time for them. And he knew where she was now, he could watch over her and protect her from afar… for now.Years passed and now Jordan is finally getting a chance to witness the pack mate sniffing ritual. Yes, she knew that her friend’s family were wolf shifters. So? That didn’t stop her curiosity about their mating rituals… or stop her longing for one particular wolf shifter who still hadn’t looked at her the way she wanted. She could soak through her panties just thinking about Aric, too bad he doesn’t seem to have that same problem about her… or so she thought. Aric has every intention of putting his mark on Jordan at the ritual this night. Oh, she may not understand all of it yet but she’d learn but for tonight he had to mark his woman in some way, it was past time and his wolf wouldn’t take wait for an answer any longer.Scent of a Mate is the type of erotica that I love the most of all. A really intense, engaging story along with some of the hottest, most sensual, delicious sex ever. For me there is nothing sexier than two people who love each other having the most intense, insane sex either has ever experienced. If it was all about the sex then I might as well read porm.. when there is an amazing story, people that emotionally care about each other plus explicit, mind blowing sex – them I am one happy camper.The story within Scent of a Mate is full of shifter packs, betrayal, fighting for control of a pack by its true alpha, rogue shifters, an amazing family of wolf shifters and the love of two very special, strong people. The action is just as intense outside of the sexual aspect as it is between the main characters at their hottest. The world building is phenomenal, the characters believable and realistic, the sex scenes are off the chart and the love is deep and true. What the heck more could you possibly need from any great story, no matter what genre it is?Set aside for a moment the erotica… if you love paranormal shifter romance then you’ll adore this novel which is the start of the Sassy Mates series. If you’re in it for the sex, then you will not be left wanting for one second as the pages are scorching hot. If a love story is your thing then the powerful love between Jordan and Aric is amazing to experience. An all around enjoyable story no matter what your reading preference is, you’ll find it has been met in Scent of a Mate. Start this series today – you won’t be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EW4I12EBNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAA11ZS#wasThisHelpful","R30EW4I12EBNL","A16TE56LP5NUL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16TE56LP5NUL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Riley has had a rotten few weeks. She’s been fired from a job she loved, not because she wasn’t good but because the new owner didn’t see the value in spending the money on her. Her boyfriend broke up with her shortly after that one devastating blow. So she’s taken off into the wilderness, into the mountain forests to simply think about what comes next and to accept what’s happened to her structured live.What she never expected was to be in the direct path of a forest fire or to be running from the flames realizing that this trip may be her last.Hunter and his crew, his clan had done all they could at this fire sight. The fire was too close and they were being taken out by helicopter. When he smelled it. Or rather smelled her, in danger, his lifemate. He did the only thing he could do – drop from the rope leading up to safety and run into the flames to rescue his mate..Hunter and Riley’s romance is sweet, tender and a bit frantic. Discovering that your life mate is human is never easy for a shifter. There is always a chance of rejection because of fear and misunderstanding. But while Hunter may be the youngest of his clan, and most likely to be voted a sweetheart who’d never hurt a bee — there is still a lot at stake for he and Riley.I enjoyed A Spark To Bear very much.

"In a perfect world ex-husbands aka douchebags would fall off of the face of the planet once the ink on the divorce papers dries.  Unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world.  Just ask Tally whose ex-husband is about as bad as an ex can get… no, really.  This guy has practically hijacked her family as his own, shows up at family events that no self-respecting ex-husband would ever think of.  And now this oozing ball of sleaze is going to be at a family wedding – her family, not his.  And Tally needs a date, which probably isn’t going to happen since her dating success rating would be a flat zero right now.  She could cancel but dammit it’s her family and he’s not going to keep her away from this event.  So she does what any resourceful woman would do…… Join a dating agency.  But not just any ole dating agency.  This one is a paranormal dating agency run by the sweet grandmotherly lady down the hall.  And the guys that visit her are off the charts hot.  So, if these are Gerri Wilder’s relatives, then Tally can certainly use her neighbor’s help in getting her a date.Connor and Theron are the Alpha and the Omega of their shifter pack.  What they’ve been searching for is their mate to complete the Alpha Triad that will govern their pack, and bring all three into a mated bond.  So far they’ve had no luck searching on their own so they’ve turned to Aunt Gerri for guidance…and perhaps a female she’d recommend for them.  Actually they wouldn’t mind the curvy beauty who rode up in the elevator with them and obviously lives near by.  She would be perfect.Twice The Growl brings Tally, Connor and Theron together as not only a secual threesome, but as leaders of the Wildwoods Pack.  Tally has never even thought about a threesome, two hot gorgeous men tending to her every sexual need or fantasy.  But she is so attracted to each Connor and Theron that she’s willing to give this a try – a reluctant try at first.  Soon she is a willing if not demanding partner in every imaginable sexy action she’s ever dreamed of… and then some.If these three make it as a triad and finally become true mates, then Tally will be part of the ruling group of the pack.  She’ll have to face other challenges, and perhaps surprise even herself along the way.  But for the love of these two men, Tally will risk more than she’s ever risked before… her heart.Looking to add some shifters into your erotic reading?  One good place to start might be at The Paranormal Dating Agency – they have lots of shifters available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFOMK0UHSZGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU9YUTG#wasThisHelpful","R1QFOMK0UHSZGO","A16TE56LP5NUL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16TE56LP5NUL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anya has been haunted by an event in her childhood.  Something neither she nor her tigress could have prevented – but that does not ease the guilt or the inability to face her childhood friend once more.  Anya has always been good at keeping people at bay… until now.Bryson recognized the woman who’d been sent to safeguard his daughter, Pepper.  Oh, he didn’t actually know her, but his leopard did and he was mere steps behind his big cat in agreeing that this shifter was perfectly made as his.  But right now he had to convince Anya to stay and protect Pepper – especially once she understood exactly what made Pepper so very special to warrant her own bodyguard at age 5, aside from her father’s wealth.Forgotten is a sexy, intense shifter romance full of danger, hidden secrets and surprising reunions.  We will also run into past friends from previous books.  Anya is a stubborn, brave woman who has allowed her inability when a child to govern how she views herself.  When she has a chance to reconcile those decisions she’ll truly be ready to open up herself, her heart to the love of Bryson and his adorable daughter, Pepper.Another piece of the puzzle that always runs through Ms Thorne’s series – I love when they cross over allowing even more interesting interactions between her characters.

She was an overindulged spoiled, entitled, rich, troublemaking brat.  Right up until the moment she laid eyes on Lezare.  The man who quickened her breath, her pulse and her tigress.  The man who dared to turn her over his knee – and she didn’t doubt that he would for one moment.Natalya had changed.  Oh, she didn’t expect anyone to believe that.  Not from the way she had acted in the past.  Yet, she had gone to school, worked to quiet and control her temper and worked at a homeless shelter where she learned another lesson in humility.  If there was one thing she longed for it was Lezare.  The shifter who could tame her in an instant if he only tried.  The mate that she believed she’d never have.  Well, perhaps she’d not be welcomed at his home considering her past, but she was determined to attend the annual masquerade ball put on by the Arceneaux family year after year.  She wouldn’t actually approach him – just to be near him would be enough… or so she tried to tell herself.Lezare knew that Natalya was his mate.  He didn’t expect to be able to claim her.

In dance and wildfire fighting timing is everything – but right now, his timing sucks.Amanda isn’t having the best of luck either.  Without a job, thanks to dumping her ex-boss’s son rather spectacularly she might add, hadn’t exactly endeared herself to her parents or many other people back in Manhattan.  Now, here she was in Marietta, Montana looking after the grandmother she hadn’t seen in years.  She’s a big city girl with a even bigger big city attitude, on the surface at least.  She really has no clue how to live in a small town where people know your family from years back and most know all your business as well.  She has some adjusting to do.I loved Montana Rogue.  Tucker is a sweetheart who has lost too much in his life.  Now he has a chance to lay down roots of his own with a woman who fascinates and frustrates him within the same five minutes.  Amanda doesn’t know how to just be herself.  She’s stumbled a lot in her life and now it seems she’s found exactly where her place could be – if only Tucker was a permanent attachment, instead of the temporary fling they had agreed upon.Each has unresolved issues in their lives, ones that won’t be decided overnight.  Time, love and understanding of the reasons that things happened in the past as they did is going to be a part of their lives.  Amanda’s grandmother, the sweet soul Molly, will have issues long after this story ends.  And Tucker will have his on ongoing family connections to sort out over time.  So, I want to say that this is a lovely romance, but it really is so much more.  Since I’ve known the author, Ms Salonen, to tackle ongoing issues that will continue as a thread through several stories.

There is no sweeter romance than one that could happen to your best friend or even you.(Just my own notation – many people, myself included consider the very short, remembering type of story Her Forever Gift to be #5 in this series, which would for me make this one Montana Rogue #7 – it’s all a matter of personal opinion, folks.

"What is man?  For that matter, what is man supposed to be as, defined in Scripture?  Furthermore, how are we supposed to understand and apply the various terms used throughout God’s Word regarding man such as soul, spirit, heart, and body?  Given the original languages of Scripture use such terms in a manner quite unlike we might understand in our modern parlance, it is vital to dig deep into a biblical understand and use of this terminology to best grasp who man is and what God expects from His creation.  C. Ryder Smith, in his excellent book <em>The Bible Doctrine of Man</em> expends a great deal of effort outlining the Old Testament, Apocryphal, and New Testament terms, how they were used, how they were understood, and how they interweave with one another to provide the reader with a great amount of clarity on this important issue.I began reading this book based on a recommendation and I must say I am very grateful I took the time to explore what Smith has to share.  There is a bit of confusion even among seasoned theologians when it comes to how the Bible describes man.  This misunderstanding of terms is largely due to the negative influence of Greek and Gnostic thinking, in particular when it comes to a biblical/Hebraic grasp of soul, body, and spirit.  Smith aptly notes, “so far as the Hebrew had his own dichotomy in his account of man, it was not the same as the Greek (or rather Aristotelian) and modern dichotomy.”  He also correctly states, “It is hard to banish Greek dichotomy from the mind, for it is a postulate of modern thought”; however, it is of the utmost necessity in order to understand the biblical doctrine of man.Smith divides his analysis into three main sections with section one exploring the Old  Testament, while section two takes a look at the writings of the Apocryphal books, and finally section three engages the New Testament.  All throughout the book, Smith spends a tremendous amount of time looking at words, their meanings, the context and similar contexts in which they are used and why those words are important when considering the topic at hand.  Furthermore, he subdivides each section into an analysis of what man is and what man out to be with the former noting the current state of humanity and the latter looking at what God desires man to be moving towards.This entire book is some very heavy reading meaning the reader will be exposed to a lot of terms in the original languages although Smith does an excellent job of defining those terms and providing all the relevant Scriptural and Apocryphal references.  Speaking of the Apocrypha, one might wonder why Smith bothers to take a look at what many consider non-canonical texts.  His purpose in examining the Apocryphal books is to simply trace the flow of the use of certain terms from their original Hebrew into the period when the Septuagint (LXX) came into use.  Being able to reveal how the Hebrew and Greek words have both similarities and differences and the manner and amount in which the terms in question were used in the Hebrew and in the Greek is an important piece of the overall conversation.  Furthermore, it will help the reader have a foundation when studying how the Greek in the New Testament relates back to the Hebrew.Given the aforementioned influence of Greek thought in particular on the notion of the word soul and furthermore how we tend to approach man and his component parts that define the whole of who we are as man, this is an important book for believers to take the time to read.  While certainly scholarly in its content, those who effort to walk through the information Smith provides will assuredly find the modern paradigm of thought on this issue rightfully challenged.  Smith leaves no stone unturned when it comes to looking at terminology and how it should be applied both from a linguistic and biblical perspective.  I am quite confident those who read this book will find it a valuable resource and most importantly, they will be presented with a biblically rooted framework for understanding who man is and why it matters in regards to the formation of sound theology on the nature of man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLYX5P9LBFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606087177#wasThisHelpful","R1DLYX5P9LBFQ","A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most who profess the name of Christ, whether they be Catholic, Protestant and all the variations that exist under both umbrellas, participate and practice at least some version of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.  With that said, there are a variety of competing beliefs and methodologies for both sacraments with a long history of denominational and church teaching to support those systems.  Which approach is correct and what does the Bible have to say about baptism and the Lord’s Supper as after all, over and above any church tradition stands the foundation of Scripture.  John Hammett, in his helpful book <em>40 Questions about Baptism and the Lord’s Supper</em> attempts to tackle some of the major talking points and perspectives about both of these issues.The book is divided into four sections with the first outlining some of the more general questions about baptism and the Lord’s Supper.  The second part digs deep into baptism, the third part engages the Lord’s Supper, and the final part of the book tackles two concluding questions about the overall importance of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.As Hammett notes in the introduction, “No practices are more characteristic of Christianity than baptism and the Lord’s Supper.”  Regardless of the specific method by which a certain church does either activity, most when questioned would likely associate baptism and the Lord’s Supper as important practices, even though many might not fully grasp the biblical why and how of either.Since both are noted as things which the body of Christ are commanded to be about doing, it is thus important to properly understand the why and furthermore the how.  Hammett rightly notes that Jesus commanded us to go forth and preach the gospel, baptizing those who come to faith in Christ.  Jesus also noted that the partaking of the bread and juice was to be done in remembrance of him thus implying that the Lord’s Supper as it has become to be known was to be a continued practice after his death, burial, and resurrection.There are a number of highlights in this book that are worthy of note, but I will focus on just a couple of questions answered by Hammett that I feel are of special interest.  The first sub-section if you will that is important to read in this book is Hammett’s discussion of the various denominational stances on baptism and the Lord’s Supper respectively.  He does a good job of outlining the Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Baptist, and any other viewpoints of note.  This was most interesting reading as Hammett engages how each tradition developed their doctrine, any historical changes of note, and how these traditions practice baptism and the Lord’s Supper.  Since Hammett is a Baptist, it is no surprise that he leans quite heavily towards the Baptist methodology and for that matter, when it comes to both of these subjects, I too connect somewhere in between the Reformed and Baptist traditions or a combination of the two.  With that said, this was valuable reading and valuable information.Another interesting topic of discussion was the issue of infant baptism, sometimes known as paedobaptism.  Some of the Presbyterian persuasion have written of late on the viability of this practice, associating it with matters of covenant and the notation in the New Testament, at least in their perspective, of the baptism of households including the practice of also baptizing infants.  Hammett covers that particular system while also noting some criticisms of such a practice by engaging the relevant scriptural passages used both in support and opposition to the practice of paedobaptism.  I found the discussion to be honest and the criticisms while forthright were irenic in tone.Also of value are the reflection questions provided at the conclusion of each chapter.  Each of the questions are engaging and will greatly assist the reader in digging even deeper into the subject matter.Over all I found this to be a very insightful book and I recommend it.  As noted earlier, Hammett definitely approaches the subject matter from his Baptist background; however, it by no means interferes with or negates the information provided or the overall thrust and intent of the book as a whole.  It is a resource I am sure many will find useful as they study the important subjects of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.I received this book for free from Kregel Academic for this review.

"What does it mean to be born again?  Most believers understand the term at least minimally as being that moment when you became a child of God.  When Nicodemus was told by Jesus that he could not see the kingdom of God unless he was born again, that statement took Nicodemus for a bit of a loop.  Was he supposed to crawl back into his mother’s womb and be delivered into this world again?  Furthermore, what are all the ramifications for what it means to be born again?  In a collection of previously unreleased sermons on John 3 and the encounter between Jesus and Nicodemus, the famed pastor Martyn Lloyd-Jones unpacks this important story and principle.I have grown to enjoy the writings of Martyn Lloyd-Jones in recent years.  His ability to engage a periscope of Scripture and to then relay to the reader the meaning and most importantly the application of what God has to say is quite remarkable.  Quite honestly, I wish pastors today would take note of his style of preaching and the manner in which he unpacked Scripture to his congregants.In this collection of sermons aptly titled Experiencing the New Birth: Studies in John 3, Lloyd-Jones walks the reader through the story of Jesus discussing with Nicodemus the subject of the new birth.  Jones rightly notes in the very beginning an important point we must grasp when understanding the new birth and for that matter the Christian walk as a whole.  He states, “Our danger always, even as Christian people, is to be reducing this life – eternal life – to something that is merely a point of view, a teaching, a philosophy, a theology, or whatever.  We must never do that.  Its essence is that it is a life, and that means receiving of his fullness.  This is the greatest thing in the world, the greatest thing that any of us can ever realize.”This means that the new birth is far more than a singular event despite that event being a miraculous demonstration of God’s mercy and grace towards sinners through the sacrifice of Jesus.  Properly understanding the new birth involves the reality that being born again places us in the family of God.  As such, there are characteristics that one should demonstrate in their lives that reveal they are in God’s family.  Lloyd-Jones does an excellent job of explaining what those characteristics are such as humility, being truly repentant, a changed life, a love for God’s Word, maturity in the faith, love for the body of Christ, as well as a desire for truth and living righteously before God.In fact, Lloyd-Jones spends the majority of his time in this collection of sermons focusing on those specific elements to include other related and important subjects such as assurance of faith, being alive in Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer, and the need to empty oneself of themselves and to replace fleshly desires with a desire to love and serve God.  I would classify this wonderful collection of sermons as an essential overview of what it means to be a child of God – the basics of the Christian walk and what it looks like in practice to have a relationship with our heavenly Father.I highly recommend this book as something every new believer should read and for all believers to have in their collection as a valuable resource.  The truths shared by Lloyd-Jones are theologically insightful, profound, and accessible regardless of what point in your Christian walk you may find yourself.  Being born again is more than an event.  Conversely, it is merely the beginning of a life lived in service to the One who gave His Son so that we might have life.  Lloyd-Jones beautifully relays that important message in these sermons and I encourage you to spend some time reading this book.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

"The motif of God as our shepherd is perhaps one of the most familiar and beloved pictures of His interaction with us that can be found in all of Scripture.  Psalm 23, an equally beloved and familiar portion of Scripture, outlines God as our shepherd, guiding and protecting us through both times of plenty and times of trial.  But do we really grasp the beauty inherent in the reality of God being our shepherd and us His flock of sheep?  It can be argued that the underlying meaning of that picture is not fully understood, especially in its ANE context nor in relation to how Jesus is noted as our shepherd in the New Testament.  Kenneth Bailey, in his helpful and informative book The Good Shepherd: A Thousand Year Journey From Psalm 23 to the New Testament, walks the reader through Scripture and examines along the way how this shepherd motif is noted in God’s Word, what it means, and how it should be applied to our lives.Kenneth Bailey is quite skilled at bringing to life ancient themes such as what is examined in this particular book.  We often forget that Scripture was written in a particular time of history, often using certain methods of describing things that can be lost in translation for modern man.  Shepherds were common place in ancient Israel but not so much in our towns and neighborhoods today.  Bailey rightly notes “The Bible has hundreds of verses that mention sheep, shepherds, flocks, and sheepfolds.”  Thus there are many passages that uses those words as pictures of our relationship with God.  Bailey focuses on nine particular periscope that utilize certain “dramatic elements” or “clusters of themes” as he puts it, specific sections that really drive home and provide a flow of thought on this Good Shepherd concept.These sections of Scripture are Psalm 23; Jeremiah 23:1-8; Ezekiel 34; Zechariah 10:2-12; Luke 15:1-10; Mark 6:7-52; Matthew 18:10-14; John 10:1-18; and 1 Peter 5:1-4.  As noted earlier, most are familiar with Psalm 23; however, some of the other passages, their context, theology, and application of the concept of the Good Shepherd may not be as familiar.For example, Ezekiel 34 speaks quite clearly about God’s role as the Good Shepherd.  Since far too many skip over the books of the OT prophets, I was pleased to see Bailey interact with these books as it will certainly assist the reader in appreciating what the prophets have to say on a topic of such importance as this.  In regards to Ezekiel 34, Bailey aptly notes how Ezekiel utilized similar statements as did his contemporary prophet Jeremiah.  One distinctive difference is the “introduction of bad sheep.”  Ezekiel also discusses bad shepherds and what God was going to do to those who were leading the people astray. Shepherds had the responsibility of caring for and leading the flock.  As the Good Shepherd, God will deal harshly with those who have been given the responsibility within the Assembly of God’s people to lead and care for the flock.Also of note is Bailey’s discussion of John 10:1-18, a passage where Jesus notes how a good shepherd is vigilant to fight off thieves and wolves from attaching his flock.  This was a common occurrence for the shepherd during this time as thieves regularly would attempt to sneak in and steal sheep and wild animals would often attack the flock.  Bailey does a marvelous job of outlining how a shepherd would position his flock, how he would station the sheepherders, and how it was the sheep recognized the voice of the shepherd.  This was fascinating reading and quite frankly, this type of background commentary and information is a hallmark of Bailey’s books as a whole.  He really brings to life and to our modern day understanding the how and what of such passages of Scripture, providing the reader with the ability to not only understand what it meant to deal with thieves and wolves, but also to better grasp how that ancient reality applies to how we deal with those who desire to steal and destroy within and without the body of Christ in our day.For those who want to research any of the information discussed by Bailey in his book, an excellent bibliography is provided that will assuredly give the reader the ability to dig even further into this subject matter.  With that said, the information provided by Bailey in this book will keep the reader quite busy with study material for many years to come. Each chapter is replete with a wealth of information, both background and outstanding commentary on the various texts that are examined.This is a book I highly recommend.  It is scholarly yet accessible and it interacts with a beloved and important picture that remains as vital for us today as it was for the original readers and hearers of Scripture.  Bailey masterfully weaves historical information into the conversation while providing valuable commentary on just what God as the Good Shepherd is all about.  It is a journey through Scripture worth taking.I received this book for free from IVP Academic for this review. I was not required to write a positive review.

"There is a definite issue afoot when it comes to sound biblical interpretation and for that matter, biblical literacy.  Many sermons are certainly preached in churches across the world and many are being trained in bible colleges and seminaries.  With that said, do people in the pews, the pastors delivering the sermons, the students in school, or the professors and academics training those bound for the ministry accurately understanding and applying Scripture?  Unfortunately in some cases the answer is a resounding no.This means there is the need for sound biblical interpretation and to better practice the discipline known as hermeneutics.  Now this discipline is not just for academics.  However, many of the books on this subject matter are written with the scholar, academic, and bible college/seminarian in mind with the average laymen often left out in the proverbial cold.  Kregel Academic, in an effort to address this disparity, has provided an abridged version of Andreas Kostenberger and Richard Patterson’s excellent larger work Invitation to Biblical Interpretation.  This abridged effort aptly named For the Love of God’s Word makes the discipline of hermeneutics accessible to the laity, providing them a solid foundation upon which to understand and engage in sound biblical interpretation.Kostenberger and Patterson rightly note that “Biblical interpretation is hard work.  The one who wants to master the handling of God’s Word must be like the apprentice of a master craftsperson.  Over time, and through practice, that apprentice will learn to skillfully use many tools.  Likewise, the biblical interpreter must know what interpretive tools to use and how to use them.  This is what it means to “correctly handle” the word of truth.”Throughout this excellent book, the authors provide the reader with those necessary tools of the biblical interpretation trade.  By first setting the groundwork and foundation of the “hermeneutical triad” of history, literature, and theology, the authors enable the reader to have a working understanding of how to approach the biblical text.  God’s Word was written within the confines of actual history.  Thus, when we read Scripture we are reading about real life events involving actual people, actual nations, both with impacts on not just salvation history, but all of history in general.  Understanding the setting of the prophetic books for example, is essential in grasping what those prophets were addressing.  Each book of Scripture is written in a specific genre meaning there are hermeneutical rules for engaging history as opposed to grasping books of poetry.  Finally, after engaging those two parts of the triad, one can dive into the theological meaning and application of the passage.I truly appreciated that the authors provide objectives for the reader to reach and the fact these objectives are provided at the beginning of each chapter.  This approach gives the reader something to think about as they are reading, helping them to hone in on the specific purpose the author is getting across in that chapter.  Furthermore, an outline is provided so the specific topics of that chapter are not a mystery.Overall, I found the discussion and information to be sound, informative, insightful, and written in a manner that all believers will find useful.  There certainly are what I would call “nerdier” discussion points provided in some of the chapters such as an engagement of how to identify a chiastic structure in a passage or noting the various types of prophetic narrative.  Even when those more academic minded aspects of hermeneutics are discussed, the information is presented in a way that will not be over the head of those who have never seen or heard such terms before.  In fact, they make it their focus to present the information in as practicable a manner as possible so that terms are not just nerdy terms, but rather are tools that can be used in everyday Bible study.All believers are commanded to be students of Scripture.  For that reason, I highly recommend For the Love of God’s Word as an essential treasure trove of information for those both new to the disciple of hermeneutics and even those who are familiar with and use all of the tools noted in this book.  Most importantly, the information provided in this book will help you better understand God Word and any book that has that focus and successfully accomplishes that mission will receive a resounding vote of support from me.  This book does just that so I encourage you to get a copy and use the tools contained within its pages.I received this book for free from Kregel Academic for this review.

"If one looks back in history, certain patterns can be discerned, particularly when it comes to the worship of false gods.  Culture after culture and nation after nation, most notably in the Ancient Near East (ANE) and later spreading into the period of the Greco-Roman domination of the world, demonstrated the embracing and worship of a system of gods.  Interestingly, the progression of this worship has some common themes, that of the worship of the same gods just under different names.  Furthermore, it can be stated that certain elements of pagan ideals crept their way into the perspective and theology of the people of God over time.  Richard Rives, in his interesting and informative book Too Long in the Sun, explores these matters and urges believers to take note of those instances when pagan beliefs have been embraced by God’s people.The first portion of this book is a discussion of a number of ANE nations beginning with the ancient Chaldeans and winding its way through the corridors of history to the time of Greece and Rome.  While Rives focuses specifically on the worship of the sun in each of these cultures, he also takes time to note how each of these cultures worshipped essentially the same pantheon of gods with only the names changed to make it seem as if something new was taking place.  What I have always found interesting about such a study is that if one goes back far enough, the origin of these pantheon of gods seems to consistently find its beginning with Nimrod, the great pagan leader of old who led the Tower of Babel effort.I found the information to be interesting and although Rives walks the reader rather quickly through each of these ANE cultures/nations, he does provide footnotes for additional reading which I would recommend taking advantage of if you are interested in digging a bit deeper.  What Rives is focused on is noting the pattern of pagan worship and he achieves his effort quite well.After establishing the issue of ancient sun worship, Rives then proceeds to outline how he believes certain pagan elements of worship have crept into the church.  This portion of the book will likely be the more controversial in the minds of many, in particular when it comes to subjects such as Sabbath, Christmas, and Easter.  While some are willing to admit that some pagan ideals have been embraced over the years, there has been sufficient enough “Christianization” for instance of Christmas and Easter to continue the justification of observing such times of the year.  Those who might question any of these topics are usually quickly labeled as being in the Hebrew Roots Movement or being a Seventh Day Adventist with those labels usually serving as an attempt to delegitimize the arguments being presented.  While some who present such arguments do reside within those movements, the approach of those organizations is based in legalism.  Rives presentation is not rooted in that approach.  His focus is on the discovery of what God says we are to do as His people, where we have perhaps strayed from those commands, and what we should do in response in order to follow what God has stated in His Word.As one who has been digging into the issue of the Sabbath in great detail over recent months, I found Rives’ arguments for the continued observance of God’s Sabbath to be biblically sound.  One specific issue of the argument over the Sabbath I have found to be rather interesting is the attempt to describe two Sabbaths, one being the Jewish Sabbath and the other being the Christian Sabbath.  Rives does a great job of noting that neither description is biblically correct given the biblical reality that “the Sabbath would be a sign to let us know that He is our true God.”  The Sabbath was clearly an important marker for the people of Israel and for that matter, one reason they were removed from the land of promise was their failure to observe God’s Sabbath.  Furthermore, Rives clearly shows how Jesus observed the Sabbath and the early church, to include Paul, continued to observe the Sabbath as prescribed by God in the Old Testament.  If the Sabbath was established by God at creation and was noted to have been observed prior to the giving of the Mosaic Law, then an attempt to equate the Sabbath as something solely connected to that law falls short as it is then not a Jewish or Christian related observance.  Conversely, it is a reminder provided by God to His people throughout history, regardless of which side of the cross they might reside.  Rives also interacts with passages often used to diminish the importance of the Sabbath in our day, noting that such verses, while clearly noting Jesus as our Sabbath rest and a future Sabbath rest for all God’s people, also drive home the reality that to observe the Sabbath now provides us the opportunity to reflect on what God has done, is doing, and will do which after all is the very reason He established his time of remembrance for His people.  Rives also interacts with the historical record on this and many other issues to demonstrate his running thesis of the movement and integration of pagan ideals into church practice and their overall negative influence.There will be some who will vehemently disagree with everything Rives presents in this book because they are fully convinced of their position.  To those individuals I would ask to at least read and consider the overall thesis Rives presents.  In the end you may not find it convincing at all or after careful consideration and after looking into the historical patterns he presents as well as Scripture, you may have a desire to think through some things a bit more.  Others will likely be in full agreement with what Rives has presented.  In the middle are those who have not even read a book of this subject matter or who have not thought once about what might be some of the roots of what they find themselves observing each week or each year. It is to that group I believe Rives has written this book and it is that group of people who should if nothing else give this book a read.We are commanded by God to reject the “traditions of men” and to be a people who earnestly follow God’s commands.  Thus it would behoove us to at least consider and explore at all times what we believe, why we believe it, and the roots of our practices.  If they stand up to the scrutiny of Scripture then we should continue in those beliefs.  If they fail to stand up to the light of God’s Word, those beliefs should be rejected and replaced with what God has commanded.  Rives provides some great food for thought on a great many issues, ones which are not secondary issues of the faith.  I would encourage everyone to take a look at what Rives states in this interesting book, analyze what you read against the pages of Scripture, and to be willing to set aside tradition if necessary regardless of how comforting that tradition may be for you in keeping with God’s command to follow His ways and only His ways.  There is still much about all of the topics Rives has brought up that I will continue to study and explore and his book has provided some excellent food for thought in my own journey and Bible study.  I submit it will do the same for you as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVEYPCDLGW40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R0JCOI#wasThisHelpful","RRVEYPCDLGW40","A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book of Revelation is admittedly a complicated book full of strange imagery and a seemingly complicated prediction of future events that has theologians and laymen arguing endlessly about how best to approach, interpret, and apply its message, themes, and theology.  For many believers, Revelation is left relatively untouched with the approach taken that we all know Jesus will return so let’s just leave it at that and allow the academics and pastors to worry about actually understanding Revelation.  Hopefully somebody has gotten it right along the way or at least close enough.To help deal with the hands-off approach to Revelation taken by many believers, noted theologian G. K. Beale’s respected commentary on the book of Revelation has been condensed into a shorter text, one intended to be accessible to “pastors, students, and general Christian readers” while not losing any of the valuable exegesis and needed academic punch of the original work.Beale rightly notes in the introduction that Revelation “is the Bible’s battle cry of victory, for in it, more than anywhere else in the NT, is revealed the final victory of God over all the forces of evil.  As such, it is an encouragement to God’s people to persevere in the assurance that their final reward is certain and to worship and glorify God despite trials and despite temptations to march to the world’s drumbeat.”  In the midst of all the various arguments presented by theologians, pastors, authors, and layman on how best to exegete Revelation, Beale’s statement should serve as the lens by which one approaches the message contained in Revelation, a message of God’s sovereignty and the culmination of His divine plan.The important issues such as authorship, date of writing, genre, various exegetical methods for interpreting Revelation, its connection with the Old Testament, major themes, and a helpful outline of Revelation are all provided by Beale prior to engaging the text itself.  The information provided in the introduction of this book is just as much of a must read as the rest of the commentary as the information provided by Beale in the introduction is intended as a necessary jumping off point for the actual commentary.The meat and potatoes of this book if you will is just that – the excellent commentary.  Beale engages the text piece by piece, looking at small sections of each chapter, exegeting those sections with salient insight that is “nerdy” when needed and that explains the text in a way that is accessible to all believers.One element I truly appreciated in this commentary and something I wish more commentaries included is the “Suggestions for Reflection” sections.  Beale uses these portions of his commentaries as more than just a few questions as further food for thought on what he just spent time discussing.  Conversely, they are provided so as to help the reader think through the underlying message in the particular periscope being exegeted.  For instance, in the reflection section on Revelation 6:1-8, Beale notes those verses demonstrate God’s sovereignty, answering the sometimes thorny question of how God uses what seems to be evil events to bring about His divine plan.Overall, I found the analysis of Revelation by Beale to be sound, insightful, well written, and understandable.  While many commentaries on Revelation seem to compound the confusion, Beale’s effort avoids those pitfalls.  I highly recommend this shorter commentary version as well as the original tome written by Beale.  Both would be valuable additions to any believer’s library and I know this is a book I will find myself referring to time and again in the future.

"Use the word apologetics and quite likely a great number of things will come to mind ranging from two people dressed in suits on a stage arguing to a variety of complicated approaches to engaging scripture that seem far removed from something the average laymen could ever understand.  Given Scripture commands “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have” (1 Peter 3:15), it is thus important for all believers to understand what doing apologetics is all about and why it is an essential element of our walk with God and how we interact with the world around us.Brian Morley in his very helpful book Mapping Apologetics: Comparing Contemporary Approaches, outlines the various methodologies related to the doing of apologetics.  This is a survey book and in it, Morley focuses on providing the reader with an overview of the key figures over the years in the field of apologetics, their respective systems of apologetics, how they are similar and how they differ, and most importantly, Morley shares how each system can be used to do what apologetics should be focused on to begin with, that of sharing the message of Scripture and the truth contained therein.There is much to enjoy about this book.  The topic of apologetics can get quite heady very quickly, especially when matters of a philosophical nature are included as well as the seemingly never ending list of theological terminology that can make many a readers mind shudder.  While Morley does not shy away from engaging the technical and philosophical aspects of apologetical methods and their proponents, he does so in a way that helps the reader understand what each apologetics method is focused on doing, why it approaches things in the manner it does, and the pros and cons if you will of each of those constructs.The one element I most appreciated about this book was the “Thinking it Over” section found at the end of each chapter.  In these respective sections, Morley provides a lengthy list of questions for the reader to ponder that both reflect back on the information provided in that chapter and challenge the reader to engage the information discussed on an even deeper level of thought and action.  For instance, in his chapter on John Frame, Morley asks the salient question of “Can the believer and nonbeliever know the same thing?”  Now Morley covered Frame’s position on that question so the reader can certainly reflect on what Frame thought; however, the intent of asking such a question is to help the reader examine that particular apologists’ train of thought and apologetical methodology and whether that approach can answer some important theological questions.Other added bonuses provided in this book are definitions of key apologetical terminology and an excellent collection of recommended resources by the specific apologists Morley explores in this book as well as texts written on those apologists and their respective apologetical methods.  I would venture to say that even those well versed in the field of apologetics and familiar with the various apologists discussed in this book will find that after reading Morley’s excellent book, they will have added to their body of knowledge and understanding of apologetics in general and the methods by which apologetics is conducted.This would make an excellent Bible College or Seminary text on apologetics, it would be a valuable book for a church small group to use, and it also is a wonderful tool for all believers to have as it contains a wealth of information on apologetics.  As we noted earlier, doing apologetics is not just the responsibility of academics and those who like to debate.  All believers are called to defend the faith and to share why it is they believe God’s Word to be truth.  Morley’s book will go a long way to helping believers understand the various ways of doing apologetics.  I highly recommend this book.I received this book for free from IVP Academic for this review.

"In my humble opinion, there has long been a dearth of quality books, if any at all, aimed at the youth of the church as well as their parents, in particular efforts that assist both in obtaining and providing respectively a firm foundation in Scripture.  Given the troubling statistics concerning the departure of youth from the church once they reach college age never to return more often than not to church, it is essential to address this problem.  One way to address this mass departure is to ground kids in biblical truth.  Starr Meade, in her book Give Them Truth: Teaching Eternal Truths to Young Minds, sets out to do just that.When I saw this book I have to admit I was very excited.  It is not often I come across a book with this subject matter and with this particular cross-section of individuals as the focus of discussion.  Furthermore, I have a 13 year old daughter who is in that group being targeted by the barrage of carnality in our world today, the allure if you will that attempts to draw so many of our youth away from truth.  After reading this book and the plethora of helpful information provided by Meade, let’s just say my excitement has only served to increase as I have been provided with a great many tools to use in my own home regarding teaching these eternal truths of Scripture to the young mind that resides in my home.Meade notes in the preface this book “is not a book on parenting.  It is a book on teaching, and it is directed to anyone – parent, grandparent, teacher, or pastor – who teaches children.”  She divides her effort into three sections wit part one addressing the unfortunate reality that far too many children are biblically illiterate, part two discusses the basic doctrines of the faith children should be taught, and part three gets into some specific concepts and ideas to drive home those basic doctrines.  Additionally, Meade provides an excellent list of resources for children, parents, and all those who will even remotely be involved in teaching children biblical truth.  Since all in some way or another will at some point in their life engage with children, this book and the recommended resources should be part of our collective toolkits.If there was one portion in this book that struck me the most and was a veritable and need punch in the gut it was the following:  “Make the time to give your children (or students) rigorous, diligent instruction in the Bible and in Christian doctrine.  You don’t have to teach it all overnight; you can take years to teach, and then go back through and reteach.  But find or create a plan, and then work your plan.  Purposefully teach the whole Bible, in its broad overview and in its details, to your children.  Choose a method for making sure they are learning the doctrines of the Christian faith well enough that they will be able to articulate them back to someone.”While many books on this subject matter only provide lip service and frightening statistics while falling short on sound methodology to address the issue at hand, Meade’s effort avoids those pitfalls.  This book is overflowing with sound methodology and helpful tools to assist parents and teachers in their effort to invest in their children with the message of Scripture.  In an age where many youth programs seem to be more entertainment minded, Meade saliently reminds the reader of the need to teach our children issues such as the importance of God’s law and the high standards set forth in Scripture.  Why?  She rightly notes, “A correct understanding of our holy God will give our children a sense of right and wrong, sin and guilt.  A right knowledge of God’s grace and of the gospel will give them the power and boldness to go out each new day, regardless of yesterday’s failures, and begin anew to live faithfully for God’s glory.”If you are a parent who has been struggling with how to teach your children the truth of Scripture then this book is for you.  If you are involved in children’s or youth ministry and understand there needs to be more to what you offer than funny videos and games, this book is for you.  The time is now to get serious about training the next generation in the foundational truths of God’s Word.  Meade’s book is a valuable tool for engaging our youth in a way that will have a lasting impact on their lives and I highly recommend it.I received this book for free from P&R Publishing for this review.

"In Scripture and in the Ancient Near East (ANE), there are various motifs presented, in particular when it comes to the cosmos.  The understanding of the heavens, earth, stars, the underworld (death), and even the temple are greatly important for understanding many of the patterns and principles presented in Scripture to include how best to interpret and apply the passages that speak of such things.  Robin Parry’s helpful and fascinating book The Biblical Cosmos: A Pilgrim’s Guide to the Weird and Wonderful World of the Bible, walks the reader through several important concepts they might never have considered in their journey through Scripture.Parry rightly notes a basic truth of hermeneutics, namely that of understanding the text from the point of the original author and the original audience and then looking at how to apply that understanding to our lives today.  As he journeys through the world of the biblical cosmos and the Israelite and ANE understanding of such issues, Parry keeps that important foundation in mind.  He presents a four part approach to looking at the biblical cosmos with part one providing an overall tour of the biblical earth, part two engaging the biblical idea of the heavens, part three looking at the temple motif, and part four discussing the question of whether we can inhabit the biblical cosmos today.Many of the elements of the biblical cosmos that Parry discusses I submit will be quite familiar to anyone who has spent even a short amount of time reading Scripture.  For instance, we are familiar with the fact that the sun, moon, and stars were created to give light and to define in part the times and seasons.  We have an understanding to some degree of the importance of the temple.  But beyond those basic elements of comprehension can be found a much deeper engagement of what God is presenting throughout Scripture, especially when it relates to God’s sovereignty and how these issues interact with the ANE grasp of the cosmos.  The in-depth exploration of such information is where I think this book shines brightest.For instance, the motif of the sea as being a place of great chaos is found throughout Scripture, but perhaps many have not understood what this symbolism speaks to in part.  As Parry saliently notes, in the ANE understanding of creation, the gods did battle and out of that battle the universe came into being.  Of course we find a much different perspective in the Genesis account of creation.  It was not the gods that did battle in the chaotic sea, but rather God who created out of chaos a perfect world.  We also see this motif/symbolism in Mark 6:47-53.  There is an aspect of this passage that perhaps many have overlooked and that is the fact that Jesus is not described as walking on the water, but rather he is specifically noted as walking on the sea.  This is a clear depiction of the deity of Jesus, especially given the fact that “Job 9:8 says that God walks about on the sea as on the ground.”  Parry aptly notes “Mark uses the same word for Jesus walking about (peripateo) on the sea.  Jesus is acting out the role of God in Job 9!”  Thus we have Jesus demonstrating his deity by walking on the sea, a beautiful picture that can be understood by grasping what this issue of the sea is all about as it is presented throughout Scripture.Another interesting issue Parry discusses is the Promised Land, most notably the various borders noted in Scripture for this land.  Parry notes two specific accounts in Scripture that note the extent of the land God gave His people with both sets of border descriptions emphasizing a body of water as a boundary marker.  At first glance this may seem as nothing more than a coincidence or a point of convenience.  After all, why not just use a river or body of water as a natural border for the land.  Parry notes something more significant is taking place in the use of the Jordan River and the Euphrates River respectively as borders of the land.  He states “The meeting place of expanses of water and land serves as a symbolic boundary between order and the threat of chaos.  The link we have already noticed between the Promised Land and creation suggests that the Land was conceived of by some as a microcosm of creation.  As such water boundaries make a lot of sense and serve to reinforce that association.”  Thus we have God creating a land for His people in the midst of the wilderness.  This can also be observed in God bringing the people from the wilderness across a body of water into the Promised Land.  Either way, as Parry so interestingly notes, the sea and/or water motif provides some beautiful symbolism in Scripture.This was a fascinating book from which I learned much.  Parry engages the biblical and ANE texts with great insight, noting to the reader some valuable truths that will serve to shed some light on a number of often overlooked aspects of Scripture.  Ultimately, Parry notes the sovereignty of God in relation to the gods of the ANE word, showing how Scripture time and again reveals that everything is under God’s control to include the seas, the stars, and all created things.  While the ANE cosmos presents a world of chaos, the biblical cosmos is one overseen by God to the finest detail.  I highly recommend this book as it provides a valuable insight into the issue of biblical cosmology, what it meant for the original hearers and readers of Scripture and how it all continues to apply to us today.I received this book for free from WIPF and Stock Publishers for this review.

"The book of Romans is a foundational book as it masterfully deals with some of the most in-depth and important matters of theological truth.  Thus having a solid understanding of what the Apostle Paul is declaring in Romans is absolutely vital to understanding issues ranging from sin, to living our life as children of God, matters related to the sovereignty of God, and the often debated issues concerning who Israel is, her future, and how those who have been grafted into the root of Israel must understand what that is all about.  These are the issues deftly addressed by Tim Keller in his excellent commentary called Romans 8-16 For You.As the title of this commentary implies, this book is focused on helping the layman walk through what are some very difficult passages of Scripture.  Keller is quite skilled at such an approach and his pastoral heart and ability to take complex theological issues and to break them down into statements one can chew on and then apply is noticeable throughout this book.  I was impressed at the number of times Keller adeptly walked through a complex issue and then provided the all important element of application.For instance, in the very first chapter, Keller discusses the issue of how we have been set free from slavery to sin.  This often carries with it two sides of the coin with one side wrongly stating “Real Christians don’t struggle with sin anymore” (i.e. legalism) and the other side declaring “Real Christians are human; they sin like anyone else” (i.e. permissiveness).  Both sides are quite wrong in their approach.  Keller wisely notes that “our sanctification by the Holy Spirit is the cause or the ground of our justification – that it is as we fight sin and obey God that we are made right with God.”  God’s grace and the Holy Spirit working in our hearts to remove the root of sin necessarily results within us a desire to serve and glory God by being obedient to His commands found in Scripture.One section of Keller’s commentary I was immediately drawn towards was his comments on Romans 11, the often discussed, often misunderstood, and often improperly exegeted portion of the book of Romans.  There are some who wrongly asserted that God has ditched Israel to the curb.  Moreover, many also wrongly understand what that term “Israel” refers.  Furthermore, those who have taken the wrong path on those aforementioned issues, further stretch their exegesis by incorrectly declaring that God created the church to take the place of Israel within God’s grand salvation history plan.  Nothing of course could be further from the truth, given the Apostle Paul clearly notes that we have been grafted into the root of the promises made to Israel.  If the root were dead and no longer valid in God’s plan, there would be no point in being grafted into that which ceases to be as that would be an exercise in futility.Keller rejects that replacement theology nonsense, clearly noting “the way that the gospel has been received by Jew and Gentile is all part of God’s sovereign plan – a plan that includes Jews coming to faith, not just non-Jews.  Keller also rightly notes that ultimately, those who are “Israel” are those whom God has called or to use a better term, the elect or the called.  Paul is making the case that God’s plan is rooted in a call that is rooted in the promises made long ago to Abraham, namely that through him all the people of the earth would be blessed.  Keller saliently comments, “All peoples – both the Gentiles and the Jews – have been disobedient, and yet all peoples – from the Gentiles and Jews – will find God’s mercy.  Those who are obedient and who have been called by God are Israel, the people of God, both Jew and Gentile, male and female.  Thus the ecclesia noted in the New Testament is part of that greater assembly of God’s people throughout history, a people who have been granted access to the covenant promises of God made so long ago.  Keller does an excellent job walking the reader through this difficult and important matter and this particular chapter if representative of the quality exegesis Keller provides throughout his commentary.For those wanting a commentary on Romans that is accessible and that helps them grasp the often complicated yet highly important theological truths found in Romans should definitely take a look at this book.  It is one I highly recommend and one I know I will find myself returning to in future studies of Romans.  I also recommend the previous book to this one as the two together make a great set on Romans.I received this book for free from The Good Book Company via Cross Focused Reviews for this review.

"Let’s be honest.  The modern model of relationships is broken.  Divorce is rampant, so-called couples live together and have children outside of wedlock, and our youth run from one relationship to another leaving a trail of broken hearts.  Is this God’s design for male/female sexuality and relationships?  Is the modern dating model and the go your own way Fleetwood Mac approach something rooted in Scripture?  Have we as parents been neglecting our God given responsibility to instruct our children and to oversee their relationships?  The evidence around us seems to shout a resounding affirmative that we have not been following God’s guidelines.  Pastor and author Voddie Baucham, in his book What He Must Be…If He Wants to Marry My Daughter, urges the people of God to jettison the modern model in favor of a more biblical approach to the instruction of our children regarding relationships.This is a book that will challenge you, especially if you have bought into the idea that an individual, in particular a teenager jumping from relationship to relationship is a positive way of finding a mate.  Furthermore, this book will challenge those who think ideas of courtship or betrothal are old fashioned and unnecessary ways to help children move towards the marriage altar in a deliberate and god honoring way.  Baucham rejects the modern dating model as a complete failure and he embraces the courtship model as firmly rooted in Scripture.  I will submit I completely agree with Baucham’s position on this issue.I have a daughter and my wife and I often joke about beginning the interview process for her future husband by sitting on the front porch polishing our rifle.  We are only half kidding with the humorous part being that of sitting on the front porch with the rifle.  My wife and I firmly believe it is absolutely vital for us to be involved in overseeing and having a great deal of input into who our daughter associates with, especially when it comes to boys.  Moreover, it is vital that as parents, we instruct her in what to look for in a mate, ensuring through the course of that instruction, that we are involved in the “interview” process. While that may seem overbearing to some, as Baucham rightly notes, “as a father, it is my responsibility to teach my daughter what these requirements are, encourage her not to settle for less, and walk with her through the process of evaluating potential suitors.”  Old fashioned?  Perhaps, but it is biblically rooted.Many tell their children to simply “follow your heart” when it comes to choosing a mate.  When their daughter comes home and presents to them a young man the parents have never met, bubbling over about how much they are in love, most parents just smile, nod their head, and whip out the checkbook to start paying for the wedding.  In far too many instances, there is no depth of conversation with this young man or his parents to ascertain his background, relationship with God, or future job plans.  The approach of following your heart falls short of being valid.  Baucham saliently comments “we need to reconsider our commitment to parental assistance in selecting a life partner in light of our biblical responsibility to protect our children’s purity, to protect their hearts, to protect their focus, and to protect their future spouse.”Baucham calls this biblical approach gospel patriarchy, an approach rooted in the need to instruct our daughters and sons on what they should be looking for biblically speaking when it comes to choosing a mate.  Fathers have a huge role in this process as they have the God given responsibility of protecting their daughters and providing that umbrella of security for them up until the point when they give their daughters hand in marriage to a man who will take on that baton of responsibility.  Baucham avers there are four main requirements a young man must meet in order to be considered worthy of his daughter and I submit these biblically sound requirements will be used in my home as well.  The future suitor must be a follower of Christ, be prepared to lead, lead like Christ, and must be committed to children.The first three requirements should fall under the no-brainer category; however, the final requirement, that of being committed to children could give some pause.  Baucham correctly notes that we live in a society that more often than not views children as a burden.  Many wait until they have achieved a certain level of success in their career field before they even think about bringing children into the world.  That pursuit of success seems to take longer and longer, thus resulting in many couples ultimately choosing to skip having children at all.  Even adopting a child is rejected in the pursuit of career.  Even those who have children often spend little time with their kids as they have to spend most of their day in the office earning enough money to pay for the “finer things in life.”Baucham suggest something that might seem a bit radical in the minds of some and that is the need to take a look at whether this modern model is also broken.  Has our pursuit of things impacted our ability to spend time with our children, discipling and instructing them in the way they should go?  Each family will need to assess their own situation; however, Baucham does rightly suggest the merit of looking at ways to become a single-income family, or at least moving towards a place where a Titus 2 situation can become a reality at some point in the future.  If anything, this is helpful food for thought that my wife and I will discuss and I think should be something discussed in many more households.  This idea goes against the grain of society as it is viewed as nothing more than keeping the woman back forcing her to be barefoot and pregnant.  Nothing could be further from the truth and what Baucham suggests and the input from many fine theologians and most importantly the many passages that speak to this issue must be prayerfully considered.Perhaps the best part of this book was Baucham’s discussion of the need for a future suitor to practice the four P’s of being a protector, provider, prophet, and priest.  If these qualities are not resident within a potential suitor for your daughter, that should give you as a father much pause as these are the qualities noted throughout Scripture that must be part of the individual who leads the home.  I also appreciated that Baucham spent an entire chapter speaking to the reality that most young men know nothing of these biblical traits of manhood.  Given that reality, godly men must spend time with their own sons as well as young men they come regularly in contact with in the circles their daughter resides, instructing those young men in the things of God.  Baucham calls this building up the future crop of godly men for our daughters.  This is a call to action, one I took to heart.To all the fathers out there including myself, it is time to put your man pants on.  Give Baucham’s book a read and consider the biblically rooted truths he presents.  Stop thinking your daughter or son can go it alone in their search for a godly mate.  Take an honest look at the modern dating model with its pitfalls and realize there is a better way, that of taking an active role in guiding your children to the altar so they can stand holy and pure next to a spouse they will spend the rest of their lives with.  Go against the tide that declares hopping from relationship to relationship is just how it works.  As Baucham notes, since “the bar has been set so low for so long in our culture, many of the qualities and characteristics seems strange, and perhaps a bit distant.  But they are supposed to be.”  All parents should pick up a copy of this book and take to heart the godly principles Baucham outlines.  More than that, they should put into immediate practice the instruction and discipling of their children for the glory of God so that we may raise a future generation of youth who are committed to the sanctity of marriage and the need to remain pure physically, spiritually, and emotionally upon entering their vows of marriage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLGHZVJOEI3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581349300#wasThisHelpful","R3KLGHZVJOEI3Z","A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ALHD0Z4FZEIJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volumes have been written in an attempt to engage and explain God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.  Learned theologians throughout the centuries have labored to write on this subject and untold number of sermons have been declared to parishioners and we still have barely touched the tip of what God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all about.  Thankfully, pastors and authors continue to study and discover biblical insight into the Godhead that needs to be shared in a manner accessible to all believers.  Joe Thorn's latest book called Experiencing the Trinity: The Grace of God for the People of God is a highly useful and highly accessible journey into better understanding the Godhead.Born out of a particularly difficult period in his life, Thorn provides the reader with fifty meditations/devotions on the subject of the trinity.  His goal is not to dive into the deepest theological wells of this subject.  Conversely, Thorn desires simply to note ""how the Word of God draws us to the living God.  In knowing Him we find peace, joy, strength, and faith.""  Each chapter is focused on presenting a number of attributes and actions of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.  In doing so, Thorn shows the grace of God working in the life of His people and how we can draw closer in love and devotion to Him.I have read literally piles of books on God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit to include lengthy treatises written by many of the most well-known theologians of our day days gone by.  While I do enjoy those nerdy tomes on a subject such as the trinity, there is something to be said about a simpler approach, one that presents for instance God's holiness, spending a moment helping the reader contemplate that enormously important reality.  If God is holy, what exactly does that mean and why should I care?  Thorn digs right to the heart of God's holiness in three short yet powerfully written pages, leaving the reader with a healthy understanding of what God being holy means as well as a starting point for further study and that is just the first chapter!After reading each chapter in this book, you will find yourself growing more in love with God and more amazed at just how marvelous this God is that we serve.  He is Creator.  He is Unchanging.  He is Jealous.  He became human and died on our behalf.  He is our great High Priest.  He rose from the dead.  He lives in side us.  He is sanctifying us.  He comfort us.  Ladies and gentleman that is just the tip of the iceberg of the subjects Joe Thorn covers in this excellent book on the trinity.This is a book you will return to over and over again in your studies on the trinity.  I highly recommend this book for all believers as it will drive you to praise and worship God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, while also helping you better understand the God of the Bible.  Thorn writes in a profound yet succinct way that is helpful to both seasoned and new believes alike.  I could not put this book down and I am confident you will find yourself doing the same.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

Answers to such a question are difficult and should never be flippant.  Peter Chin, in his truly helpful book Blindsided by God: Disappointment, Suffering, and the Untamable Goodness of God, tackles this perpetually important issue.Peter Chin is a man fully familiar with the sting and pain of disappointment and suffering.  In this book, he reflects on those experiences, specifically a miscarriage he and his wife endured, the struggles he went through planting a church, as well as the pain and agony his wife endured dealing with breast cancer.  Sharing these moments of suffering makes this a book that is quite personal as Chin walks the reader through what it was like to deal with each of those moments and the understandable questions that arose, namely where God is at in the midst of those trials.There are some who falsely believe that just because they are Christians that somehow pain and suffering will be averted.  After all, God protects His children, right?  While that is certainly true, in this life we will have trouble due to the continued impact of sin and death prior to the redemption and restoration that will come when Christ returns.  Until that glorious day, we will have to deal with issues such as what Chin reflects upon in this book.  With that said, the health and wealth gospel has so permeated the psyche of the church, causing many to have no foundation from which to deal with suffering when it comes calling.Chin notes he ""had never consciously subscribed to the gospel of health and wealth - the ideology that following God endured physical blessings - I must have subconsciously absorbed it.  Some subtle form of it had worked itself into my heart and mind, and from countless sources.""  The pernicious approach of the health and wealth gospel left Chin at first feeling betrayed by God.  Being grounded in the truth of Scripture, Chin was able to understand that promises of no suffering are foreign to Scripture.  What we do find in Scripture is a promise that God will be with us in the difficult times of life.  Chin aptly comments ""He does not promise that we will not suffer, but that when we do suffer, he will be there with us in the midst of it all.  It is a promise, not of painlessness, but of His presence.""As the reader works through Blindsided by God, they will be presented with a heart rending story, one of a loss of a child, a struggling church plant, and breast cancer.  This seemingly endless list of suffering ends with the glorious birth of an unexpected and unlikely birth of a child.  In the midst of suffering, in this case that of breast cancer, God formed a child in the womb of Peter's wife Carol, bringing life from the death of cells, joy in the midst of suffering.Chin notes at the conclusion to this book that not all stories end in a happy ending.  There will be times when despite our most earnest prayers for healing, a loved one will die.  Despite our prayers for peace in this world, man will continue to kill their fellow man and even though we may plead with God for financial blessings to rain down on those in need, Jesus told us the poor will continue to be poor.  In the suffering and in the pain, there is one resounding truth that Chin saliently reminds the reader about, that of knowing.  This knowing is rooted in resting in the reality that ""God will be with me, and as a result, I always have reason for hope, both for this life and the next...even a brief glimpse of God in the midst of the storm is better than a lifetime spent in blissful ignorance.""It is that focus and constant reminder that makes this such an excellent discussion of suffering and the sovereignty of God.  Chin shares the experiences of his own life in a very matter of fact manner, admitting that during those difficult times, he was tempted to question that God was in control.  That honestly is quite refreshing.  It is a highly personal response that connects with the reader that the academic approach often overlooks.  While there is a need for books that provided a developed theodicy that addresses the problem of evil, there is also the need for books such as this one that people can relate and identify with for we all know of people who have dealt with situations such as those described by Chin. Those who read this book will find themselves better understanding that no matter what life throws at them, God is right there with them in the midst of the storm.I received this book for free from Bethany House Publishers for this review.

"A Bible map or atlas is likely not something most get excited about.  For that matter, the few maps some study Bibles provide are probably not something many refer to on a regular basis for a variety of reasons.  Looking to find where the city of Shechem is located is quite frankly not high on the priority list of most believers and Bible readers.  I am confident that those who take a look at Tim Dowley's useful book aptly titled The Student Bible Atlas will find their Bible reading and study greatly enhanced.As a homeschool dad, I am constantly looking for new and relevant study tools, especially when it comes to teaching my daughter about the history of Israel or anything related to Scripture.  When I came across Dowley's book of maps, it seemed like something that would be of use for our homeschool studies.  I was not disappointed and let me share with you why.First, these are very easy to read color maps, unlike the often hard to read and understand maps placed at the front or rear of many Bibles.  The maps in this book are quite easy to read and the information provided on the maps is very useful.  There is a map provided for nearly every major era of Scripture to include everything from the time of Abraham up to the early congregations of the New Testament period.  Additionally, Dowley has a map that notes many of the major archaeological sites throughout the Middle East.Of further note is the index. While some may not see the usefulness of an index when it comes to looking at a map, there are times when someone may come across a city mentioned in the Bible or in other studies, but they may not know what map or perhaps maps to find that city.  An index allows the user of this atlas to locate where to find that city.  Dowley provides all the major cities in the index and on the maps in this atlas.  In addition to providing many helpful maps, Dowley also includes for each map, annotating some of the major events and time periods that particular map outlines.If you are looking for an easy to use Bible atlas that will place at your fingertips the world of the Bible, then I highly recommend Tim Dowley's The Student Atlas Bible.  It is a great tool for personal Bible study, family Bible study, and for those homeschool parents looking for valuable material to supplement their teaching curriculum.  An updated version will be available in September 2015 so be on the lookout.I received this book for free from Fortress Press for this review. I was not required to write a positive review.

"Depression is a painful experience.  It can draw one into the depths of despair with the accompanying belief there is no way out of the fog and back into the light of day and happiness.  Many suffer from depression and struggle to understand why they are experiencing this malady.  Furthermore, those around them are often ill-prepared to be of assistance and there are even more who believe they are helping those in despair but in reality are merely making matters worse.  The great preacher Charles Spurgeon was one quite familiar with depression and Zack Eswine, in his very helpful book Spurgeon’s Sorrows: Realistic Hope for Those Who Suffer From Depression, examines the salient biblical advice of Spurgeon on the topic of depression.Eswine divides his thoughts into three sections, each focused on addressing a specific aspect of depression.  The first section provides the reader with valuable information with what depression looks like and what those who are suffering depression are feeling.  The second section addresses means by which we can help those in depression, and the final section deals with helpful ways to cope with the daily struggle with depression so many face.I truly appreciated the gentle way Eswine engages the topic of depression.  It seems as if many take the approach of placing a clinical prescription or title to one’s depression, thinking that if that person takes the correct medicine, sees the correct psychiatrist, or pulls themselves up by their bootstraps, they can move forward from the doldrums of despair.  If moving forward from depression were that easy, one would think everyone would be well on their way to happier times.There are a number of important points Eswine notes, foremost the fact that suffering from depression is not a sin.  There are many reasons why someone may be depressed, many of which I had no clue about.  It is very important for those suffering from depression to realize what they are going through is not a sinful act, although one’s reaction to that situation could result in sinful behavior.Of further note is those who are in a state of depression are not alone.  Eswine shares the fact that many great men of God went through periods of depression in their lives to include King David, Martin Luther, and of course Charles Spurgeon.  When one looks at how these men of God dealt with depression, it is clear they looked to the pages of Scripture for assistance.  Eswine reminds the reader that in the Psalms, we find King David describing what depression and despair looked like for him.Most importantly, our Savior Jesus Christ went through the depths of despair.  For anyone dealing with depression, this is perhaps the greatest truth to grasp.  Moreover, that reality is also important for those helping those around them who in a state of depression to understand.  Tossing around a future hope of a time when sin and death and pain are no more, while indeed an absolute biblical truth, often does not help in the here and now of despair.  Eswine aptly notes that “when we search for someone, anyone, to know what it means to walk in our shoes, Jesus emerges as the preeminent and truest companion for our afflictions.”  Spurgeon also affirmed a similar approach, stating “the afflicted do not so much look for comfort to Christ as he will come a second time…as to Christ as he came the first time, a weary man and full of woes”, the man of sorrows.When those in depression look to Christ as that man of sorrows, who endured what they are enduring and who is at every moment comforting and making intercession for us, that knowledge places the issue of depression within the grander scheme of God’s plan.  As Eswine so rightly avers, the feeling of remoteness from God is lessened and the depressed begin to understand that God cares and our affliction, though tiresome, is not a burden we have to carry alone.Eswine also deals with the issue of suicide, a choice far too many believe is the only solution to getting out of the state of depression.  This is a difficult topic and Eswine addresses it with both grace and firmness.  Again looking at the life of Spurgeon, Eswine comments that even Spurgeon “knew this desire for death.  He found language for it in the story of Job whose profound description of misery not only reveals why in our afflictions of body and mind we would want to die but also the manifest mercy of God who would inspire such grief words and call them Scripture.”  Those who feel like taking their own life need to read the salient statement by Eswine that “a larger story exists in Jesus.  In time, even hope demolished can become hope rebuilt, if it is realistic and rooted, not just in the cross and empty tomb but also in the garden and the sweat-like blood.”I highly recommend this book for all believers.  The wisdom examined by Eswine from the pen of Charles Spurgeon regarding depression is outstanding and will greatly help those suffering from this issue to begin to grab hold of Jesus who suffered as we did, even to the point of death on a cross.  I know I learned much about depression and how to help those suffering from this pain in their life.  Look to the man of sorrows for he cares for you.  That was the approach Spurgeon took and it is the correct one.I received this book for free from Christian Focus Publications for this review. I was not required to write a positive review.

"We live in a day and age where the allure of sex is literally at our very fingertips.  Smart phones allow men to access a vast array of pornographic material often free of charge in short bursts that wire and work their way into the mind and behavioral patterns of far too many.  God has a proper design for sex that is outlined in Scripture, one that places sexual activity strictly within the bond of a covenant marriage relationship.  So how can men today deal with the pervasive influence of sex in society, ensuring they maintain a proper view of godly sexual relationships?  John Freeman, in his outstanding book Hide or Seek: When Men Get Real with God about Sex, addresses this vital issue.John Freeman speaks to the issue of sex and sexual healing from years of experience ministering to men who have fallen prey to the world's false view of sex.  Freeman speaks to this issue with great clarity, passion, and a focus on providing the reader with sound biblical wisdom.  The statistics he provides on the numbers of men even within the church that are addicted to pornography were quite staggering and sobering.  It is quite evident we live in a pornified culture, bent on twisting and manipulating what God created for enjoyment between a husband and wife.This truly is a heart issue and Freeman does an excellent job of noting that fact.  He rightly notes ""Sexual distortion and sexual addiction do not exist because sex itself is bad but because we have put it in a place that God never intended it to be.""  Many men allow the world's perversion of sex to master them, which of course then results in the addiction to that master.  The good news is there is hope for those who have fallen prey to Satan's lies in this area of their life.It is evident Freeman has a passion for helping men find victory through Christ and the truth of God's Word.  No amount of self-gumption can break the bonds of sexual addiction.  Only the power of the blood of Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit can effect this needed change of heart.  Freeman aptly states, ""Without Christ, on any given day you're a God-hater, an idol-maker, and a game-player too.  It's the temperament of every sinful heart.  That's why I need Jesus, not just to clean me up or improve me.  I need him to do radical heart surgery on me...every day!""  Such a statement demonstrates that fighting against the urge of sexual sin is a minute by minute, day by day battle that can be won only through the Holy Spirit renewing our hearts and minds.In order to do battle, men must get real and must make an honest assessment of themselves.  Many men who are trapped in the web of sexual promiscuity or who are addicted to pornography feel as if they simply cannot stop so why even try.  There is a definite sense of hopelessness that must be addressed.  Freeman saliently notes the need for confession of sin, stating ""Confession is always the beginning of repentance and change.  In other words, you can't have repentance and change without genuine confession.""Freeman also reminds the reader this is an ongoing battle that must be fought.  Temptation will come because the enemy is hell-bent (no pun intended) on twisting God's perfect design, especially in matters related to sex.  I truly appreciated Freeman's focus on the need for community, believer's gathering together to help one another stay on the straight and narrow, the essential need for accountability, especially when it comes to finding victory in this particular area.  Freeman avers ""we need a community to help us process our soul's discouraging elements and learn how to live a life of faith and repentance.""There is hope for those addicted to sexual perversion.  That hope is found in Jesus Christ and the body of Christ needs to reach out to those struggling in this area, providing a listening ear, a sense of accountability, and a focus on community.  <em>Hide or Seek</em> is truly an excellent book and one I highly recommend, especially to those struggling in this area and also to all believers so they can be better prepared to reach out to those in need to help men addicted to sexual perversion to stop hiding and to seek the healing found in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.I received this book for free from New Growth Press for this review.

"On occasion, I have tried my hand at leading or helping in the Children’s Church and Middle School youth programs at church.  I cannot always say those efforts have turned out like I envisioned while at other times it seems as if at least something got across to my audience of impressionable minds.  Presenting the gospel in a manner that is effective to our children without dumbing it down to the point where no meat of the Word is provided is highly important, perhaps now more than ever.  Thus, strategies and methods for effectively teaching the message of Scripture are tools all believers should have at their disposal, regardless of whether they serve in an official teaching function at church or not.  At some point in life, we will be teaching children biblical truth and we need to be prepared.  Jack Klumpenhower, in his excellent book Show Them Jesus: Teaching the Gospel to Kids, provides a helpful, common sense, and firmly biblical sound approach to doing just what the title of his book speaks of, teaching kids about the message of the Gospel.What struck me first and foremost about this book is the author’s passion for helping the reader keep Jesus as the centerpiece of any instruction given to children.  Klumpenhower rightly notes “the content of the message matters; it must be about Jesus.”  Furthermore, he states “the cross of Christ applies to the entire Christian life”, even the life of the smallest of children.  Moreover, Klumpenhower avers “faith in this message comes from God.  Thus we need to speak the message of the Gospel in the way God intended, by declaring it from the pages of Scripture at every opportunity.I have often been quite surprised at how many church curriculum is entertainment based as if elementary, middle school and high school aged children are completely incapable of grasping biblical concepts.  It seems as if the important issues of life, namely sin and the message of salvation are buried under comedic acts on a video.  Klumpenhower rejects such silliness, instead declaring that a “good-news teacher must not sugarcoat God’s demands.  The Bible describes sin as our willful rebellion against God and all that’s delightful in the universe.”  It is absolutely necessary for children to understand that sobering fact.  It is also important to share the solution to that problem – the shed blood of Christ that paid the penalty for our sin.I also appreciated that Klumpenhower recommends that the message of the Gospel must permeate every aspect of children’s ministry.  The proclamation of the truth of the saving message of the Gospel cannot be reserved for a special “Gospel-day”.  In an effort to help parents and teachers walk their children through the message of the Gospel, Klumpenhower provides a plethora of ways to take biblical stories and to demonstrate from those stories the message of the Gospel.  For example, he provides the reader with tools on how to take the story of Esther and to show children God’s saving work in the life of the people of Israel. Such a discussion is a perfect springboard into a discussion of Jesus and the salvation he brings.  Klumpenhower even uses the story of Balaam and his talking donkey as an example of how to show kids Jesus.As a parent who homeschools their child, I can also see applications for this book in that environment.  For instance, as I work with my daughter on the history of the people of Israel as outlined in Scripture, there are multiple opportunities in that storyline to teach my daughter about God’s grace, deliverance, and salvation of His people.  Using the techniques and tools outlined by Klumpenhower in this book will go a long way to finding even more ways and additional opportunities to drive home the message of th Gospel even in a subject such as social studies.I highly recommend this book for all believers, especially those who minister in Sunday School or who work with middle and high school aged kids.  This book will also be profitable for all parents and even grandparents.  We must be devoted to teaching our kids about Jesus to include those difficult subjects such as sin.  Avoiding those hard discussions is not what God desires and Klumpenhower provides the reader with valuable tools to effectively show kids Jesus.  In an age where too many churches have gone the route of entertainment based instruction, this book redirects the approach of teaching back to where it belongs – rooted in the pages of Scripture with a focus and passion for declaring to our kids the message of the Gospel.I received this book for free from New Growth Press for this review.

"The glory of God is a well-read term in Scripture, yet I would submit it is an often misunderstood term.  So what exactly does it mean to experience the glory of God and does it have any significant long term impact on our daily Christian walk.  Furthermore, how is the glory of God connected to our relationship with Christ and our focus on the message of the gospel as it applies to our lives?  These are the questions probed and answered by musician and author Matt Papa in his outstanding book Look and Live: Behold the Soul-Thrilling, Sin-Destroying Glory of Christ.There are some authors who simply have the ability to translate deep theological thought into words that are easily understood and that truly excite the reader to grow deeper in the knowledge of God and in relationship with Him.  Matt Papa is one of those authors.  A gifted musician whom I have long respected for his lyrical and musical abilities, Papa can now add gifted writer to his repertoire.  This was a book I admittedly could not put down and I looked forward to the next opportunity I had to pick it up and resume reading.  Not many books have garnered that level of attention for me lately.The overall premise of <em>Look and Live</em> is the necessity for the believer to behold the glory of God for it by looking to God that we can find life and liberty.  Papa spends a great deal of time properly defining the term glory.  This is a somewhat confusing term as it has quite often not been properly used in Christian parlance.  Ultimately, we worship that which we find glory in which means we all worship something.  Since God alone is worthy of glory and honor, our focus must be centered on Him.  As Papa so rightly notes, “Glory entices and begins worship…Glory is foundational to worship.”  Papa helps guide the reader to a firm and lasting realization that our focus must be rooted in the glory of God and His Son Jesus.The most significant portion of the book in my humble opinion was the chapter called “The Blazing Center.”  In this chapter, Papa focuses on the transformative power of God’s glory through the power of the cross.  Experiencing God has to be far more than just a passing conversation or a half-hearted relationship.  Falling in love with God must involve pursuing God.  Moreover, Papa saliently notes “The gospel is good news because in the gospel we finally see a glory that will totally satisfy us and enthrall us forever – the glory of God.”  When we gave at the cross we find in that action the necessity to bring glory to God in every area of our lives.Jesus is more than a friend.  He is God and He is our Savior.  Papa aptly notes “He is polarizing.  He demands everything.”  Those in passionate love with God will have the desire to give to God that which He so rightly deserves, namely everything we are and all that we do.  That burning desire is indeed “soul-thrilling” and “sin-destroying” for nothing can stand in the presence of the glory of God.I highly recommend this book for all believers.  Papa’s engaging writing style, honest personal examples, and passion literally exude from every page.  This book is challenging, biblically sound, and sorely needed.  Those who read it will find their passion for God renewed, a passion for God ignited, and the desire to share this message of the gospel with others while at the same time better understanding the need to deal with sin and to focus at all times on the glorifying and worshiping God.  This is a must read and while you are at it, I also recommend you pick up a few copies of Matt Papa’s music as well.  You will assuredly enjoy it.I received this book for free from Bethany House for this review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

"The word law as it relates to Scripture often gets a bad rap.  Grace often seems to be the more popular term of focus.  Law is often viewed as something of an Old Testament or old covenant term that while important, is perhaps something we have found a bit of freedom from given our status as New Testament believers.  Is that really what Scripture says and how we are to approach the law, specifically God’s law?  Glenda Mathes, in her excellent devotional aptly titled Discovering Delight: 31 Mediatations on Loving God’s Law, provides the reader with a proper biblical perspective on this subject.As noted, this short yet powerful book is a series of meditations specifically focused on bringing to light the importance of God’s law and why we should be madly in love with obeying God’s commands.  Mathes roots her meditations in the Psalms, with a great deal of time spent working through the entirety of Psalm 119, the largest Psalm and the Psalm that deals most heavily with the term law and what our approach should be to God’s law.As Mathes so rightly notes in the beginning of this book, “Today’s Christians don’t want to read about law.  They want to revel in gospel and grace.  But the Bible clearly links law with love.”  The majesty of Psalm 119 for instance in extolling the need to love God’s law is not an isolated perspective in Scripture.  Mathes correctly states “Other Psalms, Old Testament passages, and New Testament texts specifically extol God’s law and encourage believers to love the written as well as the living Word.”In each and every daily meditation provided in this book, Mathes explores what a certain text, in the case of this book a passage or passages in the Psalms, has to say about God’s law and our response to it.  She not only examines the passage(s) in question with astute and sound exegesis, she also uses valuable examples of what loving God’s law looks like in practice.  Additionally, she provides reflection questions at the conclusion of each meditation as additional food for thought, helping the reader dig even deeper into the passage with the focus of application and understanding.If you are in love with God you will keep His commands.  This means you will have a passion for Scripture and a desire to be a person of the Book, one who truly delights in God’s law.  I highly recommend this devotional for all believers, especially in an age where the law has far too often been forgotten.  After working through this devotional, I am quite confident you will have a renewed passion for Scripture and a renewed desire to be the obedient bride to which we have been called.I received this book for free from Reformation Heritage Books via Cross Focused Reviews for this review.

"Life is a battlefield.  It seems if it is not one thing it is another in our daily lives from dealing with issues at work, home, mounting bills, problems around the world, a screaming kid, or you name it.  Also amongst the battles we face are those of fighting the urge to sin and break God’s commands.  No matter what battle we seem to be engaged it, one important truth to remember is they are rooted in the spiritual warfare that rages each and every single day.  Bob Bevington, in his excellent book Good News About Satan: A Gospel Look at Spiritual Warfare, explores what spiritual warfare is all about, how we can know the enemy and his tactics, and most importantly, the reality that we can have confidence the victory has been won.There are many books on the market that deal with matters of spiritual warfare, some good and many not so much.  Many authors forget the answers to his battle that wages against spiritual forces in heavenly places are found within the pages of Scripture.  I firmly believe that biblical focus on biblical answers is where Bevington’s book shines the brightest.  Now there is nothing wrong with some quotes from godly men on a particular topic.  With that said, there is something refreshing about an author who writes a book with the sole source of information being the pages of God’s Word.Bevington does an excellent job of outlining the playing field.  Just as an army going into battle must understand their enemy, the ground they are fighting over, the enemy’s tactics, the enemy’s weakness, and the strengths of your own troops before going into battle, so to should the believer analyze these same issues when battling Satan.  As Bevington so rightly notes, “As members of the kingdom of God, all Christians are unavoidably involved in the conflict – each one of us is commanded to engage in active resistance.”  Thus, sitting on the sidelines of this war is not an option.Also of note in this book is Bevington’s apt evaluation of the strategy of Satan.  It is important to understand that not every evil thing that occurs in life is the work of a demonic force.  There is an alignment of forces arrayed against humanity that all seek to trip us up.  These three pernicious foes are “the word, the flesh, and the devil.”  Scripture provides us the blueprint for being able to identify which of these foes is at work in a given situation, and Bevington does a marvelous job of walking the reader how to read the battlefield and to properly identify which attack is being thrust.There are some who seem to feel as if the battle against the enemy is a losing proposition.  Everywhere we turn, it seems as if heartache, strife, and godlessness reign supreme.  Bevington addresses that wrong attitude, noting the enemy has weaknesses given he is not God, and most importantly, Jesus has won the victory over the enemy on the cross.  The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus took the battle to the enemy’s own camp, utterly defeating him.  While in this life we will continue to endure trouble, hardship, and temptation, the believer can remain confident as they fight this spiritual battle that the victory is complete.  This is a reminder we all need each and every day and Bevington saliently and gently reminds the reader of exactly Who is on our side and the reality that King Jesus has secured the battlefield.Furthermore, Bevington discusses how the battle must be fought and what weapons we have been provided by God by which engage in this conflict of the ages.  He notes we are to first remember who we are in Christ.  We are the children of God and God takes care of His children.  Additionally, Bevington comments that when we put on the full armor of God, it must be done with a gospel-centered approach, keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus who won the victory.  Moreover, Bevington reminds the reader that to resist the temptation of the enemy, we must humbly submit to God as well as confess our sin and repent of wrongdoing.  These are all keys to a successful battle strategy and they are all found in our battle manual – The Word of God.I highly recommend this book for all believers.  We are all engaged in spiritual warfare whether we want to believe so or not.  Bevington’s powerful book is Scripture centered, gospel centered, and timely.  Those who have been sitting on the sidelines hoping the battle will pass them by desperately need to read this book as a call to arms.  Those who have been fighting the good fight for many years also need to read this book as a source of encouragement.  As the title of this book so rightly notes, the good news about Satan is he is a defeated enemy and God has provided His people the tools to resist temptation and to be the warriors of the kingdom we have been called to be.I received this book for free from Cruciform Press for this review.

"There is arguably no more significant issue outside of salvation that garners the great discussion than the debate on suffering and the sovereignty of God.  The question is often posed as to if God is so powerful and loving, where is there evil and suffering in the world.  As believers, we are called to be able to respond to such questions.  While it is perhaps somewhat outside out finite understanding to grasp all of God’s ways and purposes, we are not left without guidance regarding suffering and the sovereignty of God.  John Currid in his helpful book <em>Why Do I Suffer?: Suffering and the Sovereignty of God</em> takes a look at what Scripture has to say regarding this important issue.Currid divides his book into four sections with the first dealing with God and calamity, the second part discussing why Christians suffer, the third part engaging why unbelievers endure hardship, and the final section providing salient words regarding what we should do when suffering and hard times come our way.  As Currid rightly notes in the preface, “There is a great mystery to human suffering.”  Theologians, philosophers, and humanity in general have long pondered why trouble takes place.  Is it the act of the gods in response to the disobedience of their worshipers and thus should these entities be appeased to bring an end to suffering?  Is God incapable of dealing with suffering, is He simply taking a hands off approach, or is suffering a part of the current construct as we move towards a place of restoration and redemption?There are some who aver bad things happen due to random chance.  Currid rightly rejects such a notion, stating that if that perception were true, “chaos is a powerful force that exists and acts independently of God.”  For the believer, that approach is untenable, especially since Scripture declares God as being Creator and sustaining all that takes place in the universe.  There is nothing outside His divine control.  Currid responds to the idea of chance by affirming the biblical doctrine of God’s sovereignty.  He aptly comments, “The Bible depicts that everything that happens in heaven and on earth occurs because of God’s decree, will, and purpose” and this includes what we term and view as suffering.This brings into play then the paradoxical relationship that seems to exist between God’s sovereignty and the responsibility man has for the entrance and continued sin in the world.  How can both co-exist?  Currid approaches this important question by digging right into Scripture, admitting the mystery that surrounds such a doctrine, yet also noting the reality that God is sovereign and man is responsible for sin. An important theological term called God’s permissive will or decree is key to this issue.  Currid elaborates as to what that principle is all about, rightly noting “God is not the author or originator of sin and its subsequent suffering.  Yet, God has foreordained them because he has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass…thus, sin and suffering do not exist apart from divine control and purpose.”  Such statements may cause one’s head to spin, but Currid further explains what his statements means in the remainder of the book as he discusses why suffering happens to believers and unbelievers.Building on the necessary foundation of God’s sovereignty as demonstrated in Scripture, Currid provides the reader with some excellent discussion on why believers and unbelievers suffer.  Since God is sovereign, there must be a reason why bad things happen.  Currid rightly explains that suffering brings the believer to their knees in prayer.  Scripture is full of examples of the righteous being afflicted and turning to God.  The suffering was not always lifted as seen for instance in the case of Job; however, the fervent prayers of a righteous man avail much with that availing usually resulting in a closer relationship with God.Times of affliction should also drive the believer to the pages of Scripture.  Currid saliently notes, “When in trouble, the Christian retires to the Scriptures.  He reads it, ponders it, and indeed struggles with it.”  Suffering also presents the reality that things are not as they should be and thus times of trial help the believer focus on the day when all things are made new.  Currid also notes that suffering brings humility, discipline, instruction, restoration, and refinement towards a place where we become more like Christ.  God often uses times of suffering to refine His people.Unbelievers also endure times of suffering.  Currid provides a number of reasons why God uses suffering in the life of the unbeliever.  These include what is essentially a wake-up call.  Such events are noted in a number of great men of the faith to include John Newton and Robert Murray McCheyne.  Currid provides a quick examination of those men’s lives and how God used a time of suffering to woo them to Him.  At some point, unbelievers will endure eternal, everlasting suffering due to their unbelief.  I was pleased to see Currid affirm the biblical doctrine of everlasting punishment.I think the most helpful portion of this book is the final section where Currid provides the reader with how to approach times of suffering.  He rightly notes that as believers, we should actually expect suffering.  He states, “God’s Word tells us that those who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be a target of afflictions and will suffer more greatly than most people.”  I fully appreciated Currid’s statement that “Present pain and suffering are nothing compared to the glory that Crist has bought and secured for us in heaven.”  When we endure trials, we can rest assured God is in control, things are taking place for a purpose, and death, sin, and suffering will one day be eternally dealt with.I highly recommend this book to all believers.  It is replete with sound biblical exegesis and Currid does an excellent job of affirming God’s sovereignty and noting the reasons Scripture gives as to why suffering occurs.  Those desiring to develop a solid theodicy or responses to this issue will find Currid’s treatment of the subject quite helpful.I received this book for free from Christian Focus Publications for this review.

"What does it really mean to be a true Christian?  Are there observable traits that identify the real Christian from the fake, marks that clearly demonstrate one is really a follower of Jesus vice one who merely pays lip service?  The answer to those questions is a resounding yes and Todd Wilson, in his helpful book Real Christian: Bearing the Marks of Authentic Faith, explains for the reader precisely what being a real Christian is about.Wilson begins by defining the term real.  This is important given unless one grasps what the real version looks like, the fake will be that much more difficult to spot.  He rightly notes “Real Christians bear the marks of authentic faith in ways that can be seen, heard, and felt.”  This means real Christianity involves more than simply saying you are a Christian.  It demands action that is observable by others and that impacts the world around you for the glory of God.There is a process of moving towards a place of real faith.  Wilson aptly explains the first steps toward authenticity begin with a change of one’s heart.  He comments, “A transformed heart is what gives rise to all the marks of real – from humility to hunger.  And nothing else but a new heart can do this.”  This statement dives right to the heart (no pun intended) of what it means to be born again.  As born again believers, we have a new perspective on life, a new way of living, one oriented on loving God and loving others.One particular chapter I appreciated in this fine book is Wilson’s discussion of what it means to hunger after God.  This is another term we have all likely heard many times and even declared for ourselves as something we desire.  A mark of a real Christian is evidence of hungering and thirsting after righteousness – the things of God and God Himself.  Wilson rightly avers concerning what a hunger for God looks like in practice that “When it is fed, spiritual hunger doesn’t go away; it grows…Make it your ambition, then, to feed on God as much as possible.”  As we seek after God, we are told we will find Him.  When we find Him, we will desire more of His presence.  More of His presence means more of Him in our lives which in turn will reflect godliness in our lives that others can clearly see.Another helpful aspect of this book are the chapter resources provided at the conclusion of each chapter.  Wilson provides the reader with questions for reflection that will assist in digging deeper into the material covered in that particular chapter.  Additionally, he provides several passages of Scripture for further study as well as excellent resources.  These chapter resources make this book of great value for not only personal study, but also for use in a small group environment or a family Bible study setting.To be a true believer is to be a real Christian.  Authenticity in a world replete with fake spirituality is more important than ever.  I highly recommend this book for all believers all along the spectrum from the babe in Christ to the most seasoned in the faith.  We all need a reminder that faith without works is dead faith.  Wilson does an excellent job of encouraging the reader to seek after God so that He may be glorified in our lives and so that we may show a lost and hurting world the joy of serving our loving and gracious God.I received this book for free from Zondervan Academic for this review.

"The presence of God is both a widely misused and misunderstood term in theology.  Many attribute the God’s presence to some sort of warm fuzzy one gets if they do the right series of things or if they are perhaps somehow spiritual enough to warrant finding their way into the presence of God almighty.  Biblically speaking, the presence of God is far more than either of the aforementioned incorrect notions.  J. Ryan Lister, in his excellent book The Presence of God: It’s Place in the Storyline of Scripture and the Story of our Lives, examines from the pages of Scripture how this important topic relates to the scarlet thread of redemption, what God’ presence looked like in the Old and New Testaments, and how we as believers today should view our place in God’s grand story of redemption.As noted in the foreword to this timely book, the movement of salvation history is the goal of a return to that which was lost, namely the restoration and redemption of all things, the removal of the damage sin and death have caused, and perhaps most important, God’s people once again delighting in eternity spent in the presence of God.  These principal truths of Scripture are what Lister so rightly focuses his efforts on in his book.Lister aptly notes the phrase of the presence of God is used quite frequently in books, sermons, and conversation within the church.  With that said, do we really grasp what the presence of God is all about, both in relation to salvation history or in our daily lives?  Lister rests his discussion of the presence of God on two vastly important truths:  1) “the presence of God is a central goal in God’s redemptive mission”, and 2) “the presence of God is the agent by which the Lord accomplishes his redemption mission”.  Thus, this entire concept of the presence of God is at the same time both “eschatological (it is the end-of-time aim of the Lord’s mission) and instrumental (it is ultimately what fulfills the Lord’s mission)”.  This statement aptly captures the repeated now and not yet principle found throughout Scripture on a number of topics.  In relation to the presence of God, we experience it in part now as God works in history to move history towards that future state of redemption, when sin, the wicked, and death are forever dealt with and His people will again see Him face to face.Building on those two foundational elements, Lister presses forward to explore the presence of God as it is outlined in the Old and New Testaments.  To properly understand the movement of history, one has to grasp the beginning of the book and the end of the book, namely that which was, that which was lost, and that which will be regained.  Lister correctly begins his book by looking at those vital elements.  He saliently comments, “Eden is the pattern of the better Eden to come.  From an eschatological point of view, the garden of God was to be the seat of the worldwide expansion of God’s dwelling place.”  This movement of gaining that which was lost is reflected in the entire biblical drama and Lister spends the vast majority of his book exploring how the presence of God is revealed in Scripture in relation to salvation history.While this entire book is quite excellent and I truly appreciated the in-depth nature in which Lister digs into the topic of the presence of God, in particular his exegesis and analysis of the Old Testament, the section I found most helpful was his concluding comments on the practical application of the doctrine.  It is one thing to take a look at what God has been up to and quite another to begin to grasp how you as a member of the household of faith are currently playing a part in God’s divine plan to include how His presence works in our lives daily.  Lister correctly notes, “The Spirit – the presence of God in this new act of the redemptive drama – now dwells within us to culminate the objectives of the Lord for his glory and our resultant joy.”  The giving of the Holy Spirit as the first fruits promise of that future eternity in the presence of God is what “makes the Christian life possible.”  Furthermore, Lister rightly avers “The power of the Spirit is the power of redemption and regeneration, for it is by his work of applying Christ’s atonement to us that we are born again and reconciled to the Lord.”Those desiring an excellent biblical and practical theology of the presence of God should make Lister’s book a must read.  Full of sound exegesis and theological insight, this is a book that will provide the reader with a greater understanding of what the presence of God is all about and most importantly, the glorious future that awaits those who are the bride of Christ, the sons of God, those who have been called by God to spend eternity in His holy and wonderful presence.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

"Dietrich Bonhoeffer is quickly becoming a favorite author of mine.  He was a man who lived in a difficult and pivotal period of the 20th century, dealing first hand with the impact of the Nazi regime in Germany.  Bonhoeffer also saw the acquiescence of the German church to the policies of Hitler.  These and many other events helped to shape Bonhoeffer’s thoughts on the Christian life, specifically on matters of discipleship and what he so rightly labeled as the penchant for many believers to settle for cheap grace.  As part of the excellent Theologians on the Christian Life series, Stephen Nichols examines Bonhoeffer’s life and theology.I have become increasingly interested in the works of Bonhoeffer over the past year.  He was always a figure of church history I felt was a bit neglected.  Given that he was a man who personally dealt with tyranny and its impact on the church, he was of course well suited to speak to what it means to make a stand for matters of truth and to share from his own life thoughts on what being a disciple of Jesus is truly about.Stephen Nichols truly brings to life the underlying importance of Bonhoeffer and the important message he so rightly focused on declaring.  There is a perfect balance in Nichol’s book of exploring Bonhoeffer’s theology as well as digging into the life events that led Bonhoeffer to the positions he so often rooted his works upon.  While reading this book, I felt almost transported back to the period of history Bonhoeffer lived, as Nichols deft ability to draws the reader into both Bonhoeffer the man and Bonhoeffer the theologian.Bonhoeffer loved God first and foremost and closely following that passion for God was a love for the people of God.  Living in Nazi Germany and dealing with the daily choice that existed between succumbing to the will of the state or holding fast to the will of God led Bonhoeffer to coin that marvelous of theological phrases called cheap grace.  For Bonhoeffer, “discipleship means conforming to the image of Christ, which entails suffering.”  Such a concept is far too often lost in today’s search for material blessings.  I appreciated Nichol’s salient note that Bonhoeffer embraced suffering “not because he’s an incurable pessimist or an ascetic, but because suffering drives him to grace.”If you are even remotely interested in the life and theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, I highly recommend this book as a valuable entry point into his writings and thoughts.  Nichols does a superb job of capturing who Bonhoeffer was, how his theology was formed in the crucible of suffering, and why we should pay attention to his timeless words on issues such as discipleship, community, and the costliness of grace.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

"We all communicate each and every day in one form or another.  Since we are commanded in Scripture to always be prepared to give an account for the reason we believe, it behooves us to be capable communicators when sharing the hope that is within us, namely the message of the gospel.  What better place to study the art of gospel communication that from the words of Jesus.  Joe Carter and John Coleman in their helpful book How to Argue Like Jesus: Learning Persuasion from History’s Greatest Communicator, take a look at various methods of communication, reflecting on how Jesus utilized those methods as evidenced in Scripture.There is much to enjoy about this book and the approach taken by the authors.  The reader will have to engage a number of concepts and words that could be rather foreign to them initially; however, he authors do a great job of explaining the concepts the present to include examples of what the various elements of communication look like in practice as well as how they are used in Scripture.One thing that is quite noticeable is the authors engage Greek ways of argumentation throughout this book.  While it is certainly true that Jesus would have been familiar with the Greek approach to argumentation as evidenced in the Gospel accounts, Jesus also spoke and discussed points using many Jewish and Hebraic ways of thinking as well, an approach that is at times a bit different than how the Greeks would have reasoned through a concept.  Given his audience was mainly Jews and while that audience would have been familiar with Greek methodologies of thinking, it would have been good for the authors to engage a bit more with the Hebraic/Jewish way of reasoning, if anything as a point of comparison with Greek thought and to also engage those portions of the Gospels where such an approach occurs.The ability to identify for example syllogisms or logical statements within Scripture is something quite important.  Since Scripture is quite logical in how it presents it overall message, following the points God is making in His word in order to get to the underlying point as well as understanding what that underlying point is all about is truly one of the fundamental elements of sound exegesis.  Carter and Coleman do a great job of explaining what can be some very difficult philosophical and communication concepts.  I also appreciated the repeated caution provided by the authors concerning the use of the various concepts they present.  The misuse for example of the <em>reduction ad absurdum</em> can as the authors correctly note can lead to “unreasonable logical jumps, many of which involve so-called psychological continuums” that are highly unlikely.” If we are using Jesus’ words as an example of how to communicate, one must notice how he used these techniques, how far he took them, and why he employed them.One particularly helpful aspect of this book are the case studies included in the final chapter.  Case studies are typically helpful as they provide the means to put what one has learned into practice.  The authors have selected studies that identify the methodologies they have discussed throughout the book in real life situations.  After reading these case studies, the reader will definitely be better prepared to identify the methods of argumentation that Carter and Coleman have presented.  Additionally, if the reader takes the time to answer the questions the authors pose at the conclusion of each case study, they will be even more prepared to identify, employ, and correctly utilize for example, pathos, logos, ethos, or the plethora of other techniques discussed in this book as they share the message of the gospel or when they engage others in meaningful conversation, especially conversation related to matters of Scripture.This is a book I highly recommend for all believers.  Since we all should be actively engaging those around us with the message of the gospel and the truth of Scripture, understanding and utilizing the methods Jesus himself used is most certainly a good practice to find yourself involved.  While the title of this book is how to argue like Jesus, perhaps a better title is how to communicate effectively the truth of Scripture for that is the intent and the message the authors aptly get across to the reader.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

"Who is Jesus?  Seems like such an easy question.  He is the Son of God, he came and died on the cross and rose again, and will one day return for His bride.  But who is Jesus?  Do we really grasp this Messiah, this history altering figure?  Are we able to share with the world who Jesus is and why he is far more than just a moral teacher who lived a long time ago?  Pastor and author Greg Gilbert in his excellent book aptly titled <em>Who is Jesus</em> explores this simple yet truly profound question.There are some books that while small in length, nevertheless pack a giant punch.  Gilbert’s book very much fits into this category.  While at first glance and upon the first read the message relayed in this book may seem to be focused on those searching for an answer in relation to this Jesus character so many talk about, I firmly believe this is also a book that even the most seasoned believer needs to read.  After all, knowing Jesus is at the crux of what we call the Christian life.Gilbert rightly begins by noting there is “one massive treasure trove of information about Jesus – detailed, personal, eyewitness, blow-by-blow accounts of what he said, what he did, and who he was.”  Of course where we find that information is the Bible.  For those who might feel like closing this book at the mere mention of the word “Bible”, Gilbert encourages them to stick it out and to continue reading.  If nothing else, the accounts of Jesus’ life shared by the biblical authors were written as literal and actual history and thus should be considered along those lines.  Gilbert encourages the reader to simply take a look at the claims made in Scripture and to examine them to see if they are true.  If they are true, then the reader necessarily has to make an important decision as to what to do with Jesus and to answer that all important question of who is Jesus.Throughout this book, Gilbert makes the claim that Jesus was no ordinary man, that he is the King of Kings, the great “I AM”, was fully human, the last Adam, the Lamb of God who died for our sins, and the resurrected and reigning Lord.  These are certainly some bold claims in the mind of some who have not yet fully dealt with that underlying question of who is Jesus.  Gilbert recognizes that fact and with a great deal of patience and speaking from the heart of a pastor, he walks the reader through each important claim made in this book, proving along the way that Jesus is who he claimed to be.For instance, Jesus claimed to be the great “I AM”.  While such a claim may not seem that big of a deal to our modern ears, making the statement that one was the great “I AM” was in the eyes of the Jewish people stating you are God.  When God spoke to Moses way back in the book of Exodus, He told Moses to tell the people of Israel that “I AM” had sent Moses to deliver the people from bondage.  So to say you are equal with God was shall we say a rather bold statement.  Gilbert aptly comments, “if Jesus just wanted to say that he pre-existed Abraham somehow, he would have said, “Before Abraham was, I was.”  But by using the present tense – “I AM” – Jesus was clearly taking for himself, again, the unique and exclusive name of God.”  Thus, as God and being the Son of God, in order to know God and to have relationship with our Creator, we must know Jesus and affirm that Jesus is who he said he was – God.Gilbert also does an excellent job of working through the humanity of Jesus, something theologians call the hypostatic union – Jesus as fully God and fully man.  This is a rather deep theological concept and Gilbert expertly relates he truth of this issue to the reader devoid of technical terms, instead choosing to engage why this matters.  Why did Jesus need to become God incarnate? Simply yet profoundly, Gilbert states “Jesus became human because we needed him to do so.  We needed someone to represent us before God and be our substitute.  That’s ultimately why Jesus came- to be a loving Warrior King who would save his beloved people.”I highly recommend this book for those searching for the answer to who is Jesus and also for those who are long in the faith who want to refresh themselves on the answer to that question.  Jesus made some bold claims that must be dealt with and Gilbert does a great job of doing that very thing.  Those who are searching will be challenged and those who have longed affirmed Jesus as Lord will find this book a wonderful reminder of who Jesus is and why they are so in love with him.I received this book for free from Crossway Books for this review.

"There are times when I feel the urge to dig into what can easily be labeled as a “nerdy” book and there are some theological subjects that arguably deserve such an in-depth treatment.  Exploring the wisdom literature of Scripture as well as the extra-biblical writings that impacted Jewish and early Christian thought is one of those topics deserving of such a deep dive.  Ben Witherington, in his book Jesus the Sage: The Pilgrimage of Wisdom, walks the reader through the grand and important history of wisdom literature, how it flows throughout Scripture, and most importantly, why it is necessary for believers to spend time studying this subject matter.Let me first state this is a very scholarly book.  If you are looking for a quick overview of biblical and extra-biblical wisdom literature, you should look elsewhere.  Conversely, if you desire to take the time to work through this topic and are looking for a book that digs very deep into the various elements of wisdom literature, then this book is one you will want to explore.  Those not familiar with all the various aspects of wisdom literature and thought will, again if they take the time to digest the material Witherington presents, will find upon completing this book they have gained a great deal of important knowledge.  Ultimately, this is not a quick read but it is well worth the read.Witherington notes in the Preface that “This book…is not only about the pilgrimage of Wisdom but also about Jesus the sage as one who contributed to the growth and development of Jewish Wisdom and, for the community of his own followers, charted a course that they would follow in further developing Wisdom ideas and forms.”  As such, Witherington efforts to trace for the reader not just wisdom literature itself, but more importantly, how Jesus continued this wisdom tradition.Reading, understanding, and identifying wisdom literature is a pursuit that demands a great deal of effort.  Witherington reminds the reader of that important fact at the outset of this book.  With that said, those who again take the time to grasp what wisdom is all about and what it means to be wise, will find their efforts rewarded.  In an effort to break down this journey through wisdom literature, Witherington divides this book into two parts with the first part examining this genre from the period of Solomon to the time of Jesus and with part two looking at how wisdom literature was shaped from the time of Jesus to the period of the early church.For myself, the most interesting chapter was “Wisdom in Person: Jesus the Sage”.  Of particular interest was Witherington’s engagement of Jesus’ parables and aphorisms.  Jesus used the form of the parable to relay important theological truths to those who listened to his words.  As Witherington notes, this approach is indicative of how a sage would have chosen to instruct his followers.  He also suggests “It is also quite likely that Jesus was perceived to be some sort of sage by the part of his audience that was conversant with the world of Jewish Wisdom traditions.”  Witherington presents some very interesting thoughts on the manner by which Jesus presented his teaching, parables, and speeches, asserting they take the form of Jewish wisdom traditions, thoughts that will certainly require further examination given the sheer volume and specificity of information Witherington provides all throughout this book.Anyone desiring to further their breadth of understanding of Jewish wisdom literature and how it presents itself throughout Scripture to include the words of Jesus, should give this book a read.  As noted earlier, this is a very scholarly book and it will take the reader time and patience to dig into all the information Witherington provides.  I know I will be returning to this book in the future to examine various individual elements discussed throughout as I continue my own studies on wisdom literature.I received this book for free from Fortress Press for this review.

"There have been a number of books written lately about the ordinary Christian life.  Far too many have been pursuing what they perceive to be the extraordinary when in actuality, God has been and is calling His people to something that on the surface may seem ordinary, but in reality is actually more extraordinary than the flouted extraordinary so many are focused upon.  Tony Merida, in his helpful book, Ordinary: How to Turn the World Upside Down, explores from a biblical perspective what the ordinary Christian life is all about.Merida notes in the introduction how he came to realize what this ordinary Christian life is supposed to look like.  He pondered what arguably many others ponder when they read passages that speak of the poor and the widow, namely that of believing that focusing on such things steers one too close to liberal theological pursuits, specifically the social justice movement so often rooted in liberal thought.  The question one must answer is what does Scripture demand of us as God’s people?  Merida rightly proposes that “We need Christians focusing on ordinary Christianity – speaking up for the voiceless, caring for the single mom, restoring the broken, bearing burdens, welcoming the functionally fatherless, and speaking the good news to people on a regular basis in order to change the world.” After all, this is what is described as pure and undefiled religion.Not merely content to make what is certainly an outstanding theological statement, Merida walks the reader through the remainder of this book on the active part of what it means to be ordinary.  It is one thing to nod your head and affirm with your head that we are called to help those in need.  The true proof of our commitment is in our actions.  Merida provides the reader with a number of ways to demonstrate we are on the path towards the ordinary Christian walk.While each chapter is excellent, the point that touched my heart the most was Merida’s discussion of reaching out to the fatherless.  As the father of an adopted child, this issue is quite near and dear to my heart.  The number of children languishing in horrible situations around the world and even in our own country is staggering.  Victims of neglect, abuse, starvation, and even the most basis essentials of life, they are often passed by, pushed to the side by far too many as those who reject their needs pursue the chase for the gold at the end of the rainbow.  Merida aptly comments that the “trio of the vulnerable – the orphan, widow, and sojourner – receive special attention in the Old Testament.”  In that period of history and still today, those individuals were among the most “helpless members of society.”  God commanded, not suggested but commanded His people to take care of those in need.  God became very angry with His people when they neglected those in need.  Merida also correctly notes that the New Testament presents this same theme.  As noted earlier, James wrote that pure and undefiled religion is “to visit orphans and widows in their affliction…”  Merida wonderfully reminds the reader that to visit is to actively and physically care and is not relegated to mailing a check as if that covers our religious duty.This chapter, along with all the others for that matter, is a needed call to action.  It is a call to do the ordinary things that truly must define who we are as the people of God.  While such pursuits may not bring attention to ourselves or seem like they are making an impact in a world so full of problems, if we are doing the ordinary, we are being obedient to God’s Word.  Merida saliently comments that as we long for the day when all things are made new, “we find hope and power to do justice in this present world.”I highly recommend this book for all believers.  Merida shares from a heart of compassion and from the perspective of an individual who is putting his practice what he is preaching in this book.  If you read this book, you will find yourself challenged and your paradigm shifted.  I trust that you will take heart what Merida is sharing for it is biblically sound.  This world is full of people crying out for help.  Will you be God’s hands to those in need?  Will you be the ordinary person God is calling you to be?I received this book for free from B&H Books for this review. I was not required to write a positive review.

"What is worship?  Is it just the raising of our voices in song during a church service or gathering of believers or is worship far more than just a once or twice a week occurrence?  If worship is more than just singing songs, then what does Scripture say about what praising almighty God is all about, not just from a theological angle, but also as part of our everyday practice?  Timothy Pierce, in his excellent book on worship titled Enthroned on Our Praise: An Old Testament Theology of Worship, takes the reader on an in-depth journey to what God has outlined in the Old Testament regarding what He expects worship to look like in our lives.This book is part of the excellent New American Commentary Studies in Bible & Theology and as such, continues the strong tradition found in this series of salient biblical scholarship and most importantly, the applicability of the subject at hand to the Christian walk.  Pierce aptly notes, “A fundamental thirst has awakened in people to recognize someone who is bigger than they are, to relate to Him in a personal way and to experience community with like-minded individuals in the process.”  This yearning demonstrates that many are realizing what we were created for, namely to glorify God and to have relationship with our Creator.  An integral part of glorifying God and having that needed personal and intimate relationship with God is through the act of worship.One may ask why Pierce does not provide a theology of worship that engages both Old and New Testaments.  He answers this question by aptly commenting, “it can instill, in some small way, a greater appreciation of the OT in the hearts and minds of today’s church leaders.”  Second, Pierce correctly states “the God of the OT is the same God we serve today.  The OT presentation of His story transmits a relational vividness and attitude that fills in the gaps about who He is and what He desires in ways that even the NT writers themselves appreciated and recognized.”  Essentially, Pierce is reminding the reader and the body of Christ at large that to understand worship and to have a cogent and holistic perspective on this aspect of relationship with our Creator, we had best begin with the front of the book and the foundation on worship it presents.Pierce rightly begins his treatise on worship with the act of creation, discussing all the various elements subsumed in that act that relate to our worship and relationship with our Creator.  This is the very foundation of Scripture, namely the reality that “the primary relationship of God to humanity expresses a connectedness that is both patent and unexpected.”  As one journeys through Scripture, they find that which Pierce so expertly states, the fact that “it is this relationship that defines the direction of history and theology.  And it is this relationship that moves the tension of the narratives.”The salient discussion of worship is next directed at the Pentateuch, followed by an examination of worship in the writings of the prophets, both former and later, and finally Pierce engages the beautiful prose of worship found in the writings such as the book of Psalms, a book truly replete with songs extolling the majesty of God and demonstrating this repeated pattern and concept of man’s relationship to his Creator.While many may gravitate towards the section on the Writings and their commentary on worship, I was actually most drawn to Pierce’s analysis of worship within the Pentateuch.  I think far too often the manner in which God expressed and demanded He be worshiped through the various sacrifices and for instance the Sabbath are often overlooked as something completely irrelevant and unrelated to our lives today as believers.  After all, we do not conduct animal sacrifices anymore and who wants to get into that argument over when the Sabbath should be observed.  Much can be learned in relation to the needed element of relationship in regards to worship by examining God’s commands regarding Sabbath rest.  As Pierce so aptly states, “What is so intriguing about sacred times is that not only is God’s activity sanctified and descriptive of a relationship, but so is His rest.  There is nothing about Him that does not call humanity to a recognition of His presence and, therefore, to their need to worship Him.”  Understanding the purpose and focus of the Sabbath, as Pierce again so brilliantly comments is fact that “the Sabbath pulls humanity out of its self-interest and striving.”  Conversely, it focuses the created on the Creator in an attitude of humility, dependence, and worship.Those desiring to understand what the OT has to say about worship and why it is important should most certainly pick up this book and give it a thorough read.  I highly recommend it for all believers who desire to grow closer to their Creator.  Since we should all have that desire, then that means this book is for everyone to consider.  Pierce rightly focuses his attention on the front of the book, building that necessary foundation for those wanting to them explore what the NT has to say on worship.  Those who take the time to examine the many truths Pierce explores in this book will find themselves better focused on worshiping God and understanding why worship is a foundation for relationship with their Creator.I received this book for free from B&H Academic for this review.

"I  have been using Calmoseptine for venous stasis ulceration, but decided to give this a try given the good reviews it got.  I now use it almost exclusively for my ulceration and any little cuts and nicks.  Very nice orangey smell.  Effective moisturizer as well as healing properties.  It is not as thick as Calmoseptine which I like a lot.  It goes on easily and it is easier to get this off my hands. since it is not so dense.  Washes off quickly with a a pad and some mineral oil.  Because it is not so dense I find a tube lasts longer than with the Calmoseptine.  Actually, I am very happy with the Remedy line.

"I read the reviews and was unsure about buying this rug, but in the end I did.  It is a good looking rug that is muted enough color wise to not clash with other carpeting, but at the same time the colors are energetic enough to make a statement in a hallway.  One reviewer felt that colors were not well represented by the Amazon picture, that it was darker than expected.  On the contrary, I found the colors were just a slight bit brighter than the picture.  The size is good for a hallway as it does not overwhelm or dominate but rather pulls things together.  I just put it down on the floor and did not find any strong chemical odors.  The wrinkles will disappear as the rug settles on the floor.  All in all this is a quite nice rug, especially for the price.  It feels comfortable.  It needs a grab pad underneath since it has no texturing on the back, but I am pleased by that as those rubbery backings tend to curdle and come apart over time. I like that it is washable.

"This is by far the greatest product I have ever bought for the kitchen.  It's not pretty:  in fact, it is rather homely and squat.  The color choices are limited.  But if you have a single tub sink like I do it is a real treasure.  It is neither too large nor too small at 12.2 x 12 x 8 inches.  There is plenty of space beside the tub for rinsing what you wash.  Just set it in the sink, close  its built in drain/stopper, add soap and hot water and you are going to get those dishes done with the least trouble and the most efficiency possible.  No more worry about overflow or poorly rinsed dishes.  No more scraps going down the pipe.  This baby has an ingenious drop in stopper/drain that is trouble-free and will never break or get stuck.  It just sits in place and does its job.  The pan itself is sturdy with grab bars on two sides so it is easy to maneuver.  My husband and I are both in awe of this great dishpan.

"Right off the bat, I like the book. It introduces you to all the tools, both necessary and ""nice to have"". You learn what to get, how to shop wisely, and how to use them (of course). This takes up quite a few chapters. Then you get down to business. You learn about electronic components and what things are likely to go wrong in the devices you are most likely to come across. With this knowledge, electronic devices become comprehensible equipment instead of mystery boxes. That's what I like. I like to learn about things. I like to take the mystery out of things.Now for the bad, which has nothing to do with the book. The bad thing is that acquiring all the necessary, and a good chunk of the ""cool"" tools, will run into the thousands. You also have to have a dedicated work area, so if you are short on space already... Finally, it takes time to troubleshoot and repair things. If you are retired, no problem. But if you have to make a living, it will be much cheaper and easier to have someone do the repair for you or just buy a whole new item (depending on the problem).If you get satisfaction from learning and tinkering, get this book. If you are curious about this sort of thing, but can't afford the tools, space, or time, you might get the book anyway to learn what you can. If you just want to ""save money"" by doing your own repair work, I'd say do it the easy way.

A tell tale sign is that my coffee mug at work, feels warm on the outside when the coffee is inside.

I worry less about it slipping off a table or other slightly inclined surface.Provided it is the size you are looking for, this is a quality bag that will not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSABI26ZB77J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRGE#wasThisHelpful","R1WSABI26ZB77J","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very pleased to find out that the author of this book is a Red Hat heavy weight. I'm studying for the entry-level RHEL exam - the RHCSA. I use a book that was created specifically for the exam, but I supplement it with other books. One advantage is when you need something explained another way, usually because you aren't quite getting it. This book serves, as the title suggests, as a comprehensive tutorial resource. The only downside (for me), is that it is not specifically for the RHCSA. I wish that it were, because it is easier to read than my exam prep book. No technobabble, and the coverage of Linux ""need to know"" material is good.As a reference book, this is the one I am going to reach for. I reach for the most easily understood resource, and consult others only if the info I seek is not in my primary source.In short, if you want to have a solid handle on Linux, make sure this book is on your shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKD2B9F1ZQ11O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118999878#wasThisHelpful","RKD2B9F1ZQ11O","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a critical thinker by nature, but I have a friend who definitely is not. I've been trying to find a good book or two to help him out. Goodness knows, I've tried to help him. He's not that thick, but a book that gets right to the heart of the problem, just short of being terse, is what he could use. It would ""give him the answers"" and allow him to review them when needed.This book covers the bases, but it's far too wordy. There are quotes and sidebars galore, which I found to serve mainly as distractions. Every now and then, I'd come across some ""basics"" of critical thinking. But the journey getting there was long. Much of the information in the book is nice to know, but if you threw it out, the book would be much better.Just so you know what I'm talking about when I say ""basics"", here are a few which the author covers:Analogy: The ability to draw accurate analogies to the problem at hand is important. Making good analogies and recognizing bad ones is a great tool.Thought experiments: Einstein did this often. It is the ability to visualize a realistic scenario to mentally test things that you are unable to test in the real world, either because you lack the time or the means.Logic and Logical Fallacies: In layman's terms, this is how to think in way that produces correct results while avoiding mental pitfalls.I believe that the book would be much better if the author cut out all the ""conversation"" and just explained the tools of critical thinking and how and when to use them. He knows what he's talking about but he takes a long time getting to what really matters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PN4VFCDHPGB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111892472X#wasThisHelpful","R3PN4VFCDHPGB5","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air cleaner is just what I need for a small space, like my workroom. In addition to a pre-filter and HEPA filter, it has a UV-C light which can be turned on or off independently of the air filter. The UV-C light kills or neutralizes biologicals - airborne germs. However, as you might expect, if the air filter is off, the UV-C is off, as there is no air for it to ""process"".The unit looks nice, like an audio speaker. The air flow is to one side instead of straight outward.The instructions are simple to understand, and even if you are the type to not read instructions, it is easy to figure out.

"I didn't notice any change in the way things smelled, so I can't say if it was doing a good job of ridding the air of odors. But then, maybe my nose just isn't all that sensitive. Also, if my place smelled bad, I would do something about it way before getting a UV-C device. There are two other factors to consider. One is the sound that the fan makes and is the reason I gave it 4 stars. It's at the threshold, where I don't mind it, but I know that some people who are noise sensitive, might think it was on the loud side. The other thing to consider is if UV-C really does kill or neutralize airborne biological threats. I did my research, and it does.This unit is small and unobtrusive.

"When sprayed on weeds that are growing in an established lawn, does this in fact kill only the weeds and leave the lawn? I can only tell you what happened to the weeds on my lawn. I have just a few varieties of weeds that try to creep into my lawn. I was surprised to find the next day, that in fact, the weeds were well on their way to dying. Their leaves were already brown and dead-looking. The reason for 4 stars is because the grass also was negatively affected, showing the same signs, but to a much lesser degree. However, I am fairly certain that the grass will spring back. It seems that whatever the active ingredient is, it affects grass to a much lesser degree. That's actually what I expected.

"It's Roundup, which means that it does its job of systemic plant killing the same as it always has. The difference is the delivery. I normally purchase Roundup in a concentrate. I have to put it in a pump sprayer and dilute it properly before I can use it. I also have to wash the vessel that I used to measure it. I also have to estimate exactly how much I need so I don't run out and have to mix more, or don't end up with excess that sits there for a long time.This type of packaging is different. The emphasis is on convenience. It's a strong plastic container with a sturdy handle and the Roundup does not need dilution. It didn't come with any instructions, so I wasn't sure how to connect the pump device to the cap. The only thing I could do was ""plug it in"". You'll know what that means when you get it. Fortunately, that is the correct way to do it. Tubing that is inside the spray handle comes out and what you have is a spray handle/nozzle attached via tubing, to the cap. It was a simple click and go procedure. The tubing allows you the freedom to maneuver the spray handle any way you wish, and carry the main bottle in your other hand. Ingenius design.Of course, with no instructions, I started spraying right away. Nothing came out, but it took only a second to realize that the end of the spray nozzle has four positions, two of them are ""off"" positions, one creates a foam, and the other squirts out the product in a stream. When done, I close the nozzle, and ""shutoff"" the cap valve. You'll know what that means when you see it.So, this method of delivery is very convenient. You snap the nozzle onto the cap, select foam or stream, and close up when done. No measuring or mixing. Very handy and highly recommended for jobs where economy isn't a big concern. The convenience pays for itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VB8CGN2O51BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZNI2A#wasThisHelpful","R1VB8CGN2O51BZ","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A lot of research must have gone into this book. It is concise and yet complete. Any details you might want to fill in can easily be gleaned from the Internet. However, that is not to say that this book is lacking. As you read about one region to the next, you come across the familiar things like places to eat, and places to bunk for the night. In addition to the basics, it describes places of interest, things to be careful of, etc..I would have been slightly disappointed if it just used the format I was speaking of. But it goes beyond that. It discusses things like climate concerns throughout the year, where you should go if you like to do certain things (mountain biking, going on food safaris, fishing, or what have you), and it even describes California culture(s) that you can expect to come across.If you've had any interest in visiting California and you want to know what there is to see and do, this is an excellent place to start.

"I like this thing. I have a number of bluetooth speakers, and they are all different, but this one is pleasingly unique in that it is meant to withstand shocks and is waterproof. It is rated to withstand being submersed 1 meter deep for 30 minutes. But don't go swimming with it, or show off by using it under water. Using it in an environment where it may get splashed, or might temporarily fall into the water is probably fine. It has grippy rubber feet, which is great, because I intend to put it on my dashboard. Also, the rubberized exterior not only helps with shock resistance, it also keeps other things from being damaged should this speaker make contact with them. In other words, if it falls off my dashboard while I turn the corner, it might bounce off another part of my car, but it should not do any damage in addition to not being damaged itself.I like how it powers up and down. You hold the power button for a while and it generates a low, vibrating tone that sounds like a ""boing"". It makes a thumping noise when you turn it off. There is no mistaking whether you have turned it on or off.The sound isn't going to measure up to say, a Bose speaker, but to my untrained ear, it sounds great.Don't forget that this speaker has a USB port to charge your electronic devices.

You apply it, let it sit for about 5 minutes, and then buff in a good shine. Going on, it was like any other liquid wax product - it went on easily.

"I use this baby for two specific things. They are the only things I tested it for, but I'm glad to report that it does them both well.Before I begin, I really like two ""features"". The first one is that it is less than half the thickness of my Epson photo scanner. That's probably because it doesn't do as much. It specializes (in my opinion), in document and photo scanning. The other feature is that it gets its power from USB, unlike my Epson, which requires an external power source. That once again, is probably because the Epson is more sophisticated hardware-wise (and software-wise to boot).This is a minimalist device pared down to meet the bulk of my needs 99% of the time.I now archive important documents electronically - things like receipts, confirmations, legal stuff, etc.. For example, when I received a letter confirming that my loan had been paid off, I scanned it to a PDF, and stored in a backed-up electronic form. Then I shredded the original. I did the same for a police collision report when a tourist rear-ended me an intersection. It was very handy to email the PDF to the insurance companies.The scanner is very simple to use. My Epson, while more ""powerful"", is equally more complicated and confusing when it comes the all the settings you have to choose from. This scanner and its software is pretty much ""click and done"". If I have to choose between my Epson and this to scan just about any document, it's this one hands down.When it comes to photos, I can't knock it. It's considerably easier to use than the Epson. Just remember that the Epson will allow you to do much more. I really like that you just plop the picture down and push the button. However, this scanner cannot ""fix"" old or damaged photos nearly as well as the Epson. No contest. Epson wins in the photo restoration category. If I were to scan a photo just for illustration purposes, say to email to someone, I'd reach for this scanner. But almost all of my photo scans are of all the prints I have collected over the years. Many of them are faded, damaged, etc.. The Epson does a good job of correcting damage (scratches, creases, etc.), and restoring faded photos to what looks close to their original colors.If you want to scan documents for archiving or sending via email, this is a great scanner. For photos that don't need correcting, it's just as terrific.Its size and ability to draw power from USB make it very portable compared to my Epson. In fact, to save space on my desk, I keep this scanner on my shelf and pop it down only when I need it - because it's very easy to do. I keep the Epson connected all the time, because it's considerably bigger and fussing with the power supply cable and the USB cable is a headache.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XDFSO2IVTPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN0NUOO#wasThisHelpful","R18XDFSO2IVTPL","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First the good. I think that this type of book is great for getting kids interested in reading ""chapter books"". The illustrations are funny-looking (that's good), the story is lighthearted, and there are built-in amusements (two frame crude animations, for lack of a better term). So we have a great formula here.But here's where it falls short of its potential:I loved Mad Magazine as a kid. It was zany but easy to understand and follow. This book is zany, but difficult to follow. Also there is a good amount of humor that I would not expect children to understand. For example, the name Miss Anthrope. A kid would think it was just a meaningless zany name. One who understands the ""punny"" name would probably not find it funny. I found it mildly funny. There is also adult humor (no, not that kind). That is to say, humor that only an adult *might* find funny, simply because they can understand the zaniness. I'm referring specifically to such things as the mention of biological concepts (lipids, RNA, etc.) that would likely be understood only by advanced high school students or college students taking introductory biology classes. As a kid, I could appreciate zaniness only when I understood it. I still don't laugh at quantum mechanics jokes.In addition to things that go over a kid's head, there is the story itself. Now this is a toss up. Some kids might like stories that are just jam packed with off the wall zaniness. I don't. Even as a kid, I would enjoy it much better if the story relied more on funny situations for laughs.This style of book has great potential. I think funny illustrations of funny situations would knock the ball out of the park.While the book in its current form, misses the mark for me, if you are the type of person who likes my general description of the contents of the book, by all means, buy a copy to ""test it out"". Taste in humor is sometimes like taste in music - unexplainable from one person to the next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQXXCU18Q0X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545504902#wasThisHelpful","RRQXXCU18Q0X8","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is very easy to set up. You charge it until the blinking light becomes steady, you adorn it with one of the many stickers that comes with it (you can change them later), and you pop the head on and go. That's it!What makes this for kids, are the brushing modes. There is a high for more ""experienced"" kids. In high mode, not only is the brushing more vigorous, but it makes a congratulatory sound and shuts off after the 2 minutes recommended brushing time. In the low mode, brushing is finished after one minute. Over time, in low mode, the completion time increases to 2 minutes.Each 1/4 division of the full brushing time is marked by a series of reminder tones. It reminds the child to switch to a different quadrant of the mouth. Finally, there is a default easy-start feature which gradually increases the brushing power over the first 14 brushings. This can be disabled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YDQ3RVYFMC1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB3X868#wasThisHelpful","R1YDQ3RVYFMC1H","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love non-fiction books. I take pride in building a personal library covering useful topics. As for back as I can remember, the Middle East has been in the news. I finally decided to look into what the Middle East is all about. What I wanted was a book that gives the general background of the region without going into hair-splitting detail. I wanted to also learn a little about each country that is considered to be part of the Middle East. This book delivers.The first sections describe the general geography and history of the region. It covers petroleum and the economy, water (an important resource), international boundaries, and transboundary issues.It then gives statistics and current issues of each state in the region, very much like a compact encyclopedia might. Finally, it covers key issues like war, politics, and hot zones.Now when I read or hear about what's happening in the Middle East, I have a good picture of the true dynamics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYYD16S6ORYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415680964#wasThisHelpful","R1OYYD16S6ORYH","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't know such devices existed. There is also one for lemons. The lemon tool is larger. The enamel coated metal looks good and feels substantial. I chose the largest lime I could find to test this product. When I got home, I placed the lime into the tool and it didn't seem to fit. However, after cutting it in half, it fit perfectly. Squeezing the lime was simple. No problems.With a background in mechanical engineering, I would like to advise you not to try to squeeze the life out of your limes.

"It came well packaged, each component individually wrapped in plastic and surrounded by cardboard. There are four pieces - the wheel, 2 handles, and a cylindrical steel connector for the two handles. Assembly couldn't have been more simple. You just click the connector onto one handle, pass the connector through the wheel, and click on the other connector.It's made of strong materials and the double-width wheel is more stable than a single wheel. The downward slant of the handles makes gripping it noticeably more comfortable. I tried simulating a non-slanting handle and it was less comfortable. Just for kicks, I turned the handles up-side-down and that was REALLY uncomfortable. Ha. The downward slant is not just cosmetic or aesthetic.It didn't roll easily at first, so I disassembled it and lubricated the steel connector, which is what the wheel rotates against. That did the trick.Pay attention to the warning sticker. It basically says this thing, misused, can cause serious injury.How did it work? Just great.

"Who would have thought such a toy would make me smile so broadly? First let me gripe. It comes in tricky packaging that is not easy to open. There are two plastic parts that fasten the base to the plastic packaging. At first I tried to forcefully remove it from the packaging. When a respectable amount of force did not free the base from the plastic packaging, I knew that I was either going to end up breaking it, or I would have to be patient. I chose patience. I carefully tore away until I exposed instructions (on the fasteners) on how to remove the plastic fasteners. That was an annoying exercise.I read the instructions because it's not obvious how to charge and operate it. Having successfully charged it, I launched it and watched it fly right up to the ceiling. I climbed a step stool and pulled it down by the legs. It flew right back up to the ceiling as I expected. I pulled it back down again and played with it like a basketball. I put my hand on the head to keep it from flying to the ceiling. It didn't take long to learn how to push it down toward the ground and watch it fly back up. I stopped it from rising with my palm and sent it down again - over and over. It was fun.Even more entertaining was watching my dogs react to it. They wanted to play with it but were afraid of it at the same time. They kept their distance but watched it with such intensity. Dogs are really intrigued by flying objects in the house.If the rotors strike anything, the whole thing will come to a crashing stop. I suppose it's designed to do that.I would not let young children play with this. I wouldn't even let my dogs get near this. If the main rotor (used for lift) were to strike an eye, it would certainly do serious damage. Even if I let older children play with it, I would either be there with them, have a great deal of trust in them, or make them wear eye protection. It's not that this thing is so dangerous. It's that eyes are not replaceable.Now that I've scared everyone, I think if you just be careful and prudent, you will have loads of fun until the novelty wears off. It still makes a nice decoration just ""parked"" in its base. And every now and then, you can let 'er rip as you smile ear to ear.I've got to get this for my nieces.Oh by the way, the instructions clearly say to use indoors only. If you use it outdoors, since there is nothing to stop it, it is very likely to fly away - for good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BHBI2BD774GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRXJ3ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1BHBI2BD774GW","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good case for my Nikon 70-200mm VRII. I usually don't store my lenses in cases, but that baby is expensive, so I always keep it in a special case that is made for a camera fitted with the lens. When I am using my camera (Nikon D7000) with other lenses, my 70-200 stays in the case built for both. It's not a snug fit.This camera fits my 70-200 perfectly, with the hood on. I will now store my lens in this case and use the other case only when I need to already have it on the camera. This case is sturdy, comes with a strap AND a handle, and is padded on the side that would touch your body when carrying it with the strap. It has two side pockets, one carrying the rain hood. I suspect that Case Logic designed this to carry 70-200 lenses, which are expensive no matter the manufacturer.When you open the case, a special pouch-like compartment opens up. It is part of the lid. From viewing a few pictures, it seems that the compartment is for holding the lens that you are going to swap out for the 70-200. I'm not sure (even now). There was no YouTube video that showed how to use the pouch, and the video that comes with Amazon's product page, is for an entirely different Case Logic case. I can think of no practical use for the pouch, but that's just me (and the way I like to change my lenses, no doubt). Having a seemingly non-functional part is not any reason to downgrade the review. I just consider an extra part that I may use someday.Cases are like tripods. I buy too many and end up only using the ones I should have bought in the first place. This case is in the ""should have bought in the first place"" category. Buy this one first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HP3TXF9DZYJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYRZ94#wasThisHelpful","R3HP3TXF9DZYJO","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I wish a book like this existed for all of my interests. It is exactly what the title says: The definitive visual history of photography.It thoroughly covers the subject of photography from its humble beginnings - from the time people observed projected images but were not yet able to capture them, all the way to the modern day (cell phone cameras, etc.). It is full of photographs that illustrate concepts, demonstrate techniques, are iconic, etc.. It covers notable photographers and notable cameras - the ones who or which made their marks on the history of photography. It also covers, among many other things, how photography played a part in various historical events (war, etc.).This is no coffee table book that one picks up for light reading. It is almost 500 pages and jam packed with photos and information.

All the caddies I've had in the past were not, so I had to awkwardly drape the hose off to one side or in the front. This feature was an unexpected plus.

"My copy came without the required serial number and product key. They weren't anywhere on the packaging, nor were they on the CD. The only other place to find them would be via an online purchase confirmation. There was no online purchase confirmation.Note: After quite a snafu, things were finally sorted out when Amazon sent me the proper codes to activate the software. Someone dropped the ball, but as long as it was all sorted out, I'm proceeding without bias against the product.I'm coming from the standpoint of a user who wants to learn how to draw. I understand that in the digital art industry, Photoshop reigns supreme. My guess is that it has much to do with the popularity of Photoshop. For now anyway, SB Pro 7 is much easier to learn and use. That's critical for someone who wants to focus on learning to draw, and not getting bogged down learning how to use software. I subscribe to Photoshop CC, so I'm very current. I have used Photoshop to construct a book cover, but that did not involve any drawing.When I gave equal time to using both Photoshop and SBP 7, I found myself learning much more quickly with SB7. It has a much simpler interface, which undoubtedly has to do with it being designed for sketching and painting as opposed to also working with photos and such.In addition to having often-used tools in reasonably handy places, SB7 also has layer functionality that either didn't exist before (I own SBP 6, but did not work with it much), or greatly improved layering ability. This moves it into the company of the biggies, like Photoshop. Although I haven't used them yet, I was pleased to find line construction tools (perspective, etc.). These did not exist in prior versions, and even if you are just planning to draw cartoons, you will find them very handy.The software loads up quickly and there no drawing lag that I can detect.Having learned it much more quickly than Photoshop, I will stick with SB7 until or unless I find that it falls short in a critical area. I don't foresee that happening any time soon, if at all. I must still force myself to learn Photoshop to work with photographs, but as of right now, I can whip out drawings much more quickly with SB7.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FAYG8DJECXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI95DNG#wasThisHelpful","R14FAYG8DJECXL","A9ELHLPXF7JKD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ELHLPXF7JKD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog Kuchen (pronounced koochen; meaning cupcake in German) loves any sort of toy that squeaks, and she also loves to play fetch. So when I saw this toy I knew it would be a good idea for her. The only thing I was concerned about was the fact that it says it suits small dogs better. However, I have had no issues with my dog chewing the toy up. I would recommend if you do have a chewer though to use your own judgement on purchasing the toy. However, its going to take some serious chewing to tare it up in my opinion.My dog loves the toy and plays with it hours upon hours, until I'm tired out! haha. She loves the squeaking sound and is fascinated by it. It's a little different than regular squeaky toys as it sounds more like a duck, but I rather prefer it and think it is a little less annoying than a regular squeaky toy.My dog hasn't quite figured out how to get the treats out, but I have high hopes that she will figure it out over time once the newness of the toy wears off (so she can smell it better). I also plan to try some more potent treats that I know she will want to get to.

It is super soft, and I haven't had any bristles come out which is a great sign so far. It also creates a great lather while shaving. It is very easy to maintain, and while I would recommend using a sleeve to put over the brush when drying to prolong the use of the brush, it isn't an absolute must as it does well at maintaining its shape.

"I love this heated bag sealer! It took me a few minutes to get the hang of it (simply because I was a little nervous), but once I did it worked wonderfully. It does a great job at heating and sealing any style of bag. I tried several different chip bags and various food items, and never had a problem once with it sealing. My chips or whatever food item I am eating at the time taste so much fresher than just putting a regular clip on it. It really does seal in the freshness and makes food last a lot longer.I also like that when I am done using it, I can just put it on the fridge once I am done (since it has a magnet on the back). I also like that there is a safety you can put on, this is very convenient just in case I am babysitting I don't have to worry about a kid grabbing it and getting burned.My only complaint with the heated bag sealer is that it says on the front of the box that it includes batteries, however I didn't have any batteries in mine.

"I have tried an item very similar before, however none as good or that have as many as these for the price. It is an amazing deal, and you get 6 full sheets. I like that these have not only gold and silver tattoos, but some blue/turquoise ones as well. These were new to me so, I wasn't sure how they would do compared to the gold and silver, but are now my favorite ones.These are great for all ages, but I like to say they are temporary tattoos for adults because they have a really high quality. So much so that last time I wore one, my mom thought that it was a real necklace. Another great thing about these is that even if you buy them twice it leaves room for creativity, giving you a different look each time.I also appreciate the fact that they are very easy to remove. I use just a little bit of olive oil directly on the tattoo, and it cleans off completely within a few minutes. If you are worried about possibly having an allergy from them, I will say I have very sensitive skin and they don't bother me at all. When in doubt do an allergy test, before using a whole one.They sell these all over Amazon, so it may be confusing about which ones to buy.

"I love that this shampoo is not only paraben free but sulfate free as well. It does a really great job at getting a nice deep down clean, without stripping my hair. I color my hair as well as use a straightener quite frequently, so I have a lot of factors against me. However, using this shampoo I now don't have to worry nearly as much. This shampoo really helps to strengthen my hair.I also like the smell of the shampoo to me it has more of an Argan Oil smell. It is also neutral enough, so that if my husband wanted to use it he could as it is not too ""flowery.""It is definitely a must-have sort of shampoo for the upcoming summer months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHNNOOTJINI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R43QAJ6#wasThisHelpful","RPHNNOOTJINI8","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog absolutely is crazy over these, so much so that I am about to order some more after I run out. I'm not quite sure why she likes them so much, but I think its great! Not only that but they look fresh, and I love the resealable bag. I also like that it's not just a bunch of chicken jerky crumbs, but rather big pieces. I have a German Shepard, but little dogs could eat these too as you can break the pieces easily if need be. Each bag also has a good amount in them, instead of just a few pieces like most dog jerky treats I have bought in the past  I also appreciate thee fact they have no fillers and are made in the US. I would love to see some sort of Peanut Butter treats (because this is her favorite flavor) from this company, and would highly recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2LQ87ZPTRCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQYQHEY#wasThisHelpful","R1N2LQ87ZPTRCP","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this makeup brush combo. It is the perfect foundation brush. The sponge on one side and the brush on the other. It is a lot more convenient than pulling out two brushes, and I can really appreciate the design of it. The quality of the brush is really amazing as well. It has never once lost bristles on me nor has the sponge had any flaws. It also puts and blends makeup with ease.

"I have a lot of great things to say about this tent, and then the one reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. This tent is roomy and very well made. The fabric is thick and doesn't tear easily. I love the windows so that you can look out, and I especially love the ""draw bridge"" door that ties up. Someone really put a lot of thought into how it should look, which I love!The reason it gets 4 stars from me though is because of how you put it together. If I wasn't a 5""4 small girl instead of say a 6"" 0 man like I am sure some that are buying this, I probably wouldn't have been able to put it together quite as nice. I actually had to get my mother to hold the tent up while I climbed inside to put the poles in that keeps the tent up. You put one end in a tiny hole, tie the pole with ties about half way up, and then it snuggly ends at the top of the tent. The design in this sense was just really off, as well as frustrating.However, once I got the tent up it was beautiful. It hasn't once fell or came apart. I would still recommend it, but the flawed design is something to consider when purchasing. Just know its beautiful, but you have to be very patient with it. I originally bought this at a discount for two underprivileged boys my mom keeps a lot who are 6 and 10. They both really enjoy it, and I would recommend it for all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B50JNM0ODKFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH7ZNQO#wasThisHelpful","R3B50JNM0ODKFF","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mariko's Scarf Hangers are beautiful, glamorous, and just an all around great alternative than just throwing your scarfs on the back of the couch like I have shamelessly been doing! In each package you get three beautiful hangers, tied (just like you see above) with a beautiful black ribbon. Ready for you to untie just like it was a present meant for only you. I love the presentation of each box, and the hangers themselves are even more amazing in person. There are literally so many different ways you can use these hangers. You can loop them over like you see above, tie each one to make sections, or tie it around the hanger to show it off. Creativity is in your court, and you have the ball.You can put one on each hanger or you can stack 10 on a hanger (I have done this, and it works!). They are beautiful and timeless. They have a very sturdy chrome frame, don't snag one bit, and are very lightweight. However, not so lightweight that they damage easily. They fit and hang easily in my closet. I also absolutely love the bead work, it makes them look as each one is home made (in a good way!). I would absolutely recommend these beautiful hangers, and plan on purchasing more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BUM3J2MHMQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4NJ7T2#wasThisHelpful","R31BUM3J2MHMQA","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very cute book! If you like knock knock jokes & yo mamma jokes, then you will enjoy this book. It has two sections with plenty of jokes that will keep you amused and have you thinking about it for hours after you read. I think the author definitely has a passion for writing jokes, and I think that shows through in this book. There were some knock knock jokes I have heard before, but most of them I had never heard of.  I thought for the type of jokes they were, they were clean and classy yet humorous. Then the yo momma jokes was the best part, it included each type from yo mama is so fat - to yo moma is so stupid jokes, and everything in between. I would highly recommend this book if your looking for a nice light read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M4DNJQ590ICM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYOMP6A#wasThisHelpful","R3M4DNJQ590ICM","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received the Niapads, I was like wow, this is a small sample. Little did I realize inside it contains 30 pads. Now that's more like it (guess I should've read that on the back!). Immediately, I noticed the refreshing yet light Lavender smell of the pads. I had a couple of areas that needed clearing up, so I decided to try it on my whole face. Now, if you are using it for just a pimple or a couple of pimples than it's plenty big. However, just me personally I would of preferred a little bigger pad.I then proceeded to put it on my face, and left it on for about 30 seconds. I felt a slight tingling sensation, but nothing that bothered me. It was a good feeling, like it was cleaning my pores out. The next day, I significantly noticed my skin looked a bit clearer, in fact a lot clearer! By the second day the patches of acne were pretty much gone. If I had just let it do it's thing (and used my normal facial cleanser every night), it would of probably took close to a week. I was really impressed with these little pads, and how much power they have behind them. I love that they are made is the US. I also think they are 10X better than any of those facial cleansing pads they have in Walgreen's. Not to mention they are great if you travel, since the pouch is resealable. Overall, I would have to say besides being a little small they are a win win in my book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YHDL2842JLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AWCNVG#wasThisHelpful","R5YHDL2842JLU","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can finally eat my whole cupcake or muffin, instead of half of it sticking to the paper. You get 24 of these lovely liners; 4 of each color. I love this because I can also customize the color to the event I am baking for. The cupcake liners have saved me sooooooo much money! They are also a lot safer for the environment which I love.

"I was really impressed with Oridel's Liquid Gem Face Oil. I have never used a oil that hasn't been heavy or made my face feel greasy, but this stuff is NOTHING like this! It is light, smells wonderful, and easy to blend into makeup.It gave me a really nice glow, as well as moisturized my skin. I have combination skin, so I was a tad worried that it would clog my pores in some spots. However, it didn't clog my pores not once.As you can see in the after picture my skin is glowing and more radiant.

"When I first saw the bottle, I admit I was a little skeptical. I was like, ""How in the WORLD can this little bottle enhance my face?"" Don't be fooled though. This little bottle packs a powerful punch! I was really impressed. Just after fifteen minutes of my first use, I noticed my eyes were less puffy and indeed brighter.Now, by no means am I saying its a miracle cream but indeed most of the claims of this cream is indeed dead on. I have yet to see if it will get rid of my wrinkles completely, but so far have noticed a huge improvement - and for the price it's a great deal. My eyes and skin is brighter and tighter. I have only used it on my eyes, but am told you can use it on your whole face as well. I think that is pretty awesome, and will be next on my list of things to try.

"I absolutely love this wine chiller! I have used a lot of wine aerators and chillers in the past, but none quite like this one. The stick itself stays cold for a really long time, making wine enjoyable glass after glass. My favorite thing about this product is the Aerator. Not only does the aerator do a fast and easy job letting the wine breathe, but it has this little plug attached to it that you can open and close. This is my favorite part because it keeps any air from going in, and keeps the wine at a perfect temperature. If you are looking for an aerator, chiller, pourer, or stopper than this is the way to go. Why have 4 different products, when you can buy this with them all in one. Makes things so much easier, faster, and drinking wine an all around better experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITMHXJY8BK6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RP26IGG#wasThisHelpful","RITMHXJY8BK6Q","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This set literally has it ALL! First lets talk about the cup It has a wonderful lift top that doesn't leak. It also has a screen on the inside (picture included) so that if you want you can either filter what you're pouring, keep bugs from getting into it, or put some sort of food on top. This cup also has a cup at the bottom that screws off so if you want to put some sort of snack in the bottom you can, use it for measuring, or I even use it to store a few ice cubes. It also has a strap on the side so you can carry it around your wrist if you choose to.The other part of this set is the bento box. It has amazing security and you always hear it snap it place to know its secure. It also has 2 different places to store food. The top place to store food is divided. Then in the middle is a spoon and fork to eat with. Then finally at the bottom is your biggest place to store food. It does a great job at keeping food warm or cold. I love using this to take my lunch in, and it doesn't take up much space. If your looking for a quality bento box & water bottle, these are made really well.

The first thing I have to say is I love that right on the label it lists the ingredients. It's not 20 long words no one really understands, but simple words such as sunflower oil and shea butter. The next thing I have to say is unlike a lot of mud masks I have tried this has no awful smell! In fact, to me it has no smell at all....just results. My skin is so unbelievably dry, so I was a little worried to use it at first. However, this mask does a great job at taking any dead skin off, and I have noticed I have had to use a moisturizer a lot less since using the mask. I also have really sensitive skin, and turn red almost after any mask. This doesn't turn my face red at all though, and I like that it has Aloe Vera Juice in it keeping my face cool.

"I recently received this product, and never knew the wonderful uses it has! From cooking to massages. You can literally do it all with this product, a great way to see some examples is by googling ""Ways To Use Coconut Oil."" My favorite thing to do with this product is use it as massage oil. It makes an amazing massage oil, and I was really quite impressed with how well it absorbs. I thought that it would make my skin feel oily or unclean, but made it feel quite the opposite. I love it so much that I decided to test to see how it would do as a moisturizer on my legs after I get out of the shower. It not only made me skin softer than your usual lotion, but made shaving better as well. It has also kept me from getting shave bumps as much too. I have very sensitive skin, and this is a great alternative to all of those other harmful and harsh products out there. I also was impressed with the size for the price (which is 16 FL Oz.)

"What I love about the Epica 3-Piece Ash Bucket set is that not only is it useful, but it looks great in my home as well. It's a very sleek design, and you can just tell once you take it out the box it's made of quality.The first thing I noticed was how much it holds! It is a 6-gallon bucket, leaving plenty of room for multiple fires. Which is great so I won't have to go outside everyday to empty it, on those weeks I decide to light it everyday.The next thing I noticed was the handle. There is just something about it that gives the bucket set that extra added touch of class. I also like that it has ridges designed for your hand, making it easier to carry.You are also provided a shovel with a 4.5""W scoop and maneuverable 12.5"" long handle. It complements the color of the bucket, along with my other fireplace items. Once you're done using it, it easily fits back in place in the storage pocket on the side of the bucket for next time.If you have a fireplace, I think this is a must have item!

I also like that they have no odor whatsoever to them, and that they are 100% natural making them safe for my fur baby. There was prolly are 8-10 sticks in the oz pack. I do think the price is a little high, but you do get quality treats. I would recommend these if your looking for low odor, natural, and solid treats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGM0HP0FIX2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4E1IJE#wasThisHelpful","R3BGM0HP0FIX2M","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I was amazed at was not only the quality of these dish towels, but the size! These are huge! They do a great job at drying dishes and don't fill up with water fast, making it so you can get through a full load of drying dishes and then some. They are also perfect for embroidery. They aren't so thick they you can't stick a needle through, but thick enough to where it has some quality to it. I plan on using one of these for Easter, and love that I can customize these how I want. The towels are also really soft, and great for putting between dishes to layer them. For the price you truly are getting a steal, and I would highly recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVV7AT2OZ277N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVDLPT6#wasThisHelpful","RVV7AT2OZ277N","A33LVON2S5CZHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33LVON2S5CZHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog Kuchen (pronounced koochen meaning little cupcake in german) is quite picky when it comes to treats. However, she LOVES these! Everytime she comes inside without barking I will give her a treat, and each time she comes in she nuzzles the bag for more. They don't make her breathe smell bad, they are a great size for her (she's a German Shepard) but can be broken apart for smaller dogs with ease. They aren't rock hard, but aren't soft either. There also a great amount in the bag for the price and size, I think it's a great deal. I would say in my bag there was around 30 of them, and each one was around 7 inches long.

"I normally use a scented liquid detergent on my laundry, but these new packets clean quite well without a scent -- a boon to those who are allergic to perfumes or just don't want their laundry to have an artificial scent. I used one packet in a medium load of towels, washed in hot water, and two packets in a large load of sheets, washed in warm water, and both came out clean and fresh. Since these packets are pre-measured, they are easy to use -- you just put one or two of them in the bottom of the washer tub and then add the laundry on top of them. Of course, like any product of this type, you need to keep the packets away from kids and animals who might eat them, but these clear packets look less like candy than some similar products on the market now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWYNUYW7818Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBBWTI0#wasThisHelpful","R1LWYNUYW7818Q","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It defines my curls and helps tame the frizz without weighing my hair down. It has a light, fresh scent that might be too much for those allergic to perfumes, but for anyone else I think it would be fine. It's a cream, not a foam, that you spread through your still-damp hair with your fingers. I have short hair so I used a small amount -- a couple of pumps.

"Almost every American school child read Huckleberry Finn and most likely Tom Sawyer, but what are the real-life underpinnings of these stories? Author Andrew Levy explores the time in which Mark Twain grew up, a time when the nation was moving toward Civil War. But beyond the issues of slavery and race, there also were other fears. One of those was of boys -- teen and pre-teen -- committing vandalism and other crimes. There was a lot of concern about better supervision.This book was an eye-opener for me, not least because some of the issues that faced people more than a century and a half ago are still concerns in the present day. And it brought Mark Twain -- Samuel Clemens -- alive for me. This book is dense with information while also being an accessible read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R92KYTFYTPAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439186960#wasThisHelpful","R2R92KYTFYTPAA","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No one I've ever read depicts the South quite like Rick Bragg. In his biographies ""All Over But the Shoutin'"" and ""Ava's Man,"" he describes his own family history in a way that makes the reader feel the heat of Southern summer days and difficult relationships.""My Southern Journey"" is a series of essays -- I wouldn't even call them short stories because they aren't long enough -- written by Bragg over the years as he lived in different parts of the South. The book is divided into five sections: Home, Table, Place, Craft and Spirit, and the essays cover everything from college football to crawdads. I laughed out loud on many occasions at his sly wit, but other stories are a poignant view of a South that Bragg believes is gone forever. As people crouch inside their air conditioned homes on hot summer days, he misses the big, shady front porches where people used to sit with a glass of iced tea and chat with whoever stopped by.This isn't a book you can rush through -- the language is there to be savored like biscuits and gravy. Bragg's descriptive powers are prodigious. In just a few words, he can evoke sights, smells and emotions. The people he writes about aren't, for the most part, well-educated or sophisticated, but he portrays them with kindness. After years up North, writing for major publications including the New York Times, it's significant that he has moved back to the South and now is a professor of writing at the University of Alabama.I grew up in North Texas in the 1950s and '60s, and while it wasn't as Southern as what we refer to as the Deep South, these stories prompted memories of big meals at Christmas and Thanksgiving with my mother's extended family, and days of playing outside with neighborhood kids during broiling summers. I think this book has value for anyone who grew up in the South of those years, and also for anyone who loves outstanding writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G0LKDH19UXI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848746392#wasThisHelpful","R1G0LKDH19UXI5","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've long been a fan of Elly Griffiths' Ruth Galloway series, so when I heard she was starting a new series, I had to check it out. Unlike the Galloway series, which is set in the present day, The Zig Zag Girl is set in 1950, as England recovers from the war. The main characters are the former members of a British (semi) military unit called the Magic Men, composed of illusionists and code-breakers with the goal of confusing the Nazis. Head of the unit was the beautiful Charis, who was killed during the war when a model of a battleship went up in flames while she was on it.Now, five years after the war, the men keep loose contact with each other but have gone their separate ways. Edgar Stephens is a detective inspector for the Brighton police force, and Max Mephisto is a magician on the theater circuit, still drawing a crowd but worrying about how the public's taste in entertainment has changed since the war.Max, Edgar and the rest of the Magic Men are brought together again after the body of a beautiful young woman is found sawed into three pieces in a gory re-creation of a magic trick called the zig zag girl. On stage, of course, it's all an illusion, but in this case it's horribly real. And she won't be the last one to die, either.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I found this an enjoyable read, even if I didn't like it as much as the Galloway novels. There is plenty of suspense, though unfortunately (because I like to be surprised) I figured out who the killer was about three-quarters of the way through the book. Still, this is a decent opening to a new series, and I will read the next book when it comes out. Since it's set more than half a century before the Galloway books, the tone is a little different, but Griffith's way with words still shines.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QBKEYZVR6PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544527941#wasThisHelpful","R20QBKEYZVR6PQ","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Claire Scott is the wife of Paul, a successful architect in Atlanta. She lives the good life -- big house, lots of entertaining, country club tennis. Then Paul is murdered in front of her in a robbery gone very wrong, and suddenly Claire is thrust into a nightmare. Little by little, she learns her husband wasn't who he pretended to be -- that there was a dark side to him she didn't know.Not that she didn't suspect, however. The author leaves little clues that all was not right in the marriage: Claire had an affair with one of Paul's closest friends, and, even though Paul wanted a large family, she pretended infertility when she actually had an IUD and was taking birth control pills.Lydia Delgado is Claire's long-estranged sister, who struggles to get by financially. She and Claire, and their parents, were devastated 20 years ago by the disappearance of Julia, the third sister in the family. Julia has never been found, and there's been no closure for the family.The murder of Paul Scott catapults the two sisters into their own investigation of who he really was. And in the process, they put their own lives in danger, because while Paul may be out of the picture, his associates are not.This is a tightly-written thriller with a complex plot and believable characters. I haven't read any of Slaughter's other novels, but I plan to do that soon. This book is a step or two above the usual murder mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPP9IDPRMIQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062429051#wasThisHelpful","R1JPP9IDPRMIQ9","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel takes longtime Seattle detective J.P. Beaumont back to the past as he struggles to resolve unfinished business from decades ago. The first is a very cold case -- the unsolved murder of a young woman more than 30 years ago whose nude body was found in a barrel of grease that had been rolled down a hillside. The second is not a criminal case, but it does involve a death -- that of Beau's squadron leader in Vietnam 40 years ago. A generous act by the officer saved Beau's life in the same firefight that killed the squadron leader, and Beau has always felt guilty that he didn't look up the man's fiancée to offer his condolences.Both of these cases come back to Beau in vivid dreams, the result of the painkillers he's taking after having a double knee replacement. He feels like both the murdered girl and his old squadron leader are speaking to him in these dreams, telling him he has things left to do. So, even though he's still laid up in the hospital or, later, at home, Beau starts looking into them both. The results show that the past doesn't always stay there, and that it can be downright dangerous to dig into old wrongs.I enjoyed this book. It was a good mystery, while also giving a taste of what Beau was like as a young detective still learning his craft. Be sure to read the author's note at the end of the book -- some of what happened in the story is taken from life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AO1XIQPEYZPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006213468X#wasThisHelpful","R1AO1XIQPEYZPT","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a cream -- not a lotion, which is what I had been using -- but it's not greasy and goes on smoothly.

"While this is a novel, it is based on truth -- the story of the two Grimke sisters, Sarah and Angelina, who became famous fighters against slavery in the decades before the Civil War. The sisters grew up in Charleston to a slave-owning family, and over time, as the novel explores, they became rabid foes of ""the peculiar institution.""The story is told through the alternating views of Sarah, from the age of 12 to her 30s, and Hetty (nicknamed Handful), the slave given to her as a 12th birthday present. Since Hetty is only a year or two younger than her mistress, the two grow up together. Their voices tell the story of slavery from both sides, including brutal punishments and small acts of rebellion.I loved Kidd's earlier book, The Secret Life of Bees, which also centered on black/white relationships, but much later, around the time of the Civil Rights Act. The books have a different feel, but the main issue is the same.I recommend this novel to anyone who likes Kidd's work or wants to read a good story about the struggle to end slavery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160LGNPBRFAUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670024783#wasThisHelpful","R160LGNPBRFAUU","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite its title, this book is about much more than just one year. It follows the U.S. through a period of isolationism until Pearl Harbor brings the nation into the war. It follows FDR, wily and determined, who promises that America will stay out of the war until he can no longer do so. Once America comes into the war, the tide begins to turn against Germany, but slowly.Much of this book focuses on the Nazi death camps and the horrifying details that started to trickle out about what went on there. Why did it take more than a year for Roosevelt to approve a refugee board? As always, politics were involved.Balanced against all of this was Roosevelt's failing health, which was an open secret among leaders in the U.S. and elsewhere. In all, it was a very tricky time for an attempt to both end a war and rescue Jewish prisoners.This is a long book -- more than 500 pages -- and I think it could have been condensed somewhat, focusing more on the year in the title and less on the run-up to it. But Winik is a good writer who brings dry facts to life through his depiction of the interesting personalities involved. Like his earlier book, 1865 -- one of my favorite Civil War histories -- it focuses on the waning days of a massive conflict. For those who enjoy detailed, well-written history, this is a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JW4O7GK5VZU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439114080#wasThisHelpful","R1JW4O7GK5VZU6","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an entertaining, just-scary-enough book for older kids, featuring a witch, a creepy doll, and a cabin in the woods that looks derelict in the daytime but comes alive at midnight.When his father loses his job in posh Fairfield, Connecticut, Daniel and his younger sister, Erica, find themselves moving to Woodville, West Virginia, an economically depressed area where the siblings are reviled as snobs at the local school. The family moves into a dilapidated farmhouse where the paint is peeling and the roof leaks. Both kids want to go back to their old life, but it isn't possible. And then they start to hear the strange stories about a girl who lived in their house 50 years ago -- until she disappeared and was never heard from again. And then Erica disappears ...Mary Downing Hahn has plenty of experience in writing spooky stories for kids, and it shows in this book, which will give readers the chills but hopefully not nightmares. It flows well and kept my interest until the end. The characters are likable (except for the evil ones), and within the supernatural boundaries of the story, the situations and relationships are realistic.

"I first tried this product on a rainy day. Humidity always makes my naturally wavy hair frizz, but this crème kept that at a minimum. I have fine hair that tends to be dry, and it's also color-treated. This product conditioned it while not weighing it down, which has been a problem with other conditioners. The directions also say to leave it on only two minutes, so I can use it while taking a shower instead of having to rinse it out later. It has a nice, floral scent. I used it with my regular shampoo, not the recommended Pantene product, but it still worked well. The tube isn't large, but since I have short hair it should last me for awhile. All in all, I recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD88OLD455CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM9XTQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3DD88OLD455CN","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After tackling the subject of the ancient Jews who fought at Masada in The Dovekeepers, Alice Hoffman now moves forward in time to the 1800s on a Caribbean island for The Marriage of Opposites. Rachel Pomie is the daughter of Jewish immigrants to the tropical island of St. Thomas, controlled at that time by Denmark. She rebels against her overbearing mother and dreams of going to Paris.That dream is dashed when she's married off to a fellow immigrant, a widower twice her age with several children who can help save her family's struggling business. Although Rachel never falls in love with her husband, he is a good man who treats her well. They have four four children together, including one who is born after Rachel's husband dies when Rachel is in her late 20s.All of this is a rather slow-moving prelude to the real crux of the story -- Rachel's torrid love affair with Frederic Pizzarro, her husband's nephew, whom the family send over from Paris to take over the business. The pair are passionately attracted to each other from their first meeting, with joy and scandal the inevitable result because Jewish law prohibits marriage between two members of the same family. Although Rachel and Frederic are not related by blood, the fact that they are related by marriage is sufficient. Their relationship causes them to be ostracized by their fellow immigrants.Hoffman's writing style is both lush -- in describing the beauty of St. Thomas -- and deliberate -- in the slow buildup to the crux of the story. The writing elevates this story above a simple romance.The story is based on truth, because Rachel and Frederic were the parents of Camille Pissarro, one of the greatest artists of the Impressionist school. He changed his name to a more French spelling after moving to France.This is a fascinating story, but it moves at a slow pace. Still, it made me care about the characters and their troubles and triumphs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E50CSF0TKBIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451693591#wasThisHelpful","R3E50CSF0TKBIZ","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pallavi Aiyar, a native of India, was working as a journalist in China when she learned that she and her Spanish husband would be moving to Brussels, Belgium. It sounded like a great change -- from the crowds, inconveniences and pollution of Beijing to a more developed, cleaner environment for them and their two young sons. And some things did improve. But this was 2009, the year the European economy took a nosedive. Added to that was the increasing disruption caused in Europe by the millions of immigrants coming from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, with their own customs and religions.As Aiyar relates in this book, the gravy train of social programs and benefits that most Europeans have been enjoying for the past half-century is starting to rumble to a stop in the face of more residents in need and increasing competition from countries like China and India where labor is much cheaper than in Europe. One thing she noticed immediately upon moving to Brussels was the frequency of labor strikes by people working in conditions that workers in developing countries could only dream about.Aiyar details the diamond industry in Antwerp, Belgium, which for many years was dominated by powerful Jewish families. Now, Indians have taken over that trade by using cheap labor in India to cut the stones -- and, some say, by being willing to work harder than the less-desperate Europeans.Aiyar discusses the effect of massive immigration on both the Europeans and the immigrants themselves. Despite images to the contrary, she writes, the vast majority of immigrants are poor. Climate control also comes under Aiyar's microscope, with a glimpse into the frustrating bureaucratic maze that greets those trying to hammer out a climate agreement.Aiyar is clear-eyed about the problems in developing countries. Her elder son suffered from respiratory illness while they were living in China. Once they moved to Brussels, the problems quickly cleared up. And she describes life even for the wealthy in India as being fraught with challenges. I recently returned from a visit to India, and I found her observations of the way most people live there to be right on target.This is an exceptionally well-written book that lays out the inevitable clash between Old World (European) culture and developing world culture. Writing from the perspective of an Indian, Aiyar brings a new voice to the discussion. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the changes in today's world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQOLNR119IVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125007231X#wasThisHelpful","R1JQOLNR119IVG","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been 10 years since Juliet Townsend graduated from high school, but she still remembers how it feels to be second-rate in almost everything -- looks, running speed, self-confidence -- to beautiful track star Maddy Bell. A decade on, Juliet is still living in that same small town in the middle of nowhere, working as a cleaning lady at the Mid-Night Inn, a rundown motel, and barely making ends meet. Maddy headed off to college and hasn't been heard from since. Juliet, ashamed of her lack of accomplishments, has no plans to attend the high school's 10-year reunion.Then, out of the blue, Maddy breezes into town with a huge rock on her left hand and talk of her glamorous life in Chicago. Surprisingly, she decides to spend the night at the Mid-Night Inn, and she and Juliet meet at the bar, where Juliet lets her long-simmering resentments show. Hours later, Maddy is dead, an apparent suicide that turns out to be murder. But who did it? There are a host of people who knew Maddy in high school and didn't much like her.Juliet, who finds herself the chief suspect, starts looking into the mystery to clear her own name, and perhaps lay to rest the ghosts of her high school years. She's helped and hindered by people who could be suspects themselves, and she begins to ask herself why she has settled for a second-best life for the past decade.This book is so full of twists and turns that it kept me guessing until the author wanted me to figure out who the murderer was. Along the way, the reader learns that Maddy's life wasn't as perfect as it seemed, and that even the most benign-seeming people can have a dark side.I enjoyed Rader-Day's first novel, The Black Hour, and this one (which is not a sequel) is an absorbing read. The characters are well-developed and believable, even if you don't like some of them very much. It also made me glad I did not grow up in a small town, where people know too much about each other and don't shrink from using it to their own advantage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242472FRWCR7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880044#wasThisHelpful","R242472FRWCR7F","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gentle product with a light, pleasant scent does a decent job cleaning such things as metal garage doors and patio furniture. I don't have mold or mildew, so I can't say how well it works on that. The main advantage I see to this product is convenience -- the spray bottle is way easier to use than hauling around a bucket of soapy water and a brush. But the solution isn't that strong, so you still will have to scrub some stains. It is more environmentally friendly than many similar products. I sprayed it on my metal garage doors and then wiped them with a rag. The dirt came off well. Then I hosed them down to remove the residue. I tried this product on bricks that have hard-water lime stains from my sprinkler system. Some of the stain came off, but not all of it. I understand there are stronger products to use on lime stains, though. All in all, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy this product, but it does have convenience in its favor, and it probably won't damage what it's cleaning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26209AKO06CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZVRM8#wasThisHelpful","R26209AKO06CJ","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fleas are a big problem where I live, so anything that promises to make keeping them off my dog easier gets my attention. This one includes an applicator that parts the dog's fur so the insecticide will reach the dog's skin.Unfortunately, at least for me, this product was more trouble than it was worth. Instead of an easy squeeze down my dog's spine, I had to load an applicator -- during which process I accidentally sprayed a small amount of product in my eye. I immediately flushed it out with water and all is well, but I think this device makes the whole process more difficult than it needs to be.

"Paula McLain, whose last novel The Paris Wife told the story of Ernest Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, turns to another historical figure in this book: Beryl Markham, whose adventures growing up in Kenya and as an aviator in the 1920s and '30s were profiled in her autobiography, West With the Night. McLain draws heavily on that memoir, and a number of other sources, to tell the story of a woman who lived life on her own terms, regardless of what others said about her.Beryl was raised and spent most of her life in Africa, near Kenya's Rift Valley, where her father farmed and raised horses after moving from England in the early 1900s. Beryl's mother soon got enough of the primitive lifestyle and moved back to England when Beryl was four years old. Beryl didn't see her again until she was well into adulthood, and that abandonment played a part in making her the woman she became.Beryl married young, to a nearby farmer, but the marriage didn't work out. It was the first of her three marriages, and she also had many affairs. Her father let her run wild as a young girl, picking her playmates from the local tribes and riding her horse far and wide. Perhaps it was that childhood freedom that kept her from really settling down as an adult. She became a successful racehorse trainer and eventually a pilot. In the '30s, she flew her plane across the Atlantic, becoming the first woman to fly across the ocean from east to west.Beryl was a complex character, with a good deal of charm but also a disregard for the feelings of others. She became friends with Karen Blixen, who under the pen name Isak Dinesen wrote the memoir Out of Africa. Beryl wound up having an affair with Denys Finch Hatton, who was also Blixen's lover.  Beryl never seemed to worry much about scandal, which followed her throughout much of her adult life.This book is told first-person in Beryl's voice, and as such it manages to paint her as a more sympathetic character than many biographers might have done. While I couldn't admire some of her actions, I found Beryl's story engrossing -- a window into an Africa that is long gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SRF98I046I71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R2SRF98I046I71","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not human bones that cause most of the excitement in Craig Johnson's latest Longmire mystery -- it's dinosaur bones. A young paleontologist working on a spread owned by a Native American family stumbles across what may be the largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever found.Coincidentally -- or perhaps not -- the patriarch of the landowners is found dead in a turtle pond on his property not long after the dinosaur bones, estimated to be worth millions of dollars, are found. The dead man's family claims ownership of the bones, and their tribe and the federal government soon make their own claims.It's a rich stew for Sheriff Walt Longmire and his undersheriff Victoria Moretti to handle. Author Johnson does a great job in weaving the strands together and following Walt and his crew as they tease out the facts. Added to the mix is a visit by Walt's daughter, Cady, and her 4-month-old daughter, Lola, from Philadelphia. Cady is married to Vic's brother, Michael, who's a Philly cop.There are several twists to this story that I don't want to reveal, but suffice it to say that Dry Bones continues Johnson's solid series of Longmire mysteries.  For those familiar only with the TV series -- which thankfully was picked up by Netflix for a fourth season -- this book is much farther along the path and may contain some spoilers. It can be read as a stand-alone, but some familiarity with the story, either through previous books or the TV series, is helpful. It's an enjoyable read that leaves a few threads hanging for the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXFVVFK6MJNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426930#wasThisHelpful","R3LXFVVFK6MJNB","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a novel about two women, separated by more than 150 years, who have a common issue -- the inability to have children -- and also are connected by a house with a secret cellar where runaway slaves were held as a station on the Underground Railroad. The story jumps back and forth between the two stories, one set in the present day and one set mainly in the years just before the Civil War.One woman actually existed -- Sarah Brown, daughter of abolitionist John Brown, who led the ill-fated raid on Harper's Ferry, W. Va., in 1859. The other is Eden Anderson, a woman living with her husband Jack in present-day New Charlestown, W. Va., in a house the couple would like to rehab and sell. The main drama in Eden's life is her failure to carry a baby to term despite a series of infertility treatments. Her bitterness over this failure is straining her marriage. In Sarah's life, the Harper's Ferry raid and its aftereffects are the main drama, as family and friends are killed during the fighting and her father is soon executed. A near-fatal illness has left her unable to conceive a child.I finished this book glad that I had stuck with the story to the end, which was moving and uplifting. But the pace is somewhat slow, and the continual jumping from past to present and back again was distracting. I'm not sure the modern-day plot line was needed -- the saga of Sarah Brown, her family and her fellow abolitionists would have been engrossing enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUO4O5VKUOM3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348908#wasThisHelpful","RUO4O5VKUOM3R","A1P77JG6PMRRPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P77JG6PMRRPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at fantasyliterature.comDetectives Dan Carter and Charlie Hammond have finally tracked down and cornered the perverse serial killer known as The Child-Catcher. Found in his own home, the detectives move in, focused on a speedy capture, before the Child-Catcher performs his bizarre version of open-brain surgery.Charlie takes the lead, turns up a flight of stairs and Carter hears a shot ring out. He follows, and sees the Child-Catcher sitting against a wall, a pool of blood in his lap, and a seemingly serene smile on his lips. “Suicide by cop”. On the wall: a string-connected ‘psycho wall’.Further down the hall, Carter’s partner is crying and laughing, Charlie put his S&W Model 5946 between his teeth, squeezed the trigger, and excused himself from life.Jonathan L. Howard is no stranger to the authorial weird. His resume, after all, includes the Johannes Cabal series — some genetic hybrid of horror, humor, gothic and, well, weird. Carter & Lovecraft contains elements of all of those, but is decidedly dark and heavy. And he writes a powerful opening. The child killer is seemingly caught by Hammond and Carter. He's shot and while dying, the senior officer places a pistol in his mouth and pulls the trigger. No reason why.Carter leaves the police and ventures off into the world of private investigation. While chasing cheating husbands, a lawyer appears in his office (rather mysteriously and… quietly), informing him that he’s been named the sole in inheritor of a home in Providence, Rhode Island. He’s never heard of his benefactor, one Alfred Hill, gone missing seven years ago.Howard writes wonderful prose. He’s noir without being clichéd or overdone. The narrative flows without seeming wordy, and is imbued with a subtle sense of humor:""I'm sorry,"" said Carter. ""I didn't hear you come in.""""I came in,"" said the man, as if to reassure him.Carter didn't need the reassurance on that point, but it was kind of the man to offer it, all the same.Hill’s ‘home’ is actually a bookstore: ""Hill's Books -- Antiquarian & Secondhand”. Emily Lovecraft is Hill’s niece and has been managing the store since Hill’s disappearance. It will surprise no one that Emily is related to the Lovecraft of Providence fame, ol H.P. And yes, she’s the last in the Lovecraft lineage.More weird happenings orbit Carter and Lovecraft, and they find themselves pulled by the gravity of a series of deadly events. A mathematician magician has an uncanny ability to ‘influence chance’, and while taking advantage of casinos also seems to defy physics in several apparent murders.It’s clear that the events in and around Providence are not mere magic, nor are they of the natural world. This is, after all, the home turf of H.P. Lovecraft and his dramatically interwoven tales of cosmic horror. Emily is a reluctant expert of her ancestor’s writings and history and is able to tease out from the clues of the recent murders to connect the dots with her own family history. Providence isn’t normal… nor has it ever been.""Everything… is kind of f**** up. And by ‘everything,’ I mean everything. Nothing is right, nothing is as it appears. I don’t just mean in some nihilistic, conspiratorial, paranoid kind of way. I mean fundamentally. And the joke is, it used to be worse. Then, back in the twenties, a group of guys figured out what was wrong, and how they could fix it.""The world seems to becoming UN-fixed. And it’s no accident that former Det. Carter is involved.I’ll stay away from any further plot description/spoilers, but suffice it to say, there’s a whole lot of Lovecraftian weirdness, including disjointed cities, immortal creatures of the sea, and horrors that cause insanity with just a mere glimpse.My biggest frustration with the pantheon of Lovecraftian writing is the lack of high quality long-form fiction. The space is awash with short stories, novellas and anthologies (I recently reviewed a Cthulhu-Roman Empire mash up anthology on FanLit). Howard’s entrant is a terrific mystery, wrapped up in a detective tale, enveloped in the cosmic weird of Lovecraft. And it succeeds.Carter & Lovecraft concludes with a terrific plot twist. And while Howard has written a solid and definitive ending in its own right, there’s a plethora of potential for a sequel. Additionally, Warner Brothers has acquired the television rights for the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2TO8V3BKH83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE3L7PE#wasThisHelpful","R2O2TO8V3BKH83","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ancient, and wrong.""-from Fecunditati Augustae by Christine MorganTales of Cthulhu Invictus adds nine new stories to the large anthology subgenre of the Cthulhu mythos built upon the cosmic horror foundations laid by H.P. Lovecraft. This collection, edited by the accomplished Brian M. Sammons, has several very good stories by a collection of experienced writers. All fit well within the Cthulhu and Lovecraftian themes, though only a few effectively utilize the Roman place-and-time as an embedded enhancement rather than mere historical window dressing.Below you’ll find very brief summaries and quotes from each of the stories. These aren’t in their exact order from the anthology, but are loosely ranked in order of my favorites.""Fecunditati Augustae"" by Christine MorganEmpress Faustina is tormented by her inability to give Emperor Marcus Aurelias male heirs. She turns to dark magic to ensure her fertility, though not her children’s health. Morgan has a beautiful turn of phrase and does the best job of building Lovecraftian tension while providing effective hints of the otherworldly horrors. The characters have depth and dimension and, at only 15 pages long, the plot thoroughly embeds itself in its roman historical connections. I really love Morgan’s language and look forward to reading more from her.""Seized and held. Roughly turned. Upended over a bony, knobby knee. The world tips as if it will spill out, sloshing like a rocked jar or amphora. The tough, callused heel of a hard hand strikes her a firm blow to the back. She utters a bleat of her own, a hideous glottal expulsion. Her throat opens and now she is the sloshing jar, the rocked amphora, contents emptying in a liquid splatter.""""Vulcan’s Forge"" by William MeikleThis story explores the idea that the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. may have been more than a simple issue of geophysical forces, but perhaps purposefully triggered to protect the world from a long ancient evil, primed to unleash its fury on the human race. Ancient explorers discover a mechanism deep within the volcano and find clues to its history.""One thing is certain — it was designed and built by a race long since lost to man — a race of giant intellect so far above ours that we would be mere insects under their boots should they return.""Plague of Wounds by Konstantine Paradias""I sleep in a corner in one of the back rooms of the Synagogue, miraculously left unscathed by the fire. The wound itches and breaks out into a stream of words, its lips flapping together like gums, its tongue lolling. In Greek and Aramaic and Latin and its own nonsense language, it foretells of the terrible doom that will befall the world.""This terrific story is of rabbi wrought by an unholy plague, that manifests itself within his own body. He sells out his fellow man to protect his family, but when faced with selling out humanity, he has his soul’s redemption at stake.""Lines in the Sand"" by Tom LynchAn attempted murder and a cursed dagger drags former Legionary Caius out of his comfortable retirement and into battle with The King in Yellow – a character upon whom Lovecraft built components of his stories.""As a Roman cohort stood against an army of unidentifiable creates, they saw: Towers taller than the grandest in Rome floated into view behind the opposing army. Through a haze, over a distant lake, lofty towers pulled the entire cohort’s focus. Everyone watched as the ethereal edifices board towards the sky, until something… changed. Faces feel as the beauty began to fade. Columns cracked, facades crumbled, and friezes fell.The figure in the lead had turned away, gazing back at this domain, and as it began to fade, fall, and decay, his shoulders dropped and his head fell forward. Caius could feel the torment flowing from the enemy. The anguish twisted into anger, then raging fury. The leader brought his head up.""""The Temple of Iald-T’quthoth"" by Lee Clark ZumpeAnother strong story that’s much more lurid and sanguine than the others, and effectively blends the historical place and time with the Lovecraftian themes.A killer, crucified outside the walls of Jerusalem dies horribly as the cross settles into its base:""… the crown of Jaddus’ skull burst wide open, its gory content spurting through the air. The think, viscid substance — a repugnant mix of brain, blood and gore — rained down on those soldiers ill-starred enough to be in close proximity. From the oozing, shattered husk of Jaddus’ head, a black swarm of small winged things, unseated from their next, took flight with much commotion, congregating briefly in burgeoning shadowy cloud that resembled and impossibly gargantuan monster.""Over the next decade, each infected Legionary dies. Quintus knows he’s the last and leads the investigators to a cult leader… who’s a surprise to the characters, though much less so to the readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZEKOSN0IHJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016R3G2RS#wasThisHelpful","R1NZEKOSN0IHJC","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally posted at UNRV.comSteven Saylor has built his authorial reputation on modern historical fiction, particularly in the genre of historical mysteries. His “Roma Sub Rosa” series has seen 14 books published beginning in 1991 and continuing through 2015 with his 15th entrant in the series, “Wrath of the Furies: A Novel of the Ancient World”. This story is written primarily from the perspective of a young Gordianus, who grows up to become Gordianus the Finder, the Roman sleuth whose mysteries are set across the Roman Empire in Saylor’s Roma series. ""Wrath of the Furies"" is the third book of a trio of prequels to the Roma Sub Rosa series, this one set in Alexandria and Ephesus.And who are these Furies and why do they have wrath? Antipater explains to Mithridates:  "" The winged sisters are three in number: Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone. They are older than Zeus and the other Olympian gods, having been born from the blood of Uranus when his son Kronos castrated him. They dwell among the dead in Tartarus, but are sometimes drawn to eat and to punish certain kinds of wickedness. Once they find the mortal culprit, they hound him relentlessly, circling him and shrieking, sting him with brass-studded scourges…They have snouts like dogs, bulging, bloodshot eyes, and snakes for hair. Their bodies are as black as coal, and they flit through the air on batlike wings.""Mithridates has the Roman Empire shuddering due to the destructive force of his moving army. He has vowed to kill every Roman he can, but needs to ensure that he has raised the support, rather than ire, of the Furies. All good ancient commanders must heed their mighty gods. Gordianus has accidentally found himself smack in the middle of this Mithridates plot to pay obeisance to the Furies through human sacrifice.Saylor's narrative style is clean and straightforward. Like his character Antipater, he's not poetic, but the story is entertaining and, I suspect, will be of greatest interest to readers familiar with his characters and the Roma Sub Rosa storylines. Saylor continuously updates the reader as to the Roma Sub Rosa context of returning characters and plot elements. You can absolutely read “Wrath” independently from the rest of the series, but the experience will not be as satisfying. “Wrath of the Furies” is an enjoyable historical mystery and contains 320 pages.A second narrative perspective comes from Gordianus’ mentor, Antipater of Sidon, Greek poet of great renown who has been acting (mostly) as unwitting undercover spy working for Mithridates, scourge of the Roman empire and hero of Greeks across the Mediterranean. Antipater’s contribution to the story comes in the form of fragments from his diary. He reflects on his current status, and provides a view into the goings on of Mithridates who’s systematically bulldozing his way across the Empire destroying towns and cities and claiming the role of eastern avenger against the Roman Empire.The story circles a number of mysteries, plots and subplots that run concurrently throughout the narrative:1) A portion of the aforementioned diary arrives mysteriously at the home where Gordianus is staying in Alexandria. Gordianus travels east, into the thicket of Mithridates violence and hatred, to find his old mentor Antipater who seems to be in a desperate and dire situation in Ephesus.2) Gordianus is cooling his heels in Alexandria which, for the moment, is not a target for Mithridates and so is a relative safe haven for Romans in the outskirts of the Empire. Gordianus must uncover, and perhaps eliminate, the plot of the great Mithradites to destroy all Romans residing in the outer territories of the Empire.3) Pushed into a role of spy himself, Gordianus must also determine the fate and location of several secondary characters of varying levels of interest.Antipater provides the more interesting elements of the plot as he writes in his diary from within Mithridates coterie. At times, he’s relegated to dining tables with the jugglers and entertainers who are available at the King’s beck and call, and sometimes called into consultation with the great king.Antipater describes in great detail the environment of life from the edges of the King’s court, including the horrifically grim death of a Roman general bound with his mouth forced open and fed molten gold. And yes, this is all too familiar for fans of “Game of Thrones” who read (or saw) Khal Drogo kill the despicable Viserys Targaryen in a very similar manner, however Saylor’s retelling is completely based in fact.What’s less factual is the storytelling tone and language. Everyone speaks in a fairly modern manner, replete with terms that were clearly originated well after the time frame in which this story is placed. Antipater describes himself acting like an ‘automaton’, using a term that wasn’t first spoken until the early 17th century (so sayeth Websters, at least). Considering Saylor’s reputation for historical authenticity, I was disappointed in the contemporary stylings of dialogue and narration; though do acknowledge that it may be purposeful as he targets his appropriate reading audience.Considering that Antipater reminds us (every few pages) that he’s a poet of only the highest caliber, his diary fragments are rather less than poetic. They move the story well, and provide the most interesting elements of the narrative, but the language used is merely descriptive and mundane. I would’ve preferred to see Antipater's character and personality developed through the language within the diary. His profession is certainly not apparent outside of his own braggadocio.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZ2Y2VJZO3QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250015987#wasThisHelpful","R2VZ2Y2VJZO3QL","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, these Lonovo headphones are a good inexpensive product. I'm most impressed with the sound quality at all volume levels, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, but......but there are two issues:1 - I've tried wearing the headphones with all three size ear cushions. And the things just don't fit correctly. I think it has to do with the unique angled earpiece mechanism over which the cushions rest. They're intended to angle towards the eardrum. For me, it just doesn't fit properly.2. The plastic shell that covers the sound-carrying wire came off without much trouble. And it shouldn't come off at all.

"This is an awesome mug. The vacuum element comes from the flip-top opening which closes in such a way to create suction/vacuum within the mug. When closed, it won't leak or spill. When closed, it keeps the hot hot and the cold cold.I've tested with hot coffee and I've tested with cold drinks. It's truly amazing and works as advertised. The hot lasted for well over an hour during an early morning drive to the airport about 25 miles from my home.The no-spill aspect works as well. The top screws on firmly and the tight-fitting vacuum flip top seals the beverage well.

"New York Review Books Classics has just packaged two novels by renowned author, editor and teacher William Sloane into a single offering, The Rim of the Morning: Two Tales of Cosmic Horror. Sloane is not an author I’d previously known, probably due to the fact that these stories are two of only three novels that he ever published. Stephen King contributes a short but impeccable introduction, providing a tight analysis of the stories and windows into Sloane’s background and style. Sloane wrote and edited primarily supernatural mystery/scifi, but is known in literary worlds as a writing teacher.The first of these novels, To Walk the Night, is a Lovecraftian tale of the investigation into an apparent murder and suicide. This is the much stronger of these two stories. It’s a heavy, moody, genre-bending mystery that drips with molasses-dread and alone is worth the full price of the book. The second is The Edge of Running Water, also mystery-based — the tale of an obsessed professor determined to find a way to communicate with his recently departed wife. Each story is about 200 pages long. I’ve reviewed them separately below.To Walk the NightA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:Its loveliness increases; it will neverPass into nothingness; but still will keep– From Endymion (A Thing of Beauty) by John KeatsThe first story is a weighty and serious scifi/mystery, with Greek tragedy in its tone from the outset. Sloane borrows generously from the myth of Selene, goddess of the moon, who asks Zeus to keep her beautiful human lover, Prince Endymion, forever young. To Walk the Night is suggestive of this myth, though, and not too literal, but it’s fun to catch Sloane’s references to the ancient story sprinkled liberally throughout this novel.The story opens as our primary narrator, Berkeley (called Bark), journeys to bring his best friend’s ashes home following his suicide. Jerry Lister’s death weighs heavily on Bark, and forms the narrative momentum for the initiation of the story. In many ways, this is a 1930s CSI, as Bark must work back through recent events, piece by piece, to uncover all the details and identify what’s pertinent and relevant to Jerry’s suicide.Through Bark, Sloane dramatically builds the density and importance of the full backstory and makes clear the dread and imperative nature of the need to find the true reason why Jerry shot himself. Bark reflects on the complexity of events leading up to the suicide and remembers an “atmosphere of strangeness, even of terror, which was so much a part of my life while these events were in progress.”To Walk the Night feels very gothic: there is a dark and deep polished walnut-tone vibe to Bark’s narration and exposition. The mythological themes are set early, though I only caught the first Selene clue in retrospect, upon reviewing my notes. Not all references are directly related to the story of Selena and Endymion, but the suggestion is always there… sometimes a little deeper under the surface than other times.Bark dissects his recent trauma as part of a late-night discussion with his informally-adoptive father, Dr. Lister – also Jerry’s father. Bark ponders:Nothing in life, I think, ordinarily happens in great, thunderous episodes of obvious and romantic force. Life is a series of small things, and most of them mean much or little depending on how the observer thinks of them.It’s these small things, combined with some larger clues, that feed the narrative and drive the plot.Bark tells of a visit that he and Jerry made to a former professor — a misunderstood, antisocial, introverted and clearly obsessed scientist (Sloane seems to have been enamored with this character-type). The young men found Professor LeNormand, who had been working late and alone at the campus observatory, on fire and apparently murdered. This is the core mystery around which the remaining narrative revolves.And it’s at this point that we meet our goddess of the moon: Selena. Selena LeNormand is the professor’s widow and she’s just downright bizarre. In no way does she behave like a normal human, let alone someone who just lost the love of her life. She’s tall, lithe but strong, and thought by many to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Selena’s repeatedly thought of as more than statuesque, but statue-like. Her age is indeterminate, but she’s compared to the “Greek girls in the frieze of the Parthenon.”Sloane’s writing weeps with loaded language. Language that’s very purposeful in its dramatic flair, while implying things beyond the range of normal human activity:In the silences that lay between us I heard the bumbling of an insect against the glass of the lamp and the faint slither of water moving on the beach below us.Instead of doors, he refers to ‘portals’.There are suggestions of ghosts and that something horrible laying just out of sight. A shooting star “plummets down like a tear of light and vanished in the dark above the Sound.”Tables are described as altars.Likewise, the vocabulary reeks of symbolism and weighted meaning. The names, for example: Bark is the strength of the story, and like his namesake, his role is uber-protector of his friend and of that which is normal and sane. Jerry’s actual name is Jeremiah… and like his namesake, the prophet, his role is as a revealer, working to expose the truth of his former mentor. LeNormand was a French tarot reader famous during the reign of Napoleon, and like their namesake, both the professor and Selena are, in their own respects, seers beyond normal human perception.This is a dark any enjoyable read, with enough literary and narrative weight to stick with the reader days after its completion.For the full review, please visit fantasyliterature.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B51S12DAS1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590179064#wasThisHelpful","R13B51S12DAS1N","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons as an early teen. For a brief period I was a bit obsessed and saved my most nerdly of memories which Are still somewhere in my basement.This game falls into that general category of gaming. It's highly complex, intricate and will appeal to those with patience and who don't mind giving in to their inner Star Wars nerd.You can't play without a decent understanding and reading of the rules. Though there is a simple version to allow quick play.The gist is that one player is the x-wing fighter and the other is the two tie fighters. You maneuver and position to accomplish a specific goal as laid out in the rules.The game allows one player to choose their best strategic move while blind from your opponents counter move. And then you can battle. Maybe.The main set comes with three quality detailed models. One x-wing and two tie fighters. And a bunch of heavy stock cardboard pieces and plastic dice.I'm not judging, but you have to be of a certain mindset to play and enjoy this game. It's pretty cool to be honest.

"""The label was made of a waxy yellow parchment, glued in place and stained in a couple places by a variety of liquids over the years. Beneath the stains, in a barely legible scrawl, it stated: Specimen #73.""-from Pete Kahle's ""The Specimen""This is a surprisingly good book. It's got aliens, a lot of action, a decent bit of mystery and all-in-all is a well-written tale. This Lovecraftian tale of ancient evil follows numerous characters through numerous time periods that blends mystery with scifi with good old fashioned gore-spirited horror.The core narrative orbits around the discovery of a hideous 'specimen' of unknown origin offered for sale at an odds n' ends store. From there we learn of a mind-reading alien entity that's been manipulating pockets of humanity for untold years. Actually, the years are not untold because Kahle does a terrific job of bisecting his core plotlines with alien backstory that takes us to the time of the Aztecs, Spanish Inquisition, and northern Europe circa 700 AD.In addition to the fun historical background tales, I particularly enjoyed the Lovecraftian mood set in passages such as this: ""Like a leviathan eel lying in the centuries-old muck at the bottom of a stagnant lake, the horrors from his past stirred up the muddy debris of his mind with its convulsions, sending once hidden fossils to the surface.""If you're a fan of monster-based horror and MiB-like shadow military units, you'll like this story and love the fact that it's just the first in a series.

It was light, and there's no denying author James Moore's connection to the Lovecraft collective mythos, but it just wasn't a good novel.The characters were flat, the story was bland and predictable, and there was no pull of the reader into the grander vision of what makes Lovecraft-style stories so (capital G) ""Grand"".This would be fine if you're looking for an inexpensive, quick 2-3 day read, with monsters, some mystery and a connective tissue to the world of H.P.

Eli tells his (crazy) first wife that he wants to quit podiatry to focus full time on monster-hunting (I mean hominid-hunting): ""I feel that if I don't do this, I will die. I will die a sudden horrible death. Have you ever felt that way about something? That you must either commit fully to the task at hand or die an agonizing death?""And the book is also certainly about self-discovery. Eli continues, ""There's nothing to be ashamed of, Gladys,"" he said. ""This is science. It’s about discovery. Self-discovery, even. The more we know about Sasquatch, the more we’ll know of one another.""It’s also about chasing ghosts; perhaps like Ahab  chasing that white whale - always just a fingernail’s length out of reach. And there’s lots of regret.Shields is a terrific writer, and I suspect those with English degrees will chew up the copious amount of symbolism. However, those looking for a thorough and well-connected narrative may have trouble with the opacity of Shields plot-driving machinations.None of the characters are particularly likable, and despite the relative shallowness of the characters themselves, I found the conclusion more than a bit touching.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA7MXXDPVLZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162779199X#wasThisHelpful","RQA7MXXDPVLZF","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brett Talley's follow up to his magnificent Lovecraftian novel, ""That Which Should Not Be"", proves that he will carve out a place for himself among modern horror authors. This is a thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi/horror/thriller.While there are a handful of creepy-crawlies that jump from the darkness, Talley's true mastery is his development of horror through narrative, tone and mood. He builds his story upon a backbone of well-known fictional elements - ""The Matrix"", ""The Odyssey"", the film ""Event Horizon"". And while a bit derivative, it works extremely well and I found myself aching to finish the story.""Void"" is quite short and doubling the size, Talley would've had the opportunity delve deeper into the characterizations and further flesh out the backstory.

"“One can never truly know when he steps outside his door whether today will be a day that passes without consequence, or if it will be one that changes everything.""- from Bretty Talley’s “That Which Should Not Be""""That Which Should Not Be"" is a dark and moody book, fit for a cold evening in front of the fire; or an autumnal read, for one wanting to build on the cyclical theme of the season. The writing style wreaks of HP Lovecraft, but also of Bram Stoker.Talley has written four short stories that revolve around a central theme. A student from Lovecraft’s famed Miskatonic University is hunting for a lost book of ancient renown. It’s not the Necronomicon, but rather a companion piece to HP’s much discussed fictional tome. While seeking the book, Carter Weston stops at a pub to share a few drinks with locals to see what he can learn. Four locals then each dive into their own dark tale of the supernatural.Talley channels Lovecraft well through plot development, theme and mood. As is characteristic with this genre, there are few decisive conclusions. The monster in the back of the cave is built upon a pedestal of of suggestion rather than true blood and gore. The horror resides in what’s unseen, or perhaps merely glimpsed.Frequent and early Lovecraft references pave a very Lovecraftian road. “I must protect the Book. I will not surrender it, no matter what the cost. And if my life is to be forget, then I shall die as I have lived, standing against the black tide that would cover us all.""From the first tale, which contains more than a few shades of ’The Thing’, the storyteller relays ”Demon hunted the forest was that night, and in my dreams, I heard and felt the darkest and foulest beast that ever gibbered its wail from the depths of the pit.""In another story, Lovecraftian lore spews forth, “It was then that my eyes began to open to the dark forces that move in the uncultivated lands beyond the borders of the world we know.” I realize that “X-Files” can certainly be viewed through an Lovecraft-lens: The truth is out there…just beyond reach…just outside of the lighted pathways…just within the darkest recesses of city alleys, of partially opened bedroom doors.You get a sense that the Wachowski brothers gave more than a little nod to HP as well in the cultish mythology built within their “Matrix” trilogy. From Talley’s book: “There is truth in myth my friend. Around you they walk even now, floating before your blind eyes. They are the flash in the corner of your vision, the shadow of moving where no now walks, the feeling of a presence, when you are completely alone, the whisper in the darkness. That which is, and was, and will be again.”The following expresses the fulcrum upon which the story balances. Carter chats with the men in the pub between tales:“Ah, the consummate skeptic,” the Captain said.“And I would wear the name gladly,” I replied, “for it’s only the skeptic that gives value to the truth.""“Yes,” the Captain said nodding, “but only when he is open to the truth. The skeptic with a closed mind becomes the worst kind of believer.""Myths run deep and rampant within the story. And while the heft of the stories themselves focus on it, the characters themselves act as authorial mouthpiece for its’ analysis. The four individual stories, as well as the connective tissue of the arching narrative, address the threads of an uber-world religion…references to a common foe, to common legends, regionalized as each peoples evolved over time. “But as I said before, in all myth is truth. And do we not see, in the myths of all civilizations, this believe, this feeling, that the gods have lived amongst us? That they have walked on the Earth? That they have ruled it? And at some point were overthrown? From the ancient sands of Egypt to garden-girdled Babylon. From the schools of Greece to the most high and palmy state of Rome, all speak of the same legend, the same faith.”The writing is a bit clunky in parts and the stories are derivative. Some questionable plot points drive the narrative here and there, but upon reflection, this is likely due to the nascent efforts of an author learning and perfecting his trade. Overall, the book is well-written, the arching plot is well connected and the individual stories, though predictable, are well thought out and do well to build upon the Lovecraftian foundation.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it’s launching pad for me into the discovery of more Lovecraftian lore as well as Talley’s second novel - “The Void”.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q8D3QPZ3TXR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RR20RM#wasThisHelpful","R2Q8D3QPZ3TXR8","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Something…Something, something, something. Happened. Happened. Something happened.""Jamie Morton in Stephen King’s “Revival""“Revival” is a very modern Stephen King novel that channels H.P. Lovecraft at his cyclopean best. His key characters are bold, if not as bold as some of his best work, and his themes are of familiar King material. King is often hammered by critics (professional and amateur alike) for his weak endings. But this ending is strong and memorable. It’s monstrous, dark and creepy as hell. It’s pure Lovecraft and beautiful in it’s austerity.King has said that his fans love and return to his work, not because they love horror or any specific genre, but they love his very recognizable voice. His voice is strong within the characters, themes and memorable lines. While King’s primary character, Jamie Morton, is not a writer by trade in “Revival"", we are reading his story; reviewing the tale he’s written with the benefit of hindsight. King still knows what he knows and he knows the psyche of authors: “…writing is a wonderful and terrible thing. It opens deep wells of memory that were previously capped.""“Revival” is a story about religion and anti-religion. A story about belief and the loss of belief…and an inability to believe. Morton and Paster Charles Jacobs orbit around each other their entire lives. Jacobs opens Morton’s eyes to God, but when his wife and child are taken from him in an awful automobile accident, their worlds diverge sharply only to reconnect, bounce off of each other, and return again.“…everyone needs a miracle or two, just to prove life is more than just one long trudge from the cradle to the grave.""Religion, belief and obsession are the driving themes of King’s story. King writes about Paster Jacobs, “He spoke with the patience of a true believer. Or a lunatic.” It’s a fine, and often, undefinable, line. Jacobs then transforms, turns his back on true religion. “Religion is the theological equivalent of a quick-buck insurance scam, where you pay in your premium year after year, and then, when you need the benefits you paid for so—pardon the pun—so religiously, you discover the company that took your money does not, in fact, exist.""As usual, King scatters ‘easter eggs’ throughout his novel. He works in a reference to his own “Joyland”. He drops an analogy between Pastor Jacobs and Ahab’s obsessions with the great white whale. And you’ll find a not-so-subtle reference to the author of Frankenstein, while foreshadowing of his rather electric finale — a woman named Janice Shelley, who naturally has a daughter named Mary.This isn’t King's best, but it’s a wonderful read with a fulfilling conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJO7I0N4WG5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILHW6AG#wasThisHelpful","R3FJO7I0N4WG5E","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“We are a religion of captains hoping to go down with the ship…the truth is that what moves the lifeblood of our faith is a thumping impulse toward self-destruction. “Greater love has no one than this,"" Jesus says in the gospel of John. “To lay down one’s life for one’s friends.””- from Ian Caldwell’s “The Fifth Gospel”This is a very strong (and long-awaited) second offering by the co-author of “The Rule of Four”. I won’t spend much time summarizing the story lines…plenty of those words exist already...but suffice it to say that the plot orbits the Shroud of Turin and a newly discovered fifth Gospel. Caldwell’s a bit inconsistent through the first half of the book, in developing the series of mysteries, both secular and non-. But the smoldering plot ignites about midway through. The book is very smart…at times confusing, but very much worth the patience in understanding and learning. Patience is a virtue.This is certainly similar to Dan Brown and yet it's not. Yes, there exists a mystery and yes, it revolves around a Catholic relic. The story itself is strong: in-depth Catholic knowledge not required. But one won't avoid reading this book and feeling smarter for it.  I found myself engrossed by Caldwell’s deft hand at baking an almost religious dissertation (without seeming preachy), woven cleanly around the multi-threaded plot.Brown has his almost superhuman Robert Langdon, and Caldwell has his Father Alex Andreou. Andreou's smart, wise and a little crafty, but far more human and, in many ways, realistic than Langdon. Langdon is a hero. Fr. Alex is a human. “The Fifth Gospel” is emotionally poignant, drawn subtly around Father Alex and those closest to him, and I’m not ashamed to admit that tears came to my eyes at two different points near the end of the book.Father Alex narrates the following, perhaps even giving a little nod to the every increasing popularity of religiously-based thriller fiction: “Priests underestimate the appetite of payment for cheap thrills about Jesus. Most of us roll our eyes at the prospect of new gospels. Every cave in Israel seems to contain one, and most turn out to have been written centuries after Chris by little sects of Christian heretics, or else forged for the publicity.""""The Fifth Gospel"" is a very good thriller/mystery. But it's more than the latest pseudo-archaeo-Dan Brown clone. It's about family, brothers, and sacrifice.Highly Recommended.I received this through the Amazon Vine program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HS2LHX1MEJDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451694148#wasThisHelpful","R3HS2LHX1MEJDC","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just tried this pillow on a trip from Washington D.C. to Buenos Aires, with one layover. I loved it, to be honest.

It's dense, but pliable and very sturdy.There's only one drawback in my mind (assuming you like a more firm pillow) - there's no easy way to carry this hands-free. It fit into my backpack (normal size travel pack) but only barely. There's a thin elastic band that allows you to wrap it around things, but I didn't find it all that practical.

"""On the other side of the coin— Lucifer’s side— the belief that he does not exist at all is an enormous advantage that he has never enjoyed to such a great degree. It is the ultimate camouflage. Not to believe in evil is not to be armed against it. To disbelieve is to be disarmed. If your will does not accept the existence of evil, you are rendered incapable of resisting evil. Those with no capacity of resistance become prime targets for Possession.""- from Malachi Martin's ""Hostage to the Devil""I've had my eye on this little piece of non-fiction history/horror for a few years. But between us...I was too scared to read it. Religiously-based horror is the sub-genre that freaks me out the most (and when you throw children in the mix!? Forget about it). But for this Halloween season I took a deep breath and jumped in.I'm not religious, and would consider myself a fairly skeptical individual. I do love fiction and I have a broad capacity to suspend my disbelief. Malachi Martin's novel is a piece of non-fiction - true stories of possession and exorcism.Martin describes these exclusively contemporary accounts as ""dramatic illustrations of the way in which personal and intelligent evil moves cunningly along the lines of contemporary fads and interests, and within the usual bounds of experience of ordinary men and women.” That’s cool. I’ll suspend my disbelief for that!The five stories of possession (and a sixth smaller story) are bracketed by Martin's analyses of possession, exorcism and their place within contemporary popular history and church culture. His writing is clear and vocabulary large. His writing is infused with a palpable passion and erudite depth.Malachi describes: ""The stories that are told on these occasions are dramatic and painful: strange physical ailments in the possessed; marked mental derangement; obvious repugnance to all signs, symbols, mention, and sight of religious objects, places, people, ceremonies.""Each story runs about 80 pages, though a reader's expectations should be clear: the exorcism itself runs 10-20 pages at the most. The rest of the stories detail the backstory of each victim and each priest. The stories are not connected by character nor time.I chose to read this book with an 'accepting' mindset. I'm the first to admit, while I'm an iPhone-totin' skeptic and rationalist, I passionately embrace the idea that something supernatural or alien can exist. Martin treats his subject very seriously and addresses the doubters: ""Church authorities always insist on thorough examinations of the person brought to them for Exorcism, an examination conducted by qualified medical doctors and psychiatrists.""""Certainly, many who claim to be possessed or whom others so describe are merely the victims of some mental or physical disease. In reading records from times when medical and psychological science did not exist or were quite undeveloped, it is clear that grave mistakes were made. A victim of disseminated sclerosis, for example, was taken to be possessed because of his spastic jerkings and slidings and the shocking agony in spinal column and joints. Until quite recently, the victim of Tourette’s syndrome was the perfect target for the accusation of “Possessed!”: torrents of profanities and obscenities, grunts, barks, curses, yelps, snorts, sniffs, tics, foot stomping, facial contortions all appear suddenly and just as suddenly cease in the subject. Nowadays, Tourette’s syndrome responds to drug treatment, and it seems to be a neurological disease involving a chemical abnormality in the brain. Many people suffering from illnesses and diseases well known to us today such as paranoia, Huntington’s chorea, dyslexia, Parkinson’s disease, or even mere skin diseases (psoriasis, herpes I, for instance), were treated as people “possessed” or at least as “touched” by the Devil.""The book is vivid, without being lewd nor lurid. Martin is graphic, and while the book isn’t dramatically frightening, it’s inherent topic is downright scary. ""Violent physical transformations seem sometimes to make the lives of the possessed a kind of hell on earth. Their normal processes of secretion and elimination are saturated with inexplicable wrackings and exaggeration...Reflexes sometimes become sporadic or abnormal, sometimes disappear for a time. Breathing can cease for extended periods. Heartbeats are hard to detect. The face is strangely distorted, sometimes also abnormally tight and smooth without the slightest line or furrow.""“Hostage to the Devil” is extremely well written, thought out and considered, and freely dips into theological considerations across a range of secular and non secular ideas. This book is quite heavy, with numerous pages covering the psychophysical characteristics of each characters relation to the specific event. It's an enjoyable, but not easy, read.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRH5T26L85MQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOQGF80#wasThisHelpful","RRH5T26L85MQZ","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Bombs and Believers"" is a serviceable, if not inventive, thriller cut from the Dan Brown cloth. Ancient mysteries, global intrigue, archeological puzzles and mildly bland characters drive a plot that reaches from LA to London to Istanbul.Let me know if this sounds familiar: a preeminent archeologist is murdered hours before he's scheduled to announce the discovery of a lifetime. An LA detective of art crime falls in with the archaeologists' protege and the two find themselves chasing after one of the most mysteries and awe-inspiring statues in all of Greek antiquity. See? It's fun, but not particularly new.Soneclar's writing is tight, and his plot-logic is well considered. The story as as a straight-up thriller is enjoyable and even at almost 450 pages is a very fast read. Readers of this Dan Brown will recognize the genre-heavy themes of terrorist threats, nations on the brink of world war, fabulously wealthy and shallow evil-doers, and cardboard thin government operatives.There's just no depth to this story, and perhaps could've been well-served by greater focus on fewer characters.All the above considered - ""Bombs and Believers"" is still an enjoyable read. I wasn't tempted to stop in the middle, and found myself reading well past my bedtime.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UB2OESY7BE5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9I1SCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UB2OESY7BE5G","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Word of God willed its completion, after all.""- from Alix Christie's ""Gutenberg's Assistant""Alix Christie has written a fabulously passionate ode to the written word. Clearly a student of the 'Ars impressoria' (art of engraving), Christie builds a sepia-toned portrait of the late Middle Ages, with a myriad of characters who burst through the narrative to color the realities of this uniquely world-changing period of history.Great historical fiction is grounded in the 'touch and feel' of a place and time. Christie finely textures her world with a sturdy poetic sense that splendidly blends the historical sense of the moments with a clear ardor she has for the printed word.Christie centers her story around Peter Shoeffer, the real-life apprentice (at first), and later 'shop' boss for Johann Gutenberg in his printing workshop. Peter's adopted father asks him to return to Mainz, Germany from Paris where he was enjoying the life of a monastic scribe. Peter was ""…a man of letters, a cleric, a scribe. He bore the tools of his profession in a pouch slung like a quiver at his side: the sealed horn of ink, his quills and reeds, his bone and chalk and chamois.""""The textura lettering was squat and ugly, yet every string of letters was unnervingly even, all across the line. Each of those lines ended with an utter, chilling harmony, at precisely the same distance from the edge. What hand could write a line that straight, and end exactly underneath the one above? What human hand could possibly achieve a thing so strange? He felt his hear squeeze and his soul flood with an overwhelming dread.""- description of Peter Shoeffer's first look at a sample page run off of Gutenberg's press.Religion is a pervasive force in the lives of the people in Mainz. From Peter's youth, he recalls his master's words: ""Your hand is but His tool. The parchment that we write on is pure conscience, on which all good works are noted. The rule that we use to draw the lines for writing is God's will. The ink with which we write is pure humility, the desk on which we write the calming of our hearts.""This religious specter floats over the entire notion of the written word delivered by anything other than the human hand. Writing is akin to religion. The act of putting thought to paper, next to godliness. What then is the press? I couldn't help but connect the introduction of automated printing, to the more recent lettered debates centered on the arrival of the ebook (though on a much less religious scale, of course).Gutenberg lives in a world of guilds, corrupt religious leaders, and where people don't have to think too far back to remember the horrors of the Black Death. Describing a scene at a local tavern, Peter describes ""Elders all, patricians from the city or the minor nobles from the land: the clergy was made up of second sons from wealthy families, stashed and suckled by the Mother Church for life.""It's a world of reformation, fear, and paranoia. Christie captures this world through a religious weightiness to her prose; a serious communion between the words of her novel and the printed word's of Peter's and Gutenberg's within the story.Of course this story is based on the real life events surrounding the printing of the Gutenberg Bible. It didn't just 'happen', there were years of exceedingly hard, and mundane, work, amidst a world stepping out of the Medieval darkness and into the light of the Renaissance. Christie deftly intertwines the more easily written drama between characters and classes, with the more difficult dramatization of the technical aspects of the printing itself.""When you get to my age, Peter, you do begin to wonder. If it really is a gift from God---and not a curse sent up from hell.""- Gutenberg to Peter, in Alex Christies 'Gutenberg's Apprentice'While Peter's personal story includes his adoptive family, a love interest that introduces a view into Middle Ages Germany's class distinctions, Christie's tale orbits around the explosive personality of Johann Gutenberg. He's really cast as mad scientist – moody, aggressive, undeniably driven. As Peter reflects on the years (yes years!) printing the now-famous bible he considers, ""Much has been said in the decades since, but almost none of it is true. They've practically canonized the man who found this wondrous art. How Gutenberg would laugh if he could see them from above…or else below.""The most exquisite drama of the novel is the growing reformation of religious attitudes and worldwide outlook. Gutenberg's press was introduced during a time when class wars were playing over the halls of Mainz and were reflected in the church's ever lessening control over its population. Revolution was in the air. An overhaul of Church abuses was on the horizon. Gutenberg and Shoeffer race to publish the first editions of the book before the secrets of their methods for publishing quickly and inexpensively (at least relative to the hand-copying method of monastic scribes) float up to the corrupt church.My only wish for this novel is that it would've come with a map or two, as there's a significant amount of traveling in and around Mainz, and perhaps a diagram or two of the actual press itself.I received this book through the Amazon Vine program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0FHUGSWH3TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336010#wasThisHelpful","R3M0FHUGSWH3TP","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zepp 3D Baseball Swing Analyzer is a very simple-to-use, informative tool to help improve your baseball swing. My 10-year-old son placed the product on the end of his bat, downloaded and registered the app, and was off and swinging. It's extremely easy to get started.The core of the Zepp product is a small widget that snugly fits within the hyperactive-green grip that's placed on the butt end of the bat. The 'widget' communicates with your mobile device and communicates information based on the movement of the bat including bat speed, the plane of the swing and the angle of the bat when it connects with the ball.The app only registers swings that connect with a ball (which is extremely helpful), and immediately translates the data into easy-to-read information and visuals on your mobile device. The app also retains a history of your data so you can track your improvement over time.The only issue I have with the Swing Analyzer, is that there was only one way I was able to determine what the swing analysis actually meant. Zepp has kindly incorporated a way to compare your data with that of a professional...so you can easily see how you compare from a straight statistical perspective. It still doesn't help me understand what I'm trying to do, or how/where I need to improve exactly (other than bat speed which is obvious). Zepp does not provide any further analysis on their website, however I'm guessing that they expect a community of message boards and sharing to build a base of swing learnings and education.I'm looking forward to seeing my son's swing improve, and sharing with a community of similar-minded players.I received this product from the Amazon Vine Program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ERRQUO9WZ0V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1MYCHG#wasThisHelpful","R1ERRQUO9WZ0V4","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The king of Gettland must be a doting son to Mother War, however ill-suited he might be. He had to prove to the older warriors ranged around the square that he could be more than a one-handed embarrassment.”- from Joe Abercrombie’s “Half a King”Joe Abercrombie has built a reputation on stories both gritty and rough, whose characters are strong and often in ways that are not so obvious. His genre is considered fantasy, but this story has no magic, no dragons, though plenty of action, steel and adventure.“Half a King” is focused on Yarvi, the youngest son of a king, younger brother to the successor to the throne in Gettland. Yarvi is studying to become a Minister - an advisor/wizard (not the magical kind…more of the medieval scientific kind) while forgoing any future claim on crown or wife. Before he ‘graduates’ to Minister, his brother and father are killed through an act of deception, and the young boy, never a fighter, small, weak and with only one fully functional hand is called to the throne.""Only very white, laid out on those chill slabs in that chill room with shrouds drawn up to their armpits and naked swords gleaming on their chests. Yarvi kept expecting his brother’s mouth to twitch in sleep. HIs father’s eyes to open, to meet his with that familiar scorn. But they did not. They never would again. “ While Yarvi swears vengeance on his father and brother, the tables turn quickly in an act of treachery when his Uncle attempts an assassination in order to claim the throne for himself. Yarvi survives but is sold as a slave to a trading ship, chained to a bench and forced to row.Yarvi, much stronger in mind and wit than brawn and muscle, eventually works his way off of the rowing bench. And while ""enemies are the price of success"", Yarvi also collects a handful of friends, an ensemble cast worthy of a series (Abercrombie is, in fact, planning two sequels). Yarvi is the focal point; no single character stands out significantly from the others, but as a group they fulfill the reader through their conflicting and complementary qualities. I couldn't help but make connections to Georege R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". Aside from the very medieval atmosphere, Abercrombie's world is flush with history and mythology. Without hammering the reader with a myriad of meaningless backstory, he subtley introduces the mythological depth of his world's history and slowly reinforces it over the course of the story. Also like Martin, Abercrombie loves to embed gems of wisdom like ""...great warriors die no better than other men. And usually sooner.” Most of these come from Gettland's Minister, Yarvi's wizened old teacher. Think of a modified version of a Martin maester.“Half a King” is strong in tone and bold in voice. The themes are heavy and dark - vengeance, death, slavery, regret. The story is a tad melodramatic, but within the context of this epic tale, the drama is appropriate, while adding to the heft of the atmosphere. Abercrombie balances the weightiness with a sharp sense of humor and sharper wit. He's commented that he wrote this book with a young adult audience in mind. While the story is ""clean"" there was very little indication, other than its length, that implied ""young adult”.I received this book though the Amazon Vine program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PHT9U1FHJYBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178321#wasThisHelpful","R3PHT9U1FHJYBI","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Hoopoes coated the town like frosting, piped along the rain gutters of the governor’s mansion and slathered on the gilt dome of the Orthodox church. In the trees around Yakob and Leah Cohen’s house the flock seemed especially excited, chattering, flapping their wrings, and hopping from branch to branch like a crowd of peasants lining the streets of the capital for an imperial parade. The hoopoes would probably have been regarded as an auspicious sign, where it not for the unfortunate events that coincided with Eleonora’s birth.”- from “The Oracle of Stamboul” by Michael David LukasAmid portents that include this ‘conference’ of birds, Eleonora Cohen is come into this world. Signs, signs, everywhere there’s signs. An ancient prophecy (which is never detailed) foretold the birth of this very unique child. “Just after twilight, in that ethereal hour when the sky moves through purple to darkness, the hoopoes fell silent. The gunshots ceased and the rumbling of hoofbeats whittled to nothing. It was as if the entire world had paused to take a breath. In that moment, a weary groan choked out of the bedroom, followed by a fleshy slap and the cry of a newborn child.”This wonderful story follows the travails of a young and uniquely gifted girl in late 19th Century Europe. Motherless, Eleonora (and her flock of hoopoes) stows away on a streamliner destined for (I)Stamboul, where her father intends to spend a month selling oriental rugs. Eleonora is not just a special child. But a girl. A jewish girl. A savant.Her flock feeds her, protects her, scouts for her. “With time....it became apparent that their attraction was connected in some way to Eleonora. It was almost as if they regarded her as part of their flock, the queen without which their lives had no purpose. They slept when she slept, stood guard while she bathed, and when she left the house, a small contingency broke off to follow along overhead""The hoopoes are referenced in an ancient allegory which casts the bird as a Sufi master who leads a group of thirty pupils on a pilgrimage to find God. It's an appropriate metaphor for Eleonora and the ever growing role she plays within the Caliph's court in Stamboul.“The hoopoes would have been more surprising perhaps if Eleonora were not such an extraordinary creature herself. Even when she was an infant in her nurse’s arms, one could already discern the first shoots of what would later blossom into a stunning and demure beauty, her pleasant flushing cheeks crowned with a next of curls, wide green eyes the color of sea glass, and milk teeth like tiny cubes of ivory. She rarely cried, took her first steps at eight months, and was speaking in complete sentences by the age of two.”The story takes place during a time when Stamboul is in transition. The Ottoman ways are very much in place and settled in. The world around them is changing. The Sultan, Abdulhamid II, is slowly finding ways to modernize his kingdom, but the world is simply moving to fast to keep up. The Sultan finds an odd ally and advisor in the sweetly naive jewish girl.Lukas' engaging writing style paints a colorful world of Sultans and court politics. His characters are subtlety complex, well-fleshed through poetic prose and sensible plot points. The deftly layered personalities are well-structured over the course of the book.My only negative is that the story could easily have carried additional pages. I was sad to say farewell to the world of this extraordinary girl.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVM6J9T93VB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HD62T4#wasThisHelpful","R3MVM6J9T93VB1","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“No one had ever spoken to the great unwashed as an equal, held them to their breast, cooed to them like lovers, whispered hatred for those they hated: the rich; the privileged; the whole pointless, pathetic history of their nation.""- Gregory Widen's Evita in ""Blood Makes Noise""Evita maintains a special place in popular culture. Already an amazing icon in South America, Andrew Lloyd Weber raised her profile to an unaware but willing world-wide audience. It's arguable that Madonna took it even further and certainly introduced Argentina's former First Lady to a new generation of pseudo historical/pop cultural fans.Novelist and screenplay writer Gregory Widen, builds on the foundation of the Evita mystique to create an interesting, but uneven, thriller surrounding the disappearance of Evita's body following her death and her husband's exile. Widen points out in his author's note, “Of all the strange things presented in this novel, perhaps the strangest of all is how much of it actually happened.""A bit hokey and evocative of a dime-store novel lineage, ""Blood Makes Noise"" is at times melodramatic and often without a sniff of subtlety, but its not specifically charmless. Widen's testosterone-leaden tone and prose is both exhilarating and annoying. In its' second half, the novel becomes mawkish, and the plot loses its way from what was originally a solid series of plot elements.“Evita. In life she’d shattered the pointless cycles of Argentine politics, flung open the gates of history to the great ignored, and ruled them as their pampa Cinderella. This bastard of a cow baron’s toady, the kept daughter of a kept mother of a kept town, rocketed into history on the shoulders of a dream-crazy mob that sang of her, named stars after her, and on her death, at a still-beautiful thirty-three, choked and paralyzed a country with grief.”While the story's centerpiece is Her body, the plot focuses on Michael Suslov, best described by Widen himself, ""twenty-four years old and fresh from spook camp and the frat-boy world view, was sent south, the first new blood in these parts since the consolidation in ’47. The first of the new CIA. And they hated him on sight. Ignored him...and every moment of every day for four years reminded Michael that he worked not for Buenos Aires station but for them.”Suslov was born in La Boca, one of the poorest sections of Buenos Aires, and naturally had a disturbing and fairly traumatic upbringing. In 1951, he and his emotional baggage have returned to Argentina in the service of a 'new' cold war CIA. He's met Evita a time or two and he's moderately swept up by the passion she's introduced to a country he's not excited to be in.“That every nation is given one light, one shining instant, and She was ours. Before Her, after Her, we are just immigrant chaos at the bottom of the world.""At its best, ""Blood Makes Noise"" paints an interesting portrayal of obsessive personalities, spiraling in a never-redemptive loop of anger, violence and dismay. Widen writes descriptively, if a bit cinematic in its visuals. Often it's over the top, but not terribly inconsistent with the tone of the plot. At its worst, the story is rushed, the plot points barely connected. And this is it's downfall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGV2R90NOK6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KP9VI8#wasThisHelpful","RJGV2R90NOK6V","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You're my only witness, Miss Payne. Everyone else is dead. But you were there. Those crucial three days when the tomb was found, when Carter breached the wall into its antechamber, looked through and saw his ""wonderful things""…You were close by. You knew the people involved. You witnessed the events after that, you watched the story unfold. To me, your memories are like a treasure house.""- An interview with Lucy Payne in Sally Beauman's ""The Visitors""Sally Beauman delivers an amazing piece of historical fiction, in which she evokes a world of English colonialism with characters who have real depth and a vibrant pulse. Beauman finds a poignant balance of voice among her mostly youthful leads, intermingled with their English and American upper class parents, and some real-world stars of post World War I society.The fulcrum on which the story is balanced, is the 1922 discovery of King Tutanhkhaum's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. A fictional Lucy Payne is recovering from typhoid that has taken her mother, and is introduced to non-fictional players that surrounded Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter in the year leading up to his magnificent discovery. Lucy narrates her tale that bounces between her 11th and 12th years in Egypt and England and the present day where she's interviewed for a documentary on King Tut and Carter's discoveries.""Too much past. So many lost people.""- Lucy, from ""The Visitors""Death Surrounds and permeates the story like a dank countryside mist: Egyptian mummies, Lucy's mother, Frances' brother, a family friend, and even more as the story progresses. The theme is at moments dark, but there's always a sense of renewal, of hope. At times haunting, ""The Vistitors"" thematically skips between ruminations on death, history, and the eye-awakening growth from childhood to adolescence and the leap into adulthood.Beauman's prose is often poetic; equally strong in its ability to describe an Egyptian sunset over the Nile, as it is in it's sparing and affecting dialogue. Lucy considers her past, one marred with intense relationships and profound sadness, ""I could feel ghosts gathering. They're now as familiar with my house as I am. They like to cluster, especially by the stairs. Today their mood seemed amicable; it is not always so.""""I never escape. I never shake the Valley off, it's always in my mind.""- Howard Carter comments during an offseason spent in the English countryside.Howard Carter isn't quite a primary character, but his aura pervades the story, he's a constant influence. He's portrayed as visionary and temperamental. He's obsessed with his discovery and driven with his need to complete his quest. Another character puts a finer point on how Carter's perceived. ""Maybe Carter's a genius with an ace up his sleeve. Maybe he's a misguided dreamer - and a fool.""While the story focuses on Lucy's journey through these key moments in her life, we get a glimpse of Carter's journey, viewed through the eyes of a twelve year old. And through her unique lens, we see a changing world as well. Discovery and science are moving past the 'gentleman explorer'. ""The day of the amateur excavator is over...Welcome to the brave new world of the trained professional. Welcome to the universities and museums, to scientific exaction, performed by men bristling with doctorates,"" one character states. Egypt's fight for independence from British rule runs through the background, all too reminiscent of our own modern Arab spring.Lucy's world is one that orbits an upper crust English society headed by Lord Carnarvon and filled out by an upper middle class that seems vaguely aware of the societal revolutions around them. There's a definitive ""Downton Abby"" vibe, as Beauman captures English Colonial era dialogue among the upper class gentry. Lord Carnarvon's real-life castle is, in fact, the location of Downton Abby itself.Beauman strikes a perfect tone in establishing the relationships and emotions which make up the driving threads of the plot lines: Lucy and her friends Frances, Rose and Pete, her step-mother Nicola, and her nanny Miss Mack. Beauman also balances the thrill and tensions of the discovery itself, with the self-discovery we witness within Lucy.There's a smidgen of romance, but the true romance of the story resides in its very unique timeframe and locations. The discovery of King Tut makes for a very particular place in history, and Beauman deftly encapsulates what it might have been like to live in that era. On the backbone of the fun and excitement of the Tut discovery, Beauman has built a fully developed set of characters.With it's combination of discovery, exploration, and lifelike emotional characters, I couldn't recommend this book more strongly.I received this book as part of the Amazon Vine program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZJPFHDPL8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006230268X#wasThisHelpful","RTZJPFHDPL8E","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The voices sank and rose, sank and rose higher. It was like the north wind when it blows screaming through mountain gorges; like the keening of a thousand widows in a burning town; like the cry of she-wolves to the moon. And under it, over it, through our blood and skulls and entrails, the bellow of a the gong.”- from Mary Renault’s “The King Must Die""Mary Renault weaves a tale so mythic in scope, that the story itself is only outshone by her fabulous prose. Beyond a vague awareness of the Minotaur, I was not familiar with the ancient Greek tales of Theseus. Renault takes the myth and works her narrative like Hephaestus works metal; into a believable and credible story.The novel is flush with gods and goddesses, though not in a true physical sense nor are they metaphysically present, but they persist within the psyche of the Greek people (note: there was no ‘Greece’ in this period, but for the sake of saving space, I’ll generalize). Theseus believes fully in their existence and his fate that's tied to their whims.Is he human? Is he a god? Or did he spawn from something in between? He certainly believes in the supernatural, and that he has an exceptional relationship with Poseidon. He is driven by fate and faith. His entire existence is colored by the mythical hands from above (and below) that guide his life’s path.He is crushed when Ariadne, the daughter of Crete’s King Minos, shockingly relates the planning involved prior to her reading of oracles, “We have ninety clerks working in the Palace alone. It would be a chase every month, if no one knew what the oracles were going to be.” Ariadne’s pragmatic revelation that creates a crack in Theseus’ fate…one, though, that he’s able to keep from spreading.The mythic themes provide the outline for Renault’s story. Medea, the mistress of Theseus’ (human) father, spits this curse, which touches on the well-know elements of the Theseus myth: “You will cross water to dance in blood. You will be King of the victims. You will tread the maze through fire, and you will tread it through darkness. Three bulls are waiting for you, son of Aigeus. The Earth Bull, and the Man Bull and the Bull from the Sea.”Within this context, the ‘historical’ aspect to this ‘historical' fiction is very realistic and true to its age and time. The historical misogyny is appropriate in the world and age of Theseus and is often chivalric in it’s own way. The battlefield amongst male and female gods is a significant theme and Theseus travels between societies who sometimes favor the gods and others who favor the goddesses.Theseus remembering an exchange with his Grandfather when he was still a boy, explaining a violent animal sacrifice to a young boy grappling with it’s meaning. “I had no word to say to him. The seed is still, when first it falls into the furrow.” Like Theseus’ Grandfather, Renault prose plants seeds which grow over time to expose their full meaning and understanding.I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EE0DBOG06OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCGJ6UO#wasThisHelpful","R5EE0DBOG06OS","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The tiger would pity the fawn, the wolf would weep over its lamb before the Mongol would cringe at the corpse of a child.""- from ""The Mongoliad""""Mongoliad"" is a lot of bluster but little substance. An alternate historical fiction of the middle ages during the reign of Ogedai Khan - Genghis' youngest son - the story follows several indistinct characters and loosely differentiated plot lines across a devastated European landscape. The Mongols are raping and pillaging while Ogedai struggles with alcoholism fueled by the stress of his job (granted, he's ruling an ever-expanding empire with a myriad of borders to defend, Christians to overwhelm, and family members looking to overthrow his rule).The specific story follows a band of crusaders known as the ""Shield Brethren"" whose goals ultimately focus on the heart of the Mongol empire itself. The band breaks into two, which creates dual focus for the plot, while a third lens is aimed at two lesser players in Ogedai's court at Karakoram. I won't bother to detail the plots because they're not even interesting enough to remember, let alone take the energy to recount.The book is enjoyable enough while reading. The plot moves at a solid pace and the plethora of authors know how to spin a good yarn. But overall, the book just falls flat. The characters are bland and mostly superficial. The motivations that drive the plot are thin, and the action between the handful of battles is one-dimensional. Because ""Book One"" has literally no conclusions, I'm mildly motivated to pick up ""Book Two"", but I have no driving need to find out how things continue, let alone wrap up.Buy this for an airplane ride, or sleepy days at the beach. Prepare to be underwhelmed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2F51FBKOVHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007S0EF24#wasThisHelpful","RS2F51FBKOVHL","A3ATAPFSNLF3EY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATAPFSNLF3EY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is worth a watch, though, especially if you like this series. Insidious Chapter 3 focuses on Lin Shaye's character Elise before the events of Chapter 1, and the parts of the plot that center directly on her are by far the best. As the film opens she gets a visit from Quinn Brenner (Stephanie Scott) a teenager who wants to connect with her deceased mother. Only, Quinn's already been reaching out by herself, which anyone who's heard of a ouija board knows you're not supposed to do. Quinn is easy to sympathize with. She's a bright girl who wants to be an actress and has assumed household responsibilities that used to belong to her mother. You see her father Sean (Dermot Mulroney) wanting to keep his contractor business competitive and losing patience with Quinn's desire to pursue her own college dreams because he doesn't have time to run herd on little brother Alex (Tate Berney) by himself. Sean redeems himself when Quinn winds up in danger, and the movie thankfully doesn't waste too much time with 'nobody believes me' time-wastiness. Alex is actually the one who finds the dynamic duo of Tucker And Specs online (shades of Ghostfacers there). I won't spoil anymore, but despite the sympathetic characters and familiar faces, Chapter 3 was just not as scary as previous chapters, although it certainly has some moments.I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars, but this form won't let me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CB8CAJSACM91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYTI816#wasThisHelpful","R3CB8CAJSACM91","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love real maple syrup, but it's pricey. Other members of my family are not crazy about real tree syrup and prefer the flavor and texture of the fake stuff. This organic pancake syrup is a nice compromise for us. It's made of cane sugar and it does have a maple-reminiscent taste and a thick texture. We all like it. I'm less fond of the bottle this comes in. The not-inconsiderable weight of the syrup is all in the lower half of the bottle and the handle is way on the top, so you're holding it by the light end, which makes for an off-balance pour. Also, the teardrop shaped opening combined with the thickness of this syrup means you will always get a giant dollop of syrup followed by a thin thread whenever you pour.

Don't leave it too long, because unlike some of the other eblows in this series, this mac can overcook rather easily. The cheese sauce is very creamy and mine was definitely fresh. It's just so mild tasting it almost tastes like nothing. This is especially a problem if you are going to add anything to it, like the chicken and broccoli recommended on the box.

"l really really do. I have a passel of streaming memberships, and it's hard to get the most of out of them without the use of a streaming device. Roku 2 makes it very easy to relay those memberships to the comfort of your television set, even if that TV is not smart or even HD. All you have to do is connect the Roku to the TV, put the TV on the auxiliary channel, power up the Roku and connect it to your WiFi, let it get the latest updates and then set up your free Roku account. From there, you need to connect your streaming accounts to the Roku device. It's easy to do. The screen pops up a virtual keyboard and you use the arrows on the remote to log in. You can also set up the accounts on your computer if you prefer, but honestly I've had a tougher time using the virtual keyboard on my eReader than on the Roku 2. This version of the Roku also has a set of earbuds that plug into the remote control so you can watch in the wee hours of the morning without annoying the neighbors. The quality of the Roku's picture depends a lot on the quality of your TV's picture, but I've found it to be equal to anything else I've played on this TV, although sometimes the aspect ratio needs a bit of tweaking. It does tend to start running warm the longer you leave it on, and there isn't really an off switch on this machine, so I unplug it when I'm not using it.

"I'm never sure how to rate a movie I enjoyed in spite of itself. Witchtrap is made by the same people who brought us Witchboard and Night of the Demons, so that gives you a little notion of what to expect. Expect something closer to Witchboard in tone and execution, though be aware this is not a sequel. Seriously, the distributor wants viewers to be aware of that, it's on the box. Actually, if you've ever seen the miniseries Rose Red then you're familiar with the cast and plot. This, like Rose Red, is a variation on Shirley Jackson's The Haunting. A team of parapsychologists are hired to cleanse an old property of a warlock's ghost so that the inheritor can turn the place into a bed and breakfast. Each member of the team is going into the job with their own preconceptions and motivations, some of them conflicting. You've got the parapsychologist leading the charge who can't wait to try out her new witch trap, her husband the spirit medium, their colleague who specializes in filming ghostly phenomena (played by Linnea Quigley), two grumpy private detectives and their avaricious boss tagging along to make sure they don't destroy the property in their zeal to find ghosts, and the reluctant physical medium whose presence could endanger them all. Because the dead warlock is still on the premises and he has a plan. He also has a groundskeeper lurking about to make sure that plan goes off without a hitch. The script is actually quite competent. Sure it's derivative and the dialogue is riddled with cliches, but it's derivative and cliche-ridden in a very entertaining manner. The script to Ouija wishes it was this fun. It's the acting and special effects that are (mostly) incompetent, in the most hilarious ways. You kind of have to see it to believe it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LUNPY13MHJJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001WDULS#wasThisHelpful","R2LUNPY13MHJJW","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The strength of this duct is in the coils. While the coils are tight the duct is quite strong. When it's stretched out, it becomes ridiculously easy to crush. So, if you plan on using this in a space where it's length is not going to be compromised by too much stretching you're probably okay. This  the type of duct that is currently being recommended to prevent fire hazards. Just be aware that if you are putting this on an appliance that has to come away from the wall for installation and then go back in place, you are probably going to inadvertently stretch it past its stress limit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAWOOOAHB4DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00287YBAS#wasThisHelpful","RAAWOOOAHB4DE","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These clamps need some patience to put on. Patience, swearing, and acetaminophen afterwards. One side's easy to connect because you are not squeezed into a space close to the wall yet. The screws have to go on in a certain direction or they'll just pop open again, and you have to be able to squeeze the clamps shut at an ideal angle to screw the sucker shut or else that screw ain't moving. If you're working with plenty of space that's not a big problem. Once you're ready to connect the other side though, that is where the fun begins. Have you ever tried to climb over a dryer in a very tight space? I don't recommend it. If I had to do it all over again I'd get the worm type of clamps instead.

"I like low-flow fixed shower-heads. I have no need for a hose, and I don't like being pelted with water. A good low-flow shower-head has enough water pressure to give a soft, steady stream of water throughout the shower. This Sava has the additional benefit of a wide radius, surrounding you with the water so you don't get cold. You'll never miss the extra gpm on this baby. It doesn't come with plumber's tape but I keep a supply of my own around that's better quality than most shower-heads have in the box anyway.

"I got this for my mother, who likes to sit in the tub and wash her hair before filling the tub with bathwater. This handheld shower has a nice, long slinky hose. Plenty long enough to hook to the soap dish with the portable grip. The hose is stainless steel and quite flexible, being made with links instead of the stiffer mesh I've seen on some other hoses. There is an on/off switch to stop the flow of water while attending to tasks like scrubbing hair. The picture at the top is apparently of an older model that used a button. The customer supplied image is accurate: it is a twist nozzle now. If there are any weak spots in the assembly, that on/off switch will be your leak test. The water has nowhere to go but back out whatever spot is not adequately covered. And on that note, I highly recommend you to use your own plumber's tape instead of the straggly bit they give you in the package. Also, even though this unit is supposed to be tool-free installation, I recommend using a wrench to tighten the connections. If you want higher water pressure, I will chime in with everybody else to recommend leaving the red washer out of the assembly, because that red piece will slow the flow of water by quite a bit. The shower head itself is of a decent size and has the usual three massage settings: misty rain, hard rain and drill a pothole rain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXV07FWLM937/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IV0DAS#wasThisHelpful","R3VXV07FWLM937","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am fairly impressed with this desk. Most of the time when I've shopped online for a cheap desk, I pick something that looks nice in the picture and wind up with a pvc and particle board nightmare. This desk is made of hard metal and heavy composite wood. Very heavy. This thing weighs over fifty pounds! It's not flimsy at all, except for the washers (more on that in a moment). It's a youth desk, but I am a short adult and it fits me just fine. In fact I think it could stand to be a little shorter. The only way to adjust this desk is by leaving off the bottom frame and/or the bottom pegs. I'd rather leave it as is just because it would be a pain in the arse to take any of it apart again. Putting it together is about the only drawback of this desk. The instructions leave MUCH to be desired. I'll give you some hints in case you decide to buy this desk: the washers are meant to cradle the pegs so as to protect the desk's marble-looking finish. If you put them in wrong side down, the washers will tear. The pegs that hold the screens have holes in them where the screws go. You will need to screw the pegs in at an angle to make sure the holes can align. The legs for the bottom look identical, but the ones for the back have holes in them for - you guessed it - the screen that goes in the back. On that note, you cannot rely on the welding marks or even the shape of the eyes for the screws for how to arrange those legs on the bottom. You just need to make sure those holes are facing backwards or your bottom back screen can't go up. There is an Allen wrench that comes with the kit. You will also need a Phillips head screwdriver (not included). The desk is shaped in such a way that you can place it in a corner without losing a lot of your room's real estate, but you don't have to put it in a corner. The flat back will go up against a wall with no problem. The desk has a nice design for hanging things off of. I have a power strip clamped to one angled side, and two headsets dangling off the top pegs. If you're in the market for a cheap desk and don't mind the cheesy purple and fake marble, you could do a lot worse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXNIZW170TIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNH6IZS#wasThisHelpful","RFXNIZW170TIS","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the best horror movies, ""It Follows"" has a little more going on than just a few jump scares. It wants to unsettle the viewer, and make a few interesting analogies along the way, all while paying homage to the oeuvre of John Carpenter. The story concerns 19 year old Jay, a college student living at home and dreaming of a more independent existence. She decides the time has come to sleep with her new boyfriend Hugh. Or at least, she has been led to believe that his name is Hugh. She'll come to find out his real name is Jeff, and that she should have shown him the curb. He passes on a curse to her that is propagated by sexual activity. I'll let Jeff explain the rules in the move, if you choose to watch it. Suffice it to say that, although the movie never comes right out and says so, the plot incorporates a lot of the succubus legend. Jay finds herself being followed (hence the title) relentlessly by an evil spirit that can look like anyone. Nobody else can see it, but it can effect the physical world just fine and dandy. A lot of the suspense in the movie is generated by wondering if an extra crossing across the back of the frame is going to suddenly make a beeline for our heroine. The director uses this to create dread very effectively with some great tracking shots. There is only one jump scare in here and it is very well earned and easily forgiven. Everything else is pure ""don't open that door"" freakiness. The soundtrack is genius, the setting is inspired, and any fan of ""Halloween"" will spot the references. The ending might be a 'love it or hate it' but personally I loved it. It is (minor spoiler) open ended but with a hopefulness about it. It strikes a balance you don't often see in modern horror, which lately likes to go as dark as possible when it's not an unambiguously happy ending. Give me ambiguously happy any day. That feels more real.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MTIKCM6RT6M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVXMYU4#wasThisHelpful","R2MTIKCM6RT6M2","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Quiet Ones lives up to its name, with a plot that meanders seemingly aimlessly until you realize that it was building up to not one, but two big reveals all the while. Low key incidents and seemingly trivial details that seem irrelevant become relevant in the final act. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very convincing period piece set in the 1970's. The soundtrack is all period-appropriate, with one Slade song used in a particularly memorable way. The fashions, hairdos and makeup all fit. Even the film stock has that distinctive grain, as it should since our hero (Sam Claflin) is the cameraman. The story, like The Apparition (2012), is inspired by the Philip experiment, in which a group of students in Toronto tried to create a poltergeist in support of their thesis that paranormal activity is caused by energy created by living humans. This retelling moves the scene to Oxford University and the motivation of the professor (Jared Harris) is to psychically manifest the entity experienced by a schizophrenic girl (Olivia Cooke) outside of her body in order to then banish it. Or so he says. There's actually more to it than that, but I won't spoil it. Professor Joseph Coupland has two loyal assistants in vixenish Christina (Erin Richards) and Chivalrous Pervert type Harry (Rory Fleck-Byrne) but his cameraman has flounced off the experiment citing an ethical conflict, so he recruits young Brian (Claflin) from a less prestigious school to take over the suddenly vacated role. Then he loses his funding and has to move the experiment off campus, to a dilapidated house in the country. Minor spoiler: this is one of those things that seems random, but isn't. Then things really start getting creepy. The movie is actually at its most effective when it's creeping along on pure mood, or when it's revealing something important to the plot. It suffers a bit when the CGI effects begin. Another problem is that while it's wonderfully acted, the characters  as written are hard to latch onto until well into the film's runtime, which is awfully late for them to fully develop. It's still well worth a look if you like this genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE4E1SD4CL26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8KN4IU#wasThisHelpful","RGE4E1SD4CL26","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used both diatomaceous earth and boric acid before for insecticide alternatives, so I was curious how well this combo would work. I liked that the smaller size came in a canister with a squeeze top on it, that way you can refill with the larger size as you run out of powder. The canister is not as on target with aiming as a DE pistol would be, especially as you have to hold the bottle sideways to get enough powder near the nozzle to manage a decent 'spray,' but it does alright. This is more of a slow acting insect killer than a fast acting one. If you coat a bug that you see running away from you, it's going to keep on running. The best way to use this stuff is the coat areas where you know they're running when you're not looking. Places like under the kitchen sink or behind the refrigerator. Ever since I've been using this product where they're scampering out of my sight, I've gotten up to the dubious joy of finding them dead on the kitchen floor, instead of the undeniable horror of having them run across my feet when I turn on the kitchen light.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P457CEJP3O5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FLV9H2#wasThisHelpful","R2P457CEJP3O5D","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sleepy Hollow takes Washington Irving's story as its basis and then expounds upon it to turn it into a TV show so fantastical you just have to kind of go with it. In this version, Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) is accidentally bound up in a spell with the Headless Horseman, which results in Ichabod waking up in his grave to a whole new world - our world. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie) goes out on a call with her mentor/boss Sheriff August Corbin (Clancy Brown) and the two of them run afoul of the Headless Horseman. Sooner rather than later Abbie's trajectory collides with Ichabod's, and through a series of events I won't spoil here, they find out they have to work together to prevent the Apocalypse. There's a monster of the week element to the show, but it's always tied up in the overall narrative, so there's plenty of mythology building as well. There's also a tremendous amount of UST between the two leads, with truly compelling reasons for why they shouldn't act on that. The flashbacks are very cleverly worked into the present day narrative. If you loved The X-Files you really need to check this show out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R418KFEDBO6VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ETKIFMW#wasThisHelpful","R418KFEDBO6VB","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, Jaws: The Revenge. Ellen Brody is the protagonist of this one. She's recently widowed and then loses her son Sean in the opening sequence, which is actually pretty good. It's set in Amity at night and has a reasonable amount of suspense and a fine sense of irony. Then after the funeral Ellen decides to go to the Bahamas to visit her other son Michael and things take a turn for the ridiculous. The shark that killed Sean follows Ellen to the Bahamas, where Ellen develops a psychic connection that warns her when it's about to attack. And when it attacks, the movie goes into silly overdrive, because the animatronic shark is so hilarious that you could compare it to the carpet monster in The Creeping Terror. Whenever I saw that thing pitch and jaw through the water with a demented fixed grin on its face I was laughing too hard to be concerned for the character supposedly in mortal danger. If you're paying attention you'll notice the actors kind of have to situate themselves into the shark's mouth. Somebody could have done a better editing job on this. And then there's that scene where it's chasing Michael through an underwater shipwreck. It sort of scoots along on the ship's floor. I laughed until tears ran down my face. I won't go into its mysterious ability to hold itself above water by its tail with no visible means of support, because I'm sure other reviewers have brought that up. If you like 'so bad they're great' movies, Jaws: The Revenge is one you have to see. It's almost as funny as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon (nothing's as funny as The Line though).","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHAB3HPOLO19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XBHHTU#wasThisHelpful","R3DHAB3HPOLO19","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oculus shows us what Mike Flanagan (Absentia) can do with a bigger budget. He can do the heck out of a haunted object story, is what he can do. What is a haunting but a really bad memory that won't release you? ""Oculus"" explores that notion in a time-bending way, with the mind-whammy, counter-recall flashbacks that Flanagan is becoming known for. The story centers on a possibly cursed mirror, and a pair of siblings who have a very bad encounter with it. Karen Gillan (Dr Who) and Brenton Thwaites (The Giver) play the sibs, who relive the memory of how their parents lost their minds and then their lives while they were children, while trying to destroy the mirror they believe to be responsible. Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica) and Rory Cochrane (CSI: Miami) are fantastic as the parents. Brother Tim grew up in a mental facility due to the events from their childhood, and he starts the movie skeptical of his own memories of what happened. Sister Kaylie grew up to be an antiques dealer, the better to hunt down that mirror and find out its provenance before acquiring it to get revenge on it. The devil's in the details, and the details in this movie mostly make sense. There's a dropped thread here and there, which is why I took off a star. If you like supernatural creep-fests you're bound to like this one. It's more of a slow burn than a jump scare flick, although it has some truly scary sequences in it. One more note and it's a spoiler:This is the right way to do a downbeat ending. Just because a movie ends in a dark place doesn't mean you can't have a sense of closure.

"I have been looking forward to being able to switch from store bought bread to a bread machine. I've made beer bread before and it came out delicious, but I don't want to sacrifice a can of beer every time I want to make a loaf and neither am I crazy about pounding dough. So I got this machine. I tried it out for the first time and used the basic recipe in the front of the book that's recommended for first timers. The bread rose beautifully, and the crust toasted. I didn't have the uncooked top problem that I've seen pictures of. Instead, my crust is harder than I expected. The uncooked top problem does seem to be happening with the Expressbake setting, though, and the beginner recipe in the front is a 3 hour recipe.

"This is the best movie ever to watch when you're deliriously ill. The ludicrous plot twists make sense when you're in the throes of a Herxheimer reaction. In fact, the movie is so improved by it that it's just not as fun to watch when you're feeling well. This is a TV movie (that was originally intended to be a theatrical release!) based on a suspense novel of the same name. Ivan Sergei, who is very easy on the eyes even when playing a needy psycho, stars as Billy/Kevin, a guy who gets really extreme when his girlfriends decide they want to explore other interests such as visiting the ladies room by themselves. Then he has to go murder some guy and steal his identity and it's a whole wearying thing.

"For a white popcorn varietal, it sure looks, smells and tastes like yellow. The kernels are huge, fluffy and beautiful to look at. They make an ideal canvas for toppings. The fragrance is highly aromatic, like walking into a movie theater. In fact, yellow is the most popular popcorn currently used in movie theaters because of all those aforementioned qualities. Yellow popcorn also features tough hulls, which this popcorn does also have. White popcorn is a varietal that used to be popular at street vendors. It makes smaller, more tender kernels with softer hulls. It is not as ostentatiously aromatic as yellow, but if you are looking for a popcorn that is easier to chew and digest - and if you are looking for white, you probably are - then the Hoosier Hill Farm popcorn is not really what you are seeking. As an accidental find for yellow popcorn lovers though, it's the bee's knees.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTABF2E5W0Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITQDSI8#wasThisHelpful","R2LTABF2E5W0Q6","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the brush on this mop and that is why I'm giving it three stars. I don't altogether hate the mop, even though it broke in half while I was using it. The brush is the genius part of this mop, and I think O-Cedar should get to work redesigning this thing for greater structural integrity. See the place in the picture where the black wringing handle is? That's the main problem with this mop. That is a very weak spot, right there. If you lean into your scrubbing - and with that stiff brush, you're going to want to - it's going to bend, and before you know it the sucker will break in two pieces. The thing is, it breaks in the perfect spot for you to keep using it as a hand mop. The wringer still works! It's just half as long now, so it can't be used from a standing position anymore. I will add that the mop does have problems getting into corners, since the brush will get in the way, but I didn't get this mop for cleaning corners so that's not a major detractor for me. I will keep using the half of the mop I have left as a hand mop and hope that O-Cedar gets to work on a new and improved design based on this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUC7BOZK51RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPFA2H2#wasThisHelpful","RZUC7BOZK51RB","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite way to eat pop-tarts is lightly toasted. It brings out the best in the pastry edges. A good frosting turns more interesting toasted as well. And of course warm filling is generally better than cold. The jam filling in these pop-tarts is fantastic. The frosting is good. But those darn sprinkles. They are dangerous in the toaster because they fall off with the greatest of ease. This flavor would be perfect for me if not for the sprinkles.

"I'm pretty pleased with this leash. My dog is rescue with a mysterious ritual where he gives the leash one bite when it's put on him, and he has made astonishingly quick work of other leashes this way. He finally put the last Flexi to rest, and while I loved the grip on that one, I needed to find something with a material that can stand up to his teeth better. I think I might have found it. I chose this one because it's designed to accommodate a dog much heavier than mine. The leash handle itself is heavy, but it's worth it. The leash has a thick coated nylon piece connecting the cord to the carabiner, and it's right in the spot the little guy likes to bite. It's standing up to the Teeth extremely well. It also has a plastic guard on it, so my fond hope is that if he does manage to tear through it, it won't disappear into the depths of the handle like the Flexi tape kept doing, and I'll be able to repair it. The Simple Solution leash has a compartment where you can store poo bags, and it's extraneous for me because I use a scooper, but it should come in handy for other family members who frequently leave the scooper behind. I could wish the grip were as comfortable as the Flexi's but I need something that will last longer than those were lasting for me. Hopefully this will do it.Edit 7/19/14: Okay, I guess I spoke a little too soon. Someone in this household, and I have no idea how they did it, managed to break the trigger so that it doesn't stop the cord when you press on it. Wasn't me. In spite of that fact the leash remains beloved and I have been called upon by the trigger-breaker to find another one ""just like it but not broken."" So, removing a star because the trigger evidently can't stand up to whatever happened to it. I really have no clue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QPBVWU2KKBMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU3IHW6#wasThisHelpful","R3QPBVWU2KKBMN","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robot Chicken is a stop-motion animated sketch show based on the premise of a mad scientist turning a chicken into a cyborg and forcing it to watch short movies. The shorts run the gamut of scenarios and hilarity, from gags of just a couple of seconds to spoofs lasting most of the show's average eleven minute runtime. Some of them fall flat, but the longer sketches trend toward greatness. Abide by the MA rating: despite being stop-motion animated, this show is most definitely not for children. A great deal of the humor is aimed at people who remember cartoons created to sell toy lines. Season one has some chestnuts for the ages, like a super race spoof in episode 3, or the martial arts contest parody in episode 9. If you like season one, chances are you'll like the rest of the series too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DTTOMMMXHZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEVHROC#wasThisHelpful","R29DTTOMMMXHZF","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anybody remember USA's Cartoon Express? Man, I loved that programming when I was a kid. This show was on it at one point in time. Considering it was cobbled together to sell toys they did a great job with it. The people who were involved with making it wanted to make the best show they could with the material they had, and it shows. Yeah, it's cheesy but it's some awesome velveeta. The story is about the titular Jayce, he of the skunky hairdo on the cover there. His father is superscientist Audric (also skunky haired so that you can easily see the family resemblance) and Audric's specialty is botany. Some time in the past that is never mentioned on this show, Jayce lost his mother, so Audric made Jayce a little sister out of plants; the little redhaired girl Flora that you see on the cover. Flora can talk to plants and has a giant floating pet fish because: reasons. Audric also has a robot squire assistant named Oon because, why not? Oon is the comic relief in most episodes. As the show starts, Jayce is kind of petulant because Audric never has time to spend with him, but he better step up because Audric just accidentally made the Monster Minds, so things are about to get real. So, Audric accidentally makes sentient plants bent on world domination while trying to find a cure for hunger. It's kind of funny how quickly he decides they are evil, but I guess anyone would be alarmed if their plants suddenly started growing out of control. Audric hares off to find the other half of a magic root that will stop the Monster Minds that he accidentally unleashed on an unsuspecting galaxy. He leaves Jayce and Flora in the care of  his mentor, a wizard scientist named Gillian. Gillian is a character in the mold of Gandalf and Dumbledore. Why there are wizards in space is never explored, but Gillian tells Jayce he needs to guard his half of the magic root and use the Ring of Light to save as many people as he can from Monster Minds while they try to catch up to Audric. They enlist the help of a space pirate named Herc Stormsailer to ferry them around on this errand. Herc is in the mold of Han Solo. I did always like Herc's ship, the Pride of the Skies II. It looks like a galley ship except the sails are solar panels. Every time Jayce and his group encounter Monster Minds, they wind up in a fight using armored vehicles that they store in the ship's hold when not in use. The armored vehicles were the toys that this whole cartoon was built around. I think you can see why the toys didn't sell as well as the company had hoped. They show up in every episode, but there's a whole lot of stuff going on that has nothing to do with them. The cartoon lives on as TV junk food of the highest order. This first group of episodes sets up the premise and is not the best that were ever produced. The show gets a lot better as it goes on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU89IBH0NRRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TSI63A#wasThisHelpful","R2JU89IBH0NRRR","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got these to replace the foam cushions on a SupraPlus HW261. They were a tight squeeze to get on there, but they will go on with a little stubborn effort. These cushions make the headphones stand out from your ears a little more than the foam ones did. They are soft and squishy and the leatherette material is kind of a leatherish plastic, very thin and wrinkly but with some tactile appeal, and breathable. I haven't noticed any audio deficiency from using these. They do force the speaker a little farther away from your ear, but they also create a better seal around the speaker to your ear which reduces ambient noise. I had to readjust the band to account for the new distance of speaker to ear, so if you've already got your band on maximum width with foam cushions, these cushions could present a problem for overall fit. I used to feel the edge of the speaker poking my ear beneath the foam, but now I just feel pillows. I'm liking them so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SILEE51Q6TOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007IFVJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1SILEE51Q6TOY","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a low budget horror, and they spent most of their money on the cast. That doesn't always work out as well as the pundits claim. That said, this is a fantastic cast. Katharine Isabelle, Brendan Fehr and Michael Shanks are the headliners and they're all in fine form, not phoning it in. The supporting cast does a great job too. The script is actually eerie. Forensics students do their practical on an island that was once a penitentiary with a spooky reputation. This practical involves using real cadavers in staged situations. The guy they bring along as a cook/handyman knows the stories about what used to go on when the island was a prison, and he gets more and more spooked while Shanks's professor character gets more and more impatient with him, which is a very effective way of ratcheting up the tension. The vibe is kind of like Mindhunters meets Re-Animator, at least until the zombies start rising. I don't think I'm spoiling it too much by revealing that part, as you can see from the cover that here there be zombies. The cover is also an accurate representation of how well these zombies are made up: not very well. There's one scene where a zombie chomps off a victim's fingers and then... spits them back out. It would have been less obvious how bad the effects were if they were shot at night, but a lot of them were shot in broad daylight. It's stuff like this that mars an otherwise decent low budget zombie flick. Watch this one for the performances, especially if you're a fan of any of these actors, but it's not very scary after the monsters show up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W28YIQ3GHKPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C58F9TW#wasThisHelpful","R1W28YIQ3GHKPE","A3IYSIAKYOMKTO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IYSIAKYOMKTO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the most part, the very innovative approach in the five modes for brushing, the robust design and fairly decent battery performance is overshadowed by what comes across as an overkill of technology. Apparently, staying focused on any task for 2 minutes is so difficult, the designer chose to add personalized news and weather to entertain ....using a smartphone app.  In order to facilitate the technology invasion, one has to carefully define access to different kinds of information on the app.  While some of the privacy concerns can be mitigated by restricting access, the default for all models should have been just a BT enabled ""smartguide"" that can potentially bypass the need for a smartphone app.The technology overkill aside, this is a brush that performs extremely well. The ""deep"" sweep and the different modes can clearly be felt and one notices a difference in a few days.  The battery charge holds as advertised and didn't notice any ""decay"" during brushing sessions.  Replacement brushes are a tad expensive, but generic versions are available at much cheaper pricepoints (though I have not tested their performance).Overall, an excellent brush that can potentially be crucial for oral health, if one can use common-sense approach to limit how much one wants technology to intrude.

"Using very well-known and tired examples of Google, Tesla and others, Setilli attempts to put a new spin on a well-understood issue - how can companies move quicker to capture opportunities.

In an attempt to simplify the message, the thought framework comes across as all one needs to do to apply common-sense (identify opportunity, define it, iterate, scale...) but perform these tasks faster...

"The core premise of the book is that businesses are essentially another form of expression - if that doesn't expose the ""romanticism"" infused in the book, nothing will.  Nevertheless, the author doesn't go too overboard with the narrative - he is cleverly making a point that value capture methods typically emphasize revenues and other process metrics and do not accentuate experiences as much.  Leberecht uses a slightly convoluted narrative to make this point - but it is well-made.  Using various examples (cherry-picked for its efficacy, of course), the author manages to convey that successful businesses shouldn't be thought about in strict revenue models.

The product itself is excellent, but the service model is geared towards increasing stickiness to the Nexia hub and their other products (nothing wrong with that approach, but a prospective buyer should be mindful about this).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX4AW18FD5ET6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N75ZPZ0#wasThisHelpful","RX4AW18FD5ET6","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though marketed with Grade 5-9 as key target, the plot and treatment may be better suited for the latter half of this audience, with more exposure to middle-school dramas.  Though the concept is not very novel, conveying the story in the context of middle-schoolers certainly facilitates a different perspective for the young audience.  The Disney-ish ending for the story may come across as forced, but the overall plot development sustained the interest quite well.  Vocabulary is not likely to be very challenging for most of the target audience, though kids just starting middle school may need assistance in both concepts and narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CP7H877LIOJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062311697#wasThisHelpful","R1CP7H877LIOJX","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For this price-point, one would have expected a sturdier base and more importantly the grill frame for the fan.  It feels very cheap and one can only hope that it will last a few seasons.  The assembly is very straight-forward; easy to connect to a garden hose (works fine in ""dry"" mode as well).  It may have to do with this particular unit - one of the nozzles is temperamental - it mists in random times and decides to go to sleep more often than not. The grounded GFCI plug makes this a safe option (obviously, ensure you have an appropriate outlet and easy access to connecting a garden hose to prevent kids from tripping over). The cheap-looking construction and the inconsistent nozzle performance makes it difficult an enthusiastic recommendation. Comparable units from Frontgate and NewAir should be on a potential buyer's list.  Some of the newer models come with remote control and 18"" blades (expect to pay about 50$ more).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZO39IMVTA99I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8Q30R8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZO39IMVTA99I","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A sturdy word processor/spreadsheet/presentation software is a must for home/students alike.  Apart from database program (equivalent to Access), this suite aims to provide all three essential components.  The word processor is fairly rich with features and could meet the needs for most.  Saving the file in Word format works mostly ok, though very often some of the formatting gets lost when you try to reopen the file in Word. If you plan to send files to others in a different format, you need to factor in this risk  (perhaps better to change to pdf, verify the format, and then send).  The spreadsheet, much improved from X5, may still not match Excel in all the features, but is still a strong contender.

"This set comes with high-quality products that are noticeably heavier and sturdier than comparable brands.  An excellent addition to my Dewalt three-piece combo that included a drill/impact hammer.  I am a light user of power tools, but when I need them, I want them to be intuitive to use, easy to clean up and store, and dependable. Dewalt products always meet those attributes.  At the current price point, this is an excellent value.  The corded nature of the tools may give some pause for those looking for more versatlity, but given the quality and dependability of the brand, one should be able to make that compromise.

"The designers clearly emphasized lightness and maneuverability as the primary objectives - and it clearly shows. This lightweight, stylish colored vac does have a few minor irritants, considering the price point.  The dust bin is on the smaller side and will require constant emptying;  since the motor is close to where you are holding, the loudness of the vac is more apparent.  The attachments cannot be stored with the unit, each needs to be carried around separately.  The battery life of 20 min or so is decent enough, but I end up having to depend on a regular vac to finish my cleaning.  It is very powerful in cleaning up dust/hair, but often times struggles to pick a single dead ant, for example.  Performance in carpet and hard floor is excellent and consistent.  Overall, a great vac but for this price point, some may get annoyed at minor issues such as those listed above. The suction power, however, cannot be beat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P99WKDWZ4OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPPOR1Y#wasThisHelpful","R3P99WKDWZ4OV","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to the Frigidaire model that I have been using, this model seems a tad louder, but very effective in its stated purpose. The pump and the intuitive connections make this a compelling choice if you need that feature.  I've never had to rely on constant pumping for the occasional dampness in the basement, but when those situations arise, this unit will be a great asset.  You are paying mostly for the pump and slightly better displays than comparable products.

"Most books on Africa tend to focus on issues related to aid, disease, inept governments, and generations of poverty.  While those contexts haven't necessarily changed, the author (through almost breathless enthusiastic reporting) implores to look at the continent differently.  Despite the cherry-picked examples and an optimistic bias, Olopade makes a convincing case of re-interpreting the economic changes happening in Africa.  While the effort to pain with broad strokes is laudable, the resulting canvass is very patchy and leaves much room for subjective interpretation.  The author may have been better served by focusing on specific sectors like the telecom/retail/finance intersections (M-pesa, for example) and highlight how Africa has the potential to leapfrog several generations in these sectors and enable newer service models.  In addition, the author could have spend more time in understanding how these changes will enable newer services related to healthcare and education - two key pillars for any society's sustainable growth.  Overall, an enjoyable read, but a reader shouldn't expect a critical appraisal of the emerging opportunities; it is decidedly an optimistic view, leaving much room for interpretation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW22RTNHM8I00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547678312#wasThisHelpful","RW22RTNHM8I00","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In addition to The Art of Value Investing: How the World's Best Investors Beat the Market  and Strategic Value Investing: Practical Techniques of Leading Value Investors, this book will provide an excellent basis for a serious investor in developing one's own philosophy of value investing.  But one shouldn't expect a formulaic approach (if one existed, its out-performance potential would have long gone).  This book, in particular, should be viewed in the same light as classics like Intelligent Investor.The biggest issue with this book is the approach taken for citations.  Almost all citations are from the newsletter (for a newsletter that costs close to 1000$/year, it is impractical for most readers to be able to delve deeper into any topic of interest).  The author could have served the readers more if more citations outside of the newsletter were included in each chapter.  Other suggestions may not be practical for most readers - trying to discern picks or activity of key funds through SEC filings is best left to pros, though there are accessible websites that help with the process.Nevertheless, the systematic approach in laying out the differing styles of value investing is an informative read.  The chapters on small-cap investing and special situations, particularly stand out.  Even if you believe markets are mostly efficient, the discussion on special situations provides an excellent thought framework to identify where inefficiencies could lurk - though as the authors point out, such dislocations are often fleeting. At a minimum, the book defines a framework that could serve as a serious investor's ideation plan.  Calibration of that plan is dependent on time and capital resources available to the reader, of course.  Perhaps, the author is most successful in conveying the message that value investing is not easy but requires painstaking analyses, patience and luck.  That insight, while not new, is worth repeating.Despite the issues with citations, the excellent definitions of key investment styles and a thought framework that sets expectations for each one of them, and guidelines for developing an action plan make this a compelling read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35V26TH3W1O08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118083652#wasThisHelpful","R35V26TH3W1O08","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this remarkably thorough discussion, the authors explain the basis tenets of value investing, valuation approaches and a framework to build a portfolio based on ""value investing"".  This is an excellent addition to what I consider the ""essential library"" for a value investor  - (apart from the classics such as Security Analysis) The Manual of Ideas: The Proven Framework for Finding the Best Value Investments, The Art of Value Investing: How the World's Best Investors Beat the Market, The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market and Why Moats Matter: The Morningstar Approach to Stock Investing (watchlist).  The books from Morningstar are a better choice for someone starting out, while Manual of Ideas and this book are better suited for a more experienced investor.While the book's detailed treatment of the various valuation models may seem daunting, it is well-presented; a companion website with spreadsheets based on the chapters would have been of great value (though they are relatively easy to make and some are available readily online).  This (and the above-cited books) book clearly drives home the point of needing patience, dedication and time for homework for being a successful value investor.  As such some readers may be tempted to subscribe to recommendation sites/newsletters with a decidedly ""value investing"" bent or limiting to actively managed value funds or stick with an indexing approach.  Some of those (Manual of Ideas, for example) cost close to $1000/year, while others like Morningstar's are more accessible.  Whether one chooses to build their portfolio from scratch or  use shortlisted ideas from sites/newsletters, it is critical to understand the approach, the assumptions inherent in valuation models, and associated risks.  To that end, this book performs admirably.  One wishes the authors had provided online versions of the screens/valuation models to allow for more experimentation.  Nevertheless, a well-written, detailed treatment of value investing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVZ8EJZDQN4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071781668#wasThisHelpful","R2VVZ8EJZDQN4L","A2QKCOX5ACRHC5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QKCOX5ACRHC5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sally being a peacemaker and Josie a bit more of a hot head, they played well off each other.

"Cozy mysteries seem to get a bad reputation at times for not being “real books”. Anyone who has read a book by author Kate Carlisle will tell you, that’s an extremely false statement. Ms. Carlisle is a talented writer and I’m grateful every time I read a new cozy by her. And I’m thankful she shares that talent through the cozy genre.The Fixer-Upper Mystery series is a fun, creative series that makes me wish I had the talent in my body that protagonist Shannon Hammer has in her little finger.CROWNED AND MOLDERING is my favorite story in this series so far. With an exciting plot, combined with mystery and wit, author Carlisle has penned an edge of your seat, don’t want to put it down story that will really draw readers in and have them working hard at hammering out the answers. With more twists than a spiral staircase, I never did nail whodunit.If you haven’t read anything by Kate Carlisle before, start building your collection with CROWNED AND MOLDERING, and the make additions with the rest of the Fixer-Upper series.Don’t miss the excerpt in the back of the book from, BOOKS OF A FEATHER, the June 2016 release in Kate Carlisle’s Bibliophile Mystery series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29O6ZVNODPW3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469216#wasThisHelpful","R29O6ZVNODPW3S","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don’t shell…I mean, don’t shy away from reading NUTS AND BURIED, a fun and salty mystery.I never thought I’d read about characters nuttier than my family, but the ones in this book knocked my family right out of their tree. Lindy Blanchard, the series lead, is a strong willed lady in an equally strong willed, if a little odd, family. It’s not a good idea to mess with the Blanchards. The entire town of Riverville, Texas is a pretty wild and quirky bunch. You can tell author Elizabeth Lee has a lot of fun penning her stories.A book that is sure to fly off the shell-ves, NUTS AND BURIED was a good mystery that had me questioning so many more things than whodunit. There was a lot going on and so many suspects. The ending came together nicely into a reveal that I didn’t see coming.I look forward to watching the Nut House Mystery series grow.Check out the back of the book for over half dozen pecan recipes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STHK949VWP3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425261484#wasThisHelpful","R2STHK949VWP3J","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Victoria Hamilton write wonderful series both under this name and Amanda Cooper. While I love each and every one of them, the Vintage Kitchen Mystery series is my very favorite. And WHITE COLANDER CRIME is a perfect example of why.I connected with character Jamie Leighton in the first book of this series, A DEADLY GRIND. I liked her immediately from page one of that book, and my fondness for her and her vintage way just continues to grow.WHITE COLANDER CRIME is a delightful addition to this wonderful collection of books. This story showcases Ms. Hamilton’s talent as an author and her inspiring skill of creating a story that draws the reader in and holds them transfixed until the last page is turned. I know I for one could not put this book down until the exciting reveal and the heartwarming ending.Do yourself a favor and add WHITE COLANDER CRIME to your TBR list.

"WRITING ALL WRONGS, was ALL right!I get so excited when new cozy mysteries are due to be released. There are certain authors who bump up that excitement to a whole different level, and Ellery Adams is one of those authors. If her name is on the book, I’s a for certain read for me. The Book By The Bay Mystery series is the only proof you need of why.First, I adore the way each chapter starts with a quote from a famous literary figure. I think it’s fun with an author add a touch like this.WRITING ALL WRONGS starts just a few months after series lead, Olivia Limoges and Chief Rawlings are married. I enjoyed reading the new dynamic in their relationship. Reading of how they were adjusting to their new roles.This was another brilliant plot by Ellery Adams, whose attention to detail on a bad day is wonderful, and on a good day, outstanding! And outstanding is the word to use to describe this book. A strong, edge of your seat storyline, brilliantly written characters, combined with the prose of this talented author, make WRITING ALL WRONGS the best of the best in this series.Trust me when I say, there were no wrongs that needed righting in this incredible book!Check out the back of the book for an excerpt from the upcoming 2016 release of BREACH OF CRUST, the newest installment in the Charmed Pie Shoppe Mystery series also by Ellery Adams.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3YY6DLPIMSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042527084X#wasThisHelpful","R1R3YY6DLPIMSW","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A perfect cozy for autumn reading, snuggled in a favorite chair with a cup of tea. There are a lot of fun moments in this story.

The fun took nothing away from the mystery, which was compelling and well done. Just the right amount of twists to keep the reader guessing the whole way through until all is revealed.Mystery fans, you have got to read THE BIG CHILI. You won’t be disappointed.

I adore both of them, so this was exciting news for me.It looks like book thirteen in the Scrapbooking Mystery series is lucky #13 for Laura Childs!

"This was my first book in the Pecan Valley Mystery series, bit I plan to go back and read the first two, GRANDMOTHER’S FLOWER GARDEN and BIRDS IN THE AIR.Author Ann Summerville has penned a wonderful whodunit that I found hard to put down. Great writing and a flowing storyline with likeable characters made NIGHT AND DAY a delight to read.Lead character Bea thought her biggest worry was getting her friend Marge to move out of her house and into one of her own. That was before murder and real estate fraud entered her life.A shorter than average book, this story still held all the mystery and intrigue as a much longer book. Page after page I became more involved with this and couldn’t wait to discover who the killer was, even though I didn’t want the book to end. And wow, when the reveal did come, I was completely blindsided! Well done Ms. Summerville.As I mentioned, I want to go back and read the first two book in this series and I also look forward to future installments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QFF0IP6W2X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508723966#wasThisHelpful","R33QFF0IP6W2X9","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Santa is dead! Well, a Santa is, and A BARK BEFORE CHRISTMAS is where it happened. Author Laurien Berenson kills off Santa and it’s up to Meanie Travis, protagonist of the fun series, to find out why and the real who, (because we all know author LB didn’t really kill him.)It’s not easy I’m sure to keep series with eighteen titles fresh, but Laurien Berenson, being a wonderful writer, manages to do just that. And I have no doubt it will just continue to get better and better.A BARK BEFORE MIDNIGHT was well plotted and moved at a good pace. Lots of questions raised, and I didn’t have all the answers until the reveal, which was exciting, if a bit more intense than in most cozies (at least to me).Dog lovers will be in heaven with not only this title, but the entire series. But I guess the word Canine in the series title already gave you the idea. ;-)I really enjoyed this book and I’m now going to have to go back and play catch up. But I’m always willing to find a series that’s new to me. If this is one you already follow, you’re going to be happy I’m sure.

"DARK CRIME by Christine FeehanThe first story in this anthology, DARK CRIME, was extremely well written, and full of energy, with an interesting story line and good characters which Ms. Feehan’s fans are sure to love.DEAD BY TWILIGHT by Maggie ShayneStory two, DEAD BY TWILIGHT was even more enjoyable. I loved that the story started in the 50’s and told us how Chloe became a vampire. Ms. Shayne is a wonderful writer and this story only serves to show why she has the fan base she does.CIMARRON SPIRIT by Lori HerterStory three in this anthology, CIMARRON SPIRIT is my reason for owning and reading this book. A longtime fan of author Lori Herter’s work, I was thrilled to see had penned a new vampire romance. And by her story being third in this book, they saved the best for last!Ms. Herter’s talent for writing a vampire romance (She is the author who started the vamp romance genre), is as strong as it ever was. Classic and classy is what CIMARRON SPIRIT is. I couldn’t put this book down until I had finished her story (which for the record, I read first because I was too excited to wait). It was romantic and passionate. And author Herter has proved once again that erotic and erotica are two different things. Her love scenes invite the readers to use their imaginations, and I for one find that much sexier.I was disappointed that Ms. Herter’s story was so short, but soon discovered there is a sequel called CIMARRON SECRETS! And a third installment called CIMARRON SEDUCTRESS will be coming out!It was great to see these authors come together and all of their fans are in for an amazing ride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAM8TEI8Z07O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515156213#wasThisHelpful","R1BAM8TEI8Z07O","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brava to author Lori Herter for this wonderful sequel to CIMARRON SPIRIT, in which Ms. Herter makes her return to the genre of vampire romance, and can be found in EDGE OF DARKNESS, an anthology which also includes stories by Christine Feehan and Maggie Shayne.I loved this continuing story of vampire Rafael de la Vega and him human love, Annie Carmichael. Their story is romantic and intriguing, and comes to life through the skilled writing of this talented author. Instead of being a mere reader, I felt like a hidden observer in each wonderful scene in this story. I could feel their love, fear, their every emotion as though I was living it myself.Indeed, it is because of the way author Herter pens a vampire romance that I came back to read this genre. Her's were the first I had ever read with her David de Morissey series. She brings true emotions into her stories. And when she writes a ""sex scene"", you don't get erotica, your get erotic and sexy, steamy. The kind of scene that makes you sigh. Honestly, Rafael de la Vega is enough to make me roam around in the dark with my neck exposed!You won't be disappointed if you give this book a try. No, instead, you'll be transported into an excellent story by an amazing author.Be on the look out for the third installment, CIMARRON SEDUCTRESS.

"BE MY BANSHEE is unlike anything I have ever read. This book isn’t just a para-cozy, it has a large paranormal aspect to it. It’s not a story I would normally read or review on my blog, but there was one major deciding factor in me choosing to read it…the authors, Joyce and Jim Lavene. These two brilliant writers turn everything they write into gold.Well written and very creative, BE MY BANSHEE has an incredible plot. There was action and suspense from the beginning of page one, all the way to the fantastic conclusion. Once again the Lavenes have created a winning new series.Even if this isn’t your normal reading material, with the Halloween season approaching add a copy of this fun mystery to your reading list. Can you think of a more perfect time of year to read a book about witches, banshees, shape shifters, and more?If you’ve read books but this beyond talented writing team, then you know you have to get this book.

"I didn’t read the stories in this book when they were first published, but after seeing the Hallmark Channel movie based on the second book in the series, A BONE TO PICK, I knew I had to read them. I’ll do each review separately.REAL MURDERI enjoyed this first story in the Aurora Teagarden Mystery series. REAL MURDERS was fast paced and entertaining.Lead character Aurora “Roe” Teagarden is a lot like a grown up Nancy Drew. She can’t turn her back on a good mystery, especially not when it involves the murder of a fellow member of the Real Murders club.Aurora’s investigation is not an easy one for her, or for the reader. With so many twists and turns I wasn’t anywhere close to making a guess at the killer. I was blown away with the reveal.After reading REAL MURDERS, I was even more excited to start that second story,A BONE TO PICKHaving seen the Hallmark movie of A BONE TO PICK, I of course already knew the outcome of this story, but that didn’t take away from the fun of it. As in most cases, this book was better than the movie.Author Charlaine Harris has a wonderful writing style that simply pulls you into her stories. You get a real sense of being involved in it all.In this story, Aurora “Roe” has an old mystery to solve when she finds a skull in the window seat of the house she inherited from an acquaintance. Suddenly the excitement of owning a new house and everything else that was left to her is overshadowed with trying to solve the mystery of the skull.I will say, of all the cozy mystery protagonist I’ve read, Aurora is a little more zealous and reckless in her investigating. I hazard from being a member of the Real Murder group no doubt. But to me it just added to the fun because I kept saying things out loud like “Seriously! You’re going to do that? You’re just asking to get yourself caught and killed!” Yes, I do talk to the characters when I read. Don’t you?All in all, this was a wonderful, well written story that was hard to put down. And now after reading the first two books, I’m really looking forward to getting caught up on the whole series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PTMQE60BTL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425282694#wasThisHelpful","R19PTMQE60BTL5","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the first book in this series, I knew it was going to do well. But I didn’t come close to conceiving what a runaway hit it would be!I really enjoy the characters in the Tourist Trap series. They’re not perfect. Not even series lead Jill Gardner. They all have flaws. Some of them are aware of them and some aren’t. You can’t get any more real life than that.I have to say, I was happy to see the victim in KILLER RUN murdered. LOL Harsh I know, but I didn’t like her at all. As far as victims in mysteries go, she had it coming.Author Lynn Cahoon has smooth and easy writing style that made me want to keep turning page after page. This story had plenty of twists, turns, ups and down to keep me guessing. And once the killer was revealed, I was holding my breath through the excitement. A very action packed scene indeed. Without giving anything away, if I had been Jill, I may have murdered Aunt Jackie during this scene. ;-) It would have been easy enough to get away with.Killer Run was a perfect installment to a wonderful series. I look forward to what Lynn Cahoon has planned for the next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QP0MKZ76B4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNBLXX0#wasThisHelpful","R10QP0MKZ76B4P","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wonderful mystery of murder, mayhem, and table assignments, all set in the world of an “old folk’s home --- that is, Independent Retirement Community”.This delightful mystery follows Carolina Pennsbury and her fellow dinner table companions of the Buckingham Courte Retirement Community. And tis group of ladies is something else! After “losing” the sixth member of their dinner table group, the ladies try very hard to keep their seating arrangements to five. But how many are at their table becomes the least of their worries when they have a would be cat killer to find, after someone poisons one of the residents cats.This was a cozy unlike any I’ve read. With an original concept and a true skill for storytelling, author Helen Grochmal had me intrigued and completely absorbed in this laugh out loud mystery.I can only hope that should I find myself in a retirement community one day, I have a group of ladies like these for companions.

"Author Mary Marks is back with another delight installment of her Quilting Mystery series.Please be assured, you do not have to know how to quilt to enjoy this series, not do you need to have read the first to books in the series to read this one. But it is always fun to go back to the other installments to see how it all started.In GONE BUT KNOT FORGOTTEN, protagonist Martha Rose suddenly finds herself executor to a friend’s estate. A friend she hasn’t seen in twenty years. Things don’t seem right to Martha, and then another body is discovered. Add to that the theft of items worth millions of dollars, and Martha knows she has to get to the bottom of things.I truly enjoy Ms. Mark’s style of writing. I really liked that she explained some of the rituals of a Jewish funeral. I’m Christian and my grandmother was a minister, so learning more about other religions is fascinating to me.GONE BUT KNOT FORGOTTEN was a wonderfully crafted mystery. Ms. Marks takes us through a sleuthing at a perfect pace.  There were more twists and turns than a quilt has stitches. More suspects than a few, and questions that felt like there could be no answers to. All leading up to an amazing reveal that had me completely surprised.I look forward to what author Marks has in store for us next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQ4I8XBSR8KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758292090#wasThisHelpful","REQ4I8XBSR8KR","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read this book on the heels of the book before it in the series, THE DARLING DAHLIAS AND THE SILVER DOLLAR BUSH, I will say I liked ELEVEN O’CLOCK LADY more.The Darling Dahlias are back and planning on enjoying a wonderful summer. But they didn’t plan on the murder of the town’s lady with the “somewhat wild reputation”.With rumors sprouting up all over and the suspect list growing like weeds, THE DAELING DAHLEAS AND THE SILVER DOLLAR BUSH was a well plotted mystery that captured my attention at the very beginning and held me captured until the end.I really like all the ladies in the garden club. In real life, one or two of them would be sort of hard to get used to. However, between the pages of this book, they are a lot of fun to read.With it’s 1930’s setting, this isn’t your typical cozy mystery.

I’ve been missing out!Lady Georgiana Rannoch, protagonist of the Royal Spyness series, is such a wonderfully fresh character! She reminded me so much of a combination of Rose from the Titanic move, and a Christie heroine. She was simply delightful!Author Bowen has penned an excellent mystery. The journey from England to America on the luxury liner added an amazing feel to the story. The mystery was tight and flawless. I kept changing my mind about the killer and was still wrong when I read the reveal.Author Bowen’s writing is everything I was told it would be and more.

"Author Peg Cochran has a new series! YAY!Already being a fan of author Peg Cochran’s writing (I so miss her Vintage Lingerie series written as Meg London), I was beyond thrilled to hear about her new Cranberry Cove Mystery series. When I finally got a copy of BERRIED SECRETS in my hands, I was as excited as a child on Christmas Day!For sure worth the wait, BERRIED SECRETS was everything I had built it up in my mind to be….no, wait…it was more! I was hooked on the book from page one and the beautiful image of Cranberry Cover author Cochran painted of the quaint town. I wanted nothing more than to climb into the book and explore more of the town, meet the people.Monica Albertson is a fantastic new protagonist. She’s strong and spirited, but very real and relatable. I’m not sure who I’m going to fall in love with, but it’s a tossup between Monica’s brother Jeff and Greg Harper, the owner of the local bookstore. And the twins that own the candy shop, well, I’ll let you meet those ladies yourself.This was a wonderful story from the beginning until the last page, everything in this book flowed so well. It was a fast paced, intriguing mystery that urged me to keep reading, to turn another page, and I did. Before I knew it, and much too soon I was at the end. Oh, and major points to Peg Cochran for an amazingly original place to find a body!And don’t miss the delicious cranberry recipes you’ll find at the back of the book!If you are choosy about the new series you start, I would suggest adding this one to your list.

Between the wonderful writing, twists and turns, delightful characters like Polyester Monroe, and adorably punny shop names such as Material Girl and Flowers In The Attic, this book kept a smile on my face the entire time I was reading.Author Diane Vallere has sewn together a mystery that mixed just the right weave of intrigue, action, and humor to make this cozy whodunit a serious contender for my favorite book of the 2015. It is for sure in my top 5 favorites.Stitch together some time for reading and add CRUSHED VELVET to your “must read” list. If you haven’t read the first book.

Any fan of the Country Cooking School Mystery series is going to be simply thrilled with this installment.Author Paige Shelton wasted no time in getting the mystery and action going in this story. It started on page one and didn’t slow down until almost the last chapter. With all the twists and turns, then the surprising reveal, this was one of the best in the series so far. Author Sheldon is going to have a lot of work to do to top this one. But I have no doubt she will!The characters in this series are wonderful. I adore Betts and Grams. Just the thought of being a “ghost whisperer” with my grandmother is outrageous. But it sure is fun to read about with this pair. And I’m head over heels for ghostly Jarome.Rather you prefer traditional cozies, culinaries, or paracozies you’re going to be thrilled with IF ONIONS COULD SPRING LEEKS.Ms. Shelton also included 5 yummy recipes. Make sure to look for them in the back of the book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4BLNVXP5ASM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425269299#wasThisHelpful","R3C4BLNVXP5ASM","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Cookbook Nook Mystery series is one I keep at the top of my favorites list. When I finish reading a book in this series, I get right online to find out how long I’ll have to wait for the next. For the record, the wait time between books in a cozy mystery series is normally around a year. But with this series, it feels like more like two years. So, I can say with all honesty, the worst part of this book was finishing it and beginning my wait!With perfect settings like Crystal Cove, and the Cookbook Nook and its café, it was wonderful to become lost between the covers of this delightful mystery.Author Daryl Wood Gerber really throw everything into this story. In this installment, one of my favorite cast of characters is dealing with pirates, thieves, and chocolate! Oh…and murder of course! Fast paced, full of twisty turns and tons of surprises, FUDGING THE BOOKS, is my new favorite in this series. I know, I say that a lot, but when it’s true…hey, it’s true!Fans of this series and of author Daryl Wood Gerber/Avery Aames are going to go mad over the sweet bounty that is FUDGING THE BOOKS. If you haven’t read the other books in this series, you can start with this one and not feel lost. But please, do go back and read the others too!And check out the back of the book for yummy chocolate recipes, and the sneak peek of FOR CHEDDAR OR WORSE, book seven in the Cheese Shop Mystery series by Avery Aames.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFYNV5FWT4DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425279405#wasThisHelpful","R2BFYNV5FWT4DT","A2XLON026DQ98N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XLON026DQ98N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After  a dramatic opening chapter set in an historical context, the novel moves between two time frames: the nineteen thirties and the nineteen fifties. When each time period becomes important to the story, the chapter heading makes it clear.  Throwing these two time periods back and forth at times becomes confusing, but to understand the essence of the story, this is necessary.The protagonist is Curl Hoyer who is introduced in the first period as a young man and then in middle age in the second period.  He is a scientist who struggles to find himself whether as a scientist or as a lover.  He searches for love. First he meets a young woman, Henne, who while with Curl hiking, falls off the edge of a cliff, and in order to save her, Curl grabs her, but cannot get her ankle released which is caught between two stones.  In order to free her, he twists her ankle so much that the foot is decapitated and from then on Henne has to wear a prosthetic.  He believes that Henne will be the only woman he will ever love, but then WWII comes along, and they become separated until years later.Then he meets a young teenage girl, Anna, with whom he Is smitten, but she is too young and her father makes sure that Curl stays away from her.  As a scientist, Curl works at lighthouses, trying to improve the quality of the light beam, but there are those who make his job at these places difficult, which forces Curl to travel to maintain his position.  Finally as a middle aged man Curl meets Silke.  The theme of the story is Curl struggling to find his soulmate and then to keep her.There were places in the story that confused me and it was difficult for me to accept that Henne had an artificial foot and then Anna also has one, and I missed when or how Anna got hers.  At times the story dragged and then it would pick up its pace and became a page turner.  However, for the most part, it is a romance.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34OJ48B0GW4AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6EKPXK#wasThisHelpful","R34OJ48B0GW4AS","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cole McBride, a military veterinarian, is on hiatus while getting his PhD in Infectious Diseases by working with gorillas in Africa. All of his skills come into play when he finds that something is killing them.  His girlfriend dies from the virus in two days after handling a baby gorilla whose parents were dead and although the baby did get the virus, he also survived it, but she didn’t.  Cole castigates himself because he never pursued her romantically more aggressively when he knew she really liked him.  Cole has two experienced African veterinarians with him, but then they are captured by a bunch of African thugs led by Kony who kills at the drop of the hat.  In fact he and his friends escape from Kony and he tries to get more help to identify this virus.  It definitely is a new strain, which make it doubly hard to find out how to kill the virus and save lives before it kills too many people like Ebola did in the beginning.Cole needs help and time is not on his side. This mysterious disease has all the aspects of smallpox because some humans who have had the smallpox vaccine as children seem to have an immunity, but this virus hits and kills in two days, while small pox, even for the unvaccinated, takes about two weeks.  He knows there is a pox named “monkeypox” but it does not strike and kill this quickly either.  After three humans are diagnosed with this virus and die, the former Special Forces veterinarian knows he must figure out how to stop this outbreak from spreading before it blows up into a global pandemic.They also have working dogs with them who sometimes saves their lives.  Cole figures out that the basis of the virus has to be a form of smallpox, but something added to it that makes it more viral and deadly.  This story is as interesting and a page turner like the Crichton (Andromeda Strain).  It is not a long story and one can read it quickly, if you can lay it down, which I couldn’t.Part action thriller, part medical/science the author plots a quick paced, well researched novel, in the same vein as Michael Crichton. Not dissimilar in some ways to Crichton's Andromeda Strain (unknown virus/disease is killing animals and people), with a wider world hopping scope and a dash of Congo thrown in.  He becomes aware that the virus has been brought to Washington D.C. and will be released on a night when special entertainment is on the White House lawn and there are about four hundred thousand people celebrating.  Although he knows how the virus is spread, he and his other medical and military seek to find the instrument that will expose everyone and they are determined to find the virus before everyone is exposed.The story is well plotted and quick paced, with a few twists and turns. It keeps the tension fairly high while still allowing for character development and introspection.  There were several men and women involved in the plot and I had a little difficult keeping up with who was who and what was their role since it seemed to change at times.I loved the story.  I highly recommend it to all those who enjoy this type of genre.

"Pastor Jonathan was raised in the Pacific Northwest, in Olympia, Washington, but it is difficult for him, his wife Lily and his daughter Angela to live on the small wages he received.  In the meantime, in Denton, Alabama, Pastor Cobb, a real dramatic pastor with a hatred of Blacks and with the forcefulness to keep the White members of his Church confined to his way of thinking, dropped dead.  He had a group of Deacons that were called the Posse, who made sure all Whites conformed to Pastor Cobb’s rules, including torture and murder.  After Cobb’s death, this was an active White Church and they started searching for a new minister.  Although they tried, they couldn’t find a Southern minister and the only one available was Pastor Jonathan. Pastor Jonathan and his family had no idea about the extreme racial discrimination in the Southeast and the first time he saw it was when they were getting on the bus to go to Denton from the airport, the Blacks were told to sit in the rear and the Whites in the front.  Next he noticed that when walking down the sidewalks, all Blacks stepped into the street when coming up to a White.  By the time he had his first sermon, he realized that there was a deliberate separation of the Whites from the Blacks and he was determined to change this.  Innocently, he deliberately had his first sermon stating that Jesus never stayed apart from any one because of the color of his skin.  Some people walked out on him.The Church paid a Black maid, Maude, to come and cook for them and clean and Jonathan became very friendly with her.  She asked him to quit picking up after himself, etc. and doing her work for she could lose her job.  He made her a deal that he would if she would come on Sunday to his Church, he wouldn’t pick up after himself.  She told him the congregation wouldn’t like it and it might start trouble, but never realizing the truth of her statements, he held her to it.  When she entered the church the next Sunday, it upset everyone and several people left.  The next day Maude didn’t show up for work and Jonathan for the first time entered the Black portion of Denton and found Maude with her face all cut up from a razor blade, beat up and probably with a broken rib.  Jonathan realized finally this was retribution for her daring to sit in a White Church.  He also saw how poorly the Blacks lived in their restricted part of Denton.  He had Maude taken by ambulance to the nearest Black hospital and paid for her being there over a week.  It took Maude a few weeks to recover and in the meantime, Jonathan was warned by some well-meaning Whites, to stop pushing mixing Whites and Blacks.  Someone was going to get killed and three men were named as having died for being too friendly with Blacks.This is an intense emotional story.  It traces the extreme racism between Whites and Blacks up to and through the sixties.  The author does a great job of character and scene building.  Jonathan had been a football player and was not afraid, and when he felt injustice was occurring, he stepped up and tried to fix it. He was truly nave, never realizing the challenge and danger he was facing from these racists, even though he was warned by many.  The story is dramatic and realistic.The only problem with the story is typos, wrong words, and needs a strong editing, which actually disturbs the descriptions when they are faulty.  The reader has to trace the sentence words to determine the author’s intent.  I would urge the author to have it edited and reprinted correctly.  It is too fine a story to be left like this and it is because of this I could only give it four stars instead of five.I was given a complimentary e-book copy for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M1TSKLRA5TF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIFYBRC#wasThisHelpful","R3M1TSKLRA5TF6","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Irish Cottage: Finding Elizabeth  (Travel Romance Beth Book 1)Elizabeth Lara, who had been abandoned by first her father, than her mother, was raised by her Aunt Mags, a wonderful woman.  Because of her background, Beth grew up, built a perfect life as San Francisco’s top divorce attorney, and when her aunt Mags passed at age 90, turned in her request for an indefinite leave of absence, as she was so lost now.  She had never been in love although she had a boyfriend for a year.  She didn’t trust love so she left her former life behind to spend time in Ireland where she had been once and a place that her aunt Mags had loved.  But after Mag’s passing, she was given a box of letters from Mags, who had written them before her death; they were numbered and Beth was to read them one at a time.  They turned out to have advice from Mags, which she never gave Beth when alive.  She indicated that the last letter would reveal to Beth the truth of her parents and why she grew up without them.The Emerald Island welcomed her and she was able to find a beautiful cottage by Lough Rhiannon.  She felt it was an expensive rental, but it was available and she could live there as long as she liked.  She intended to date, if it flowed into her path, but she had no intentions of falling in love.  She couldn’t trust it.  Almost as soon as she arrived, Beth’s solitary retreat into the magic wilds of Ireland was interrupted by Connor Bannon, a gorgeous hunk of a man with light brown hair, ice blue eyes and a secret of his own. He was also grieving and completely unexpected.  He had had a problem with his real father, but he was raised by a very loving mother, who died early and although he was never publicly claimed to be this man’s son, who was titled, he did inherit this estate.Through very interesting and startling circumstance, Beth met Connor, and although both of them were afraid of love, they were pulled together and Connor helped introduce Beth to Ireland and meet adults her age and she did nothing but enjoy life.  This was an exciting and well developed love that Beth and Connor shared with many, almost too many, sexual love scenes, but they are handled with taste.  Based on some of the advice Beth received in her aunt’s letters, she decided to let go and trust herself to love Connor, who was so desperately in love with her.  Where I have trouble with this novel is that the author has very well developed the characters of Beth and Connor and then placed them in a situation that I don’t find to be consistent with what Beth and Connor would actually have done in real life.  In fact I was shocked.  I cannot explain it because it would be a spoiler, but the story suddenly ends with a cliff hangar to support the next book in the series.  This weakened the entire story for me and also does not draw me to read the next book in the series.I am giving the book four stars because the author did a good job of describing Ireland and all of her characters, although I’d like to give it three stars because of the way it ends and it needs some closer editing.  It is almost like the author got tired of this plot and wanted to start something new so did not tie it up properly.

"I have been to Gallup, New Mexico and in this story, one can see it as it was twenty years ago and the personalities of the characters in the story are true to life.  The story had a slow start.  There was too much tell and not enough show and it got quite boring for the first two chapters as the characters were being described with their heavy drinking and drunken escapes.Then suddenly it picks up interest and character development.  One of the main characters, Cinnamon, is forever seeking her mother also named Cinnamon who abandoned her family when young Cinnamon was a young child.  Now young Cinnamon is a private eye who has a partner, Burro, who is a little mentally ill, but psychic and his visions are helpful when they are performing their jobs.Cinnamon gets a phone call from her friend, Mirage, who wants Cinnamon and Burro to come to Gallup because her brother, Lonnie is found stabbed to death, and she had been drunk and passed out the night before and she is afraid she might have killed him, but in any event, she wants Cinnamon to find out who did.  Cinnamon has some old information that her mother had once lived in Gallup and Carlsbad and worked with an archeologist before she disappeared again.  Young Cinnamon is hopeful that by going to Gallup, she may find her mother.Native Americans are very spiritual and believe in spirits, etc. and much of this is included in the characters in this story.  The mystery is good, the plot is excellent and it has so many twists and turns that although there are broad hints, the reader doesn’t discover who killed Lonnie.  And it is interesting how the plot includes the talent of these Native American artists and yet reveals how difficult it is to for them to become famous, which is an aspect of this mystery also.I enjoyed this story and the further it went, the more interesting it became.  However, there were so many characters included that it was difficult to keep track of them with their own peculiarities.The story needs to be edited more thoroughly, but all in all, after those first chapters, it is a good mystery.

"The three books of this trilogy are dark, thrilling and well researched.  The authors paint a bleak, realistic picture of the l700’s, making the readers aware of the brutality with which those who are different are treated.  This first book is a mystic thriller with beautifully wrought characters.After escaping from the war in Tyrol in 1703, getting caught in a snowstorm, deserter Johann List ends up in a secluded mountain village ridden by fear and superstition. Soon he realizes that there is something wrong with this village, that it lies beneath a grim shadow - animals get killed, people disappear, hooded shapes lurk in the dark woods. When Johann falls in love with the daughter of a farmer, they decide to leave the village together. But even before they are able to elope, the situation escalates - a life and death struggle begins.  This is a story full of tragedy and emotion and allows the reader to travel back 300 years in time to an area in Germany and Austria.  This first volume is a brilliant combination of mystery thriller and historical novel.The story is written simply, yet is so vivid it is like the reader is there, recognizing the vulnerability  of these uneducated and superstitious farmers and loggers and even the Catholic priest.  And then there are them who are included even in their prayers for protection against.  Authentically and vividly the author duo tells a story full of tragedy and emotion and allows you to travel back 300 years in time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE09RRFMMJUII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUENTSY#wasThisHelpful","RE09RRFMMJUII","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kendall is a criminology student at Elmhurst College and out of the clear blue, she gets a box of old books on criminology, necromancy and the supernatural.  She has no idea who sent them, but accept them because of the subject matter.  She has four girlfriends, Tiffany, Jamie, Denise and Becca.  There is a rumor at the college that the fourth floor library has a ghost, and once or twice Kendall meets an old woman in that library while scouting for more books on crime, who guides her to the books she wants.The story is mostly dialogue between these college girls, such as you would expect the chatter to be, and there is very little in the way of ghosts or spirits.  Mostly, it is the girls attempting to get along with each other, and for teenagers, this book might be appealing, but although the subtitles indicate that it is full of ghostly actions, I didn’t find them.  In fact, other than the girls mentioning the rumor of a ghost in the fourth floor library, that is about all that is said.There is a decent plot here, but there is no excitement, or intrigue, or even a real mystery, and although it is well written, that is why I only gave it three stars.

"Fires of Alexandria (Alexandrian Saga Book 1)The library of Alexandra was considered the finest library in the world during the days of Cleopatra and when Caesar was fighting the Romans, some way the library caught fire and many of the books, which were irreplaceable, burned.  It has always been assumed that it happened when Caesar set fire to his ships to keep the Romans from capturing him and it accidentally set this library on fire.  There wasn’t much help to put out the fire because of the battle being waged between Caesar and Rome.  Although the title suggests this is the subject of this story, but actually it had little to do with it other than someone paid Heron to determine who the culprit was.  She accepted the job because she was short of funds and could have been enslaved because of the debt.  By the end of the book, it is hinted who the culprit was but going along with history, it still is a mystery except for some guessing.The story really was about a woman, who took the role of her twin brother in order to make a living, and so she did everything to make herself appear as a man, even to the extent of making male genitalia so she  could pass as soldiers were always patting suspects down.  She had a younger sister whom she was protecting from being taken as a slave for non-payment of her debts.  The author has chosen to utilize the renown inventor and mathematician Heron as the protagonist.  The story spends much time describing these inventions, their uses and also has Heron maimed for non-payment of debts.  A Northman enters the story, who is huge and a great warrior in his country where he is king.  He saves Heron many times with the help of his men, but since Heron is also a man, there is no romance.The writing is rather rough and disconnected and sometimes the reader loses sight of what is transpiring, but all in all, it is an interesting mystery in another era, under other conditions, but the poor symmetry weakens its value as a good novel.  I’d like to see it rewritten with the help of a professional writer and perhaps delete some of the boring features of developing the inventions and either forget about the fires at the library or make it more about the fires and less about the inventions.I was given a free copy of the e-book for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5HUM7DW1SOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BCOGT8#wasThisHelpful","R3G5HUM7DW1SOA","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A freak storm hits and the teenagers decide to take refuge in a long-closed uranium mine.  It has warning signs that it was a uranium mine and has a barrier, but the teenagers don’t want to get any wetter, so the boys manage to get in.  It is cold and the only light they have is from a cell phone and Seth and a new guy from Scotland, Kieran, do their best to scare the others in the creepy tunnels.  Because of the intensity of the storm, there is like a creek running through it and finally they find a dry chamber, which they hole up in.During the storm, a huge tree falls across the entrance and they can no longer get out.  Eventually Zoe is able to get her cell phone to work and she calls her father who is a doctor.  The doctor rousts out firemen, one of whom is a father of one of the boys, and eventually with machinery, they are able to get the tree moved and the kids out.  While they were still inside, they noticed that they all looked very white and sort of sparkled.  Zoe’s father is worried about whether they have been contaminated and takes a blood sample from Zoe.  Immediately Zoe realizes that her hearing is extremely acute, one of the other teens can see through walls, and each teen seems to have a faculty that is way beyond normal, except for Kieran.The teens decide that since they have these super powers, they should use them to benefit others and the plot moves on while they experiment.

"The story is fiction, but there is too much fact for it not have to been written by the author about people she knew.  Willodean is the protagonist and the story begins from when she is a young girl into her adulthood.  Maggie Storm is her sister.  Maw Sue houses the two girls and seems to be their caregiver.  Lena is Willodean’s mother and there is a father.  Willodean speaks of her divorced husband when she is going through one of her emotional phases.  The girls speak of themselves as being hillbillies and Maw Sue is very superstitious and performs rituals that frighten Willodean.  She is also a great story teller, and since they use candles, this helps to cast shadows on the walls that further frightens Willodean.  Maw Sue talks about invisible phantoms called Amodgians and wears a pendant with a red stone in it.  All of this probably contributes to Willodean’s mental instability.  A woman named Dell sews the girls’ clothing, which the girls hate because she uses whatever material she has and they were so awful looking.  The sisters are very competitive of each other.  They are always drawn to strange bugs and animals.It is not clear when Willodean began to suffer from mental illness.  Both of the girls got switched vigorously by Maw Sue for misbehaving but when the Chapter Salvation opens up, Willodean is just talking and/or thinking in words or thoughts with no continuity, and pages now have no paragraphs or punctuation.  It is like words and/or sentences are thrown up in the air and come down in random chaos.  There are just words and words of who Willodean is and they don’t make much sense.  Her deceased grandmother and now deceased Maw Sue show up and speak to her.  Willodean’s inner self, whom she calls her twin, shows up and taunts her.Willodean describes Maw Sue’s house as oodles and oodles of horrors.  She spends hours and hours describing what she is experiencing and although this story is well written, it is confusing because it is so long and the reader loses track of some facts.  This is a depressing story, but if it is based on the author’s own knowledge or experiences, it would be long.  It is as if anything and everything that Willodean ever thought or experienced is in here.  I didn’t find it to have the humor and such as described in the description of this story in Amazon.  In fact, it would be difficult for me to recognize the description and the story as one and the same writing.  But for anyone who wants to live in the confusion and stress of a mentally ill person, this would probably be a good book to read.I was given a complimentary copy of the e-book for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JV9FOHVVBQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YHWWL8#wasThisHelpful","R4JV9FOHVVBQV","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“schiz•o•phre•ni•a:  A long-term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior, leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation.  (In general use) a mentality or approach characterized by inconsistent or contradictory elements.”The author of this story, a well-educated young man, suffered this disorder or a psychosis of some type off and on, and after he considered himself well, then wrote this fictional story showing how the mind is not consistent and dreams up experiences to satisfy itself.  If the reader does not read about the author’s past mental breakdowns, this story will be completely confusing and not make sense, but if the reader can keep in mind that these descriptions are for the benefit of himself, then one can walk in those shoes.  It is something like when Alice goes down the rabbit hole and has all of those weird meetings, it would be a total blank if the author had not been so explicit in the tale.  So it is with this story.  It took me awhile to remember that I was reading about events that were mental and not physical, for the most part.  Then the story hooked me.Since the author is culturally from another country, that may have interfered somewhat in understanding the problems, but I don’t think it is really important as far as how the mind works.I was given a complimentary copy of the e-book for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXSHZJIQ0KQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500394262#wasThisHelpful","R3OXSHZJIQ0KQ4","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cassie Eisen is the wife of Eric Sanders.  She never bothered to use her husband’ last name after marriage.  Both were college graduates, she even had gone to law school and became an attorney.  They had twin children in middle school, Nathan and Jocelyn and a baby girl Rebecca, who still nursed and kept Cassie exhausted so Cassie had never practiced professionally as an attorney.Cassie and Eric decided to add a room to their house for Rebecca and Eric searched around for a reputable and good contractor.  He found Tom Mullen who took him to a house that he said he had remodeled and the work was excellent.  Eric and Cassie signed a contract with him to build the addition for a set price.  As time passed, they were appalled to find his work to be terrible and no matter how they tried, they couldn’t get him to either correct his problems or refund their money.  They couldn’t find him most of the time and the inspectors would not pass the work that he had performed.In the middle of this, Eric was arrested for having been peddling meth to Tom’s workmen and Cassie managed to get him out on bail by depleting their credit cards.  Then Tom chooses to sue Cassie and Eric for a judgment for the monies due him and because they wouldn’t let him finish the job.The story has some amusing parts, the son Nathan can think of more legal questions for Cassie to answer than she has the patience for, knowing that he might try some of them out. Jocelyn is unhappy much of the time because she is bullied by a couple of girls at school.

"Karina was an undercover agent who worked with a partner, Cal, who was also her boyfriend for the past eight years until she found him making love to another woman.  She had a dog Ranger, who was extremely protective of her and she was moving from California to Arkansas to spend time with her grandma and grandpa.  Her mother, Sgt. LiAnn Marie Tuck, a retired Police Officer was moving there also from California. Karina had just finished an investigation of a wrongful death case at Jubilee Retirement.  LiAnn was just recovering from a failed romance with Crigger.  Both women intended to just relax and spend free time with the grandparents.Now throw in the devil himself, Caesar Calvanio, son of a mob member, who was rich, but always looking for a way to make more.  One of his sisters was Carmella, who matched him in viciousness and he was seeking a new line of making money besides drugs, prostitution, sex trafficking and the numbers game.  He stumbled onto a new area to fleece and that was the occupants of fancy and expensive retirement homes.  Most of the Seniors now lived alone, had healthy bank accounts and some had organs that were still salable.  He managed to find a dishonest doctor to declare and see to it that Seniors with good organs slowly went down hill until they did die.  He had another cohort who ran the ambulance and his sister Carmella operated the Senior home, which he fleeced out of a man named Nick through torture and threatening to kill his family.This Senior home was in Arkansas where Karina and LiAnn were moving.  The grandparents had friends in this Senior home, and the plot thickened as some of the Senior friends complained how some things didn’t seem right there.  The story is a page turner of murder, torture, robbery, betrayal and romance when LiAnn and her daughter, Karina, each find a new suitor, as naturally these women were each beautiful, vivacious and exceedingly intelligent.I truly enjoyed this story, mostly because of unusual plot relative to Senior housing for retirees, and there were several plots woven in and out of the main one.I was given complimentary copy for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PEX2MVCFTNU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692410570#wasThisHelpful","R2PEX2MVCFTNU0","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HOUSE DIVIDEDLeonard Robbins was a retired CIA agent, now confined to a wheelchair from injuries suffered from an auto wreck.  His wife was a retired FBI agent.  They were living a fairly quiet life now except for the ups and downs of their collegiate daughter, Courtney, whom they just learned had become a member of an anti-Israeli group “Students for Palestine Justice.”  Courtney was more gung-ho to help what she believed to be a fight for the right than researching the actual facts of the continual conflict between Israel and Palestine over their adjoining lands.  As with parents and young adult children, there was no talking to her.A building owned by Israel had been blown up in Washington D.C., in which a young girl was killed along with others and it was believed that the girl never knew it was a bomb.  President Wheatfield, our female U.S. President then, called on Leonard to head a counterterrorism task force to track down and destroy any Palestinian sympathizers who were terrorists.  Because of Leonard’s incapacity, he would work from his office and the President ordered that all government departments, which acted as the country’s safeguards, would send one or more agents to help Leonard and respond to his orders.  This would move their ability to work together much more efficiently than was usual when the various departments preferred to do their own thing.  Once the first bomb was detonated, it pointed towards an organized terrorist group, and especially after a second bomb was shortly detonated at another Jewish establishment.This story moved right along as Leonard and the various department heads attempted to find these individuals, who at the moment were unidentified.  One of the interesting characters in the book was a Russian woman who could work wonders in searching out other computers, like ones which were in the hands of the terrorists and reading their messages.Although this story was written as fiction, it contained much factual information and was extremely interesting where it showed how these various departments used their skills to seek and destroy.  Naturally in order to include some human interest, Courtney became trapped in the middle of delivering a bomb, her life was at stake and her parents became frantic.I enjoyed this story immensely and I would recommend it for not only its entertainment, but it was extremely educational.

"GHOSTS OF TSAVOStir a pot full of ghosts, displaced English people in Nairobi, Africa, wild animals and an hysterical aunt and then sit back and enjoy the tale.  This seems to me to be more of a YA genre adventure because of the way the main character, Beatrice Knight (Bee) relates this story.  She is an investigator for the Society for Paranormal and Curious Animals, being a natural psychic, and her employer is Professor Ray Runl.  Bee has been widowed, and her ex-husband Gideon is a ghost who pops in and out of her life to give her his two cents worth.  Bee has no financial recourse but to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Steward.  Mr. Steward has lost all of his finances but has secured a job in Nairobi, Africa building a railroad.  Mrs. Steward is one of those overweight, over-emotional women who uses her hysteria to get her way at the drop of a hat.Bee can discern ghosts by seeing or smelling them and where they are going, in years past, the gossip is that two ghostly man-eating lions killed and ate over 135 men.  When everyone alights in Nairobi, the town is about two building on an unpaved street and their house is long, unappealing and one story, just sufficient for them all to live in.The story then wraps itself around Bee attempting to find these ghostly lions and determine what the circumstances now are surrounding them.  Bee does have a humorous way of describing  events.  The weakness of the story is that it starts out slowly and drags for a while before the action begins to play itself out.  This is not a deep emotional story, but it is an enjoyable read.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJ28FBGSNRJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYWOK84#wasThisHelpful","R3OJ28FBGSNRJA","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DAUGHTERS OF BABYLONBy Elaine Sterling3 starsThis was a difficult book for me to read.  The author states at the end she wanted to provide a different insight into and about Eleanor of Acquitaine, one of the most famous women of Europe during the middle ages.  I have read several novels about her and she is totally fascinating. However, I would have enjoyed the story much more if she had stuck to just Eleanor and her life experiences.  Instead she threw in two other story lines, which I couldn’t seem to connect to Eleanor, and the first chapters were full of statements or words in either French or Spanish, which meant nothing to me or anyone who doesn’t know those languages.  This then kept me from understanding much of the intent of the story.  On top of that the author is enthralled with poetry, and for those of us who do not enjoy poetry, it did not enhance the story. At the end the author explains how long it took her to write this book and then adds several pages of poetry by other authors, which for people who are interested in history would become more prominent by reading such excerpts, which would enhance this particular book.One could call it a historical novel, which it is where it pertains to Eleanor.  As far as the book pertains to Eleanor, I would give it four stars or five stars, but the large foreign language excerpts with no translations and then the insertion of two other story lines with little tie into Eleanor’s life, ruined the book for me.  But it is well written, obviously by a well-educated author and I would prefer to give it a higher rating, but I did not enjoy any of the book other than the parts relative to Eleanor and Acquitaine.I was given a complimentary e-book copy for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AY58QBJKMSRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTCJ2JS#wasThisHelpful","R1AY58QBJKMSRT","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TO PARTS UNKNOWNThis is a most intriguing story about five people in particular caught in the Japanese invasions of Singapore, Java, Indonesia and Dutch Islands.  The cover adequately represents the spy theme as several of the characters are actually spies.  George Adams is an English reporter who left London after his beloved wife Maggie died in an automobile wreck.  He wrote stories about people and places that he saw while in the South Pacific.  He ran into Thomas Montclaire, a Frenchman who spoke several languages and although he seemed perfectly gentle, actually he turned out to be a great fighter and spy, along with his friend DeMer, a Dutchman whose island was overrun, and he was made a prisoner and tortured.  He escaped with the help of Thomas.  Lady Jane Carrington Smith, an English aristocrat, who had run away from her parents in India to escape marrying someone she didn’t love, becomes one of this group as they flee the Japanese.I was a teenager during WWII and I saw the newsreels of the war in the South Pacific.  The author did a fine job of describing the bombings, fighting, killing and the islands so realistically the reader feels he is there.  The author also described each of his main characters so well that the reader could walk in their shoes.This story was a page turner for me and although it presented the war in that area realistically both in the fighting and the emotional traumas, it wasn’t gory and I couldn’t lay it down until I finished it. A mystery runs through the novel about who Lady Jane might truly select as her lover since she flirts with all of the men.I think this is a great story, written in a polished manner and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of genre.I received a complimentary copy for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16QRW545DVJCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940224586#wasThisHelpful","R16QRW545DVJCP","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is definitely a YA genre and although the author uses Indian names like one might expect, it is simply written and has a good share of imagination in the plot, which would make it particularly interesting for teenagers, about whom most of the story centers.  Her language, however, does not particularly feature how Indians would speak in their language.  Also when the deer was killed and the girl went to skin it, with the boy’s help and then she takes the skin away to wash it and he wraps up the meat, with no electricity how was he going to keep the meat from spoiling?  Also, usually when there was a skin, it would take three Indian women to scrape the skin clean of gristle and fat on one side and hair on the other.  And then it was soaked in animal urine to make it soft.  As far as keeping the meat, usually it would be cut in strips and dried.But taking into consideration who would be reading this story, I think it is a good plot with heroes and heroines and bad men, and fantasies that make it enjoyable.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLD3WLT93WR75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMYA6UI#wasThisHelpful","RLD3WLT93WR75","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ADOBE GOLDThe Stone Justice Series, Book 1By Robert C MowryColonel Tyrone Rafter was sent by his friend, President Lincoln, to find a man important to the Civil war in Mexico.  Rafter was captured, his leg wounded so badly it was sawed off by a rather incompetent Mexican doctor and he was kept a prisoner for seven years, subjected to torture, starvation and terrible living conditions.  He finally managed to escape, but upon returning home learned that his beloved wife Laura had been told he was dead and had remarried.  Rafter became extremely bitter and hostile, never revealing to Laura that he was alive because of her remarriage.  He remained mostly in Mexico and became so violent and dangerous that he was known El Pata Fantasma.He let President Lincoln know he was alive and Lincoln eventually sent for him to send him on another dangerous mission.  Lincoln had been promised by a Mexican constituent a large amount of gold that had been mined by the Mexican and hidden.  There were rumors of gold being in the Santa Fe, New Mexico area, but no proof.  Rafter was to ascertain if there actually was gold available for the Union’s use.Rafter spent two weeks with a minister who helped him adapt to the role of being a minister, and he was an atheist.  He read the Bible in most of his spare time, adopted an abandoned dog, Dinger and visited all of the Methodist churches in the towns between Washington D.C. and Santa Fe to firm his role as Pastor Justin P Stone.  Because his wooden leg was so tender, he purchased a buggy, which was his trademark.  As the story proceeded, he learned that Laura died, his son Buck, a young man now, although in the military, had a terrible temper, and as he visited the different churches, was called upon to do weddings, funerals, sermons, and give solace and comfort to many.  He began to question whether there was a God.The story is filled with war, death, Indian attacks, romance, betrayal, love, hate and is a page turner.

"This story has all of the mystique, intrigue, danger, politics and clash of cultures as “Shogun” did (although it was about Japan).  The author spent hours researching the history of these times and in an efficient manner so that it did not interfere with his story, he listed separately information about China and its history so that the reader has the background.  Years ago I read that the English made a fortune selling opium to the Chinese, which surprised me because the movies were always about opium dens and I assumed the Chinese were providing it.  This is far from the truth.  This story basis is built on a segment of high Chinese officials who were purchasing opium clandestinely from the British and selling it locally through a network.  There were others who were close to the Emperor, who is now an old man, with three sons, one of whom will inherit his power when he dies, and they knew that opium was destroying many Chinese and were attempting to find the source and destroy it.  At that time in China, there were two main genetic people, the Manchurians who were beautiful, tall, very intelligent and ruled  China.  The other segment were the Han, who were smaller, flat facial features, and usually were the common people and laboring class.China restricted each different western country trader to a certain small area not a part of mainland China so that they could not influence the Chinese.  The story includes romance, murder, betrayal, beauty, and an insight into the Oriental mind, which even today, is hard for the Westerner to understand and accept.I loved every moment of this page turner, absorbed the information it provided and would hope there is some way the author can market this so that it becomes popular.

"Since this novel is about a teen age girl along with other teenage girls, it would appear to be a YA genre, but I would not recommend it for younger teenagers as there is too much sexual content, gore and anti-Christian actions, which although obvious as fiction to an adult, might actually confuse a younger teenager.It is during the Middle Ages, when myth and magic were most common and Countess Erzsebet Bathory seeks out fourteen year old Katalina because she knows how to bind sheets into a book, but cannot read.  It is important that she cannot read for this is some type of history important to the Countess.  There are few servants at the castle where Katalina must live and the Countess is vicious in striking Katalina when she makes a mistake.  Four young teenage girls come to the castle where the Countess is supposed to teach them to be sophisticated.  One of the younger ones, bored, offers to teach Katalina to read, which she does.  Of course, Kataline works well into the night binding these books, but as time goes on, she also reads them.  They are about people who are afflicted, meaning vampires, although it is not spelled out except you know it because they feed on blood.I am not into the modern day vampires, so do not know how this fits into this category, but there were times when it was difficult for me to know if Katalina was reading or whether it was something occurring in her real life.  As Katalina read further, so much of the content was repetitious of what had already been written, and the stories did offer priests and nuns in almost a demonic manner, although it was not clear to me that they were Christians.  Thus is became boring to me, but perhaps not to youthful readers who are into this particular genre.The book could use some good editing, but generally speaking, it was written well enough, taking into account what I already said.  Although I would like to, I do not feel I can give it more than three stars, which can alert readers who might be more particular.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19D2HOAPEWLV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OW7ACRI#wasThisHelpful","R19D2HOAPEWLV4","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IT TOLLS FOR THEEThis story starts out like most war stories with a battle ensuing and the protagonist, Dan Ross, an American soldier is very cognizant of the fact that he is responsible for the lives of the men who follow in his command.  In the beginning, he is pinned down on the side of a mountain and the Afghan insurgents are pummeling them.  Dan doesn’t have many men with him and his commander is supposed to be nearby supporting him, but he never shows up.  Dan finally is able to get his men in control and they capture an Ahman who is guarded by the ANA, which are a mixture of Afghan men who have joined with the American forces to fight the insurgents.  However, Dan is suspicious of them.  When Dan questions his commander why he wasn’t there to help them, the man replied he was where he was supposed to be and Dan was wrong.  Later Dan notices that the ANA men are very polite to the Ahman, which makes Dan suspicious and then one day the ANA shoot all of Dan’s men in the back and only Dan and another man escape alive.Dan is so shot up, including a bullet in the spine that he is paralyzed from the hips down and he is in a wheel chair.  He intends to get well within the year and go back and find these men and kill them.  The fact that Dan lost all of his men but one weighs on him heavily.Eventually the Army discharges him, feeling he’ll never get well enough to soldier again, which embitters Dan whose entire focus is getting back to Afghanistan and take his revenge.  The story picks up speed as Dan finds a way to get back there and the Afghan people he meet while he seeks out the insurgents.  This is what makes the story so different than many of these war stories and it shows Dan’s ingenuity.  This story is well written, is almost a page turner and brings out some true facts like the American people really don’t want to think about the war in Afghanistan and Iraq and since there is no draft, it is easy to just ignore it.The story needs some editing for typos etc, but it doesn’t take away from the plot itself.

"THE NIBELUNG GOLDThis is an unusual novel in that it is written by a man who is a native of Holland, and it took  place in Holland in the early nineteenth century, when myths abounded relative to spells, paranormal events, telekinesis, ghosts, and everything that was not understood, fell under the veil of witchcraft.  The protagonist, Willem Wolf, a very rich man, was determined to learn the truth of all of this phenomena.  The story opened with him and his companions having offered a woman Wera Keller a goodly sum if she could prove telekinesis.  She said she could, she appeared and many unusual events occurred, but then she appeared to have over-extended herself and died.  Her last words to Wolf were to find her and save her.This first of this novel lags at times as the author was setting up the scenes for the story.  Dr. Krone was a psychiatrist and believed there was a definite connection between the mind and  paranormal events.  Wolf, suddenly was able to appear and disappear at will and Wolf believed that it was the collective effort of seventy-nine mediums who gave him this ability and energy.Throughout the story there was much violence as greedy men kidnapped Wolf’s friends and tortured them to learn more about Wolf.  As time passed, I felt like I was truly reading about the way people considered mental illness and witchcraft in the eighteen hundreds.  The last half of the book picked up speed and moved rapidly ahead, making it much more interesting for me.I feel this is a little different outlook of the paranormal than what is usually found in stories today, and therefore may be refreshing for some readers.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37K7BSLPO2BDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I7N53FE#wasThisHelpful","R37K7BSLPO2BDP","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a senior citizen, the font is so small in the explanation boxes that it was difficult for me to read it and since most left side pages were blank, it seems to have been prudent to enlarge the font and have it coincide with the photos it is describing.  The color red for the reading font made it more difficult to read.As far as the layout otherwise, although I see the other reviews covered that fairly well, it is something I know little about.  I feel that most of his photos were good and gave us a glimpse into this area of the world.  What I did notice is that where I might have expected everyone to look Chinese, and since most of the closer pictures were of men (probably because it is a Muslim country) there is great diversity in the facial features of the different individuals.  Some looked like they might have been Slavic.  I liked it when he inserted some explanations about this since this book is almost a documentary.This is a small book, but it also doesn’t cost so much to purchase like some of your large photographic books.

"Part 1 of this book is in essence a novella, which introduces Richard, who lives a double life, with his wife and family.  Whether the reader will care to purchase these Parts separately remains to be seen.  It is an unusual way to write a story and in the 500 books I have read and reviewed in the last four year, this is the first time I have encountered this.  Be that as it may, this novella was interesting, although not a page turner.  It introduced Richard, whose wife Julia believed him to be a banker when he had been a member of the Queen’s military forces since a teenager, and his role as banker was a subterfuge.  However, Julia’s father, an English Judge, was aware of Richard’s double role as Richard exposed that to him when asking to marry Julia. Richard was away from home often and Julia was led to believe it had to do with his duties as a banker.  Actually, it had to do with his military duties.  England and a couple of other European countries had been attempting to trap an African in Somalia named Charlie.  Charlie had been raised as a child to be a pirate and because of his size and craftiness he soon became a pirate and kidnapper.  He was in direct contact with a minister in the French government and he had planned to capture three hostages and hold them for $500,000 ransom.  The French minister tricked him and held the hostages for three millions dollars ransom, unknown to Charlie.In attempting to trap Charlie, Richard and his four military men stopped Charlie, but then were not strong enough to hold him and Richard’s men were slaughtered and Richard was shot in the head.  A force of Americans fought it out with Charlie, and saved Richard. Richard had a most difficult time recovering.  During this time, Julia found out the truth of her husband from his military commanders and Richard suffered greatly from PTSD and was too dangerous for Julia and his girls to live with. And now the reader is ready for Part II as Richard has recovered, he believed and hoped to be united wth his wife and family.  This was interesting, but obviously just an introduction to more to come.I was given a complimentary copy of the e-book for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0CDXLUBAZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCWMGSC#wasThisHelpful","RK0CDXLUBAZR","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Relive early days of colonial times in U.S.This is an historical novel, which is fascinating, educational and dramatic.  The author did a great deal of research covering these historical times and then encompassed it in a great novel of John Law, a fifteen year old Scot who had been grabbed by Scottish military to fight as a pikeman against the British forces of Cromwell.  During the battle of Dunbar, the Scots were defeated and all Scots who were not wounded or sick were gathered up and sent overseas to the British colonies in Massachusetts to work as indentured servants for several years.  There were  factories there capable of making Englishmen good money, except there were no laborers.  This is where these prisoners were to go.  John originally was to be in a factory, but then instead was labeled a shepherd and placed in a tract of land where English farmers left their sheep with him to be grazed as long as necessary.John, because of being a Scottish soldier, is not treated well by the English, but an Indian soon comes along and through sign language and a little English, teaches John where the best ground is for planting and how to learn to live in this wild, very cold country.  This story encompasses John and Lydia, his wife, the births and deaths of their eight children, his continual struggle to hold his land because the English never designated him a land holder.  The characters are filled with emotion because of the many experiences they had, good and bad, you live with John and his family, realizing his helplessness.  His Indian friend who attempted to become a Christian, was badly treated in the end and taken off as a slave.  The story includes Indian wars as they attempted to hold back the tide of English settlers.This story is well written, realistic and certainly educational as to those times.  At the end, the authors gives several of books relative to those times, which helped him produce this historical novel. I couldn’t lay the book down.  In its way, it is a page turner and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSV461HM8YVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFDJTWG#wasThisHelpful","RJSV461HM8YVQ","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story has one of the best plots I’ve read in a long time.  The protagonist was a young woman, Alex Hoffman, who was well trained in writing codes for computers, physical hand-to-hand combat training, worked well as a team.  The chapters are many and are written about individual people, places and dates, which is well because there are so many characters named and it is easier to keep track of everything and everyone.  Because of her training, she felt most confident of her ability, although she did manage to get herself in some very tight spots.  The story commenced when Robert’s wife, Melanie, needed a heart transplant after four months of heart failure and she was refused by the Board who decided who was eligible for heart transplants because there were so few hearts available.  He was devastated but then a Mr. Helms approached him and guaranteed that he could get such performed in return for a small favor in the future, but wouldn’t tell him what that favor might be.  Robert was overwhelmed in worry and although he wondered what kind of a favor would be needed to fulfill a $100,000 operation that wouldn’t cost a cent, he agreed to it.  Immediately he was contacted, Melanie had the surgery performed and all was well.EXCEPT Robert was the head of an high tech company in India, which wrote difficult software to meet any demand.  Some Congress members wanted a safer, faster, more secure way to have Americans vote, whether for the President or Congressmen.  Several companies, most of them overseas, could develop such software and had bid for the contract.  Two members on Robert’s company board were against hiring overseas because they were always late, sloppy and couldn’t be relied on.  One of them died in a car wreck and the other one suddenly had a heart attack.This set up the story, a page turner.  It included men from several countries who were most interested in adapting the software to change the vote under certain conditions as they chose.  Consequently, this circle of men could select the American Presidents and other Congressmen.  The way the plot proceeded, it was plausible.After reading this story, which I truly enjoyed, I found there was a novel written a few years prior by this author called “Executive.”  It explains Alex and some of her past, which is lacking in this story and it would have been better if the author could have somehow alluded to that first story.  She has a few chapters of that book featured in the back of this e-book and it is not written nearly as well as this one.  This book does need some good editing, but for the most part doesn’t take away from the story.I received a complimentary copy for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS44N4BFZT3AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCM14Q#wasThisHelpful","RS44N4BFZT3AF","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One chapter is from the standpoint of the female protagonist, a new movie star, and the next chapter would be from the standpoint of the male protagonist, Stephan, an ex-ranger who now makes his living by photographing as a paparazzi.  Ordinarily this would make a story easier to read, but this is a story in which there are so many new characters in each chapter and it becomes so convoluted, that the reader can lose sight of the plot.It is definitely an action story, action in many different ways, even to the extent that a reader wonders if, especially some of the medical procedures, are possible.  Of course, since this is fiction, the author can make up anything he wishes.  But each chapter is so long, and there is so much action and so many characters that the reader becomes impatient for the chapter to end.The characters are strong, the scenes are strong and yet there were times when I was bored because the actions were so complex and strung out so far.

"The author is the son of parents from Holland who immigrated to Wisconsin and he along with his eight siblings were raised in the Dutch Reformed Church.  The creed of this religion included the exacting teachings of Calvinism, which allowed no room to question anything the Bible said.  As a result, the congregation lived severe lives, totally judgmental of anyone who sinned as the Bible described it, and obedience to God was more important than love or compassion for sinners.As the author grew up and reading the Bible daily, which was a family practice, he realized that the God of Christianity was a God of wrath and love often demanded of Moses the death of other countries that the Jews passed through.  Particularly, it bothered the author when God demanded Abraham to kill his son as a sacrifice.  This memoir is the story of his path of pain and confusion that he traveled even into his now advanced age of 76.  Through his early years as a minister after spending hours trying to reconcile these condemnations and judgments, even unto death, he could not give up the Bible and he spent hours, searching himself and others to try to justify the viciousness of the orders of God, which many modern day churches still follow.  When in the pulpit, he attempted to by-step some of the verses of the Bible and interpret them differently.  But he was talking to congregations raised in this judgmental pathway and they would complain until he had to leave as minister.As time passed and he continue to attempt to justify those unloving parts of the Bible, he never really could and because he wanted to use the Church as a place of love and compassion, he began to take college courses in psychology, but at the same time, had to find churches who were more liberal.  He was most stubborn in his determination to convince others, especially ministers, that fundamentalism was not the message that Jesus was sending, but it didn't work.  Since he was a man and stubborn, he suffered much emotionally and mentally, even making enemies of his family.This is a good book for Christians who also cannot relax with a God of wrath and love as promoted in many Churches of Christianity and perhaps find solace in the suffering of this man.I was given a complimentary copy of this book for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFNJTLDTBJH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9OP606#wasThisHelpful","R3LFNJTLDTBJH3","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is written by a man who was born in Lagos, Nigeria and currently living in Montreal, Canada.  Although the novel is a work of fiction, it is based on events that actually happened and of which he is knowledgeable.The protagonist is a female, Ranya Abass in Darfur, who is recently widowed and because of the continuous civil wars occurring there and in neighboring African countries, is bombed out of her home and the only place she can go to is a huge refugee camp for displaced persons.  She has a teenage daughter and a teenage son and it will take them five days to walk there, carrying only a sleeping mat, water and a little food.  She teaches them to cover themselves with sand so they cannot be seen from the air or by other travelers they should meet.  The camp provides very little and people who are already living there help her to find material to make her a small overhead tent, but there is not enough food or essentials.  She and four other women walk miles away from the encampment each day to cut wood and bring it back to sell to other refugees so  they can cook.  The great constant danger is that there are gangs continuously roaming around who raid and kill.  One day one of these gangs come across the women, strip them and gang rape them.  It is traumatic for all of the women, but one woman never emotionally or mentally recovers.There is a peacekeeping force consisting of UN and the African Union military but there are  not enough men to really protect an area as large as France and these gangs hit and run.  They sustain themselves by robbing UN trucks of food and armaments.  The UN are not allowed to chase these gangs down and actually either capture them or kill them, but only to fight defensively when necessary.After the women are raped, they no longer leave the encampment.  Then Ranya’s son decides he will earn some funds and he joins a band out of the camp who are making some money.  Ranya’s daughter falls in love with a young man from one of the tribes that are hostile.  Ranya’s son disappears and Ranya is determined to find him.  She joins one of the gangs and becomes a militant.  The story encompasses the different trials and tribulations of the people of these warring countries in Africa and how desperate and unsolvable it seems.  The author does a fine job of describing his characters so that the reader is pulled into the emotions, feelings of hopelessness and sorrow, and at the same time, incorporates the actions of all of these different groups of peopleFor anyone who would like to understand Africa better and learn about it from the personal experiences of one who lived there and knows it as it is, this is the book you would want.

"At the end of the book the author has left a list of books that she used to establish this story about the year 1734 in the Appalachian Mountains of the U.S. in the lands of the Cherokee when the English were trying to establish a mutual relationship with them in lieu of the French who were using the Mohawks to establish a hold.  The book contains many Cherokee myths and the system and politics by which they lived.  The female protagonist New Moon is a young widow, who is a sister to Chief Dancing Cloud and she has visions about anything important that will be coming into her life.  She meets an Englishman, James Fitzgerald, who takes the name of Red Panther, and is spying for his king, but has spent so much time with the Indians that he dresses like one, lives like a Cherokee and takes his place as a warrior.  In due course, New Moon, although she tries to fight it off because he is a white man, falls in love with Red Panther and he falls in love with her.The story is full of action as the various male Indians test each other physically and then end up battling the Mohawks.  Red Panther is an extremely powerful and well developed man and New Moon is a beautiful young woman.  The story is a page turner because there is so much action, but perhaps the story is overloaded with the romance between New Moon and Red Panther.  In fact, it seems to be about half of the novel.  I like romances but not to the point that it is the story, although the author does call this an historical romance.However I truly enjoyed the tale and much of it was because of the revelation of the life style of the Cherokees.

"For those of us alive in these times, it is hard to accept and realize the hardships that people suffered in the l9th and 20th centuries in America.  This story takes place in northeastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma where ranches included hundreds of acres and the main income was cattle raising.  The protagonist, Charlie Dobyns is the son of a Cherokee mother and White man, but the mother is strict with her children and raises them like any white mother would.  After Charlie is born, four years later a son David follows and four years after that a daughter Viola.  Early in his teenage years, Charlie is taught by his father to handle horses and cattle.  Charlie especially has a way with horses, as his father did.  On one of the long trips of driving cattle to market, Charlie met a wonderful man and wife, who are quite wealthy.When Charlie’s parents die from yellow fever within two hours of each other, Charlie is left with the responsibility of caring for his siblings.  He takes them to this wealthy family, who takes them in as foster children and Charlie, David and Viola are ecstatic, but then one day the man is thrown from a horse and killed and his wife sells the ranch and moves elsewhere, leaving Charlie and his siblings abandoned.As the story progresses, Charlie continues to develop into a great man, his brother David follows in his footsteps and Viola becomes a lovely young lady, with the help of other people.  There is much trauma and sadness in this story, as it would have been in those days and so it is like a historical novel.  It is most informative and educational and the only weakness I found in the writing was that at the end, it is like the author crammed in the various children and grandchildren that Charlie and his family had.  When I started reading the book, I looked to see if it was fiction, which it was, but the author certainly had her details of life in those days realistic.

"The author had worked in an auction firm in real life and used her background as the scenes for this mystery.  Virginia Blythe, an employee of Gable & Co., auctioneers of antiques and dated furniture, paintings and china, was a department head and not well liked by her boss, Brian Gable III.  The company had a small kitchen in its large, dark basement, which was also a storage area for most of the larger antiques.  Virginia’s parents had passed away the year before, which caused Virginia to be sad and extra sensitive.  Virginia had to go to the basement kitchen to make her coffee, to which she was addicted.  One day down there, she could hear sniffling, the next time a wailing and finally caught sight of a beautiful young woman ghost, sitting on an old settee. This frightened Virginia and she told Brian, who made fun of her and threatened to fire her.  In fact, the several employees of the firm did not believe she saw an actual ghost.Now throw in a mixture of her boss, Brian, being poisoned, some valuable porcelain disappearing and the ghost handing Virginia her diary, identifying her as Constance Pendleton, dated 1928.  Why is the ghost haunting the place?  Why is Virginia the only one who can see her?  Who killed Brian?. Why does Virginia receive a threatening note?  Then the pages of the diary portray a second mysterious drama ensuing.

"The author of this story says she likes to write in-depth characters and spends time imagining what her character would be like and do under certain circumstances, and that is certainly how she presented the characters of this story to us.  Sunset Villa was a resort in Jamaica, which had been devastated by the hurricane Sandy.  The owners of only five years, Nolan and Anna Pearson purchased the resort and had a big mortgage on it plus wages for the few employees they had.  The managed to renovate the resort after the storm and had a wonderful cook and employees.  They were visited by a reviewer, Matthew Kane, for a travel magazine, who was not mentally healthy and more demanding than any patron would be.  The Nolans weren’t there when he stayed there and although he was well treated, he demanded so much that the employees didn’t know how to handle it.  Since he was narcissistic and egotistical, he wrote a extremely derogatory review, which definitely hurt the resort’s reputation.Anna contacted her best friend, Kate Hamilton, a psychiatrist, how to attempt to get Kane to do a better review and Kate suggested they invite him there for a free week, saying nothing about the review.  Anna let other friends know of the problem and about seven or eight of them came the same week as Kane, as did Kate.  Thus you have a collection of most interesting characters: Jessica, an older teenager, who won a free ticket there and brought her boyfriend Rob, an uncouth character from the South who drank too much and the two fought often; a friend Adam who was a top businessman; Kate, and Daniel, an Englishman.  Kate is a beautiful woman and Kane wants to bed her and flirts outrageously and ogles her.  Kate is aware of this and leads him on, until she finds out he is going to write another bad review, just because he can.The author describes her actors and the scenes so well it is like being there.

I also think it appeals to the masculine humor more perhaps than the female.Pros:  It has an interesting plot.  The author handles the back flashes well also.  Where the author elaborates that the protagonist is speaking to the reader, in essence this is called a first person point of view.Cons:  The beginning third of the book was so full of analogies, instead of good “show rather than tell” writing, that it loses the reader’s interest.  Also if the reader does not know the people in the analogies, it leaves him not understanding the meaning of the sentence.The author does have a sense of humor, but perhaps more for a comedian than a book.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YNDM195BAUT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGK9IB6#wasThisHelpful","R2YNDM195BAUT2","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was in high school during WWII and I remember the news footage when General Eisenhower first visited Auschwitz, and even in these times there are people who claim that Auschwitz and the other death camps never existed.Although this story is written as fiction, the conditions and treatment of the Jews as related by Jack Fisher are true.  Jack was originally a Jew and imprisoned in the ghetto in Poland by the Nazis.  Jack and other small boys would make a hole in the wall and sneak out to steal food to eat, for the Nazis never let enough food be allowed into the ghetto to feed everyone sufficiently. At this time, Jack had a Jewish name as Jacob, so he spoke Polish, and then had to learn German, which the Germans demanded.  Jack was rather blond with blue eyes, so he didn’t look Jewish, but more Polish.  One time when Jack was out stealing, he entered a Catholic Church.  The priest gave him food and told him to come back weekly and he would have food for him.  The priest also recognized the fact that Jack looking Polish might save his life, so he dye Jack’s hair more blond and told Jack to use the Polish version of Jacob and he also taught him some Catholic prayers.  Thus Jack was able to save his life and as the years passed, he said he was Catholic.  Eventually the priest was taken away by the Gestapo.  Jack was four and five years old during these times.Then the Nazis began to move the Jews out of the ghetto, over-loaded them on freight train cars and sent them to Auschwitz.  Eventually all of Jack’s family was killed and the only reason why Jack wasn’t was because the Nazis thought him Polish and Dr. Mengele never got around to experimenting on him like he did the other children.  Through this story Jack tells about the atrocities that occurred.The slant in this story against other tales of Nazis and the Jews is that the story takes place in 2039, the Holocaust of the murder of six million Jews took place from 1939 to end of WWII and in the meantime in 2019 there was a slaughter of twenty-thousand Christians by Muslims, which was considered the Great Holocaust.Jack is now one hundred years old and there were only four or five other Jews that old who were Holocaust victims.  One by one they suffered mysterious deaths.  The officials of Austria, Germany and several European countries claimed Jack and the others lied.  That they did have camps where they simply held people who were considered anti-German.Jack spoke up about his experiences when he had a chance and his great grand-daughter, Christine, was able to get documented proof of these camps and the names and numbers who were killed, as they were original Nazi records.This put Jack and Christine’s lives in danger.  And the story continues with what they went through to prove what Jack said.  This is a fantastic plot, a page turner, but a true historical story based on facts.

"In 1840, Captain Eli Gaspar was in charge of a whaling ship off the coast of Puerto Rico.  He left a wife, Sarah, and a small daughter, Charlotte.  Eli and Sarah were very much in love,  but she was a weak woman and she worried always about Eli when he was away at sea, and she had problems coping with life when he was away.  He wouldn’t change occupations because whaling paid best.  In his last trip, they harpooned the biggest bull whale he had ever seen, and after hours of struggling to wear the whale out, it suddenly energized and smashed the whale boats, including the main ship that Eli was on.  There was a young boy, Henry, on the ship and Eli told him to go to the after house because that is where the men went when there was danger.  Eli finally drowned after three days floating on the roof of the after house, which was all that remained of the original ship.In Eli’s home town of Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island, a painter was renting this 300 year old house and he continuously painted pictures of ships and whaling and especially one portraying the last hours of Eli’s life.  It was always a mystery how this painter, who had never been to sea, was so accurate, but he made a fortune. After he died, a young divorcee, Remy, and her young daughter, Olivia, rented the house.  This didn’t set well with Eli, but Olivia was extra sensitive.  The rest of the story is composed of the trials and errors that continued in this house until a solution was finally reachedThis is an entertaining quick read and contains no ghostly horrors, but instead is amusing.

"The protagonist, Billy Redmond, has been hiding out in the mountains of Montana for twelve years ever since his wife, Jane, and daughter, Aspen were killed in a fire.  His former home was  Spokane, Washington but none of his family knew where he was except that he had left word with the director of an assisted living institution where his father and mother lived.  This was in case anything happened to either.  The director contacted him because his father, suffering from dementia, had passed.  He drove his old pickup to Spokane and stood back during the funeral, intending to leave immediately thereafter.  But as life so often does to us, he was not allowed to return to his former life. A few months prior, his brother, Trevor, and wife had been murdered while on a trip in Europe, leaving a six year old girl, Gracie, and a teenager, Kendall.  His mother, who was a very bossy and caustic person, spotted him and told him he had to show up for the reading of the will the next day.Trevor and wife had left the guardianship of their girls to Billy and Trevor’s sister, April, but Billy’s mother got a court order vacating April as guardian because she was a drug addict and could never be found, and appointing Billy.  Billy hadn’t been around children for so long, Kendall proved difficult, Gracie loveable, Billy’s mother impossible and then a stranger claimed that Billy’s daughter, Aspen, was alive but in jail in Spokane, going by the name of Libby and that he should go help her.From then on Billy is on a fast track trying to catch up and learn the truth of a multitude of lies, raise Trevor’s daughters, develop a kinship with his now nineteen year old daughter, Libby, and learn the truth of Jane’s death.  The author has a wit about him that shows throughout this story and although the plot is very convoluted, it is entertaining as Billy attempts to untangle everyone’s lives and find a new romance for himself.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone for a few hours of light reading.

"This is one of the best books I have read lately.  It immerses one in the Muslim and Western worlds.  Muslims, Jews and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain before Spain existed.  The area dominating this story was called Andalus by the Arabs and Berbers, Iberra by the Greeks and Hispania by the Romans.  The author did extensive research to be able to present to the readers the various characters who carried the tale forth, including all of the religious and social mores of these times.  The Arabs controlled this area for over seven hundred years.Noor was the daughter of King Tarik and is the protagonist who carries this story forward.  During these times, Islam was not so aggressive and actually considered itself an offshoot of Judism because Abraham was the reputed father of both races/religions.  Christianity was tolerated as long as it didn’t try to interfere with the other religions.  It is a shame that the world can’t continue along these line.In this story, Noor, as the surviving queen of Andalus continually faces wars as races fight for land.  There are too many colorful characters who demonstrate the times to attempt to describe in this review.  For any reader who loves historical novel and is intrigued by that part of the world and those times (remember the movie “El Cid”), you will be thoroughly educated and intrigued by this story.I was given a complimentary copy for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QEGU3IKK01V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTN7MFG#wasThisHelpful","R19QEGU3IKK01V","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a short, entertaining and rather intriguing mystery.  Cleo Cooper is quite knowledgeable about ferreting out good mineral or rock deposits and she believes that there is a large run of granite in NE North Carolina.  She has a little dog Tulip, who slips in and out of the story, and she has made a deal with the owner of the land covering this possible granite deposit, it turns out to be so, that Gladys Walton, the owner will deal with her.The story wraps itself around Cleo having a drilling crew out on the property drilling core samples near a house in which Gladys’ best friend Irene lives.  Cleo goes to the well on Irene’s property, and seems to fall in, although she feels more like she was uplifted quickly into it.  At the bottom of the well is Irene’s body.  Now include Gladys’ two adult children who have discovered their mother’s deal with Cleo and attempt to thwart it, having their mother sign over the rights to them.  Then mix in a lover of Cleo’s, her ex-husband, the sheriff, unexpected accidents and run-for-your life chases.This is a simple story, but good for a fast read and reasonably written.

"This novel contains many metaphysical teachings and beliefs and so may be a little difficult to understand for some readers.  The narrator of the story is John Burns, a clairvoyant therapist who has been working with Sophia Deming, a middle-aged, married Canadian woman residing in southern Florida with her second husband, Nigel Deming. She is the youngest of three sisters, Louise the eldest and financially secure, and Cynthia, the middle girl who is talented and a writer.  The parents of these girls were George and Amelia Kelly, both deceased by the end of this story, but Amelia was very talented as a painter and writer.Sophia is working with John because she is so miserable at this stage in her life.  When young, she was only interested in getting married, which she did and Nigel is her second marriage and then she became a nurse.  Because of such a talented mother and sisters, she feels she has failed in life and now she works as an administrator in a hospital to support herself and Nigel, plus she is taking college courses to improve her standing.John, in his therapy, recognizes her as a Libran and she is extremely talented, if she would only let herself go. She has a beautiful voice but won’t sing and whenever a new facet of life is suggested to her, she refuses even thinking about it by saying “but.”  Through the years Sophia has studied Jung, different religious thoughts and books of psychology.  She hates it in Florida because of the heat and she can’t grow the flowers she loves.  Finally in desperation, she returns to Canada to be with her sisters and her father is dying.  While she is gone, John can keep track of her actions and thoughts through remote viewing and often sends her mental messages to help her.Sophia always thought her mother didn’t love her, which often occurs with children, but it seemed to be mostly caused by her intense awareness of her mother’s talent as a painter.  When her father dies and she is going through his household effects, she comes across a story entitled “The Antiquity” written by her mother during the two week before her death.  Sophia feels that her mother is trying to tell her something since she left a note saying it was for Sophia.  The story is included in this novel and then Cynthia convinces Sophia to let her do a play of it, which she does and the entire play is also included in this story and it is difficult to determine if both of these are saying the same things because they are not verbatim.The story is well written but it will present a difficulty for some readers because John off and on goes through pages of dialogue expounding on his philosophy, which is most difficult to understand and then the original “The Antiquity” and the play do the same and the reader is at  a loss as to what the author is attempting to project.  Much of it made no sense to me, but the last chapter is narrated by Sophia and she explains what was meant because she finally has reached that pinnacle.I was given a complimentary copy of this book for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ZTQ94FGPGI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452568448#wasThisHelpful","R18ZTQ94FGPGI9","A26SW43I0MXGGA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26SW43I0MXGGA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author has done it again and come forth with another brilliant “who done it?” mystery.

"I bought Smokey Joe 18 years ago as a teenager (when it had the wood handle). I saved up my own money, $44 (a lot for a 13 year old) to get it. I always wanted one so I could barbecue on my own. I was so excited to try it for the first time! It wasn't easy to master charcoal grilling, but I eventually got it down. I don't barbecue much anymore, so I haven't used Smokey Joe in a few years. I did take it out of the plastic trash bag I had it stored in and it was as good as it was when I left it. No rust, no corrosion.Smokey Joe is a great little charcoal ""kettle"" grill. It's much better than the other offerings and cooks really well, as good as the other Weber kettles due to the design. The heat from the charcoal is radiated and conducted around the inside. Some exits the vent, but the majority stays inside. It stands about 18"" tall from the bottom of the stand to the too of the lid (not including the handle). It's probably 14"" in diameter at the grate, and has two air control vents- one on the bottom in the center, and one on the lid. The bottom vent has nice wide tabs for adjustment. The grill itself is made from stamped sheet steel, probably about 22 gauge or 20 gauge, that's been enameled with a nice rich polished black finish inside and out. For those unaware, this isn't powder-coat. It's a special paint containing glass fibers that is sprayed on, allowed to dry, and then fired at high temperatures like glaze on a piece of pottery or the enamel coating on your camp cookware. It's a very durable finish that will last for decades if cared for. I've never had any issues with chipping, peeling, or pitting with the finish. It cleans up well too.The cooking grate and fire grate are both steel. The fire grate is probably 10 inches across and a little heavier-duty and isn't chrome-plated like the cooking grate. The legs are actually bent aluminum bars that are fastened with bolts and wing nuts to the lower half of the kettle. The nuts are on the inside and also help support the fire grate. They join in the middle with a bolt and wing nut, which also holds the ash pan.  Overall the legs are the only weak link with Smokey Joe as they bend pretty easily and are a pain to bend back. The lid fits snugly to the lower half of the kettle to help control airflow.As far as function goes, it's great! I like it as much as a propane table top grill. Not as easy to use, but I like charcoal and how it adds flavor to the food when you use lump charcoal (all I use) with a charcoal chimney. The fire grate will hold a full chimney of charcoal, about 4 lbs and that will last a long time. I've fired up Smokey Joe, grilled, set it aside, and it was still hot enough to cook with an hour later. The grate isn't big. I could only fit 4 large burgers (6"" uncooked), but could fit a full dozen hot dogs at a time. It would easily roast a whole chicken or a couple of cornish hens. I could fit 2 big T-Bones on it as well, and 6 kebabs with room to spare. There are instructions for smoking as well, but I never used it for that. If you're cooking for a crowd, you will run out of room, but for a family or 3 or 4, it's just fine, especially if you don't have room for a big grill or want something portable for tailgating or camping.The only gripes I can think of is the legs are flimsy, the ash pan is a little too small for my liking, and the bottom vent can get jammed up with ash and be hard to adjust. It also gets hot so you can't do it bare handed. The airflow in the firebox area is a little uneven. There seemed to be a hot spot right in the middle of the charcoal. Not ideal.Some tips for cooking with charcoal...Use lump charcoal. Not briquettes. Lump charcoal is all natural, made from whole pieces of wood with no fillers. Briquettes are made from a mixture of charred wood chips, coal dust, calcium carbonate, and a binder like dextrin. I think lump charcoal starts easier, burns more evenly, and gives off better heat. Use a charcoal chimney with firelighters, not lighter fluid. I don't care how odorless they make it, I can always taste it on my food. A chimney also starts the charcoal more quickly and evenly. Try to lift the lid as little as possible while cooking. Unlike a propane grill where the heat is constant, it disrupts the airflow inside and can change the charcoal fire's heat output. It's okay to keep the bottom vent cranked wide open, but only when grilling burgers and hot dogs and some steak. Chicken and pork needs lower heat. Be patient! Charcoal doesn't cook like propane does, and the temperature doesn't respond as quickly.ProsAffordableWeber qualityWill last longer than youCompact and lightweightEasy to cleanPortableConsLegs are a little weakAsh pan is on the small sideBottom vent gets clogged with ash and is hard to adjustOverall, I recommend this over any of the other hibachi-type tabletop grills. It's not as easy as propane or as forgiving, but it cooks like nothing else. It's Weber, so it will last a very long time!

"One of the best Christian movies I've ever seen! I am a Christian, and don't normally watch many Christian movies. I've seen the popular ones (Fireproof, Courageous, Facing the Giants) by these directors, and they were good, but this one took the show. It's about an embattled family (the Jordans)-Elizabeth (wife) and Tony (husband) whose marriage is in serious trouble. Tony is a pharmaceutical salesman and is very successful and on top of the (his) world. Elizabeth is a real estate agent. They are both at odds with each other and don't know what to do, how to communicate, love, and give little attention to each other, all with their daughter in the middle. He is also flirtatious and gives into temptation. Things are bad, but Elizabeth meets a new client, Miss Clara, who soon bonds with her and starts to minister to Elizabeth. Eventually, Miss Clara gets Elizabeth back into a prayer life, teaches her to pray the right way for her family and Tony where the real fight is against the Devil, not her husband. Elizabeth gets into the groove of prayer, Bible reading, and growing into the wife and mother God intended. Soon, some things change and Tony gets fired from his job due to his own issues. That's when it gets interesting and we see how prayer works to do things and enable us to work in ways and love in ways we never thought possible in the midst of tragedy and trials, all by grace. I won't ruin the ending, but let's say that the Lord does a great work in all the Jordan's and the family is reunited under their prayer and God's grace and power working through it. Not by their own strength, but by God's intervention through prayer and God's presence. I love the Scripture at the end of the movie...2 Chronicles 7:14. See it. Even if you aren't a Christian, you will really like it and it will change you. I know it really encouraged me and motivated me to pray more, and pray the right way! Also, pay attention for surprise cameos throughout the movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5YSHNXZKFAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LIIYPY#wasThisHelpful","R3P5YSHNXZKFAL","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this as a Christmas present from my brother back in 2000 (I think). I've had it for 15 years, and I can say it's one of the better lighters I've used. It's super-simple only one moving part, no electronics, no electric igniters, no pressurized butane, and it's just about bulletproof. You can stomp it, run it over, drop it, dunk it in water, or leave it outside for weeks. It's wind-resistant and will burn just about any flammable liquid you can put in it, but I don't recommend anything other than Zippo or Ronson fuel, which is mostly naphthaline and some other hydrocarbons.I really do love the Zippos. They've been around forever and haven't changed a bit aside from some simple updates. It's made from formed sheet brass, I'd say about 28 gauge-it's pretty thin, that's gone through an extruder. The fuel reservoir, chimney, wick, and flint wheel are housed in the insert that slides into the body. It's made from sheet steel, bent and formed. The fuel reservoir is stuffed with cotton to hold the fuel, and the wick threads up through it. It's caped off by a dense piece of cotton held in place by a spring-loaded brass screw that houses the flint holder. To fill, you lift the cotton and squirt in the fuel until the cotton is saturated. Put the insert in the lighter body, and you're good to go! The lid is spring-loaded and snaps shut to extinguish the flame and keep out dust and dirt. It's not water proof, so it's not a water-tight seal, but it still resist water and would light when wet.To light it, flip the top and spark the wheel and that's it! Super simple. The wick is cotton with metal inserts to keep it standing up straight. It will last forever, and the only thing I had to replace was the flints, which also last a long time.As far as durability, this is one of the most durable lighters I've ever owned. It will last forever if you take care of it. The only things that would wear out is the wick and possibly the spring mechanism that holds the lid closed. It's wind-resistant. I've got it to keep lit in pretty windy conditions. The flame is bigger than most all lighters as well, as much as a butane lighter turned all the way up or more. The fuel lasts a long time if you don't keep it lit for long periods, otherwise it won't last nearly as long as a butane lighter. It's easy to fill, and it's important not to over fill it as it will leak out of the wick and all over the place. When you light it, poof! You'll have a lighter on fire. It uses the standard ""Zippo"" type fuels. I recommend only Zippo brand or Ronson. You could use gasoline, paint thinner, Coleman fuel, jet fuel, or diesel in a pinch, but I don't recommend it. I love this lighter. I don't use it much anymore since I don't smoke, but it is always on standby!Highly recommended for any survival kit, camp gear, or around the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FF00VC9HOSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5FLT0#wasThisHelpful","R31FF00VC9HOSW","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a gamer, but I have played around with these some, and I know a little bit about headsets and headphones so I figured I'd give my input. First, these are designed for the X-Box 360 console. They have a microphone for chatting (like a headset I used to use as a customer support rep) and two earphones for sound. I had never heard of Turtle Beach before my stepson got these so this was my first exposure to this brand.The design is fairly standard. They are ""over the ear"" type headphones, which fit around your ears, with two earphones connected by a nice wide padded headband. The headset is made pretty much entirely of plastic, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it keeps it lightweight (and the price down). They are able to swivel maybe 10 degrees to the right and left, and the band is somewhat adjustable, but I found it hard to adjust. It's interesting that the earphones are screwed to the headband as opposed to a traditional sliding band design. There's a nice, flexible microphone with a dampener on the end to minimize pops and noise from breathing (yes, it works). The earphones are nice and padded with a fabric like material that I didn't think was all that comfortable, not like some other brands that have a soft, faux leather material that really conforms to your ears and blocks out ambient noise and helps with bass response.Speaking of sound, the X12 has an inline amplifier that runs off a 5 volt USB port on the X-Box. Turtle Beach says it pushes a measly 35mW per channel, which is reasonable considering the sound output I got. The speakers themselves are 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets. There's a control module on the main cable (it's a full 16'-that's feet) long. It has controls for volume, bass, and chat volume, which you can adjust to be able to hear it in the headphones along with the game/movie audio, a useful feature.It's a little tricky to set it up. I am pretty good with electronics and audio stuff, and ended up consulting YouTube to get it to work. It will work with a PC as well as the X-Box, but it's a little different to set it up on a PC.For performance. In a word it was good, but not great in movies and games. I didn't use the microphone so I can't comment on that. I've listened to some really cheap $5 earbuds all the way up to $500 headphones, and these fall somewhere in the bottom half. There's no noise-cancellation option with these, so I think the $60 price point we paid is a little high. I will say it's a million times better than your TV's speakers, but I wasn't impressed. Nothing to write home about. The bass was mediocre with the bass boost turned all the way up, so I can substantiate the 35mW rating. I think they could have benefitted from some different padding on the earphones to seal them better to your ears. They are comfortable to wear, but I found that extended sessions with them did hurt my ears. They are nice and breathable, so my ears didn't sweat.The most annoying thing about these is the durability. They broke after a month when one of the earphones decided to break off from the headband below the screw mounts at the swivel. During the autopsy, I found that the swivel itself is only about 1/4"" wide. Obviously it wasn't an easy fix, but some JB Weld later and it was back up and running. Only a few weeks later it was broken again, so I ended up drilling down through the screw mount block, driving some 1/16"" steel rods through the holes to stabilize it and keep it from flexing, and JB Welding it all together again. So far no issues. It's uglier than before, but hey it works.ProsGood value (on Amazon)Decent performanceInline amplifierChat volumeLong cordConsBroke easilyNo noise-cancellingSound output could be betterUncomfortable during prolonged useInstructions were vague and confusingFor the price, there are better headsets out there. Turtle Beach has a big selection, and although I like the X12, I think there are better options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBCLNAUT2JIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EQE0YM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBCLNAUT2JIA","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with a Husky mower. You might know them for their saws, weed trimmers, blowers, and hedge clippers, and their professional mowers, and they make good products. They make 2 models of this, one with a Honda engine, and this one with the Briggs engine. It has all wheel drive, meaning it is propelled by all 4 wheels as opposed to the rear or front. It has smaller 8"" wheels in front, and 12"" wheels in back which is good for rough lawns or going up hills. It has a 22"" deck with an attachment for a hose for cleaning, and is a 3 in 1, meaning it bags, mulches, or can do side discharge. I am not sure how big the bag is, but it holds about the same amount of grass as the Honda I use from time to time. It's big enough to hold the grass from a 10,000 square foot yard, provided the grass isn't taller than 3,"" and keeps the dust down. All the wheels are ball bearing supported, and it's adjustable from about 2"" all the way up to 5."" Just like other mowers, adjusting the height isn't easy, but it's made easier by some WD-40 on the wheel pivots.I really liked the 4-wheel drive system although I can't really see any read advantages over a rear wheel drive system on other machines (I like it better than front drive). It's activated by a clutch drive system sort of like the hydrostatic drive on a riding mower. There's 2 handles on the handle that you squeeze to make it go faster. Squeeze harder, it goes faster. Simple. It works well and was easy to control when mowing around water handlers, trees, and edges. It goes from a very slow crawl to about 3 mph very quickly. The 163 cc 7.25 hp Briggs motor is more than powerful enough to get the mower going and up steep hills without bogging down. It cuts great as well. Grass leaves were cut very small and that's good. I was pretty impressed. It's relatively quiet, but not as quiet as the Honda 6.5 hp overhead cam motors. Like most all of the new engines, there's no primer or choke on the carb and no throttle control (which I didn't like). It started on the 2nd pull after sitting for a week. Impressive. It takes the Honda 5 or 6 pulls sometimes to get going. It's good on gas too. I mowed a 10,000 sq ft. yard and barely used 1/4 tank. The grass catcher is easy to remove and replace, although one of the mounting bars always gets caught on the pull start string.The only things I don't like about it is that there's no throttle control and I thought it's noisy. Also it's difficult to back it up if you need to because the groomer gets pulled too far under the deck. It's also heavy and I'm a pretty strong guy, but I found it a little hard to push when freewheeling. Husky gives you a 3-year warranty which is nice, but not as good as the Honda mowers.ProsAll wheel drive works goodInfinitely adjustable speed controlPowerful engineBall bearing wheelsNo chokeStarts on the 2nd pull when coldConsNo throttle controlA little noisyHeavyVery hard to back outDifficult to push when freewheelingBottom line: This is a very capable mower. Powerful, easy to use, and has Husqvarna quality. Would I buy this over the Honda? In short, personally no because for the same price Honda makes better motors with overhead cams (the Briggs is overhead valve), they have honest to goodness throttle controls, composite decks so they'll never rust, and they have the quadra-cut system with 2 blades, which cuts better, although I have no complaints about the Husky's performance! They have a better warranty as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUV6QOO5VE94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XCGX2#wasThisHelpful","R1DUV6QOO5VE94","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great story. I was skeptical at first, thinking it's another sports-theemed inspirational movie, but after watching it, I was surprised and inspired. ""23 Blast"" is based on the real-life story of Travis Freeman (played by Mark Hapka-you might remember him from a short stint in Days of our Lives). Travis is a small-town boy from Kentucky with a love for football. He grew up around the game, and at age 9 was water boy for the local high school football team, the Corbin Redhounds, which he aspired to be part of one day. However, at age 12, Travis was stricken with a serious and rare case of bacterial meningitis in his sinuses that nearly killed him. Although he survived, unfortunately, it left him completely blind in the span of 2 days. However, that didn't get Travis down and out for long. With some help from his parents, a tenacious mobility coach, and his childhood friend, Jerry Baker, Travis is able to live a normal life. He attends Corbin high school, and even goes on to play football for the Redhounds, fulfilling his dream despite his handicap.However in the movie, Travis Freeman is a junior at Corbin high school playing football for the Redhounds when he gets ill and is blinded. Also unlike real life, before the incident, Travis was a star player, exemplary student, and all around popular guy. Just as in real life, he is accompanied by his childhood friend, Jerry Baker, who plays as second string backup quarterback for the team. Jerry struggles with his own trials and tribulations, but serves as a great inspiration and encourager to Travis throughout his ordeal. Travis eventually gets well enough (with some help from the State appointed mobility coach, Patty) to get out and live more independently, and eventually get back to high school. With Jerry's help, Travis is able to fit in as a normal student. After a while, Travis is approached by the team's head coach, Coach Ferris (played by Stephen Lang), and asked if he wanted to play football again. Travis accepts, and is tasked with playing the center position. It wasn't an easy transition, and after a lot of practice, trial, error, and some humiliation, Travis gets the position down. The movie concludes with the final game of the Redhound's season with playoff implications. With everything on the line and seconds left in the game, after their running back and quarterback are injured, Jerry and Travis are called to the field by coach Ferris. I won't ruin the ending, but what ensued was really surprising and a really cool ending to the movie.I really enjoyed the credits because it showed real life pictures of the actual people involved in the movie, some of which stood in during filming (on site in Corbin, KY at Corbin HS, no less). These included Travis' mom and dad, his mobility coach, coach Ferris, and others from the film. As far as content, I really liked it. The acting wasn't cheesy (unlike some other Christian-ish movies out there), and it's well choreographed and produced. This movie is rated appropriately as well, with a minimum amount of cursing (occasional mild language), alcohol use (Jerry Baker struggles with alcoholism-as he did in real life), and no trace of sexual content to be found, other than a nice wet kiss from Travis' love interest, Ashley. I wouldn't recommend this as a child-friendly movie, but it would be appropriate for a young adult/teen.Some have said this is a Christian movie, and there are undertones to it, but it's nothing like movies like Fireproof, Courageous, or God's not Dead. Don't expect to see prayers, the gospel message, or evangelizing in 23 Blast. I thought it's kind of disappointing because the real-life Travis Freeman actually went on to become a pastor. He even makes an appearance in the movie when Travis and his family are in church. The pastor (Freeman) gives a message that I actually felt was inspiring, and I think it touched Travis (movie Travis) in a way that helped motivate him to press forward in life.So this was a good movie. I wished it were closer to real-life, but I'll take it. Not so much a Christian movie, but it's a great story that I am sure will inspire you. It spoke to me as I have a disability due to a brain tumor surgery I had 11 years ago. The message is that nothing is impossible if you believe and keep pressing on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QARWK474292S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH00JP6#wasThisHelpful","R1QARWK474292S","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Krazy Glue! I've been using it for years and years and it's been just about the go-to adhesive when things need fixing. Why do I like it so much? It works fast-usually only 30 seconds is all you need for a bond. It's strong-if you prep your surfaces being bonded. You only need a little-or you can use a lot. It bonds just about anything-wood, metal, glass, stone, plastics, ceramics, stoneware, pottery, rubber. I've repaired things that would have otherwise been tossed out and used it for tough jobs where JB-Weld or other glues wouldn't have worked like on small items, toys, electronics, and tools. I also follow an old mechanic's trick where if you cut yourself, you can use super glue to glue the wound shut. It's really amazing and I don't need a band-aid. Yes, it works! For the record, surgeons use a type of this glue to close incisions.I love it. The only time I don't use it is when I need a real strong bond or the bonding surface is too small or under shearing loads-then I reach for JB-Weld. I really like the design of the glue bottle and applicator and the protective tube. The glue container itself is small and holds about .14 oz of glue, but that's really all you need as a little goes a long ways. It has a green cap with a needle in the end to seal the tube after using it. This works very well. Better than some others I've tried from Loctite and Super Glue. The bottle dispenses a small drop at a time, which is good to avoid over-applying it and making a mess and having bonded skin. The tip is small, which I like, as it helps getting glue where I want it.Krazy Glue is really a chemical called cyanoacrylate-ester with proprietary fillers to speed bonding (usually powered glass) and cling. Cyanoacrylate has been used for a long time in the model airplane and boating hobbies to bond wood and plastic as a 2-part deal of the glue and the hardener/catalyst. This doesn't need the catalyst owing to the unique fillers in it. All it needs is pressure, or more specifically, the absence of air, which makes it great for quick bonds where you can't wait around holding the workpiece together. The bonded pieces are pretty strong, but surface prep is really important. The surfaces have to be clean of old glue or paint, and as flat and tight-fitting as possible. The better the parts fit, the stronger the bond will be.For all it's merits though, it has limits. It doesn't do well bonding small items together that will be under load. It doesn't have good shear resistance in those cases. Also, it doesn't work well on irregularly-shaped workpieces or porous surfaces or really shiny surfaces. To address those, you need to put glue on both sides being bonded. On some items like plastics, if you add too much, the excess glue seeps out and discolors the workpiece, especially on shiny plastics. It can also cause clouding near the joint on clear plastic like polycarbonates or clear polystyrenes.Other than that, yes, it bonds your skin in seconds. To release bonded skin, pull it slowly and gently  in little increments while applying rubbing alcohol to the affected area.  Mineral oil or vegetable oil can also help. Other than that, it really is a ""wonder product."" I can't imagine not having a tube or two around my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAB986JH4IXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CNZJA0#wasThisHelpful","R1GAB986JH4IXS","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this for about a month so I can give my professional opinion. I worked in IT, and did a lot of work on printers-configuration, setup, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair-on all kinds of printers, from $100 Brother monochromes, Xerox Phasers, HP, Epson, and Canon ink jets, to $20,000 Konica-Minolta BizHubs. I've seen a lot of good printers, some terrible ones, but I haven't come across any great ones. The 3460 is an exception. I've had experience with the WorkForce units and some of my customers really liked them. When I was asked which inkjet printer to buy, I told them get a WorkForce. This was on sale at C*stCo for cheap.In the box I got the printer, a set of inks that seemed to be full (standard capacity), not the reduced ""trial"" sizes some companies include), the power supply, and installation CD. The courage of printers was painfully evident: Epson still doesn't include any USB or ethernet cables. This is a commonality with all the printers I've worked with. It's not hard to pack a $5 ethernet cable or USB cable in the box. It was nicely packaged as well, but not an eternal struggle to remove it from the box. The 3460 is an update to the previous gen. WorkForce ink jets, which were really great. Ultra reliable, good output speeds and page counts, and pretty economical to run for an ink jet. Like the 3640, they all have print, scan, copy, and fax capabilities, and ran a multi cartridge setup (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow), which was nice because you could keep printing (limited to monochrome) when one color was very low or empty. My Epson NX625 couldn't muster that as well as the WorkForce for some reason.For those unaware, the WorkForce line is the business-oriented model of ink jet printers from Epson. They typically feature options for higher output and page count duty cycles (not unlike the HP OfficeJets), larger paper capacity with dual feeder trays, duplexing, ADF, automatic 2-sided printing (also scanning fax, and copying), and support for 14""x11"" stock and everything in between. The 3640 is no exception. It has all that and adds WiFi connectivity, Ethernet, and a USB option as well. Up front, you get a multi-card reader that reads SD, Memory Sticks, CF, and has USB input for connecting flash drives, cameras, or other external devices that you can directly print from without a PC. There's a nice 3.5"" LCD touchscreen as well, and a well laid-out control pad for the fax, copy, return button, and menu functions. Everything else is mirrored on the screen. Very nice. The screen itself is bright (you can adjust it), the UI is also nice and it's not hard to learn where all the menus, functions, and controls are located. It has an auto document feeder for the fax and copier, a scanner bed that will take books or stock, and 3 paper trays (2 up front, 1 in back) for different types of stock. Epson says room for 500 sheets and I believe it. The document feeder can hold 35 pages, which isn't bad!It has WiFi, ethernet, and the standard USB. It's not a small printer. I estimate it to be 17"" wide, 14"" tall, and 17"" deep, so make sure you have room on or under your desk. It's not heavy, under 30 lbs, so much lighter than a comparable laser. Setup was easy, and I'd say it would be easy for anyone. You can use the CD, or download the newest drivers from Epson, which I recommend because they are the newest releases with bug fixes and firmware. Install the inks, power it on, run the install program, follow the connection instructions (for WiFi or ethernet-USB is simpler), wait for it to finish (or update if using the disk), and print your test page. Voila! It's a quick process as well, something Epson has been good about in the past. For the fax it runs from the install program, but you can opt to do it later, which I did. Fax setup is simple enough, just make sure you use a filter if you're on DSL. If you use a PBX, make sure you select that from the settings and you should be good to go. Run a fax test of course-I fax HP's automated fax system for that.Performance is very good. Epson says 19ppm, and I agree. It's not as fast as my (expired) Stylus 625, but fast enough. Just as fast as a laser if not faster. First page out took about 6 seconds over ethernet, which is pretty good. Not as good as my retired HP LaserJet 2xxx series, but still good. I don't know the max resolution, but text and graphics came out very crisp and sharp. Photos were also good on standard ink jet paper and would be a lot better on photo paper. You can set the print quality that ranges from fast draft, draft, normal, and photo (very high) quality. Scans were completed quickly from both the ADF and glass, and the scan utility was easy to use. Copies were fast too from both the ADF and on the glass. The fax is a fax. It's about as fast as any other fax machine I've used. There are tons of parameters you can adjust from the touch interface. The screen is responsive and sensitive, but not overly sensitive, and the icons and graphics looked good and were totally legible. A really neat feature this has is the ability to print from your mobile (iOS or Android) device and tablet. Follow the directions to set up the link, and you can print web pages, documents, pictures, or graphics from your device over the air.Now as far as this being economical. Typically in the long run, lasers are more economical than ink jets, especially if you print a lot (10,000 images a month). A large toner can pump out 2000 pages. This will barely get out 200 with standard inks, and probably another 100-150 with the XL's. Obviously, printing text and graphics will stretch that, but using it for photos and graphic intensive tasks will quickly drain them. Also cleaning the print head and power-on's drain the ink, as the print head is cleaned during power on. Cartridges for this typically run about $35-$40 for the colors (they come individually packed or as a 3-pack-the 3-pack is cheaper to buy) and a black runs $16 or $17. That's for the standard capacity. For the XL's plan on spending $20 to $40 more for the color and blacks. If you run them all dry and have to buy 4, plan on dumping out about $100 for the XL's and $50-55 for the standards. Cheaper than toner (OEM), but not by much. You can get remanufactured toners for much cheaper. On a side note: Unlike laser toners, which you can get away with, do NOT use refills in these printers! They either don't work or will work a little, and when they do, the print quality is not as good as the OEM's, and they don't last as long. More lines, less coverage, and dead spots even after cleaning and aligning the heads. The refills aren't much more than the OEMs. It's better to keep it on. It has an eco-mode that puts the machine into a suspended animation until you wake it up (tap the screen) so it doesn't use a lot of power. I say under 10 watts at idle, maybe less. A lot less than a laser printer, even at idle.Sending faxes is a good experience. Provided the fax is correctly configured and working, it's a breeze. You can program commonly-used numbers into the speed dial memory. You can schedule a fax, pause it, set it for auto pickup, program the number of rings, set templates, assign signatures, etc. Lots of features for all 4 functions. The scan interface is the standard Epson-style. Same as my Stylus. Not the most feature-rich or easy to use (my HP utilities are my favorite), but still functional. This machine requires very little finagling and it's easy to set up.Final thoughts: This is my favorite ink jet printer. No, it's not HP, and I really like HP (my OfficeJet 6310 is almost 10 years old and works fine), but I prefer the Epson. The new HP Envy units are impressive, but for price and performance and features, it's hard to beat the 3640. I highly recommend this printer. If you own a small home-based business, or want a quality, high-output ink jet, go for the WorkForce. If not this one, the step down is perfect for just about any print job. However, this isn't a laser and isn't meant to do continuous jobs, so if you do over 300 images a month, go for a small laser. Otherwise, I recommend this over any other.Pros:EconomicalVersatilePrints fastHigh quality printsFast first page outUser interface is easy to useComes with 4 inks that seem to be fullReliable3.5"" touch screen interfaceCan print wirelessly from mobile devices and tabletsCons:Ink is still expensive for relatively low page outputsDoesn't include any cables (USB or ethernet)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31RT5KJ8XEUTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGEUC#wasThisHelpful","R31RT5KJ8XEUTY","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my stepson for Christmas in 2014. We got it at a local retail store on a holiday sale for $25*. It came bundled with a wireless controller, 2 games, a cheap headset with mic, the power supply, power cord, and all the cables needed to get it going on your TV. There was also a free month of Xbox Live, which you needed in order to play games. They had one with the optional Kinect, but it was almost $100 more.For those who aren't familiar, the Xbox 360 is Microsoft Corp's venture into the console gaming arena back in 2005, joining the already wildly successful Sony Playstation 3 console that otherwise owned the market. Like Sony's online community, Microsoft's Xbox Live paid subscription online community linking Xbox owners together where they can buy apps and games, receive Microsoft software updates and patches, and do multiplayer. All you needed was an Internet connection and pay Microsoft $60 a year for ""Xbox Live."" The original was buggy, and later versions suffered from a hardware flaw that caused the console to overheat (Red ring of death) and in some cases completely lock up. Unless you did some major surgery to fix it, your Xbox became a paperweight. The later versions fixed that problem. This is the newest 360, the ""E"" model, following the 2010 ""S"" model. The 360 ""E"" brought about some welcomed changes. One was a change in hardware. Mircosoft offered the 360 with or without a hard drive. Ones without the hard drive had 4 GB of user storage for user profiles and whatever games could fit. It's better to pay the extra $100 to get the 250 GB model.The original Xbox had a processor based largely on Intel's ""Coppermine"" Pentium III CPU's. The new ""E"" iteration has a 3-core CPU made by IBM based on  PowerPC, codenamed Xenon with a separate graphics processor. The ""E"" 360 has a SoC, with the GPU and CPU integrated on a single PCB. The CPU runs at 3.2 GHz, and can run 2 threads per processor core, so it's a lot like Intel's Hyperthreading tech. The first Xbox had a Nvidia graphics processor. The 360's graphics processor is made by ATi (now AMD). The power supply is external, and the power brick is big and heavy. It has to be to run the 180 watt Xbox.It runs ""silver"" disks (not compatible with Bluray) from the optical drive that will read DVD's of all kinds (DVD-R/RW), CD's of all types (R-R/W+/- MP3, etc.) and the game disks, so you can watch movies or listen to music on it. For connectivity, on the back you get a full-size HDMI and a component video out (yellow, red, white) that's set up as a 3.5mm jack terminating in the composite plugs that go to the TV, a lot like a video out for an older digital camcorder. For the record, you're going to want to toss those out because it works best with the HDMI. The max video resolution for the 3 plug output is only 480i and both signals are analog, not digital. HDMI funs full HD at 1080p with digital audio that's a lot better. It's odd that Microsoft didn't include an HDMI cable...why wouldn't you include a $5 cable in a $275 console bundle? It's like the $600 printers that don't include ethernet cables or USB cables. Sheesh. For the audio, it comes with support for 5.1 Dolby Surround. There is no digital audio, just the standard 2-channel from the composite. For digital audio you need to run the HDMI.The bundle comes with one wireless controller. It runs on the 2.4 GHz band, and you get good connection up to 30 feet. It runs on 2 AA batteries and boy does it use batteries! If you use it a lot, a set of batteries will only last you maybe 3 weeks. I use high capacity rechargeable and still only get that much. The battery back detaches from the back, and it's not very durable. Mine is held together with duct tape and super glue at the moment. Older Xbox controllers work just fine...plug them into the USB in front.The 360 has both a RJ-45 fast ethernet (10/100) or WiFi 2.4 GHz. There's also 4 USB 2.0 ports. 2 on the front for controllers or other devices, and 2 on the back. The software features are endless. Microsoft transferred a lot of it's Windows genius to the Xbox. When you sign up with Xbox Live, you  go to the Xbox Live user interface, which took some getting used to, but is overall a nice layout. It's arranged a little like Windows 8. You have access to Microsoft's Xbox Live app store where you can get access to online game marketplace to buy games and DLC's, apps for Netflix, Hulu, Nickelodeon, YouTube, and others. There is also a weird rendition of Internet Explorer built in that lets you (somewhat) browse the web. It's nothing like the desktop PC equivalent though, but good enough to do basic stuff. The sad part is you need to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold to use it all for $60 a year. Sony's Playstation Network has been free since inception, but I hear that's changing soon...Gameplay is good. Audio is good, and graphics are good too in HD. Now for the record, for those folks throwing down the argument that PC's game better than consoles...well you're right for the most part. Yes, you can game in 4k on a PC with multiple monitors and have amazing frame rates and audio quality, but you're going to pay for it. The Xbox One costs around $400. A PC that can game in 4k, or even 1080p will run you twice to three times that much, not including the monitors. So if you want to game, but don't want to spend $1200 on a gaming PC, get the Xbox One. It's amazing.  Even the 360 is good on games in HD. I have no issues with the video quality or audio quality. The 360 will play the older previous-gen Xbox games, but for the older games, some won't run in HD. My Star Wars Battlefront 2 only runs 480i even with the HDMI cable. You won't get HD until you get into games launched around 2007. Watching YouTube and Netflix is nice too. HD videos play well, and on a nice HDTV it's a great experience! I have noticed that it does get hot when playing games like Minecraft. Nothing real bad, but it was alarming at first.As far as the game selection...there are tons. If you can think of it, it's probably an Xbox game or been ported to Xbox. There are games on disk and games for download. The bundle came with Halo 4 and Tomb Raider. As a side note, the most profitable game franchise in history, Halo, debuted on the Xbox. The rest is history.So now that the Xbox One is alive and well, is it worth getting the now year-old ""E"" 360? I think it depends. If you haven't got the extra $150 or so to spend, then get the 360 with the 250 or 320 Gb hard drive. If it were me, I'd keep saving and get the One. It adds all of the stuff missing from the ""E"" 360 and competes well with the PS4. The bummer is you can't play older Xbox games on it, but Microsoft has a fix for that in the works I hear...Pros:Versatile: plays all Xbox games (except One)Great gaming performancePlays CD's and DVD'sFull size HDMI output4 USB 2.0 portsWiFiLots of options for apps, Internet, and social mediaCame with Halo 4 and Tomb RaiderNice user interfaceConsNo digital audio (optical) optionNo Bluray driveGot real warm during gamesDidn't come with HDMI cableExternal power supply is bulkyNeed to sign up for Xbox Live Gold to use games and appsSo that's the Xbox 360's newest (and last) iteration. Microsoft says it will stay on the books until 2016, so if you've got one, enjoy it white it lasts. Would I get one? It depends on how much money you've got. For $280...no, because soon the One will come down enough in price and with Microsoft unlocking it soon so it will play all Xbox games, I see no point in getting one at that price point. Otherwise, it's a great box that will keep you entertained until the cows come home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7GGCHKZNFQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FATRKOK#wasThisHelpful","R3D7GGCHKZNFQT","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this monitor since early 2005 and it has been a great monitor for the last 10 years. No dead pixels, no ghosting, no fading, and no burn-in. It's just a good as it was when it was new. The Syncmaster is an LCD display with a 17"" (measured from top corner to bottom corner) viewing area. It's not a widescreen, so expect the standard 4:3 format for videos and multimedia. It has a fluorescent backlight and a matte screen to prevent glare. It has both VGA D-Sub and DVI inputs for digital and analog. It has an internal power supply, so it takes a standard 3-prong PC ATX power cable, so there's no power supply to mess with.It has some pretty nice features too. It has an auto adjustment that actually works as it should. You can adjust just about every display parameter possible, way more than I ever had a use for since the auto adjust worked so good. It's not the thinnest thing out there, but this is 2005 vintage display tech at a time when CRT monitors were still in use. It's not too heavy as it's mostly made of plastic and ultra thin sheet steel and aluminum. Unlike some of the Dell monitors in this class (17 and 19"") it's pretty light. I'd say it's under 6 lbs. I think it's about 2.75"" thick.  at the thickest part (the part where the stand attaches on the back.It comes with a stand that raises it up to a good height for viewing. It's not adjustable for height and it doesn't pivot like the Dell monitors of the same period, but it's the right height for most people. It's nice and bright, but there were times when viewing some multimedia that I had to turn the brightness up. Not a huge deal though. Because it's an LCD, don't expect the high contrast and color saturations of an IPS or LED backlit panel you see today. It's got nice viewing angles too. The response time (between frames) is .8 ms, which is pretty good, only a couple tenths off some of the newer monitors out there. Contrast ratio isn't the greatest at 600:1, but this isn't an ultra-high resolution display. It maxes out (natively) at 1280x1024, which is the best you can get with VGA, forget DVI, but then again this screen is so small you really wouldn't get much benefit from DVI over VGA anyways. There's no speakers and no USB plugs with this one either, but that's just fine. It keeps the weight down and the power consumption and heat. Because this uses a CFL for illumination, it does get pretty warm with prolonged use. Not real hot, but it doesn't stay cool to the touch.Overall this is a nice (even today) monitor. It's cheap, simple, and will last forever. It has decent viewing angles (for an LCD PC monitor), is bright, and has good contrast and color accuracy. I wished the native resolution was higher and the contrast ratio was better, but hey, for a 10-year old display, I can't complain. It's outlasted 2 printers and one PC!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYE1WI3O1XOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009CEL18#wasThisHelpful","R1WYE1WI3O1XOB","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 2nd installment of the Star Wars franchise- Attack of the Clones. It continues where the 1st installment, The Phantom Menace, concludes.  Anakin, now a young man (probably 17 or 18), is progressing rapidly in his Jedi training, and although he is brilliant with his lightsaber and as a pilot, is very much an arrogant, headstrong, and often argumentative pupil, much to the chagrin of Obi-Wan. Padme Amidala has grown up into a gorgeous young woman, and the former Queen of Naboo now occupies a seat in the galactic senate. All is not well in the galaxy though, as a dark shroud that is the dark side of the Force has clouded and obscured the Jedi Master's insight into the mysterious inner workings within the Republic, and the strengthening of the Separatists droid army and Trade Federation has plunged the galaxy into economic and political strife, with many star systems dissenting to join the Trade Federation. In like fashion, Anakin and Obi-Wan are tasked with protecting Senator Amidala after an assassination attempt. In a unique turn of events, Anakin is given the responsibility of protecting Padme after Obi-Wan is send on a Knight's errand by the Jedi Order to trace the suspected assassin back to Kamino, where Obi-Wan discovers a decades-old secret plan by the Republic and Jedi Order to build an army of clones to protect themselves from the Separatists.This movie is a lot different than the first. There's more lightsaber and epic battle scene action, more drama (as in an unfolding romance between Anakin and Padme), a somewhat jumbled-up story line with Hayden Christensen (Anakin) slowly but surely coming under the influence of the dark side with his inability to control his feelings (and his preoccupation with Padme). The acting is a little stale at times, and there's a cheese-factor sometimes, but it's somewhat classic Star Wars. Overall, it's a good movie. I don't give it 5 stars simple because it didn't feel like a great movie. It's still Star Wars though! Love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMDJ5G68WVQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMHYA38#wasThisHelpful","R3QMDJ5G68WVQA","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Revenge of the Sith is the 3rd installment of the Star Wars series. Although Episodes 1-3 are totally different than 4-6, I think Lucas did a great job of following the canon between the sequels/prequels. I thought it would be a total mess, but the story lines actually follow each pretty well. The acting on Anakin's part is better. The dialogue isn't as cheesy and stale, and it's more suspenseful with better CGI.Here's my overview without spoiling it if you haven't seen it...It's critical to have watched the other 2 movies to get what's happening in this one as they all play together. Episode 3 sees Anakin progressing as a Jedi apprentice (he moved up from Padawan), Obi-Wan's increasing frustration with his Anakin's lack of discipline and inability to control his feelings (as he comes under the increasing influence of the dark side), and the Jedi council's increasing suspicion that something's awry with the Galactic Senate and the shadow of the dark side looming over it. We learn of Padme's wonderful revelation as well, and we see the appearance of General Grievous (the droid army's commander in chief) for the first time. It's full of epic battle scenes from the Clone War with the droid separatist forces in space and on land. Not like the 2nd film where it's basically Geonosis. These battles take place on Utapau, in space, and other worlds. The CGI is better (I think), and the storyline is more developed. Ewan MacGregor (Obi-Wan) is brilliant (again) and it's nice to see some emotion and expression in Hayden Christensen (Anakin) as well, something lacking in the 2nd installment.It was absolutely heart-wrenching when Anakin befriended (against the Jedi Council's order) Chancellor Palpatine (the mysterious Sith lord), who manipulated him and told him he could prevent Padme from dying if he embraced a new facet of the Force, as foretold in Anakin's recurring nightmares. As their relationship progressed, he became more disenfranchised, aloof to the true force and his role as a Jedi (he never became a Jedi Master), and eventually melted like butter in Palpatine's hand. It was nice to see it make sense- Anakin's strange behavior in the 2nd movie, arrogant, unpredictably violent tendencies, and totally un-Jedi like demeanor, turn to the dark side in tragic fashion and morph into the Sith Lord's new apprentice- whom any Star Wars fan knows is the completely heartless and evil Darth Vader. We finally get to see why Vader has to wear the iconic and infamous black cybernetic suit as well (thank Obi-Wan for that).Other hallmarks critical to the latter 3 installments includes the breakup of the Galactic Republic and the formation of the Galactic Empire, the birth of Luke and Leah and their journeys, and the demise of the Jedi order with Obi-Wan and Yoda's exile. Good stuff.If you've seen the 1st and 2nd installments, get this one and watch it. It's almost a no-brainer  anyways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWE981ALEKPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JLXH#wasThisHelpful","R3SWE981ALEKPD","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The #10 (formerly A5) is a cold plug with a thicker element, designed for higher nitro content fuels, high-compression engines, and warmer temperatures. I used this when it was the A5 plug in my .15 CV with a high compression head. It didn't like the A3's and the #8's were finicky when I tried 25% nitro, so I tried the A5 and was pleased with it. The summer weather made the motor run hot on 25% with the #8 plug, so I switched to the A5 for a while and the tuning was a little easier. Once I switched back to 20%, I started using the #8 again because I couldn't make power with the A5 installed, so you'd want to use this on a motor with higher compression or when using high nitro content fuels (above 20%). Any higher nitro and probably best to go to the R5. It didn't last as long as the #8 did, and it was more expensive, but for a high performance plug, you can't go wrong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIOSIPMYI91M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015GGQN8#wasThisHelpful","R1HIOSIPMYI91M","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for Christmas last year along with some AAA and AA high capacity Powerex rechargeable batteries. For the record, although this is branded Tenergy, I got mine from Batteries Pl*s, and it was the same charger, but it was rebranded as a one-hung lo brand ""Nuon."" Outside it's the same case, and inside it's the same electronic systems, just a different branding.This is supposed to be a ""smart"" charger, and in some ways it is, but I guess that depend s on your definition of ""smart."" Like most all battery chargers, it has built-in microprocessor controls that monitor the cell condition, temperature, and voltage,  and adjusts the charging current to give the best possible charge delta. It accommodates only four batteries at a time (two 9 volts), but will charge rechargeable NiCad and NiMH battery chemistries. It's compatible with AAA, AA, C, D, and 9 volt cells. Sadly, it won't do Li-Ion cells. There are two charging modes that you select with a switch. ""A"" mode is for lower capacity batteries (under 1000 MAh and the ""B"" mode is for batteries 1000-2700 MAh. When the switch is in the A position, it charges the batteries for 4 hours, but when it's set for high-capacity batteries, it takes 8 hours, and they aren't exaggerating. Interestingly, you have to plug it in after you load the batteries or it won't work right according to the directions. I charged 4 AAA 1000 MAh Powerex batteries, and 4 AA 2700 MAh Powerex cells, and it took a full 8 hours. Even when they were out of the package and had a slight charge to them, so this isn't a ""quick"" charger. It does have a row of 4 red LED's that turn off when charging has completed. To differentiate them from the rest of the batteries, the LED's for the 9 volts are green. My gripes besides the long charge cycle was that it felt cheap, smelled bad when charging, and didn't have adequate ventilation. It did get quite warm during charging, so I am not sure how that will affect the batteries longevity.Pros:CheapSimple set-and-forget auto shut off and trickle chargeCharges NiCad and NiMH high and low-capcityCharges all of the popular battery types AAA, AA, C, D, 9 voltLED indicators let you know when charging has completedConsNo real-time monitoringNo conditioning or break-in modesNo display for charging statusFeels cheapSmelled bad during chargingSeemed to have inadequate ventilation for coolingFor all it doesn't do, it will still charge your batteries better than an analog charger, won't overheat them or overcharge them, and shuts off it it gets too hot. It's a simple, low-cost charger that's pretty versatile. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of the $50+ chargers, but it's compelling that a $30 charger does lots more, and you get real-time monitoring.

"I got these for Christmas last year in a pack of 8 batteries from Batteries Pl*s. They cost about the same here as there, so no qualms about going Amazon for them if you're curious. They came in a transparent plastic clamshell container that snaps together and it's really handy for keeping them together. This isn't my first set of NiMH rechargeable batteries. The last set I had was way back in 2003 when NiMH cells were just getting affordable and practical. This is my first experience with ""Maha"" branded batteries though.For the record, these are the highest mAh capacity AA's out there that I know of. The package says 2700 mAh, but I have heard of them coming in slightly less than that even after being conditioned, which I think would be a good idea with these if your charger has that function. The ""can"" of the batteries seem to be well-made, and the negative side of the can has a dimpled surface which is nice for keeping the batteries snug against contacts and makes it harder for them to fall out. They are NiMH chemistry, nickel metal hydride electrolyte, and as such only produces 95% of the voltage an alkaline cell does. A far cry from the 1.2 volts the first NiMH cells managed. I put 8 of these on my multimeter with a 3200 ohm 2-3 watt load, and got:1.42v1.42v1.43v1.44v1.43v1.42v1.42v1.42vThis is compared to the 1.5-1.7v for alkaline, so expect a drop in performance from items powered by electric motors or lamps. I put them primarily in an X-Box controller and RC car (takes 6 of them) and noticed a definite difference in the car's speed compared to alkaline cells. As far as run time, I did notice a difference between these and a name brand cell in the RC car. I'd say at least 30% more run time before being too drained for the car to move. I ran these in a wireless X-Box controller and got a good 2 weeks worth out of them with several hours use each day. I can't comment on how they would work in other devices, but I could reckon that it you put these in something like a TV or stereo remote, they'd last forever, probably years before needing to be charged. In something like a flashlight, digital camera, flash, or low-draw toy, these would give excellent run times. The downside of all that capacity is charge time. In my Nuon ""smart"" charger (it's not that smart), takes forever. They needed the full 7-8 hours for the lights on the charger to come off. Lame. I am not sure how they'd do in a different charger. On another note, the plastic film label on on of the cells has started to peel off. Not sure why as I haven't abused or roughed these up at all.ProsAffordableVery high capacityConsistent voltage output under loadHandy storage caseSeems to be a quality productConsNeed to be slow chargedReally need to be conditioned for maximum performanceLabel is already peeling off one batterySo that's the Maha Powerex AA batteries. I like them so far, and they seem to have gotten better with age. I have no reservations recommending them.

"These are rechargeable AAA batteries. I got them for Christmas from Batteries Pl*s for about $5 more than on here. I also got the Nuon ""smart"" charger. I've had no experience with the high capacity NiMH batteries, just the standard capacity (like 600 mAh), so I was excited to get to try them out. Being rechargeable, the chemistry limits them to about 1.4 volts, not the 1.5-1.7 (both measured by my multimeter) of alkaline batteries. So you can expect a drop in performance from devices like lights, lamps, and items with electric motors. These are listed at 1000 mAh, which is a lot. The highest I've seen for AAA rechargeables. My main application for them was in my electric shaver/trimmer, which is an absolute battery hog. I had been buying batteries from the Dollar Store (4 batteries for $1). Two alkaline batteries lasted for maybe 3 uses of 10-15 minutes each time.After trying the Powerex batteries, I was less than thrilled. The drop in output voltage is noticeable. The motor doesn't spin as fast, and for cutting hair, that's not good as you don't get clean cuts and it pulls the hair. On the plus side, I did notice slightly longer run times, but strangely, the margin wasn't impressive, maybe an extra 30 minutes of run time overall, so the extra time was welcomed. It was kind of offset because the slower motor speed meant it took longer to knock down my beard. I put them (3) in my high powered LED flashlight, and I could tell a sight drop in light output, but the run times was a better. I didn't measure it, but I'd say it was about an hour, probably more added run time. Use these in something like a TV remote and it will probably be good for a couple years of use before needing a recharge. For the record, all that capacity means they took forever to charge. When they had run down to 1.24v, four batteries needed a full 8 hours to fully recharge in my Nuon, AKA Tenergy charger. I would say that like all high-capacity rechargeables, these would benefit from conditioning to keep them operating at maximum efficiency. The battery ""can"" itself seems to be sturdy and well-made, but the negative contact is missing any kind of dimple or ridges to help keep the battery seated on the contacts. The AA version of these has a roughened negative side. Not sure why these don't.ProsHigh capacitySturdy constructionSeem to be good qualityConsNegative contact was flat and smoothTakes forever to chargeNeed to be conditioned for maximum outputI'd have no reservation recommending these. Be sure to invest in a good quality digital charger so you can run them through a conditioning cycle. I am sure they will get better with age, but conditioning would be helpful. Otherwise, great batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176QGN0ODUM8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VW5W9A#wasThisHelpful","R176QGN0ODUM8B","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My stepson has head this for years and years. It sat in the closet until I found it. I thought it was a gimmick, until I started digging in the toy box and found the controller. After more digging, I found the eye glasses. I love RC cars, and my son told me it had a video camera in the car that you can see through the glasses.Naturally, I couldn't resist giving it a try. I put in some fresh batteries and gave it a spin. It works! At first I was a little disappointed because it seemed cheesy, but after a while, it grew on me.The car itself has a camera built into a pod in the front that can tilt up to about 75 degrees. It has 3 lenses on the pod. One is the actual camera lens, and it's flanked by two others. I am not sure what purpose they serve, but one seems to be an infrared illuminator and the other is a receiver. The glasses have a TV projector that projects to the right eye. It has a soft rubber eye cup that helps if you have glasses, but it doesn't work the greatest. The controller has a single on/off switch, and the glasses plug into the bottom with a 3.5mm jack. You get forward/reverse and left/right controls for the car. Pretty standard RC car stuff.How does it work? I thought it worked pretty good. Please note this is 2006-era tech when POV and FPV technology was in its infancy for the consumer market, so I didn't expect much, and that's what I got. It works, and that's enough for me. The camera only does monochrome, and the resolution less one of those portable black and while televisions. The screen itself is tiny, about 1"" square, smaller than the viewfinder on an old video camera from my high school video production class. It's bright enough, but don't expect ultra-clear pictures. In the dark, even dim light, the picture is so dark you can't see. That's not surprising as the camera lens is so tiny, a hair bigger than a cell phone camera.The car takes 12 (yes, 12) AA batteries, 6 for the controller and 6 for the car. That's a lot of batteries, more than any RC car I've ever seen, and more than any toy I've ever seen. It's good to use alkaline and not rechargeable batteries because they have more voltage (1.5 versus 1.2). It might not be a big difference, but it adds up and that extra voltage helps with the car's speed and maneuverability. I used it with rechargeable batteries and I could tell a difference. The batteries don't last very long either. I have 2700 mAh capacity AA rechargeable batteries and I only got a few days of occasional (10-15 minutes) of use before the car was sluggish and barely moved. With alkaline cells it's even less.It's easy to control. It's a single speed and isn't variable, so you get full forward and full reverse speed, which with fresh batteries (alkaline) is about 4 mph. The steering is instantaneous- snapping left to right very quickly. It was fast enough to be useful. I think if it went any faster it would be hard to get a clear picture on the camera and control it. This was designed for kids, and it's probably not a good idea to have an RC car going 10 mph in the house crashing into things because it takes a little while to get used to controlling something from the car's point of view. The turning circle isn't very good because of the wide tires and weak motor, so it got stuck easily. Not a huge deal, but annoying. The range is terrible indoors. I could only get maybe 20 feet before the picture in the viewfinder was so garbled and scrambled it was illegible. A far cry from the miles of range from the new FPV machines.The glasses leave a lot to be desired as they aren't very eyeglass friendly. I wear glasses and they didn't fit over my face close enough to my eyes to get a good view of the viewfinder. Thankfully, the viewfinder can tilt up and down, so I was able to position it downward enough to get a good look.As far as durability is concerned, I was impressed. This is a rugged toy. It's heavy, sturdy, and the plastics are strong polystyrene. The axles would be the only weak link and there's no suspension, but that makes it stronger, and the axles are steel and imbedded into the wheels so unless it was stepped on by an average-sized man, they wouldn't bend. The same for the glasses and controller. The cable for the glasses will disconnect from the controller before it breaks. Both were sturdy and seem indestructible.Pros:Sturdy and durableReally funWorks goodAhead of it's time (for 2006)Easy to useCons:Range is really shortGlasses didn't work well with eyeglassesCamera viewfinder could be bigger and brighterLow resolution pictureUses lots of batteriesPoor battery life with standard capacity batteriesSo that's the Wild Planet Spy Gear video car. For its time it was amazing. There weren't many practical toys that worked this well 9 years ago, and even today I think it's still useable, especially if you don't have a smart phone or a lot of money to spend on a new one. It's good for kids and big kids alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWC3OXX2UEYO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMRVI8#wasThisHelpful","RWC3OXX2UEYO9","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice basic stand. It's not super fancy, but good enough. It came in 2 pieces, the legs were folded up and the bottom piece that cradles the guitar was separate. The top of the stand telescopes up or down to fit different sizes of guitars, so you could put a banjo, a lute, or something like a ukulele on it. The legs fold down and have rubber feet on the ends, the neck cradle is also padded with foam, as well as the bottom part. There was a warning sticker on it about not using it with nitrocellulose finishes, so I think the foam has something in it that hurts that finish. The stand is pretty sturdy and solid. Holds the guitar (a larger bodied acoustic Fender) just fine. No issues. The bottom is a little wobbly and isn't held in by anything- it just sits inside the upright tube.

"This is a slip-on TPU case. TPU stands for thermoplastic polyurethane, a semi-rigid quasi-rubber material that's impact resistant and pretty tough. I've had good luck with TPU cases and silicone cases over the years so I thought I'd get this one. The case works, the only issue is that it didn't fit on the phone very well. The bottom left corner kept slipping off and the edge of the phone was exposed. Not good. Empire Cases was amazing though and I was able to exchange it for another flip wallet style case. Quality issue aside, TPU cases are good, simple, cheap insurance for your phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M96TTT2QDCYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWNVWN4#wasThisHelpful","R2M96TTT2QDCYU","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my trusty Optimus L9 for 2 years, and it's been a good phone. It was a mid-tier smartphone, and I got it on a good deal from T-Mobile (paid $224 for it). It was a massive upgrade from my old, but great Exhibit 4G and I initially like the big 4.5"" 540x960 qHD screen, big battery with removable back and expandable storage, dual-core processor and dedicated Cortex GPU, thin profile, sturdy build, Android Jellybean, and LG's nice Optimus interface. Now, after 2 years, it's beginning to show it's age. 4.5"" screens have become the bog standard, dual-core processors have gone the way of the dinosaurs, even in mid-tier phones. As much as I wanted to keep loving the L9, it's now becoming a 3rd wheel.Enter the L90. It's a mid-tier smartphone. Mid-tier means it won't have an 8 MP or higher camera, a 5+"" 1080 (even 720) screen, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB storage (although the Samsung Galaxy Avant, the L90's rival, does), the latest quad-core processor and GPU, LTE (again, the Avant does), or ultra-thin and light construction.The L90 is a T-Mobile only device (for the US anyway) and the bigger, more mature brother to the L9. Although it still has ""L"" and ""9"" in the title, the L90 isn't the same phone. There are similarities, but hardware/software-wise there are some significant differences. First off, it's bigger, measuring 5.18"" tall x 2.60"" wide x 0.38"" thick. A little thicker than the L9's .36,"" but I found it's still easily to hold and rides nice in the pocket for a biggish phone. It's a little heavier at 126 grams (4.4 ounces). Other differences include a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon Cortex-A7 400 processor running at 1.2 GHz, compared to the L9's 1.1 GHz Texas Instruments OMAP chip. You get an Adreno 305 GPU and there's 8 GB of ROM inside compared to 4 GB on the L9, but like the L9, half of it is consumed by the operating system and user interface, along with T-Mobile's bloatware. All told you get to use a little under 4 GB. Not much, but better than the L9. You still get the same 1 GB of RAM, and it retains the expandable storage with a MicroSD card slot up to 32 GB. The back is removable (thank you, LG) along with the slightly-bigger battery. In the L9 you got a 2150 mAh cell. In the L90 it's up to 2460 mAh. There are still 3 sensors on the front (not including the IR for the QuickRemote): accelerometer, proximity, and compass.For connectivity/network, this is a GSM device, so it runs on the same networks as ATT, MetroPCS, T-Mobile, and Cricket, but it's only a tri-band phone, so it runs on the 850, 1900, and 1700 MHz bands, and (sadly) is WCDMA, which means it's radio only gets up to HSPA+ 21 ""4G"" 3G, or EDGE. There's no LTE support (also sad). That said, there is an international version (GSM) that adds the European 900 and 1800 MHz bands. So, if you take this one overseas anywhere outside Brazil, Oceania, or Israel, chances are it might leave you hanging.The display has also grown from 4.5"" to 4.7."" That might not seem like much, but holding the phone it's easy to tell. It's covered in the same Gorilla Glass 2, and same multitouch capability. The extra screen is a welcome addition. The resolution hasn't changed from the L9 at 540x960 at qHD. It's still an IPS display with 16m colors as well. The ppi hasn't changed. Last I remember it was 236 on the L9. Not bad, but not great and you can see the pixels if you look close. It's still really responsive and sensitive, so that's good, and has good contrast and is pretty bright. The other difference is in the construction. LG borrowed the self-healing material from the Flex to use on the L90's battery door. It's an attractive finish, but I like the L9's back better as it's easier to hold, won't collect fingerprints, and has a textured soft touch rubber coating. The rest of the device is pretty blasé. Whereas the L9 had nice wide chrome trim, the L90 only has a thin strip. Although the L90 isn't bad looking, I like the L9 better. It' thinner, easier to hold, and looks better without all the curves. There are only 3 physical buttons, volume rocker, power/lock, and the home button/task manager button. It's flanked by two capacitive keys for back and menu. Same as L9.Other features that are the same includes the camera. It's still a 5 megapixel unit with a single LED flash, and is GPS-enabled, geotagging, autofocus, has a voice-triggered shutter (don't have to press the on-screen button), face-tracking, and preset shooting modes like panorama, etc. The white balance and exposure meter are adjustable, but that's about it. The front camera is the same as well, 1.3 megapixels and records VGA video only. Like the L9, it shoots 1080p video at 30 fps, and you can pause in the middle of recording or take snapshots. It can keep the flash on to act as a video light as well.For software, it runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat, which I like more than Jellybean. It looks better, is smoother, and works better with the Optimus 3 interface. It adds some good features like the QuickRemote feature that lets you use the phone to control your TV, Blu-ray player, cable box, or other devices needing a remote, but most of the apps are the same from T-Mobile, which I never used. You get the Google search, Facebook, Google+, Gmail, Amazon, T-Mobile TV, etc. There's also Quick Memo that you can draw on the screen to take quick notes. I really like the Optimus 3 UI as well. A nice refresh from the L9. There's some similarities, but thanks to KitKat, it's pleasantly different. There's also knock unlock, which you just knock on the screen to unlock it. It's nice, but more of a novelty I think. There's the obligatory live wallpapers, customizable color themes, etc as well.The other miscellaneous features include b/g/n WiFi, A2DP v.4 Bluetooth, micro USB 2.0 (no 3.0 here), full HTML and Flash enabled browsing, Java MiDP, mobile hotspot, WiFi calling (on T-Mobile only), MTP USB sync, 3.5mm headphone jack, predictive text input, LG's rebranded Swype, A-GPS, NFC, FM RDS radio, text-to-speech, voice commands (Google's version of Cortana and Siri).So, how does this all work? First, it's a lot faster than the L9, which doesn't surprise me because of the hotter chipset, but in normal use you can't really tell. It's only when you ask it to pat it's belly and say the ABC's and jump on one foot that you can tell a difference. Where the L9 would choke and sometimes crash, there's very little lag in multitasking and games on the L90. The screen is actually nice! Nice and bright, vibrant  colors, and good resolution. It's a little nicer and brighter than the L9, and I'm not sure why because they are the same display. Still sensitive and very responsive. The camera leaves something to be desired though. The same issues that I had with the L9 are carried over to the L90. Shooting performance is similar, but faster to focus and snap on the L90. Image quality is also similar. Outdoor photos in bright sunlight look surprisingly good. It's only when you go indoors that the quality drops off considerably. There's no HDR (helps when things are backlit and shadowed), and images suffer in low light. Pictures were noisy and grainy, almost out of focus. With the flash on, it tended to either over expose or turn everything blue, but you can help that by changing the white balance. In anything other than a nearly pitch-black room it was only good for about 5 feet.Videos looked good for a midrange camera. They were in focus and smooth at 1080. No complaints there, I was pretty impressed. You can also shoot 720, and 640x480 for MMS. I liked the image galleries, video, and music player apps as well.For call quality and data on T-Mobile, I had no issues. WiFi calling was uneventful, calls were loud and clear and I couldn't really notice any robotic voices or stuttering on the other end when someone called me from the L90. Data speeds on 4G where I live are respectable. Full bars give about 4 mbps down, and about 1.5-2 mbps upload. Not bad. Obviously LTE would improve on those quite a bit. Battery life? It was so-so. If you used it a lot, it would need to be refilled with electricity at the end of the day, not dissimilar from the L9. Despite the bigger cell, the battery life between the two is similar, probably due to the L90's bigger screen and faster processor. Figure on about 10-12 hours talk endurance (maybe more) and 2-3 days standby. FYI, you can improve the battery life quite a bit by turning down the screen brightness to 40 percent, disabling all unused apps running in the background, and disabling WiFi.So...Pros:Larger 4.7"" screen with good colors and brightnessLarger 2460 mAh batteryRetains expandable storageRemovable back and batteryKitKat 4.4.2Respectable camera8 GB ROMQuad-core 1.2 GHz Snapdragon 400 chipsetShoots nice 1080p videoQuickRemote works goodOptimus 3 UI is easy to useSeems to be well-builtDecent battery lifeGreat valueCons:Not as pretty as the L9A little heavy/chunkyNo LTETri-band onlyOnly 4 GB user accessible ROMReally needs 16 GB ROMCamera photo quality is hit or missPoor indoor and low-light photosThe Galaxy Avant is a better phoneSo, that's my take on the L90. I still like my L9, but it will be put to pasture soon. Will I replace it with the L90? Probably not as the Samsung Galaxy Avant beats it in important areas. It has LTE, 16 GB ROM, better battery life, and a more consistent camera. I have always had better luck with Samsung's camera over LG's. If I had to, I'd take the Avant with the smaller screen simply because it has LTE. All points aside, now that you can get a near-new Galaxy S3 for the same price as the L90, it's a no-brainer. Still, the L90 is impressive. You can get one for $100 at T-Mobile, and that represents a fantastic value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388YD4122PJ8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTEUAQQ#wasThisHelpful","R388YD4122PJ8X","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I worked for a whitewater rafting equipment supplier and we used 303 to wipe down and protect our urethane and PVC boats after being cleaned. It works fantastically. There are some other products out there from Armor All, Meguairs, and Mother's, but this one works the best.303 is a spray on/wipe on protectant for plastic, rubber, urethane, fake leather, PVC, and Hypalon. You could put it on bonded leather, but I wouldn't recommend it on expensive leather. Use a good quality leather cleaner/protector for that. I don't know what's in it, but it's similar to other protectants of this type. You can spray it on the surface, or spray it on a rag and use it that way. It works good either way. Use it on your tires, the weatherstripping, plastic bumper covers, headlight lenses, tail lights, vinyl roof (for a convertible), the vinyl upholstery in your car or boat, interior trim, dash, interior light lenses, or sunroof seals. Also use it on your PVC or urethane-coated raft, paddle board, or your poly/composite kayak. It will also do glazed fiberglass.It has an additive that helps protect the surface from ultraviolet rays so it won't degrade or fade under prolonged sun or weather exposure as well. It also acts as a cleaner, but don't expect it to remove the mud stains or dried-on dirt from your bumper covers, rubber, or plastic trim.How does it work? Comparing it to something like Armor All Ultra Shine, I say it works just as good, but with one difference, and that is the longevity of the shine and how well it shines with a single application. I put this on the headlight lenses of my wife's car that were starting to ""craze"" (get cloudy), and it took away about 80% of it right away. After buffing with a buffer, I added more 303, let it sit, and then wiped it off. The lenses are still as good as the day I cleaned them! I get good results on trim too, especially on my back bumper which has a black matte plastic on the top that was oxidizing. It cleaned it up and it's been good ever since. Armor All did a good job, but the shine didn't last as long.I also I compared this to a commercial interior and exterior trim shine/protector I had access to that a lot of body shops and detail shops swear by, and although 303 didn't do as good a job, it sure came close, and the commercial product was a lot more expensive. I am pretty happy with it. I highly recommend it, and especially for items that will be exposed to the elements and direct sunlight for long periods (outdoor upholstery, inflatables rafts RIF's, convertible tops or vinyl roofs, trim, etc.), but it works great for any plastic or rubber. It costs more than Armor All, but for what you get, it's worth it.ProsWorks on all rubber, plastic, or synthetic materialsContains high concentration of UV protectantsShine lasts a long timeProtects from the sun, rain, andHelps prevent oxidizationWorks nearly as good as the professional stuffConsA little expensiveSo that's 303. It's a great product and I give it my high recommendation. We used it on $6000+ urethane finish rafts before long trips and it worked great, better than Armor All or Meguiars. It's worth the extra cost to protect your investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I0MVKQ291R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KN0UOEE#wasThisHelpful","R12I0MVKQ291R4","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, for those who think these are indestructible because it says ""tungsten carbide"" need to be aware that they are fragile and will break if you use them improperly. I bought a set of 20 of these (each size had an additional bit, which was really, really nice) from a local retailer Ha**r F***ght T**ls that repackaged and put their name on them. I had been looking for some of these for quite awhile and finally found them on Amazon, and was going to buy them until I found a set of 20 for a few dollars more and snatched them up.As stated these are micro ""drills."" The actual tungsten carbide part is the drill itself. The rest of the bit is made from high speed steel, and the carbide tip is welded on. They are right hand twist micro fluted bits and range from 1.2 mm down to the smallest .3 mm. They come in a nice opaque plastic holder that opens like a clamshell. The middle holds the bits and lifts up so you can easily take them out.The sizes are perfect for just about any project. I had to look real close to see the finest bit's cutting surface. The actual drilling part measures about 1/4"" for the largest bit (1.2mm) down to about 3/16"" for the smaller 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 bits. This is long enough for about all of the projects you'll be using these for as they aren't heavy-duty. The shank is 1/8"" which is the size of rotary tools (Dremel and the like) and pneumatic high-speed micro die grinders. You could also chuck them in your lathe or milling machine. They had the plastic donuts that help you set the depth on the mill without changing the settings on the machine. I wouldn't even think about using them on a regular drill as they are so fragile. You can use them for more than drilling as well. They make good spiral cutters on thin and soft materials.They are best used on thin and soft materials like copper or brass, fiberglass, plastic composites, carbon fiber and graphite composite, plastics, aluminum. They don't work on steel as I tried drilling a small broken knife tang from a handle. The largest bit only put a nice divot in the metal before snapping. I tried a smaller bit and it was the same effect. I did try them with my Dremel on some thin plastic and some thin posterboard to see how  they work and they worked great! I did manage to break one of the .3 mm bits though when I tried to use it as a spiral cutter on the poster board, but there was another one to take it's place. I think there's a reason why I got doubles of each one. Also be careful when handling them as they are sharp, and the small ones are sharp like needles. I managed to stab my thumb on one when getting another one from the plastic holder.Pros:Wide selection of sizesSeem to be well-madeTungsten carbide cutting tipsHandy plastic holderGood valueCons? Not really a con, but worth mentioning: They are incredibly fragile. Use with care!Overall, I'm really happy with them. I know they will get a lot of use! Time will tell as to how long they'll last or how long they stay functional, but they should last a while. be warned: It's not if you break one, it's when!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBCAQ8QLGQC9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMXHXGG#wasThisHelpful","RBCAQ8QLGQC9D","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Super Glue"" as it's know is actually a mixture of cyanoacrylates and some additives that help with adhesion and drying. Unlike traditional ""CA"" type adhesives, this one doesn't require a catalyst for it to harden and set. This glue is unique in that it cures in the absence of oxygen unlike some other glues that react with the moisture in the air (wood glue, Elmer's school glue, polyurethane glue), or solvent-based adhesives that rely on aerosol effect to set up (rubber cement, contact cement, PVC or urethane adhesives).This stuff works great on just about anything. I've glued metal, rubber, plastic, wood (somewhat), ceramics, glass, and china. The only things I had trouble bonding were fabric, stone, and wood. It doesn't work that good on porous materials as it needs something to stick to. You have to apply the glue to both pieces you're bonding to for the best results on porous stuff.It works especially good on polystyrene plastics as it liquefies and softens the plastic a bit. If you put some on a piece of styrofoam, it will actually dissolve it. To make Super Glue work correctly, you have to squeeze the two items being bonded together tightly for a strong bond. The more surface area you have to adhere, the better. It's better to apply the glue to both pieces before bonding them together.A little bit goes a long way, and because it's runny, if you add too much it goes everywhere. Get it on your skin and it will bond instantly to anything you touch. The best way to ""unstick"" your skin is to use something like lotion or mineral oil, let it soak a little bit, and gently pull it off.Loctite did a good job of designing the dispenser and bottle. Usually the glue will make a real mess of the applicator, and if you don't wipe off the excess glue from the tip before putting the cap back on, it will glue the cap to the applicator. I've had this happen to me a lot, but it took longer for it to happen with the Loctite bottle. The 10 grams will last a long time. I've had mine for almost a year, and I use it frequently. My only gripe is that the applicator still sticks to the cap after a while and gets crusty with hardened glue. CA also has a very acrid smell to it that burns your eyes and nose if you get a good whiff of it.Overall, a great product. Highly recommend it. Every home needs a bottle of Super Glue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28CNSFTOWC01B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YXG78#wasThisHelpful","R28CNSFTOWC01B","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the ""old"" style Gorilla Glue a while back and had it for about 2 years. I used it a lot, and generally was happy with it. However, this is not a miracle adhesive and does have some limitations, which I'll go into later.This is a polyurethane-based glue, the active ingredients are diphenylmethane diisocyanate and some other reactants, and are very similar to those in expanding polyurethane foam, or 2-part polyurethane used to make molds or rigid polyurethane foam for insulation. Like wood glue, it reacts with moisture in the air, and just like poly foam, it expands when curing. It doesn't contain any aromatic hydrocarbons or suspended solvents like toluene, heptane, or acetone, or alcohols, so it's non-flammable and relatively safe as it doesn't produce strong and dangerous fumes. It does have a funk to it though, but not obnoxious.It works pretty good, but that largely depends on a couple factors. One is the surface it's being applied to, and the other is the type of application. Gorilla Glue by nature doesn't have good tensile strength and isn't very strong in shearing-type loads. When it cures, it gets frothy and expands to 3x's it's original volume, so that can cause problems with joints that shift when it dries. The surface prep is important, like any adhesive. It doesn't work good on bright, shiny surfaces like steel or plastic, and works best on porous things like wood, concrete, fabric or unglazed ceramics. If using it on steel or plastic, you need to sand the surface to rough it up to get the best bond.I used this to secure the little nobbles that go on the bottom of the toilet seat, and they came off within a couple weeks. I used it to glue the stock back on my stepson's wood and metal replica rifle, and it broke in a month. So I was pretty disappointed with it. It worked great on wood and some pottery, but didn't work when I glued the handle back on a mug that broke off. The trick is to firmly clamp the bonded items together or the glue will expand and compromise the joint. The frothy glue isn't resistant to shearing loads, unlike something like a hard epoxy (JB Weld, etc.), but works good when used to bond items with good surface area contact. The less surface area bonded, the weaker the bond. If you have a small surface to bond to, it's better to get hard epoxy.It's pretty easy to use, just apply a small amount of glue (a little goes a long ways) and clamp or compress the surfaces being bonded together. It helps to moisten the surfaces being bonded.You need to be cautious and clamps are important as the glue will expand and try to push the pieces apart. When the glue dries, it expands and will leak out everywhere if you use too much of it, so be cautious and not liberal in applying it. There may be some extrusion from the joints, but that's normal. You can scrape it off with a knife blade or sand it off. It is messy, sticky, and won't clean off with soap and water. Acetone, paint thinner, or alcohol are the only cleaners that will work.ProsStrong bonds when used correctlyDoesn't contain toxic chemicalsNon flammableWaterproofConsNeeds meticulous surface prep on nonporous mediumsLow tensile strengthExpands when curingRequires solvents for clean upSo Gorilla Glue is a good product. Perfect for wood and pottery and stone, but requires extra attention on steel and plastic. Overall, I'd prefer a 2-part epoxy over this just because it doesn't expand and makes a stronger bond and resists lateral loads better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5I9AOCM4XB6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001GAYRC#wasThisHelpful","R5I9AOCM4XB6X","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: I returned the first defective digitizer, and they sent out a replacement quickly. The replacement worked just fine! 2nd time's the charm I guess. Now after a month, the screen has one hairline crack and some  micro fracturing under the camera (see the pictures). It hasn't been dropped or abused or anything. I originally gave it 3 stars, but now down to 2. Obviously, this isn't an OEM replacement or equivalent as the glass is much thinner and flimsier.I ordered this to repair a very badly damaged iPad 2. It had been dropped on two separate occasions and the screen was completely demolished. It was so bad that my stepson was cutting his fingers on the glass shards. I got a quote of over $90 at a local electronics shop to replace the screen, and was considering it until I found out that a replacement digitizer was less than $30 and wasn't terribly difficult to install if you know what you're doing and are careful. After weighing the options, I went for the replacement digitizer. I considered a couple others, but settled on this one because it got the best reviews and came with a full set of the required tools for a great price. I got it in the mail in a week, and it arrived well protected in a box cocooned with bubble wrap. The glass was protected with two clear peel off plastic sheets as well. No issues there. It came with the home button and camera holder installed too. I also bought the plastic bezel frame that fits between the digitizer and the iPad chassis. You'll want to get one as you'll most likely ruin the original. It only cost $4.Quality-wise, it seems to be as good as the original. The glass seems relatively thick and smooth with no visible defects, but I don't think it's the same quality as the OEM. The home button has a good clicking action and feel to it, so no complaint there. I did notice it's a little snappier than the original, but it doesn't effect function. The camera holder was a little crooked though, not a huge deal.The toolkit was great! I didn't get the Torx driver, but they sent me the phillips free. The SlyPry tool worked good, and there was a straight plastic pick with a point and a pryer on one side, a blue plastic pry tool, a metal spudger, a T4 Torx driver, and a 000 philips driver. The 2 included suction cups were useless (at least to me). The drivers were okay, but I could tell they weren't quality items as the shafts weren't centered to the handle. Not a huge deal though, what can I expect for $25 plus shipping?For those curious, this is the digitizer, not the actual ""screen."" I won't go into how it works in detail, but it translates the touch from your fingers to the LCD screen underneath to interact with the iOS of the iPad. All touch screen devices have one, and it functions independently of the LCD, which is good because in most cases, you can replace it as it is the thing that's usually broken, and the iPad screens, especially the later iPad 2, 3, 4, Air's that are more fragile than the first gen. iPad, which had the digitizer integrated to the LCD.Installation was pretty straightforward, but a nightmare! The screen was so shattered it took over 2 hours just to get it off. I am pretty good and comfortable with delicate electronics repair, and I will say this was one that really tried my patience to the max. Some helpful pointers for those thinking of DIY digitizer replacement:Get a heat gun. A hair dryer doesn't get hot enough to fully loosen the adhesive, and Apple does a good job of liberally using adhesive! Apply heat with the gun on the low setting, holding the gun about 1"" above the digitizer. Move it back and forth so as not to heat one spot too long. Get it hot enough so you can only touch it for a second. Don't overheat it as you might damage delicate parts underneath. Heat along the lower left hand corner of the iPad to loosen the adhesive and slip you spudger in under the glass. I used the SlyPry tool and it worked really good. Pry it up a little, enough to get the spudger in. Guitar picks would be helpful here. Applying more heat if necessary, work up the left hand side of the glass with your spudger, being careful to keep it as flush to the glass as possible so you don't push down inside the iPad and damage the LCD screen. There aren't any cables on this side to break, aside from the digitizer flex, which you can cut with scissors.Keep working it up the side until you get to the camera. Don't heat the camera up as you can melt it. Heat around it and pry up the screen on the top. STOP and keep away from the upper right side where the power/volume keys are as you'll most likely ruin their ribbon cables if you do as they are stuck to the digitizer glass and super-delicate. Once you get the glass unstuck, stick in a guitar pick to keep it off the frame and go back down to the bottom and heat to the right of the home button. DO NOT go prying under the home button because that's where the WiFi module is and it's extremely fragile, and could be stuck to the digitizer as well. Now that the left side, and part of the top and bottom are free, apply heat to the right of the home button and up the right side to loosen the adhesive.Once it's hot, lift up on the left side of the digitizer, and fold it over to the right hamburger-style, making sure that the ribbon flexes for the power/volume and WiFi aren't sticking to the digitizer (You'll have to cut the digitizer cable on the left side, don't worry as you won't need it). Add more heat it necessary, and be really careful. You should be able to fold the screen and lift it off without breaking any cables. This won't work well if your screen is really shattered though, as it will break apart like it did for me. I had to go back and lift the screen from the broken sides to get it off, but it worked for me. I recommend buying the plastic trim piece because it's possible it will get damaged in the process. Just replace it so the screen will fit flush without any gaps or high spots. It's a $4 part. I did, and it was a bit of a pain to get in. I ended up super gluing it down because it was fractionally too large.Once the screen is off, remove any glass pieces left behind. Make sure to get them all or the screen won't lie flat. Be careful not to jam razor/needle sharp pieces of glass into your fingers like I did 8( I cleaned the edges with a Q-tip soaked in 99% isopropyl alcohol to get up any left behind adhesive. Optional, but I recommend it. You need to use the included philips screwdriver in the kit to take out the screws holding down the LCD so you can remove it and get to the digitizer cable. Take out the screws and lift it from the right side, as the connector is on the bottom left. Flip up the metal retaining handle and GENTLY pry off the LCD cable and lift off the LCD. The digitizer cable is held in with w flip-up plastic clips. Be VERY careful flipping them up (use a fine plastic pick, toothpick, or dental pick-don't break them as they are real fragile). Once they're up, slide out the digitizer cable.Now you can put the new digitizer in. Insert the digitizer cable into the ZIF connector, making sure to fully seat it in the connector. Use a tool to press it in as it needs to be seated all the way or parts of the screen won't work. Lower the plastic clips carefully. If they break, the cable won't seat correctly and the screen won't work. Set the LCD on it's left edge and plug in the LCD cable, flipping down the metal clip. Replace the screws and wipe off the LCD with a lint-free cloth to get off any fingerprints or dust. Take the digitizer and fold it over the LCD and set it in the frame. Now you can power on the iPad and test the digitizer functionality.If everything works, you can remove the adhesive backings, remove the plastic protector on the bottom, and set the digitizer in the frame, pressing firmly on the edges until it sits flat and flush. I don't recommend putting books or heavy things on the digitizer to get the glass to set flat. If it doesn't, then it's possible the frame is warped from being dropped (like mine was...I had to grind 3 of the corners flat with my Dremel tool to get the plastic frame to lay flat because it was so buckled) or the plastic frame is damaged.That's pretty much it! Hopefully you didn't break anything during the process. The usual victims are the WiFi module and power/volume assemblies. They're cheap to buy but a bear to replace (You might consider buying them as a precaution and send them back if you don't need them), so being careful is paramount.If you have problems with the screen not working, or parts of it not working, before you glue down the screen, check the digitizer connector. Make sure the cable is pushed all the way down so the white dots are flush with the connectors. If you still have issues, it could be a faulty digitizer, or some other part on the iPad. If it was working fine before the digitizer replacement and you didn't damage anything, then it's more than likely the digitizer being faulty or damage to the connector. If the replacement digitizer doesn't fix it, then it's a bigger problem.ProsCheapIncluded tools are very helpful (guitar picks would have been nice)Seems to be the same as OEMConsDigitizer was faultyStarted cracking after a monthAdhesive didn't fully hold down the digitizerCamera holder was installed crookedSo if you need to replace the digitizer and would rather DIY, this is a ""cheap"" fix. Buyer beware though. It's tempting to save so much money, but it's a crap-shoot with quality and I recommend investing in another adhesive kit in case the digitizer starts to peel off the iPad body.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QCLXVL26WNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRASG2A#wasThisHelpful","R21QCLXVL26WNW","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to replace a white iPad frame that was destroyed and falling apart after the iPad was dropped on the edges. I replaced the screen and the bezel at the same time, and I recommend doing this as you'll probably damage it when replacing the digitizer. The frame arrived in perfect condition in a sturdy cardboard sleeve. It's made from fragile semi-rigid plastic, and I couldn't tell much difference between the OEM Apple frame and this one, other than the Apple frame had extra keyways so it fit more securely in the iPad chassis. I found out later that this created a pain when installing it, which wasn't easy. The problem occurred when setting it in the frame as it was fractionally too large, so it bowed upwards on the sides and didn't fit flush. I thought it was due to the buckled corners of the iPad from it being dropped, but the frame bowed at least 1/8 inch on one side. I ended up breaking a corner to get it to fit flush. Also, it didn't set down securely, so I added some super glue to hold it in place, which was like wrestling an grizzly bear for a steak. To be fair, the Apple frame was also secured with glue (like rubber cement), but it had extra keyways that set in cutouts on the iPad chassis corners.Once I got it in though, it looked almost exactly like the original, aside from the raised corners where it didn't fit flush. Not a fault of the frame, but from the iPad's damaged corners.Pros:CheapWorks just fineCons:Didn't fit rightMissing some key alignment marksFragileSo if you are replacing the digitizer in your iPad, make sure to get a frame, especially if the original is cracked or broken as the new glass won't fit right. Overall I'm satisfied as it works as intended. Not as good as the original, but close enough!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZD69WTIZ3AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Z1ZWEI#wasThisHelpful","R1BZD69WTIZ3AZ","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This the best laundry stain remover I have ever used. Out of the others I've tried (bleach, Shout! is the most common), this works better, faster. I've had no issues cleaning blood, coffee, fruit stains, grass, dirt, or stains from ""body fluids."" It does better than bleach and doesn't contain chemicals like bleach (sodium hypochorate) that will ruin your clothes if you're not careful with it on colors. I've used it on clothes, carpet, upholstery in my car and couch. For whites, it's fantastic. It will even remove dried, set-in stains that bleach won't touch. It works fast too. I could see the stain being removed before my eyes when the stain is fresh!For those interested, it contains hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 for the chemists) as the active ingredient, which is an oxidizer, and in low concentrations is safe to use on organic and inorganic materials as a cleaner and disinfectant. It doesn't work like a surfactant, which lifts stains, but dissolves them. H2O2 is also a weak acid that helps with disinfecting and stain removal. The laundry cleaner adds some suspended chemicals, a thickener, and maybe some surfactants to boost the cleaning action, but it's mostly H2O2 and water. It is safe for your skin too unlike bleach, and doesn't leave a strong smell if you are sensitive to those products. Yes, there are reports of it bleaching colors, but if you use it properly, it won't. Make sure not to let it sit on the garment too long, and rinse it with plenty of water before throwing it in the washer. I've never had an issue with it, other than when I've been careless with it and bleached a spot of my carpet 8(Pros:Fantastic stain removerSafe to use on hands and clothesOdorlessDoesn't contain caustic chemicals like bleachWorks fastCons:Will bleach clothes or carpet if not used properlySo if you want an environmentally-friendly, but powerful stain remover that won't eat the skin off your fingers or make your nose burn, get some of this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZ0LW6GFYA02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00099XKD6#wasThisHelpful","R1RZ0LW6GFYA02","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Oxiclean for the last 5 years, and have never been disappointed with it. In a word, there isn't much properly applied Oxiclean CAN'T clean or remove. I don't know what it's made of, but probably a mix of suspended hydrogen peroxide as sodium percarbonate or sodium perborate which provides the stain removal action through oxidization and dissolving stain compounds. In a pure form, it's used in rocket fuel as an oxidizer.In addition, H2O2 is also a weak acid, which also helps to remove stains. As another plus, it's a fantastic disinfectant, used extensively in various forms to sterilize medical devices and prevent infections (this is the foaming action that happens when you pour over the counter hydrogen peroxide in a cut).It works best on organic stains (fruit juice, blood, dirt, grass stains, pit stains, urine, poo, vomit, etc.) because the H2O2 is good at removing organic things (it's used in hair bleach products and teeth whitening, and bleaching flour and paper). Oxiclean is also environmentally friendly, unlike some detergent or chemical cleaners. It's also odorless and doesn't contain strong irritating chemicals, good for those who are sensitive to those things. I noticed it doesn't dry my hands out real bad like bleach or other cleaners (Comet, Soft Scrub, Pinesol).I've used it on some of the toughest stains to remove, that bleach wouldn't touch. Here are a few: Set-in orange juice, blackberry, and raspberry juice stains. The yellow underarm ""pit stains,"" stains from chocolate (chocolate milk), blood (after it's dried, on white shirts), cooking oil stains (vegetable, canola, and olive), poo and pee stains from people and pets, grass stain (a bear to remove), water stains in the back of my station wagon, too. Those were particularly hard to remove. Strong carpet cleaner, highly concentrated Simple Green, laundry soap, dishwashing liquid didn't work as good as this! I've also used it to remove hydrocarbon stains from lubricating oil. It didn't work great, but it did work a little. I usually end up using something like brake parts cleaner on those.I like to dissolve it in warm water and put it in a spray bottle. A little goes a long ways. I put 2 tablespoons in a 24 oz. sprayer and it worked great! Make sure to shake it up occasionally and keep the spray orifice clean or it will build up. I also use it in the laundry when washing whites. I put a scoop into a large load while it's washing and I did notice the whites (especially dirty socks) were brighter.A word of caution though. Oxiclean in high concentrations can bleach things. I sprayed it on my carpet to clean a big hot chocolate spill, let it sit overnight until I could get a carpet cleaner, and when I vacuumed it, there was a spot that had lightened quite a bit. I also had this happen in the back of my car, so be careful. If you spray it on in a solution, don't let it sit too long before laundering clothes or before cleaning carpets.Pros:Environmentally friendlyDoesn't contain noxious smells or chemicalsDoesn't bleach clothes when used properlyRemoves just about any organic stain when used properlyA little goes a long wayVersatile disinfectantCons:None, other than be careful when applying in high concentrations as it will bleach fabric or carpetSo overall, this is the unequivocal cleanser and stain remover. It's outdone some of the most popular cleaners and stain removers I've used, and it's environmentally friendly, safe to get on your skin, and doesn't smell bad. Use it on carpet, clothes, couches, mattresses, cushions, drapes, etc. You won't be dissatisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNX8C9Z91O5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GI8UOO#wasThisHelpful","R1KNX8C9Z91O5G","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my wife's 1999 Ford Escort ZX2. After reading some favorable (and unfavorable) reviews, I decided put it in at I think 134,000 miles in an attempt to smooth a rough idle. It only cost $7, so I figured it was worth a try. If it worked, great. If not, then I only lose $7 and it was a good learning experience.For those who don't know, Seafoam itself is an oil-based solvent. You can use it on gas, diesel, 2-stroke, 4-stroke engines. It dissolves and removes carbon buildup and deposits. It contains stuff like naphtha and pale oil, which serve as dual-purpose cleaner and lubricant. It was originally developed as an additive for use in 2-stroke outboard motors (hence the name, Seafoam) to remove carbon buildup on the top of the piston and spark plug, exhaust and intake ports, and inside the crankcase. 2-stroke motors use oil in the gasoline for lubricating the internal engine parts, and over time carbon and gunk builds up and causes power loss and hard starting and accelerated engine wear.You put it in the gas tank, crankcase, or you can pour it down a vacuum line (the brake booster line on most cars) when the engine is running (I think 2000-2500 rpm) so it goes down the intake manifold into the combustion chambers. The directions say 1/3 of the can that way, the other 1/3 in the engine oil, or you dump the whole can in the gas tank. Doing it down the intake makes lots (or a little) white smoke out the exhaust. You're supposed to put it down the vacuum line until the motor stumbles and stalls. Let it sit for 10 minutes or so, start it up (this is where it smokes), and drive it hard for a few miles to burn off the dissolved carbon. If you go the oil route, you run the engine for 250 to 500 miles max, then change the oil. In the oil, it's supposed to remove sludge and deposits. In the gas tank, it stabilizes the fuel and removes varnish buildup, removes carbon from the valves and piston crown, and cleans the injectors (carburetor jets, fuel bowls, and venturi) in the carburetor.When I used it, I did the 1/3 deal and put 1/3 down the vacuum line and 1/3 in the gas tank. I didn't put it in the engine oil since it wasn't due for an oil change for a while. I put it down the vacuum line for the brake/clutch booster and kept the engine at 2500 rpms until it drank all the Seafoam. Some smoke came out, but nothing major. Let it sit 15 min, then drove it hard.After a while, I couldn't notice any discernible change. Even after the tank of gas was gone, no change. So, 7 bucks down, no biggie. Your results may vary. I've heard some got great results from it, and others not so much. Even though the idle didn't change, I am sure it did some good fuel system cleaning.Personally, I would use caution when using this on a car, because there are potential hazards, such as carbon being blown down the exhaust and lodging in the catalytic converter. There are too many other good fuel system cleaners (like Chevron Techron, Berryman B-12, Gumout FST, Lucas Oil Fuel System Treatment and Upper Cylinder Lubricant) that actually work well and are designed for modern engines. I've used Techron and Lucas Upper Cylinder Lubricant and they work great. Smoothed the idle out quite a bit in the car I used the Sea Foam on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5LLETK54KBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JN2EU#wasThisHelpful","RE5LLETK54KBF","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cat6 is a must for a high throughput network (up to 10 gigabit). The price difference isn't much, but it's worth it if you need to manage a lot of data through a lot of cables like a big switch from a DC to many routers or access points, or amplifiers.

"Love this book! I never heard of the author, but his message is right-on, and he mixes it with the word of God, which is the hallmark of his life experience of his journey through unemployment. It's so encouraging to me because I've been on and off of work for over three years and have had a very hard time finding work in my field.His message is inspiring and really speaks to me. He mixes his practical experiences with Biblical foundations that really help put a deep perspective on the many struggles that accompany unemployment. The author is a success story, despite going through many storms: a once highly successful company executive, family man, ready to collect a large bonus, and close on his dream home, only to have his world turned upside-down by a pink slip and endure a year-long unemployment journey.I am a Bible-believing, Spirit-filled Christian man, husband, and father, and know that God is hard at work during my personal journey with job-seeking and has a bigger purpose behind it, but it's so nice to read the account of someone who has ""been there and experienced it."" Even if you aren't a Christian, I think you will find this insightful, inspiring, and instill some hope in the struggles, the testing, and storms that come with career transition and unemployment.Whether you've been out of work for a week, or a year, I think you'll find this an inspirational, enlightening, and encouraging message from someone who has survived and is thriving even in difficult circumstances.

"I got this for my stepson for Christmas. It's as the description describes it. This is a ""training"" device meant to mimic the real thing, just like a ""blue gun"" used for firearms training drills. It mimics the real thing pretty accurately, with similar heft (some butterfly knives are lighter), balance, and functionality. The only thing that's missing is the quality, which isn't good. The description says it's ""black powder"" and I assume it means it's powder coated, but it seems more like thick black paint than powder coat. The faux blade is about 1/8"" thick steel and has holes drilled in it for lightening and identification purposes. The handles are about 5"" long and coated with the same black material. Functionally, it's indistinguishable from the real thing. It opens pretty smoothly and easily and the pivots aren't tight or bind up. The screws are torx type, so they don't come loose, and I assume it's also to keep people from taking it apart.It has a locking latch at the butt, but I had to force the knife closed to get it to latch to the other handle, and it didn't fit flush like it should. I found it funny that on the blade there's a Benchmade-like butterfly with the word ""Balisong"" running through it, which lets you know this is a knock-off of the real Benchmade Balisong butterfly trainer. Funny.So, that's it in a nutshell. A good knock-off that's pretty much as described and you get what you pay for.

"I got this for free with a purchase from a local tool and hardware retailer. It's a digital multimeter with seven functions. Pretty simple. No auto ranging, buzzer for continuity, just the basics.It came with a tiny instruction manual and the two test probes. It includes the 9v battery. I wasn't expecting much, and that's what I got so no surprises. It does everything the box says it does.You can measure all the basic functions (except AC current): AC volts, DC volts, DC current, Ohms, Continuity, diode/transistor, and a battery test mode. It works pretty well for being so cheap. It does only go to 750 volts on AC or DC, and doesn't measure AC current, but everything else is there. The LCD display only has a 3.5 resolution, so you're limited to that. Not a huge deal, but a larger display would be nice.I had no trouble getting the functions to work. The instruction booklet did a reasonable job explaining things, so a novice can pick it up and learn how to use it. It doesn't have auto-ranging so you have to choose it yourself. I always start on the middle setting when probing unless I know the correct setting for the test I am doing. I was able to measure volts, DC current, resistance, and continuity. The battery test function was useless to me (maybe I didn't do it right). The best way to test whether a battery is ""good"" is to hook some leads to the test probe (alligator or test clips), and hook it to a resistor (anything around 100 ohms and 5 watts), then probe the terminals. You get great readings that way.As far as accuracy, I'd say it's good enough. 1.5v batteries read around 1.6v and the 9v batteries read 9.7v. The bother for me is that the resistance readings dance all over the place and never really settled in, even with good connections. The thing it's missing is microamp setting. Milliamps are the bog standard, but it would be nice to be able to measure something smaller.The test probe wires are reasonably long, but the test probes themselves seem pretty flimsy and the wires wiggle inside the hand pieces. I had trouble with the banana plugs coming loose and unplugging themselves from the meter. Having to keep plugging them back in gets annoying. The only other gripe I had was it acted wonky a couple times, where I'd turn it on and it wouldn't give me a measurement. It would eventually sort itself out after a while, so that's annoying too. The battery might need changing soon I guess. Not sure if this has a fuse on the 10A circuit...hope it does.ProsCheapReasonably accurateIncludes a batteryDoes the basic functionsSmall and compactConsCheapNo AC currentNo microamp settingReadings took a while to settle downCheap test probesBanana plugs wiggle out of the meterSo that's the Cen Tech multimeter.

"I got this on special at Ha***r Frei**t Tools for cheaper than on here. I'd been in the market for one for quite a long time, and finally bought one a few weeks ago for an electronics project (fixing my wife's hair flat iron) that required some delicate soldering. This would also be good for something like beading or jewelry repair.Because humans don't have 4 arms and there are some tasks that would benefit from it, this thing is great. It came in a blister package, and my first impression was: Cheap!It's made from chrome plated steel and seems pretty sturdy. The base is weighted and has a soft pad on the bottom to protect whatever you set it on and to keep it from slipping. It's painted in an attractive black crinkle paint. It's pretty simple design. There's a main bar that has two arms at the ends with alligator clips. Attached to the bar is the magnifying glass that's mounted to a similar mechanism as the alligator clips, which is basically 2 plates with wing nuts on either side that squeeze together. In the middle of the plates are holes that mount to ball ends on the bar so the arms and magnifying glass can articulate.The bar itself is rigid except for where it mounts to the base, which can move left and right and rotate. The magnifying glass is mounted in a flimsy steel compression ring. It's interference fit so there's no glue or anything holding it in. Surprisingly, the magnifying lens is actually glass! It resists scratches and dings better than polycarbonate or other plastics.As far as how well it works, well, it works and does what it says it does. It helps you hold things so you can have 2 hands free to work. I use it mainly for soldering wires together, but I'm sure you could use it for other tasks. I am not impressed with the design on the mechanisms that allow the arms and magnifier to articulate though, as the nuts can get loose, and to move the arms you have to loosen them and re tighten them. The base kept it steady, but you'd want to limit how much weight you put on it or it will topple. The magnifier didn't magnify that much, I'd guess maybe 2.5 to 3x at the most. It would be nice to have a secondary lens inside the bigger one for small up-close work.Pros:HandyReasonably pricedSturdyGlass magnifying lensFull lange of motion for the ""hands""Cons:Joints are clunkyBase could be bigger/heavierMagnifying lens isn't secured to the mounting ring very wellSo overall this is a handy tool for people needing another set of hands.

"JB Weld has been around for a long time and I have used it for a lot of different projects/repairs.It's a standard 2-part epoxy, containing the resin and a hardener (catalyst). The two won't work without being mixed together, and require equal part of each tube to harden properly. The thing that sets JB Weld apart is that it is reinforced with tiny steel filaments, a lot like polyurethane resin reinforced with fiberglass or body filler. This adds stability and rigidity so it creates a very strong bond. They say it has a tensile strength of 4,000 psi, which is pretty strong. Not the strongest, but pretty good!It's super easy to use, just mix equal parts from each tube together and mix until it turns a nice grey color. Once it turns grey, you'll have about 30 minutes to make the repair before it sets up and becomes unusable. I've found it works better if you mix slightly more than you feel you'll need because it seems to mix better in larger quantities, and mixing it in a container (like a mix cup or inside of a sports drink bottle cap).It's water proof, resists chemicals and petroleum products like oil, gasoline, diesel, grease, brake, hydraulic, and transmission fluid, and even solvents. I used it to repair a carburetor on my weed trimmer (an internal part that's submerged in gasoline), a knob on my Bowflex, a fitting on my RC car's exhaust (which gets bathed in highly corrosive nitro fuel constantly), and some other things I can't remember, and it's fantastic. Never had a problem unless it was my fault. I was able to grind it like steel, you can drill holes in it, run a tap in it, sand it, and cut it with a cutoff wheel no problem.Unless you need to fix a cracked engine block, the two 1 oz tubes will last for a while. They do make a jumbo-size tube though.Overall it's a great tool every home should have.

"I got this to repair a Dell Inspiron that wouldn't charge or run off the AC adaptor. I suspected the charger board had gone bad so I bought another one.This isn't an OEM Dell part. It's not even a name brand, but a one-hung-lo Chinese clone. It appeared to be relatively well-made, but I could tell it had lots of hand-soldering that wasn't done very well. There was flux all over the joints for the ethernet jack and solder mask. The joints were sound, but sloppy. I compared it to the genuine Dell and I could tell the quality wasn't up to par.But looks aren't everything. It cost under $10 and I am sure it worked, just it didn't work in my situation as it turned out to be another problem (motherboard).3 stars for the part, 5 stars for the customer service.

"I got this years ago (I forget how many, probably over 10) and I will say it's the perfect addition to the Dremel rotary tool! This is a flex shaft that attaches to the motor drive shaft of the rotary tool. There's a special drive adapter that you screw onto the roto tool's motor shaft (after removing the chuck and collet) so it mates with the flexible drive shaft inside the tool. The end of the shaft has a collet that screws onto the front of the rotary tool to secure it. It's super-simple to install (Yes, a caveman can do it). I got it as part of a kit and it is a very welcome addition.I love this thing. It's been as indispensable as the Dremel itself! I've used it for drilling, grinding, carving, cutting, polishing, and sanding and it works great. Never had an issue except for me using it incorrectly and breaking my micro bits. I don't know if it has an RPM limit, but I never used it past 25,000.As far as the shaft itself, it has a hand piece that houses the shaft lock (for locking the shaft inside to install bits). It has a rubberized coating all around and feels great in the hand. I had no trouble controlling the tool even in awkward positions. The tip houses the same quick-change collet system as the rotary tool. Use the wrench to loosen the drive nut, unscrew it, and remove the collet. Simple. There's a collar on the tip of the hand piece that unscrews so you can attach Dremel accessories to it (the router/spiral cut attachment, sharpener). I am not sure if you can mount the planer. I haven't tried it.The shaft is made from high-density elastomeric rubber that is very tough, but flexible enough to be useful. It's about 5/16 or 3/8"" in diameter and about 3 ft long (give or take). Inside the rubber jacket is a flexible metal drive shaft that flexes very easily to reduce friction when bending during use. There are spring coils at either end of the shaft to reduce stress on the hand piece and the mounting nut that screws to the Dremel tool. I had no issues with it binding up at all even when bent at nearly 70 degrees. Dremel says a 5"" radius, and I can substantiate that.I forget if there are needle bearings in the hand piece (I'd say there are), but Dremel applies generous amounts of what looks like silicone grease to the drive shaft, which you can remove easily for servicing or cleaning if needed, like adding more grease. I don't think that's necessary as more grease just adds drag and it spins pretty freely as it is. I would say this is a very low maintenance tool, just like the Dremel itself.I did apply some M7 Pro CLP to the shaft and I can tell it spins more freely and with less noise and vibration.I have no gripes with this at all. It's comfortable to hold, and even after awkward positions I had very little hand fatigue. You can use it with a fist grip (be careful not to push the shaft lock) or fingertips. It's capable of some very precision work. It's very easy to maneuver into tight spots the rotary tool won't fit. Any of the 1/8"" bits will fit this, and you can of course swap the collets to fit micro drills too.It's versatile as well, and fits most of the modern Dremel rotary tools. I love it. If you have a Dremel and use it a lot for precision work, get one of these. Great investment.Pros:Dremel qualityEasy to useComfortableLong shaftLow maintenanceVersatile, works with some Dremel add-on'sCons:Only one, that it won't fit every Dremel.

"These were a Christmas gift to my wife. I am an avid cooker (so's my wife) and know the mark of a good pan/skillet. I have some experience with Calphalon with their flat bottom griddle,. and wasn't pleased as it warped after the third use and didn't heat or cook food evenly.These are the Contemporary line, which I know has a good reputation for quality vs. value, and I can say I am pleased with them. This comes as a 2-piece set and you get a 10 inch and 12 inch skillet/omelet pan (you can use them for both, tradition pans are a little deeper and come with lids) made of hard anodized heavy-gauge aluminum (not sure of the type of aluminum, there are lots), but I can say it's of high quality. We have an 8 and 10 inch tri-ply (aluminum/copper/stainless) that have been the best pans I've ever used, so these have some tough competition!Aside from being heavy-gauge aluminum, It has a heavy bottom as well, which is good for even heat distribution so foods cook evenly (I hate hot spots). I can report that these do heat evenly and I haven't had any problems with hot spots. I'd say these cook as good as my tri-ply cookware even though they don't hold the heat as well. The sides are shaped in a fashion that helps food to slide off, and it does pretty well. It's non-stick inside as well, which works great and has been durable (make sure to use plastic or wood spatulas, spoons or turners) even with some abuse with metal forks and spoons. It's not as smooth inside as some other pans, but does the job and cleans up very well. You don't have to use a lot of butter or oil to keep food from sticking, which is good for your health too.The handles are aluminum as well (forged this time) and fastened to the pans with heavy rivets (they are cylinders of soft aluminum pressed on with a hydraulic press) which is the norm for cookware these days. Aluminum handles stand up to heat very well, but these are only good for 450 degrees, so a bit less than stainless or ply pans. Not a huge deal, but some buyers might want ones rated for higher temps.My ONLY gripe is that the handle on one pan has come loose and is wiggling. I think from heating and cooling cycles, but they aren't warped so I don't really mind much. I will keep an eye on it and report back if it gets worse, but you really can't argue with a ton of happy reviewers!Pros:Heavy gauge hard anodized aluminumHeavy bottoms heat evenlyForged aluminum handlesNon-stick coating has held up wellGreat value for what you getCons:Handle on one pan has come loose and is wiggling a bitOnly rated to 450 degreesSo you get some great pans for a great value.

"This was a Christmas present we got a few years ago. I think we've had it for about 4 years? I don't know, but it sat unused for quite a while. I think the extent of its use was a couple (botched) haircuts and me using it to trim my beard (lots faster than my little Panasonic trimmer), which I've been doing for probably the last year.So it's a kit that includes lots of stuff and you should be able to start cutting hair with it after some practice. The kit includes six cutting guides in various lengths from around 1/2 inches down to 3/16 or 1/8 inches (I forget), two hair clips, some barber's style scissors and guide comb, a tiny bottle of oil for the trimmer blades, blade cover, and a tiny brush for cleaning off the cutter assembly. It comes in a plastic container to hold all the contents.Now, the picture on the listing is different than what I had. The clippers are a shiny chrome and the on-off switch is on the side not the top. The clipper itself looks different as well (maybe Conair redesigned it?).The clippers did their job and worked as I expected to. There's an adjusting lever on the side that adjusts the top blade's depth, push it forward and the top cutters move forward. Pull it back and they retract. I liked that feature quite a bit, and the lever was pretty sturdy and held their position.  I kept it on the smallest setting to trim my beard to the length I like it and it worked fine. They trimmed my thick beard (beard hairs are much tougher than actual hair) like it wasn't there and cut hair with no issues whatsoever. The blades are self-sharpening as well, and it isn't noisy. The motor inside doesn't spin too terribly fast so the cutter head doesn't go very fast. The guides snapped onto the clippers just fine and stayed on pretty securely.The scissors were junk. You could tell they're cheap, made from cheap steel, not very sharp, and marginally cut hair. The comb worked fine, and the clips worked good like they should. No complaints there. The oil bottle is small and won't last a long time, but you don't have to go crazy with the oil. Just a couple drops on the cutters to keep them lubed between uses. The brush is pitiful and only good for cleaning the hair residue out of the cutter head.Now, the reason for two stars...The clippers are complete junk. True, they work good, but they broke after maybe 12 hours of use. I was trimming my beard and then the clippers started making a terrible racket. The top cutter seemed to detach from the rest of the cutter head and was flopping around. I took the clippers apart to investigate to see if it was just something that came loose, but on further inspection, one of the return springs for the cutters had snapped completely in two. That is due to metal fatigue and over time, the spring got stressed and finally broke at the fatigue point. It's basically unfixable unless you buy the whole spring assembly, which might cost more than the entire trimmer kit.The design of the cutter head is also questionable. It's based on the eccentric reciprocating design, where an eccentric plastic hub with a metal shaft that fits into a slot in the cutter head. As the motor spins, the shaft moves the top cutter side to side. A torsion spring acts to return the cutters and provide some stability to the top cutter. This isn't the ideal setup for clippers. Good clippers have an electromagnetic reciprocating system that's much more reliable and provides a more positive cutting motion.Pros:Clippers performed goodCuts thick hair greatAdjustable cutter depthIncludes six cutter guides, hair clips and comb and scissorsInstruction manual and how-to for haircutsCons:Cheap clippersCheap scissorsClippers broke after 12 hours of useSo it's not a professional-grade clipper set, but unless you're a barber or stylist, you probably don't need anything better unless you're brand-specific. They do what you want them to do, cut hair, and they just work. Conair doesn't make bad products, and I don't know if they've been redesigned to address the issue, but breakage after 12 hours of use in a hair clipper is ridiculous. Go buy some Wahl's and you won't be disappointed!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUDURRDTH8KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CNRUQK#wasThisHelpful","R2PUDURRDTH8KA","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2002 Subaru started to experience transmission quirks about 8 months after I bought it back in 2010. It would slightly jitter (tough to notice, but it's there) when cold from 1-2 gear, and abrupt downshifts from 3-2 2h3n you put your foot down. I did a full service (trans fluid, both filters replaced), and it didn't help. It started getting worse, so I bought some of this after reading favorable reviews.You add the whole bottle to the existing fluid, but be careful because if it's already full, you need to drain some. This is a full 24 oz of fluid you're adding, almost 1 quart and a half. I added it and my transmission was overfilled. You add it when the motor is warm and running and should notice a difference right away, but I didn't. No discernible difference in shifting. In fact, it has gotten slightly worse in the last 2 years.I paid $12 for it and it was hit-or-miss, but not a big deal. I think I will drain 48 ozs of trans fluid and replace it with 2 bottles of this for yucks soon. Not terrible optimistic about it.The upside is that it does other stuff like clean the fluid, condition it, and helps stabilize it. That's good, even if I can't tell it's working. So, give it a try. It's better than dropping thousands on a rebuild or new trans. You never know. This won't repair a problem and it's not a permanent solution. If your transmission is damaged, it might help temporarily, but the issue will come back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KECHNVF4469N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ARTZPO#wasThisHelpful","R2KECHNVF4469N","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am skeptical when it comes to ""engine additives.""  I have tried some and they didn't work so never again. I am familiar with Lucas Oil products...I've used their Transmission Fix/Stop Leak with mixed results. I wasn't apt to try more. My dad's a mechanic of 31 years and knows other mechanics of 30+ years, and some love and swear by additives and some think they're a waste of money. I was in a conversation with a long-time mechanic and he mentioned the Lucas Upper Cylinder Lube and Injector Cleaner and how he got a lot better mileage in his 2005 Buick. I had seen this stuff in the parts store and never thought much of it until I heard the words ""I got better mileage"" and ""it's less than $12 for up to 10 tanks of gas.""So I borrowed some and what do you know, I got about 60 miles farther on 1/2 tank of gas. Normally my 2002 Subaru Legacy wagon gets maybe 18-19 city and 25 highway (not too good...gas here is $4.00/gallon) so that's 110-120 miles for 1/2 tank. I was lucky to get 260 miles on a full tank with mixed driving (that's 15 gallons of gas if I run it almost dry). I added a squirt of the Lucas and I got 180 miles for 1/2 tank! I drove it last week on 3/4 tank from here in Vancouver, WA to Olympia, WA and back and then another 40 miles of driving before the light came on for gas...that's 340 miles to a tank. Amazing. I was stunned.The 32 oz. bottle will treat 100 gallons of gas or diesel. You can add more or less if you want to. You can add it every fill-up or every other, doesn't matter. I noticed that if I didn't use it then things went back to the way they were.It's best to use it right before you fill up. They say use 3 ounces per 10 gallons. I take the bottle with me in my trunk and add it right before I pump to mix it up. I didn't notice any change in how the engine performed, no change in power, idling, acceleration, etc, but who knows how it's helped the insides. It's got lubricants in it that stick to the ""upper"" part of your engine, the parts that gas touches like the injectors, intake valves, piston crown, valve seats and guides, fuel pump and adheres to them. I am sure it's good for cleaning (although I don't know how good it does as this isn't a solvent-type cleaner) and lubing the injectors, and I'm sure my fuel pump is happier and the fuel system's happy (ethanol in fuel is corrosive to rubber parts and over time it makes them brittle). It didn't make my pinging go away, but hey, for $12 it's paid for itself in the first 4 tanks of gas!It's made me a believer in Lucas Oil and I will definitely try their other products again. Amazing. Definitely worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKC44HNIRV6SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ARPVOI#wasThisHelpful","RKC44HNIRV6SP","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use two of these at work for a dual-monitor setup, and I am really pleased! I used to use one of these with a Viewsonic 19"" widescreen and could immediately tell a difference between the two. The Viewsonic's colors were duller and were darker than the Dell's, and even on max contrast they still weren't as good. Although the resolutions were the same, the colors and detail were nowhere near as good, which is why I ""traded"" for another one of these from another co-worker's setup!It's a 19"" widescreen format monitor with anti glare coating on the screen, the 19"" being measured diagonally, it's actually 17.5"" wide and 14.4"" tall including the stand, and 5.7"" thick. It operates at a 60 Hz refresh rate, 1000:1 contrast ratio, and a dot pitch around 0.2 mm. You get 16.7 million color support, and it's pretty bright too at 300 cd/m2. It's energy efficient, EPEAT rated silver, and only uses 38 watts when on, and 2 watts in standby. Obviously the LED monitors are much more efficient than the old fluorescent lamp backlights.I really like the monitor. The E198WFP isn't a newer monitor and doesn't have LED backlighting, but it does do HD and has inputs for both DVI and VGA/D-sub. Obviously, the DVI will give much better picture quality, but on VGA it's not bad at all. There's no HDMI. The maximum resolution (native) is 1440x900 HDCP and a 160 degree top/bottom viewing angle, which is pretty good for a lamp-type display.The base is nice a sturdy, and it's adjustable for height. It locks into place securely as well. The monitor is heavy though at 11 lbs (no doubt due to the internal power supply) and not as thin as newer ones, but for what it is, it's great.

"I have two Buzz Bee dart guns; this one and the Hawk bolt action blaster. I really like the Hawk, and despite it's shortcomings it's a really cool gun. From my understanding, the Double Shot was originally a side-by-side ""double"" rifle, but they reconfigured it into an over-under shotgun design. It's made of the same polystyrene plastic as Nerf's (I own a lot of them), and is colored as such. What's very un-Nerf is how it fires. The darts load into hard plastic cartridges that look like shotgun shells. Inside the shell is a post and some kind of spring (like on Nerfs) to limit the amount of air that propels the dart. The cartridges are loaded into the open breach of the gun, which you break open from a tang-mounted release. As you break open the barrel, a cord cocks a spring mechanism and piston, sets the trigger, and the gun is ready to fire. It has a single trigger to fire both barrels either individually, or all at once. After firing, break open the gun and when it's fully open, the shells are ejected just like in an ejector-style shotgun or rifle. Really cool.Range isn't stupendous. Maybe 20 feet. Sometimes I only got 1 foot, the dart just fell out of the barrel, other times, one dart would come out with some authority. This isn't a slow-loading dart gun. If you keep spare loaded shells on you (there's a storage area in the stock covered by a flip-open cover) it can be re-loaded pretty quickly. If you're using this as a primary weapon in a war, then you are in trouble as even though it's not slow to reload, you only get two shots, while someone else might have 18, ready to go. So this would be best as a last-ditch gun. Fire and throw it away. I didn't find it too difficult to operate, but I'm an adult. Kids under age 8 would have some difficulty getting the gun cocked. The shells are critical to firing it, and losing them renders the gun useless (unless you use it as a club). Durability is a major issue. We had this for a little under a year and it's broken. The string that cocks the mechanism snapped (or one of its mounts), so it's useless which is kind of a shame because I like the Double Shot, just like the Hawk. The plastic isn't as thick as on Nerfs either, so I'd hesitate to say this is ""kid-proof"" and even less adult proof. Even though I like the blaster, there's a reason I'm a Nerf aficionado. Also, the dart/cartridge refills aren't cheap. For $10 you get 6 of them. I can get 30 Nerf darts for that price.Pros:Works like a real shotgunCan fire both barrels at once or individuallyStorage area in the stockLightweightShoots far (when it wants to)Con's:Isn't durableDoesn't shoot far (when it does)Breaks easilyOnly fires two shotsCartridge/dart refills are spendy","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGO5KSHRR88K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LORAZS#wasThisHelpful","ROGO5KSHRR88K","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a lot of Nerf guns (a few Recon CS6, the Recon Deploy, Stampede ECS, Swarmfire, ultra-modified Airtech 2000, some modified N-Strilke single shot pistols, and some Nite Finders). I have used lots of Nerf guns as well and modified a lot of Nerf guns.My first experience with Buzz Bee's guns was at a church event because they were using them in a kid's game I was working on (shoot through the circle on a whiteboard, get some candy). There were the break open over-under shotgun and the Hawk. I think I hated it at first because it wasn't working at all, kept jamming, and didn't shoot far, but I fell in love with the coolness. It uses plastic ""cartridges"" that look somewhat like a shotgun shell. They hold the darts (plain suction darts a little wider than Nerf's) in the shell, which you load into the blaster. The Hawk is a bolt action dart blaster, and it works basically like a bolt-action rifle! It has a clip that holds 5 (if I remember right) cartridges that load in like the real thing. Load it open bolt or closed. Insert the clip, cycle the bolt, and fire. To reload, move the bolt handle up 90 degrees, the bolt cocks the spring, ejects the ""spent"" cartridge, and loads another dart. Awesome! You can load them individually too, just like a single-shot rifle. The action actually works really good most of the time. I was pretty impressed. They don't go real far. I had trouble getting them past 20 feet or so, but it shoots accurately. Probably more so than my long-barrel CS6. The stock has a built in storage area that holds extra shells and darts.Compared to a Nerf, the Nerf blasters are better-built, stronger and more durable than the Hawk. Not to say Buzz Bee has quality-control issues, but they could build their stuff better. I could tell you had to be careful with the Hawk. It's not really flimsy, but could benefit from some thicker plastic. It's made from the same polystyrene as Nerfs. The clip is hard to load too as you have to hold the first cartridge down with your finger while you insert the second one or else it will fall out. Annoying. Loading is slow. You have to put the darts into the shells or you can't fire them. For any kind of rapid-fire, you'd need extra clips pre-loaded.Sometimes the darts wouldn't leave the barrel, so you would reload and fire only to have two darts come out, one might go 10 feet, the other will fall out. The other downside is the cost of the thing. It's $30 to buy it. It comes with only 3 shells and 4 darts. To buy more shells and darts, I think it's almost $10 for a pack of 6. You can get 30 Nerf darts for that much, and you can't really use the Buzz Bee darts in a Nerf gun. I had mixed results, either they're too big or too short. They work fantastically in my Nite Finders and my Airtech though. They also worked well in my N-Strike pistols.So, that's the Hawk. It's super-cool on one hand, not-so-cool on the other. Questionable quality, unreliable operation, mediocre firing range, hit-and-miss functionality. The cool factor outweighs the other things though. I was going to rate it lower, but because this dart gun is in a class by itself, I gave it accolades.Pros:Super-cool and realistic functionalityLightweightDecent firing rangeAccurateCons:Unreliable firing mechanismSeems to be flimsyClips hard to reloadSlow to reloadExtra ammo and cartridges can get spend and the more the better","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EN6F17B6B3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NRJRWI#wasThisHelpful","R32EN6F17B6B3N","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This came in an ASUS Essentio desktop from BestBuy that I set up and configured for a customer. It's my first experience with an i7 Ivy Bridge quad, so I was excited to see how it worked. I am familiar with the Sandy and Ivy-Bridge i5's, and they are already overkill for 90% of what you'd use a PC for (even gaming), so I was expecting more of the same. I was happily rewarded with the exact same (I couldn't tell a huge difference) performance as the i5 3470 (another screaming CPU). I have built 4 machines with that CPU and have 4 very happy customers.The i7-3770 is the locked-multiplier version of the i7-3370. Intel also makes an unlocked ""K"" code of this processor that can be over clocked for better performance, and it's really easy to OC the i7 K same as the i5 K. It's built on the 3rd-gen Ivy Bridge 22nm process, which is an excellent package. It doesn't consume a lot of power and is rated at just 77 W TDP (same as the i5-3470). For a comparison, a comparable AMD is rated at 125 W TDP and gets completely smoked by the i7. (I love AMD, but they are still way behind Intel in their architecture and efficiency/speed). It's a quad-core with hyper threading, which effectually doubles the base core count, so Windows (or Mac) sees 8 processing cores in Device Manager. The base clock is 3.4 GHz with Turbo-Boost to 3.9 GHz. There's 8 MB L3 smart cache, 5 GT/s DMI, and 25 GB/s memory bandwidth. It has a dual-channel memory controller and will handle 1333/1600 memory up to 32 GB.Like the i5, this has a built-in GPU. Here it's Intel's HD4000 graphics, which isn't too shabby! The base clock is 650 MHz that can dynamically bump to 1.1 GHz, so yes, it will play games in stock form, just don't expect high frame rates and high settings. For low to medium on demanding games, it will be playable. The i5 has the HD2500 graphics, which aren't as good. This also has Intel's VT-x virtualization.As far as performance, on a machine with 2 DVI monitors, 8 GB 1333 MHz RAM, and discrete graphics card, it's smoking fast. The fastest machine I've ever used. Faster than the i5 with 1600 MHz RAM and premium motherboard. There was almost zero lag when opening applications (like word, and first launch of Outlook). Enterprise software that is hard on CPU's like Microsoft Exchange, some dental practice or medical practice software won't bog this down either. Quickbooks Enterprise, which is a pig and is hard on even dual-core processors, is tamed by the i7. iTunes encoding is ridiculously fast, and any game you throw at this BF3 online, Crysis 3, Metro, Skyrym (with a good GPU) will give you the highest frame rates possible. The hyper threading is kind of useless unless you're doing things with programs that are multi-threaded, which I don't use much, but from what I hear, that makes the 3370 one of the fastest quad cores out there. It also ran very cool. The fan never revved so high it was obnoxiously loud. The included PWM controlled Intel cooler is really good.My only gripe is that it cost $330 in a tray. Even inside a PC, it bumped the cost of the otherwise affordable ASUS desktop to over $800. It begs the question...do you really need this much firepower? For most users, the answer is probably no.Take the smoking-fast i5-3570k and add hyper threading and 2 MB of cache for an extra $115? Really? The performance gains are negligible with just about everything, including games. However for non-gaming applications requiring a stout CPU (video/audio/CAD, etc.), you will probably need the extra performance. If you need anything more, spend an extra $300 on an i7-3930K Sandy Bridge-E 6-core with hyper threading and quad-channel memory support for 64 GB. That will handle any job out there.Pros:Super-fastIntel 3rd-gen Ivy Bridge architectureDecent Intel HD4000 on-chip graphicsLow 77 W TDP8 MB L3 cacheSupport for 1600 MHz 32 GB DDR3 RAMHyper threadingIntel VT-xTurbo-Boost v 2.0Runs coolCons:Cost. It's too expensive.So, it's a stupid-fast CPU. It will handle any job out there (short of ultra high-end applications requiring special hardware,  quad-channel RAM, etc.), give you the richest gaming experience possible, and do it efficiently...just like an i5-3470 or 3570K. In terms of value for dollar, I can't recommend it. Save $115, get the i5, and use the extra cash on a graphics card or other upgrade. Use it on some pickles. Either way, it's an awesome CPU. If you can swing it, get it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTNRZL5GLHWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SZ0EHE#wasThisHelpful","RVTNRZL5GLHWZ","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I run this alongside the older, discontinued LJ 1012. The LJ 1020 is an update to the 1012, and has a lot (thankfully) of the same features as the older model. It's still very compact (small enough to fit on any desk) at less than 15""x10""x10"" has HP's ""instant on"" fuser (which stays on even when idle for faster startup), and the really versatile software of the 1012. It's still compatible with Win. 98 SE and up. The difference between the 1012 and 1020 is in the hardware. The processor is now up to 234 MHz from 133 MHz, but it has less RAM (2 MB instead of 8 MB). There isn't a discernible difference in print speeds between the two either, still around 15 ppm for text and text/graphics. Not stellar, but similar to competitors. The best part of that is the first page is out in under 10 seconds. From the click of ""print"" to the first page (I measured it) was 7 seconds. The main tray holds 150 pages, the output tray holds around 120, and there's a 10-page fold-out tray for one-off jobs or envelopes, or other special needs. It's also easy to use. No complicated setup needed. There are just 3 buttons on the front for clearing errors, resuming or canceling print jobs.The resolution hasn't changed either: the default 600 dpi and a bump mode to 1200 dpi using the software. We mostly print packing slips, labels, and other documents with it, and it does a great job. The text came out very crisp and sharp. Graphics looked okay, but nowhere near an inkjet and a little lower than some comparable models from other makers but you'll pay more, around $20-40). The 1020 doesn't have a network card like the 1012 so it's USB only, but there's still no USB cable included which is weird. This cost almost $190 and still no $5 cable included? Get real HP. If you want to use it on a network, just share it (the host PC will need to stay on and out from underneath any kind of firewall or anti virus program that blocks network sharing). No need to complain about no NIC, as this wasn't designed to be an office-wide machine, but a personal laser jet for a single user or two. HP says 2,000 pages on a single toner (You can get toner for this for ridiculously cheap, like under $40) and a duty cycle (per month) of 5,000 jobs. Certainly not major-caliber output, but again, this isn't that type of machine. If you want/need that, go buy one designed for high-output, high usage. It's also quiet as there's no cooling fan, but the lack of a fan does hurt print speeds when printing a lot. If you print jobs of 30 pages in fast succession, the print speed will slow and it might need a cool-down period between jobs. Again, shouldn't be an issue since this machine isn't a high-volume design.Pros:Retains the 1012's useful featuresBump in processing speed to 234 MHzSmall, compact and lightGood print speedsExcellent quality textFirst page out in under 10 secondsToner can be had for cheapUseful software suiteSimple to useCons:Print quality for graphics needs workNo USB cable included (again!)Still no network capabilityPrint speed slows down under heavy use to prevent overheatingSo it's a really nice, low-cost, no-frills laser printer for your desk or small workgroup if needed. Don't expect fast printing, high duty cycles, or high-resolution graphics as you won't get it. What you do get is a reliable printer that's easy to use and economical that prints good and won't cost a ton to keep running. I highly recommend it. We really like it at work too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LDTZ67JZBLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009EM13G#wasThisHelpful","R11LDTZ67JZBLE","A303SNZ4AR7TDQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303SNZ4AR7TDQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HP practically wrote the book on small home office and large business printing and document management and it shows with the Laserjet 1012. I have had some less-than-stellar experiences with other HP printers (inkjet and laser), but have generally been satisfied with them. I have 5 of these sitting around my office and have used the LJ 1012 a lot and have grown quite fond of it.First, it's small, under 15 inches wide, 9 inches thick, and 8 inches tall so it fits on a desk perfectly. It also weighs about 13 lbs, so it's lightweight. This is a laser printer, so it takes toner. The toners last a long time and are pretty inexpensive, less than $30, which is about the same price as a single inkjet cartridge that won't last as long. It's made mostly of high-strength polystyrene and ABS plastic so it's tough and will last a long time. There are 1012's in use today after almost 10 years of constant use and tens of thousands of pages. The printer is connected with a USB only, so there's no network card for connecting to a network. That's not too much of a hassle though if you must print over a network since you can set up printer sharing and use it from another PC on the network. It's super-simple to use. There's no complicated settings to fiddle with, just two buttons to print a status/configuration page, cancel a job, and 3 LED indicator lights for print and printer status (attention, go, and ready). There's a simple on-off switch on the back that's out of the way and maybe a little inconvenient to use.On the hardware side, the LJ1012 has a 133 MHz processor and 8 MB of RAM for caching documents and quick spooling. Although it's not major-caliber hardware, it's good enough for a small office, or for a workstation needing a printer that can't access to a networked printer. HP says that a toner will be good for 2000 pages and 5000 jobs per month. I can concur that, but you may be able to stretch it even further with higher capacity toners. Changing the toner is very easy.The software aspect of the printer helps it out with some very useful features. Setup wasn't too hard, but isn't seamless. Also, You get a power cable, but HP doesn't include a USB cable. Seriously? The cable costs $5 and you can't include one in a $100+ printer?A word on drivers...there is no driver for this printer available from HP for Windows 7. Kind of annoying, but you have to tell Windows to install it from it's list of compatible drivers when you're ready to install it. The software set can be used with a PC or a Mac (some features aren't available on a Mac at the time of the 1012's introduction, but I don't use this with my Mac so I can't comment) includes utilities and customizable features such as pre-formatted watermark (confidential, draft, and others), duplexing (manual) that's helped by images on the print utility showing how load the paper (it prints on brochures and documents). There's a fold-out priority tray for printing single documents or on envelopes or labels. The main tray holds 150 sheets of letter paper. The priority tray handles 10 pages at a time.Performance is good. We use a few of these for printing documents, packing slips/invoices, and shipping labels. I saw 14'ish pages per minute with the first page out in under 10 seconds. Not bad! My Dell 3115 takes about 1 minute to warm up and calibrate before the first page is out from idle. The fuser is ""always on"" so there's no warmup period like on other laser printers. However, if you're doing volume printing, the speed will slow down quite a bit to prevent it from overheating since there's no fan to keep things cool. That's actually an advantage as the 1012 sips electricity and is really quiet. The printing noise isn't obtrusive, but it's not real quiet either. Print quality is on par with others in the class I've noticed. 600 dpi that can be bumped to 1200 using the configuration utility. I noticed a difference, but it wasn't huge. Tiny font is legible but not super-chrisp unlike regular fonts which look really nice. Graphics also come out really nice, although this isn't a high-res printer and doesn't print high-res graphics.Pros:Compact and lightweightAffordableFast first page outDecent print quality for graphics. Excellent for text.QuietLow power consumptionEasy to useIncluded software makes the printer very versatile with useful featuresCons:Low duty cycle of 5000 jobs/monthNo Windows 7 driverToner could last longerPaper tray only holds 150 pagesSome Windows software utilities aren't available on Mac'sNo USB cable in the boxNo cooling fan so print output drops during large jobsOverall a very nice office or even home machine. Compact with good performance, the 1012 might be discontinued, but is still an excellent laser for the money.

"For me Ms Joyce never lets me down.  While this one was a little different take on the usual grizzly shifter fare, it quite possibly one of the best I have read.  I loved the idea that Ian and his two brothers were so much like a regular bear in many ways.  For instance, their bodies required them to hibernate for 6 months out of the year.  No, if want to stuff, their bodies at sixteen went into their first hibernation and every year thereafter, it just demanded they stop and go to sleep.  Needless to say that little detail could put a damper on finding and keep your true mate.In Ian's case it is one very human Elyse Abram who has put an ad in the local paper for a none romantic partner/marriage in exchange for partnership in her homestead and being her husband.  All she needs is a strong back and good hygiene and some one who is self sufficient during the long cold winters.  What she gets is Ian who has shown up on her doorsteps to give her a letter from her crazy ex-boyfriend/wolf shifter whom Ian was ordered to put down due to his insanity and killing of human.It a very interesting and hot, sexy, and in some ways tragic ride to a wonderful and satisfying ending.

Since I have read the next two I can say the also suffer to a degree with a lack of conflict.  I never like an over abundance of conflict but it needs to more than these stories had.  I will therefore have to rate them as 4 stars as well.

"My god I didn't think it was possible to get any better, but Ms. Joyce has just out done herself with this story  It absolutely blew me away and took my socks with it.  Hot, dynamic and blow your mind sexy, way to go Damon.  He has turned out to be the best character of this entire group.  The Gray Back as a group have just made me fall in love with each of them, but I think Dragon Man, Damon is head and shoulders the best character ever.He might be a scary devil but his mate Clara is his equal and more.  I loved how the author has taken a once cold, draped in mystery dragon shifter and turned him into a warm, wonderful, personable dragon man.  With it she just turned the genre upside-down and backwards.

"Just finished this one and I loved it  I thought the author did a wonderful job of portraying the sheriff and his clan in a very credible light.  I love the idea of Tara being a wanted fugitive by the FBI.I also thought that the dynamic between Axl and his brother, the alpha, Alec was extremely well done.  I like that while Alec seemed stuck in the old ways he was still able to see that Axl and Tara were meant to be together and that he instigated the means by which her father was reunited with her against the bad guy.It was a sexy, sweet and very nicely done story and I know you will love this one as much as I did.  I really want to see ALec story next.

When traditions says that no Stanhope had a chance of ever achieving a happy marriage and stabile life, the brothers have all decided they will never marry and they will break the curse.  Unfortunately, their vows are short lived when faced with 4 equally tenacious ladies of the ton who are their matches and better.Each is a full length story and each is a fun, wonderful and very intriguing read.

"A new twist to the species plot.  I think the author did an excellent job of introducing a new elements into the stories and that she gave us two stories in one was an added bonus.The first story is one that picks up the story line of a Species male, Mourn, who lost his mate and was grieving and the human woman, Dana, who had lost her human mate.  Together they help each other to heal and in to process find that love can strike more than once.  That the second time around can be even better than the first and future is for the living.The second story is very different in that the female in this case was raised as a Species but in reality she is the daughter of the Doctor who worked at  the facility.  He killed his mate and his 4 year old daughter was a witness to the murder.  So what does any insane doctor do?  He grabs her up and brings her to Mercile's facility and puts her in a cage with a species wolf pup.  Where she is raised with #927.When the her mate 927 is killed she is sent to a sanitorium for the insane and held even after all the Mercile facilities have been raided.  927, Hero, is in that group of species who was freed, but he is told he killed Candi in a rage and she was told that 927 was killed because of her.  When they are accidently reunited all manner of complications are borne of the reunion.It's a truly special story and I know you will just love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XK92ONPV2MHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FUXNW2#wasThisHelpful","R1XK92ONPV2MHO","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good addition to the Luna Lodge series, but I thought it raised more questions about the Remus character and his powers than it answered.  I enjoyed reading about his human Angel and secretary to the Lodge, Jenna. She was a really strong and very decisive character.  The kind of mate you would want at your back when the chips were downI am still not sure that I even like Remus a person but I loved him for the character he is in this story.  He is hybrid and something much more it seems .  I thought it left so much still unanswered but there was no doubt that he and Jenna will be together through thick and thin in this series and that together they are unstoppable.I think you will really like this story.

I like the Wyatt character and I am glad that Ms. Bolryder gave him is own story and a chance at love.I thought the introduction to the Wyatt's mate was really intriguing.  His first impressions of the person who came to interview for a job were hilarious and thought Valerie's reactions to him and her backbone did her real credit.  I also loved that while he wasn't really sure if it was a man or a woman that something strong compelled his protectiveness to follow and see where it lead.Wyatt is a big soft  and the perfect gentleman and foil to soothe an abused and scared vulnerable young woman.  One who quickly became necessary to him and one who quickly bypassed his guard and stole his heart even as she lost her own.  I know you will love this one.

"I didn't love this one, but I didn't hate it either.  I thought it was more of 3.5 stars rather than a 3 or 4 star story.  It might have been that there was such a long time between the previous story and this one, that I was a bit fuzzy on some of the details that lead up to this story.I did like the Val character and her true mate Apollo.  I thought their relationship was a little on the touchy side and the quick wedding in the jungle with the natives was a little far fetched, but none the less hot.  It was a good addition to the entire series package, but it needs to be read quickly after the others with no lag in between as it does effect the way this story comes off.I think you'll like it.

"I'd really like to give this one a 4.75 stars.  I loved the story line and I loved the fact that earth has too many men and they women are either buying into singles program to travel off world to mate with aliens or putting up with men who knock them up and move on or staying single forever.Faith is a great character and I loved that she raised the $20,000 to be a part of the relocation and mate search to another world.  I thought that she was a bit nave to take the money for chosing Torkel as her chosen one.  I did think it was odd that the same alien who studied her so closely before she was on the transport was the same one that offered her the money to choose his friend in the challenge.It's a wonderful story.  It has all the elements of such.  Great, strong characters, lots of loving, lots of misunderstanding and lots of forgiving and moving on.  I think you find this one is not only a great love story, but a great beginning to a wonderful new series. I have to say I was surprised at the numbers who did not like this series, but I think it's a good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B74YLQ2UQ4ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RMDAUY4#wasThisHelpful","R3B74YLQ2UQ4ZT","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of alien/human relationships and normally I am really into them.  This one, while good, was not the kind I usually really enjoy.  I go more for the highly developed alien plants were their technology makes our look like prehistoric earth by comparison.  This one was not that kind.I loved that Alien that abducted Novalyn was from such a planet.  His intention was to claim her for himself, but his plans were thwarted by his superior when it was found out what he had done.  Novalyn winds out being dropped along with 12 other women on a rather preshistoric earth type planet that needs women to repopulate the masses.  Unlike the others she was not given a choice and causes all kinds of problems, both for her and the Federation who put her on the planet as well.It's a very intricate story and plot and while I didn't love it I did enjoy it and the for the most part the story line.  I think it is one you should give a chance.  It does kind of grow on you.  I think you will find in the end you are rooting for Ordrik to have Novalyn except him as her mate and stay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E24IQ3XT85XI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D0TUS4#wasThisHelpful","R3E24IQ3XT85XI","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought all three of these at one time and since I could not see the book number in the table of contents I read this one before book two.  While it in not way took from the story it did dump me into the middle of the story that was partially started in book 2, I believe, as I am just now starting this one.I loved Marcy story and I thought Teo was a wonderful if a bit inept hero.  He is a bit on the stilted side and very much an old fashion kind of dragon.  It was hard to tell if he was enarmored with Marcy of if he was totally turned off by her.  About 50 per cent of the time I was sure he hated her and the rest of the time I thought he was just looking to get laid.When he finally gets to it, however, there is no doubt that he is 100% in love/lust with her and she with him.  They are one hot couple.  The descriptions of their surroundings and the places he takes her to are excellently done.  Ms. Savage paints some loved pictures of them and Marcy paints some love pictures of her own.  Of course she has one rather hot dragon guy to paint in the nude to make it really spicy.I to believe you will love this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AGAVWR8IC6BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131PQPCW#wasThisHelpful","R1AGAVWR8IC6BU","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a bad read for the price of free.  The author has done a nice job of writing a rather interesting and fairly believable story.  She grabbed me from the beginning with this story and for the most part kept me immersed and interested in the story line and the characters. I would have like more depth and better interaction between the Chloe and Saul.  I thought the author went to quickly to his Dragon shift and the fact that he left so quickly and Chloe went back to life even after they had mated, was not to my liking.  I especially did not like that she attempted to have sex with her old boyfriend even though mated to Saul. I though she should have made a better attempt at the transition of Chloe  and Saul.  While I understand his nature was dragon, I would  have like him to have explained the mate process to Chloe before that actually took place.I understand that there has to be some conflict and that is how it was achieved, I just thought it could have been a smoother transition.  I also wish that the author had clearly marked these by book number 1,2,3 etc as I wound up reading the 3rd book before the second and it left me a little flat.All that aside I do believe you will enjoy all three if you are into this shifter/dragon genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQ1EMBBR2WOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3FC1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3MQ1EMBBR2WOK","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rather good but somewhat bland Victorian/goth type of story.  I like it but I just didn't love it.  While it was totally in character with the genre it was not a surprise in any way for me.  I had this pegged from almost the beginning.  The author has created some rather good characters but while most gothic type stories are dark and keep the reader in complete suspense, it was evident for the beginning exactly what was going on in Netherby Halls.The author did try to keep it as some mysterious deep dark secret. But she was much too up front about the kind of person the head mistress was; and the fact that she was evidently not held in much regard by both her relatives and the person who placed her as the mistress, made it pretty obvious that she was not a very savory person to be running such an institution for young impressionable orphans. I think you it almost reeks of the smell of a brothel in training.All that said, I still believe you will enjoy the story even though I don't think you will really be in much suspense.  I did find it interesting that both main characters were of magic persuasion.  I think you will like this one but maybe not love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCKVIRS4X5E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXOSSV6#wasThisHelpful","ROCKVIRS4X5E9","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ms. Bolryder strikes again.  I am such a fan of these brothers and I especially loved the Maverick character.  He is such a Bear.  I don't mean that in the grouchy kind of way but in the true since of a kind of rough not quite civilized man/bear.  His life has been hard but somewhere down deep in his soul is this sweet, lost little bear/boy.I love how he has from the first been the catalyst that drives the stories, all of them.  He recognized immediately that the three women who showed up to answer his ad for a wife were the answer to all their problems.  That he knew immediately that He and his bear were destined to be the life mates of one Ms. Harmony and that he never stopped trying in his rather caveman way to convince her to be his one and only.  That he was willing to do whatever it took to keep her.  Even learn how to embrace his human side and to acknowledge his love for his mate.I know you just love this story and you can't help but love this big old, Wild, clumsy, caveman bear, Maverick  This one is something special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQ8MVGDFJO85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WOU89Q#wasThisHelpful","RAQ8MVGDFJO85","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first I have read by this author but I thought it was a nicely done story.  The characters were well thought out and they were absolutely believable.  I thought the fact that Emily was rushing to find a new life because of her mother's remarriage to a man, who wanted to have time with new bride without her daughter hanging around, was bit more than I would have thought would fly.  Especially since her mother had waited many, many years to take such a step.  Then to have the new man insist that Emily move out before the wedding, was perhaps a little contrived.That is no way takes away from the story of a rather brave, young women traveling many miles to a strange place to take up a life as a mother to two young girls and become the wife of a total stranger.  It is a great story and think if you are a romance reader you will find this one to be sweet, pleasant and a nice change.I say give it a read and enjoy the ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37L6IMGNZ60XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9FYVXS#wasThisHelpful","R37L6IMGNZ60XO","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again I am quite simply astounded at this Author and the wonderful stories she tells. Jacinda from the House of Healing, a widow of an Assemlyman of the House of Protection, who is held in low regard by many of the purists of this house, find herself in a very sticky situation.When you are suddenly singled out by the King of The House of Protection for special favors and thrust into the lime light, how do you survive to fight another day, with every person against you.  That is the question Ms. Eidem has thrust into the fore front with this story.  It is handled masterfully.  I know you will fall in love with not only Jacinda and her courage and her self worth, but with Jotham the King and both of their combined families.  This is a story of  second chances, of love blooming against all odds, and of families who must come to terms with the fact that because you had one life mate does not mean that your life ends when your spouses does  It is a powerful and gripping story set in intergalactic space but could easily be any family right here, right now facing all the challenges set forth in this wonderful read.It's quite simply one of the best stories ever.  I sincerely hope there will other stories added to this Imperial Series.  In particular I want to hear Stephanie's, Barek, and Jacinda's oldest sons story.  I know they will be wonderful and I can't wait to see them in print.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTIKQ60PJ7RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010VZNFNM#wasThisHelpful","R1CTIKQ60PJ7RA","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was young we had a commercial that was for a bubble bath called Calgon.  The commercial went like this (CALGON TAKE ME AWAY),  That feeling of total contentment and relaxation is exactly the kind of euphoria that Ms. Eidem helps me achieve every time I begin, immerse and end one of her exquisite intergalactic stories.  This one just blew me away.How do you survive the destruction of you home world, build and new life, and then suddenly remember there is something very important that you have forgotten about your family and that plant.That for nine long years has remained just barely out of your consciousness.  Something that could literately mean life and death for those who were on that planet.  That is exactly what Victoria must figure out.  While this is the story of her life mate, Lucas, and finding their way together and forging a life, It is also the story of a great love and devotion to family.  Can she convince Lucas and her step-uncle to trust her.  Can she reach what is left of earth in time to save her family left behind, on a world of total and utter destruction.  Will she even be able to reach the surface to see if they might still be alive when there was only food for 4 people for 4 years.It's a wonderful, suspenseful and gripping story of the human spirit at it's best.  When you just KNOW that you are right.  When you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that against all odds they are there waiting with time quickly running out.  I know you love this one.  It's some of the best writing and one of the best storylines I have read recently.  Ms. Eidem is a master story teller and you simply have to read this one.

"How would YOU deal with everything DISAPPEARED AROUND YOU?  Including every member of your family being wiped from the face of the Earth.  All except one, your niece who is nine years old and a trauma victim of an Alien race?  Those are the questions you will face when you step into the pages of this breathtakingly spectacular world that Ms. Eidem has so expertly created for your enjoyment.I find this author's work to be some of the most interesting and inventive proses and dialog I have ever read.  Her characters, while they are mostly of Alien origin, to be real and so fascinating that it is hard to put the stories down.  These are full length multi pages love stories.  I say love stories because,  while they might by some be considered Science Fiction, by me, they are as close to the human experience as any human story would be.  Cassandra is a direct descendent of this Alien Race who discovered and populated Earth.  He rescuer's are Corinian's from the original Planet 5000 light years away.Every detail and nuance of this story is so exquisitely done that at times you will forget this tale is not set on Earth, but rather, in deep, deep space where anything and everything is possible and different.  You will taken thousands of light years in the future and shown a world through the imagination and inventiveness of Ms. Eidem.  I is an experience that will take your breath away, leave your heart beating faster, and your mind open to any and all possibilities.  This is the first of this series.  I am already about 78% in the second book, Victoria's Challenge and I can tell that it is as good if not better than the first.You have to buy and read these stories, if you have any interest in other worlds or Aliens at all, and if you don't this will bring you to the conclusion that you might want to explore the possibility.  I loved every single word, every conflict and every action that brought Cassandra and William together and the story that forges their lives as a couple who stands together and family is all that matters.  Not titles, not prestige, not money, not any of the superficial things that sometimes matter on earth.  Love, Honor and first and foremost Family about all else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QB3MGAAX1SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKXWOM2#wasThisHelpful","R6QB3MGAAX1SW","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really, for the most part, like this grouping of stories.  They were good.  A few were on the slow side, and a couple of them I had read in their original single story offerings.I have to say, the one thing, I did not like was that most of them were not really stand alone stories, in that, you felt almost compelled to buy and read the next story.  In fact, several of them, were out right cliffhangers and they are not my favorite.  Therefore, only the 4 star rating.I will say that for the money it is not a bad buy.  You just need to be made aware that they are not complete stand alones and there are some cliffhangers in the mix.  My advise is for the money buy it and give them a try you might really want to go further and buy the next additions to those cliffhangers of the next in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDDSA06WPBMNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q8TZQM#wasThisHelpful","RDDSA06WPBMNJ","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was a total surprise for me.  I know it was hinted in book 1 that she had a secret but I had no clue until Ms. Bolryder revealed it.I thought all the characters in this book and previous one were excellent.  They are strong, sexy and they are willing to go to the wall for those they love.  But above that they are family who love and respect each other.  Isn't that what we all want in the end to be loved and to have the respect of those who love us?I think you will find this one a great addition to Ms. Bolryder's collection of special shifter series.  I love them all and this one is no exception to her genius and her ability to weave a short story with incredible depth and detail.

When tragedy strikes this wonderful super class athlete on the snowboards, it is not his family who is able to snap he back to reality, but another damaged individual, who has also faced the challenges of personal tragedy, Kylie.Together they prop each up and form the bond that finally breaks through Ryan's reserves.

"I love this story.  I thought the author did a marvelous job of portraying the Godan Warriors as the saviors of earth against the onslaught of the Hahnsyhn, who have come to plunder and destroy the earth and those who dwell here.  I thought that Roark the First Commander and the one in charge of the forces here on earth, was believable, strong and very much a hard man to please.  His character was strongly handsome, and yet, when It came to Mira the human earthling, he was soft and loving.I think the author did an admiral job with different factions that were involved in the conflict and the action both furious  and believable.  The added element of the unregistered children being taken away an never seen again was brilliant.  It was one that allowed Mira to shine in her caring for not only these lost children but those that she and her sister Wynne had gathered up off the streets and protected, feed and adopted into their hearts.There is a huge surprise at the end involving First Commander Roark and I think you will find it very interesting.

"I LOVED this one too, but it was a little slower than the first two as far as reading it goes.  It is also a very different story from the first two. Ke'lar the brother of Ra'kar is faced with a very tough decision.  One he ultimately decides is well worth the risk.  Ar'Ar's mate Summer Mills has run away. Ar'ar, the first son of Malek and the old time enemy of his clan, Ke'lar find he must shield the little human and help her regardless of the consequences.  Being confronted with doing what he thinks is right and what is lawful according to Hir council laws proves to be his only option..Summer has be taken and she absolutely must get back to earth to get her little daughter back from her ex husband before he discovers she has been taken by aliens.

"WOW!! I have to say this is possibly the best new alien story I have seen in a while.  I really liked it and I thought it was hot and very, very nicely handled.  In fact, before I even finished this one I bought the next two .This one is Jenna MacNally's story and that of a Hir Warrior, Ra'kar who accidenrly crashes on Earth when he is attacked by his enemy the Zerar.  They are very nasty race who has devastated his plant and killed half the population in the scourge.  The female half for the most part are dead and there is little hope of repopulation of the planet.  That is until Ra'kar discovers the beautiful and obviously compatible species in the North Carolina hills of Earth.What follows is a very quick and very different courtship and capture of most befuddled human, Jenna.  The roaring alien shoots her, handcuffs her and then mates with her via his very arousing purr and cuddles.  He than repairs his space craft and wisks her away to Hir, where he proceeds to claim her by Hir law as his lifemate.  Jenna and he successfully mate and are pregnant.  A good thing you would think.  But there are some on Hir who do not adhere to the mixing of the races.It is a magnificent story with many twists and turns, when the path to true love as we all know is never smooth.  I think you have this series at the top of the scfi list.  I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5HL5X373HP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH65BDG#wasThisHelpful","RU5HL5X373HP1","A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q9ZYNO1MXQDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wonderful new series by Harmony Raines. Earth is dying and the Karalian aliens have come to earth looking for compatible females to help them repopulate Karal.  They have with the cooperation of the Earth President devised a lottery system to match the aliens with the females.  It is a complex system of matching human DNA with the Karalian DNA and the fertility cycle of the earth females.While the earth population thinks it is really a lottery, it is in effect a rigged pairing of not only fertility cycles, and DNA but also whether or not they can live in harmony with the Human Female who is less than cooperative and in fact did not even enter they lottery and was the person responsible for the loss of 10 human lives and two of the Karalian aliens.  Elissa is opposed to this system and believes it is a conspiracy to punish her.  Marin is the first Male Karalian chosen to be her mate.It takes place both on Earth and across time and space.

"This is another solid Guitar Play Along book based on the songs of Jack Johnson. They feature a demo track and a play along track. These ""play along"" books are a GREAT tool for any guitarist, as most of the songs are familiar, you can play your favorite artists songs to really sound alike backing tracks, (minus the vocals of course) and you can work on your improvization skills. I own a ""acoustic hits for beginners"" which also contains the song ""Upside Down,"" but what is cool about this book is, it has the little simple intro and outro included. This is a good play along book for those who: Like JJ, play acoustic guitar, would like to practice lots of different chords. Great backing tracks!

"A book dedicated to playing some Santana, NICE! The backing tracks here are EXCELLENT!! The mix of songs is really nice and creative, as it does have some of  his well known songs as well as a couple obscure ones. Santana's style is really really hard to grasp, as I think the key is ""effortlessness,"" as in, what I'm getting, is his ability to just PLAY without really FORCING it. Which has really helped me develop my own personal style. For me, playing without ""trying"" is hard, as I feel I kinda force my way around a song. Saying something interesting muscially while making it sound awesome but also EASY is extremely hard. Practicing playing and listening Carlos' music really really teaches you to just let it ride. Playing with feeling and emotion, obviously, but doing so in a way where your movements and note selection aren't forced, and always sound natural and like they belong.  I would recommend this play along book to anyone who would like to become a better guitar player and crank out to some Santana, a really soulful guitarist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IYMIWVX1H6QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571528295#wasThisHelpful","R2IYMIWVX1H6QC","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Definitely agree with the guy that has the most liked review on here. This was a lucky find here on Amazon, as I buy a TON of play along books. Peter Green has been one of my favorites for awhile now, and his playing has always been something I wanted to emulate. Enter this book. Its nuts because in reality, the technicality of the songs in this book AREN'T THAT DIFFICULT!! It's really amazing what he made sound so complex turns out to be rather ""simple."" (fingering, even the use of SLIDE on ""Albatross"" ANYONE can pull off!!) Peter Green just knew how to make emotion travel thru his guitar into your mind.  If you are aware of who Peter Green is and you play guitar, this book is a MUST!! Superb backing tracks, right on par with any Hal Leonard Play Along book, as well as the TAB. Great write ups too, and unlike the Hal Leonard series of books, the breakdown tracks of JUST the solos is acutally something I did end up using and appreciating!! Definitely a must buy!!Don't be put off by the corny looking cover, this really really is a GEM of a find for a blues playing guitarist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GJBPLYDI2SJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=185909645X#wasThisHelpful","R2GJBPLYDI2SJ0","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been playing guitar now for 1 year 9 months. I've progressed rather quickly, not because I'm a ""natural,"" but because I put in TONS of hours and hard work. I've previously owned a Mustang 1v.2, which I got when I ""outgrew"" the plain amp that came with my ""Epiphone Guitar Player Pack.""The Fender amp worked very well for me for a few months. Nothing wrong with it, other than I wanted to try something different. Had lots of fun sounds, fairly easy to use. Bought the single footswitch for it. Didn't really end up using it all that much as it didn't really do anything I needed.Ended up getting a Vox VT20, which is a GREAT amp as well. Sounded a lot better, easier to use, all in all great. Well, a few months pass, I've started recording myself playing along to backing tracks. Started out using a little handheld Tascam DR-05. Liked what I was hearing and made a few cds for friends, etc. They sounded ok, but it was made with the little mic in my little practice room; ""echo-y."" Come Christmas, I get a Tascam DP-008 8-Track recorder, which has several different inputs.  So I started looking around for another amp, one I could connect DIRECTLY to my 8 Track.  Found this guy. My previous experience with Fender amps went well, and this one has a ton of good reviews so I went for it. Boy, WAY easy to use. I LOVE the built in screen where it shows everything, amp model, pedal used, mod used, delay, etc. Then you can also fine tune your sound via the actual knobs on top. The screen is pretty much what sold me, as I really don't like fussing about with my laptop while I'm trying to play or record. I'm sorta old school like that. I have played around with the Fender Fuse software after hooking it up to this, but I'm not really that interested in finding out about all you can do with it. I much perfer tangible, hence mussing about with the amp itself. YOU DON'T have to hook it up to your computer EVER to get great sounds, it's just another option for those who are into  that. So far, I've been able to dial in EVERY sound I want. I play mostly blues, but sometimes I play some Slayer or some Santana or some AC/DC. Lots of different sounds I am consistently able to get.So, back to recording. If you're like me and you like recording yourself playing along to backing tracks or with actual music, you can get cd quality recordings when you use this amp to hook directly up to your 8 track or what ever other recording device you have. I'm using the XLR output (it has 2 outputs) from the cab into my 8 Track. Then I have my iPod plugged into a splitter where one 1/8"" end  (1/8"" is the size of your standard headphone cable end)  plugs into the ""AUX"" input on top of this amp, and the other 1/8"" plugs into a 1/4"" male adapter plug ($4) and then into the line input on my 8 track. I've recorded tons of songs this way, and they all sound really pro, minus my somewhat ok guitar abilities. :-)The speaker is plenty loud, the controls are responsive, easy to read, it's VERY well built, open back to stash the cord, etc. You can rename any preset right from the amp, which is handy so you can just name it ""Santana"" or whatever so you can find it easier. It comes with a basic two button footswitch. I ended up buying the 4 button footswich as well, which you run simultaniously with the 2 button. I would definitely recommend the 4 button footswitch.As far as sounds, reverb, etc, none of them sound ""digitized"" to me. They all sound really really good. Everything on the amp is customizable, so you can tweak any field you need to to get exactly the right sound you're looking for.My ONLY complaint about it so far is; if say you want to move preset #81 ""Metallica"" (example) to preset #1, you sure can, BUT, it doesn't SWAP them, it simply overwrites preset #1. Which is really LAME because you can easily overwrite one of your own favorite presets or a good factory preset. There is a way to reverse it but that requires you to do the factory reset which sets it back to day one. Other than that, this amp is really really great for any guitarist, ESPECIALLY if you're doing your own home recording. Sounds fantastic piped directly into your multitrack recorder rather than mic'd in. Very fine amplifier.Basically, why you should buy/consider this amp:Scaleable: XLR outputs; Home recording, also if you ever plan to play live, you can connect this amp to a PA system using the XLR outputsCustomizable: Using the amp directly to customize or via the Fuse software, you can do a LOT for your own sound.Loud as F: You most likely won't need a bigger amp unless you're playing outside. Not sure what some of these morons are talking about when they say can't hear it over a drum set. I have a drum set. Its nonsense.Easy to Use: You can figure it out within minutes of plugging it in.If you're serious about guitar, this is a great place to start, as you can only go up from this point. This is about as good as you're going to get under $500, and this amp will grow with you.Ask me if you have a questions! Have fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OVDEM04EP4YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTIQKM4#wasThisHelpful","R2OVDEM04EP4YV","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have about 40 of these play along books, and most all of them are superb. My playing has improved TREMENDUSLY since begininning using them. What I do mostly that works for me, and is most fun for me, is to learn the intro and a few key verses of a song, and then simply improvise the rest, which helps me practice my pentatonic scales and such. So I rarely ever learn an entire song note for note, but to jam along to a familar song and put my own spin on it is really rewarding. This book has many of AC/DC's well known songs, and the backing tracks are AWESOME! I learned ""Dirty Deeds"" and it's fairly 'easy' to learn the hook, then jam out the rest. The tone I can match perfectly with my Mustang III amplifier.

"This was my first ""Signature Licks"" book I've purchased. What I have been doing for the past year and a half teaching myself guitar is use the Hal Leonard Guitar Play Along books, which I contribute a LOT of my success at progressing so quickly. I mostly play blues, and one of my favorite guitarists is Buddy Guy. This book is a great learning tool for me as it breaks down snippets of songs and explains what's going thru Buddy Guys head (theoretically) as he blazes thru his solos. Music is really fascinating and also for me, easier to understand if I can look behind the curtain so and see the how and the whys as to why someone did something musically. The audio examples are great, and the descriptions of the song snippets, written in TAB and also standard are clear and easy to understand. Also, my favorite song off the Stone Crazy album, ""I smell a rat"", had quite a write up to it by Dave Rubin, who described it perfectly when he said the solo was ""violent."" That IS the perfect way to desribe it!!  Anyway, if you like insight into learning why your favorite artist did something and you want it broken down into manageable chunks, these ""Signature Licks"" books would be a great tool for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ONSK6HK0X8U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=079358180X#wasThisHelpful","R1ONSK6HK0X8U6","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an actual review of the product ! Wow!Another great blues title from Hal Leonard publishing. The songs themselves are not too technically difficult. They are really fun to play along with or what I like to do most, play my own stuff over the backing tracks. What's different about this blues selection, if you're familiar with Albert King, is that the songs are more in a swing feel and have some stank/funk to them, which is what I really jive with when I improvise. Most of the songs are in drop D tuning. The version of ""born under a bad sign,"" while in another ""Blues Play Along' book has the bass line and a few main solos, this one has all the solos only, not the bass line/hook. Which is cool they're giving you a new version. Albert King was a legend, here's your chance to learn some of his tunes.

"This is THE one book to get if you're a student of the blues. Whats cool about this book is, while all the songs are RJ songs, the versions presented here are some of his most recognizeable songs that were covered by popular artists! Really cool, as the original versions, while great, would be rather sparse for a good ""play along."" Crossroads by Cream, Come On in My Kitchen by Keb' Mo', one of my favorites by the Rolling Stones, ""Love in Vain Blues,"" ""Dust my Broom"" by Canned Heat, a SUPER FUN slide slide ""Walkin' Blues"" by Joe Bonamassa, ""Ramblin' on My Mind"" by Eric Clapton, ""Traveling Riverside Blues"" by Led Zep, and ""Sweet Home Chicago"" by every blues artist ever. This is definitely one of my favorite play along books. First for the cultural significance of the great blues songs, second for the masterful mix of styles that have been derived from the legend himself, the guy who really put blues in everyone's ear, Robert Johnson. A great selection. I have every blues play along by Hal Leonard, as well as many other play along collections, and this one is easily at the top.**On a scale of 1-10 in difficulty playing note for note along with the book, this is about an 8, lots of slide work, string skipping, chord work and, what gets me, the frustratingly ""simpleness"" to the songs.A MUST for any blues lover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DBDDE19T9DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1458414892#wasThisHelpful","R35DBDDE19T9DZ","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another fine collection of TAB plus backing track books from Hal Leonard. I got this mostly to practice my right hand picking technique and work on my speed, and wow yeah this is a good one for that! Whats cool about this one is alot of the intros and melodies are somewhat ""easy"" to get under your fingers with a lot of practice, but then when it comes to the guitar solo parts, thats where it gets pretty insane. Do-able and nice to have one reliable sourse if you're a big time Dime fan, but those solos are going to take a LOT of repetition!!  ;-) Great backing tracks. Minus the one star for some of the guitar work was a little oddly off from the originals, making it somewhat difficult to process. Still, a great Play Along book for Pantera fans or those wanting to rock out.**I started a rating system based solely on how technically difficult the songs are to play fully and exactly as transcribed; 10 being extremely difficult. I buy these play along books not usually so much to play exactly along note for note, but if that's what you do then the rating is based on those who would do that: note for note, no improvising.Difficulty: 9.3 Pretty extreme in quite a few areas.

"I buy a ton of guitar instruction books, learning materials, play along books, videos, all sorts of items to expedite my proficency at playing guitar.I play mostly blues. The reason I got this book was mainly because I didn't really understand what it means when they say to ""play the A minor(or whatever) pentatonic over the I, IV, V"" in a progression. Do I just use form 1 of the 5? Where and when should I use the other 4 forms? I'm assuming that it would be too easy to just use the first form for all the chord progressions so I'm not sure when I would use the other ones and where exactly. I didn't and still don't fully understand that concept and how that works. I'm going on my second year of playing. I practice 2-3 hours a day minimum, 7 days a week and read a TON to learn the concepts behind what exactly I'm doing.This book says it will get you playing all over the neck. Yeah, it does. But so does the $5.99 ""Ultimate Scale Book."" The best thing about that book was it gave you the BIG PICTURE first of the all five scale patterns, then you practice each one until you put them together. This book goes thru one at a time for an entire chapter. Me I like/have to visualize the ENTIRE picture and know what I'm ultimately working towards. What I was looking for exactly, was WHY, HOW, and WHEN to apply one of the five pentatonic scales.Well, basically what this book is is an expensive lick book. There are hundreds of lick examples, mainly in a rock or blues style. Upon first opening the book you see tons of licks in tab, and tons of words, so your first impression would be ""wow theres a ton of info in here! Yay!""  Well, the words usually aren't actually helpful, they're simply describing the lick you're about to play. Lots of filler.Before purcasing this book, I already knew and understood how all 5 patterns fit together and how to transpose them. I guess what I was after was some clarification on how to mingle different keys together, what the ""rules"" are for that, and basically a definitive source for that. Well, after looking through this book, I found only partial answers without really any clarification. I found sort of what I was looking for on page 68.What this book is: tons of licks with description of each as well as audio samples, and ""Quick Theory Tips"" one or two per chapter which usually ARE actually helpful, but since they're ""quick,"" they don't really expand on some of the ideas. This book would be good for those that would like to practice each form of the pentatonic scale for an entire chapter, which includes dozens of licks. I think if you were going thru this book chapter by chapter, sure by the end you'd know how the scales fit together, but I feel if you did that, you'd be bored by the time you got to the end.If you're just looking for a book on how to practice and fit the pentatonic scale together, the book that worked for me that costs $5.99 is Troy Stetina's""Ultimate Scale Book."" which has pretty much ALL the scales, major, minor, blues, etc. I have 4 of Troys books, and I consider his books to be EXCELLENT resources for the beginning to advanced guitarist. That book mainly has pictures and I just practiced it day in and day out until I got it.This book mainly failed for me in the writing; boring textbook style, whereas Troy's books are written in a conversational fashion and also CONTAIN INFORMATION CONSISELY. Not a bunch of filler words to sound smart. Maybe the info I need is in here, but if it is, it is NOT easy to find, isn't in a logical place, or is hidden among the hundreds of lick example ""explanations.""3.5 Stars. One thing I really liked about it was it does have some really cool sounding licks that aren't so easy and not so hard. Good licks.  Not a complete waste of $ for me, but wouldn't buy again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6Z2WBY41RGY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423496280#wasThisHelpful","R6Z2WBY41RGY0","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have about 30 of these Play Along books, and I play mostly blues. One my favorite guys is Magic Sam, so I was super excited to see this Play Along out!! I played the heck out of ""Easy Baby,"" one of my all time favorite songs. Side note: I use a VOX Valvetronix VT20 amp and I am able to get that ""slapback"" Magic Sam sound.) All the tracks are great, the backing tracks as well as the guitar parts. Every song and every artist on this one are legendary!! It's like playing with the Blues All Star Team!!(obviously these are NOT the original tracks played by the original artists. There are two tracks, each complete songs, one with guitar and one without guitar) What I personally like about this book is, I can play acoustic guitar to most of them, or electric, they sound good either way! Most of these songs have been covered hundreds of times by other blues artists along the way, so if you're trying to get the ""vibe"" of a song and you cant find the TAB anywhere else or the backing track, give this a shot!

"This is a really diverse collection of popular 90's songs. I found most of the backing tracks to be really great, and a few had really stellar guitar parts recorded, noteably ""Alive."" This would be a good pick for an intermediate/advanced guitar player. The songs are pretty difficult to pin down for a beginner. Thought the tab/sound for ""Santeria"" and ""Been Caught Stealing"" sounded odd/off, like an odd added note was thrown in there throwing off the whole familiar vibe.

"Being as I'm super into playing blues, I'm always on the lookout for books/dvds to make me better and expand my musical horizons. The three star rating is in no way a knock on Dave Martone's playing ability. If you don't know who he is, wow, he is pretty amazing at guitar to say the least! There are a ton of instruction materials out there, and I've bought enough to realize about 50% are worthless, 30% are misguided jumbled messes, and the other 20% are actually helpful. This one is somewhere around the 30% misguided mess. The book has several lick examples. The DVD is high quality, Dave is well spoken and knowledable, however, the course just seemed like it wasn't following any sort of plan and I kept wondering where it was going. I felt the video was mostly a showcase of Dave going, ""Ok watch this!"" and then ripping thru some crazy lick example at lightning speed then saying ""ok now you try."" The book is pretty useless unless you're following along simultaniously with the DVD. The lick examples are pretty boring to play. Three stars for the excellent quality video, and the couple of pointers I learned. Not sure who exactly this is aimed at, definitely NOT for beginners or intermediate guitar players.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYNIWMM8AC8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739093304#wasThisHelpful","R1EYNIWMM8AC8T","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another excellent selection of ""rockin' country"" songs and backing tracks from Hal Leonard. I bought it to learn ""Guitars Cadillacs"" by Dwight Yoakam, and that is a FUN one and overall rather ""easy"" to pin down for a moderately good guitarist.

"I have about 30 of these guitar play along books, and I play mostly blues. I have almost all the blues related ones, and there isn't a bad one in the bunch. This one is no exception. I've noticed the ""slower"" sounding the beat of blues songs, the faster the guitar part is. That is true for this case. Some pretty quick guitar going on here.

"I have about 30 of these play along books, and I generally play blues. This Gary Moore book is FUN to jam along with. Gary Moore was a super talented guy, and played a variety of genres. This book has a little of his blues and a little of his rock side. The songs are pretty technical, but what I usually do is learn the melody to the songs and practice improvising to the rest. If you like to play blues AND rock, this is a great pick! Excellent backing tracks as well as recorded guitar parts.

"I bought this DVD as a supplement to my other guitar lessons I'm doing. I have a few of Troy's books, and really like them and find them pretty concise and helpful, although they are really challenging. This isn't really an instructional video per say, or just an interview video, it's somewhere in between. Basically what this dvd is, is it is like you get to sit down and talk to Troy about his philosophy and how he approaches playing guitar, what techniques he uses and likes and recommends, and some of his favorite  exercises for speed and control. It's filmed interview style and its him talking directly to you. Some ""instructional"" videos I have are basically some meathead showing off for 55 minutes and then telling you, ""so, like, now do that."" Well, this isn't quite as bad, as Troy RIPS through plenty of examples without very much set up, but the thing I like about this video is, yeah, he's ripping through them, BUT, he's explaining WHY he's doing it and his logic behind it. So, even though I am an ""intermediate"" guitar player, the few tips I picked up, the knowledge about kinda how and why to do a few things, made this video worth purchasing. I really appreciate an INSTRUCTION video that actually has someone smarter than me on it, who is actually TEACHING me something or inspiring me in some way to figure something out on my own. That's where this video shines. Troy really comes off as being sincere and wants me to learn something from him. He's very well spoken and a natural teacher. His style is loose and candid. The setting and camera work are top notch. This isn't one of those gimmicky cash grab ""Learn everything about playing in a band as lead guitar in an Hour"" dvd's where you're just copying what some horrible host is showing you and talking to you as you're a dork and he's the cool kid. Most of the video was way over my head, as there is a LOT of assuming you have some knowledge of music theory, but the way it's presented didn't make me irritated, it only made me want to learn more so what was presented could really connect with me.  It comes with a TAB lesson book, which has all the examples he plays, so you can practice them on your own.I would say, if you're hungry for all types of guitar instruction, this video is a great insight to a really super talented guitarist! It's basically like sitting down with Troy for a couple hours and him trying to convey to you his 30 years of experience and ideas. There's a ton of knowledge here, you just have to be able to properly receive it, or be prepared and ready to do some work to make those ideas ""click"" for you.**UPDATE:OCT.2014***** Well as I've progressed at guitar and my knowledge of music theory, I went back and rewatched some of the tips. It was cool because now I can better grasp some of the concepts and was able to pick up some valuable tips! I would say to any and every new guitarist, don't blame the material at first if you don't understand it yet, just be patient and keep studying and soon things will just make sense to you. Good luck! Great video!!!!!!! Also, fun to watch some of the shredders on this video. MAB was my favorite. Sweet guitar too!**UPDATE: NOV.2014**** I watched this video AGAIN the other night. I pretty much learn something new each time I watch it. The more you learn, the more you are able to learn. This DVD is a great resource if you can extract the tips that Troy presents. Also, its fun to watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSIKJ9ZQGHBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066PSQ3G#wasThisHelpful","RZSIKJ9ZQGHBN","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm somewhat new to playing guitar, and this is the second amp I've owned. I debated a while on why I should pick this amp compared to some of the other ones on amazon. Ultimately the reason I bought it was all the helpful reviews. Well, here is my positive hopefully helpful review!If you're new to guitar, this amp is a great logical choice. It is plenty loud, and it has hundreds of sound settings for you to find your own sound or a sound you're trying to mimic, such as BB King, which I have found, which is really cool, considering this is more of an ""entry"" level amp. I'm claiming this is great for beginners and parents of beginners for several reasons: Brand recognition, affordable, VERY well made(solid), loud, and FUN to play with, thus keeping you interested and having fun with your new guitar. It's also fairly compact, looks ""cool,"" portable, and has customizable sounds to play around with via the Fender software. Another reason if you're looking at this as a parent, well, for me (an adult), who plays every single day for hours and hours and can afford much more expensive amps, I really can't justify buying another amp right now. This one meets all my needs, which is great because it just happened to be so affordable! So, unless your kid is the next John Mayer, this amp should meet the needs of most kids and teens through their entire time playing. And if they stop playing after a couple months, you can easily sell this amp and get some of the modest ammount you paid full for it.If you're an adult like me, and are somewhat new to guitar, this amp is really a bargain, and you can get a TON of sounds, it's plenty loud, and you can always upgrade if you need more loud, as the other Fender amps pretty much have the same exact settings and sound fields as this one, they're just louder and have a couple more options.So far, I feel I really scored with this amp!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DL8V8EVJWXC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTGMI5O#wasThisHelpful","R3DL8V8EVJWXC6","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi, I am 34 year old regular guy intermediate guitar player. I'm definitely not a guitar snob. Funny how almost every ""low priced"" guitar on Amazon have ""reviews"" by those super cool guys who already ""own"" Gibsons and Fenders and Martins, but for some reason buy these ""cheap"" guitars and then trash them on a review. Anyway, I actually took a chance and bought this guitar used from Amazon warehouse deals as ""like new."" I'll share that experience as well, in case you're wondering about how that works too and hopefully you can find a good as deal as I did! Well, the guitar came in a plain outer box, and inside was the Epiphone guitar box. The guitar had all the plastic on it and was wrapped still perfectly inside and looked to be unused. There were also stickers on the pickups and a sticker on the guitar itself. It had the user manual and even came with a bumper sticker too! It was NOT stamped ""USED"" on the backside of the neck. I'm assuming it was unused. I'm not exactly how that works with Epiphones lifetime warranty, as they generally only warranty items bought new. There was only ONE pretty ""major"" ""flaw"" with it, and that was one of the pickups as way loose and rattling around. I tried screwing it back down but it seems that whatever it screws into is stripped out. This to me was NOT a big deal as I will find time to fix it myself.  For the amount I saved buying it ""used,"" I cut my losses. It still works just fine, and actually doesn't present that much of a sound issue or anything. Able to play just fine.There were quite a few reasons why I picked this guitar, mainly for me, I really loved the trapezoid inlays. They are mother of pearl and look great. The color, Wine Red with the Flame Top, is so amazing looking! It has just a great color scheme with the white pick guard, the muddy orange knobs, and the chrome hardware. A stunning guitar!!! Aesthetics alone, this guitar is magnificent!!!!!!!!One really awesome thing you can't see from the picture, the ""Epiphone"" logo on the headstock is also mother of pearl!!! Which adds just an extra touch of class to an already beautiful guitar.To me, this guitar seems built like a tank. It's quite a bit heavier than my other guitars, but it doesn't seem ""heavy."" It's balanced perfectly. The tuners hold their tune just fine. I can see like others have stated about the push/pull coil tapping knobs being somewhat difficult to push/pull. To me it's not an issue as I don't switch around mid song or anything. This guitar is my best sounding guitar, and I can produce quite a few different sounds with the coil tapping feature and the tone control. I actually got a BB King play along dvd to play with, and I can replicate a LOT of his sounds and tones using this specific guitar combined with a Fender Mustang1v.2 amp.($129) I reach for this guitar the most now, as for me, it just seems like I can honestly get the sounds I want and maybe it's just in my head I don't know, but it feels like I can just grab those notes and chords easier. Everything about this guitar I love. Looks, sounds, build quality. Everything. There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying an Epiphone product.I was also on the fence and wondered about what the difference was between this $499 model and the $399 LP Standard model and why the price difference. Well, I went on Epiphones website to find out.-This, the PlusTop PRO has the coil tapping controls-PlusTop PRO has Probucker pickups, Standard has Alnico Classic Humbuckers-PlusTop PRO has the flame topI believe everything else is exactly the same, and you can get more color options with the PRO model. So the extra hundred bucks may or not be worth it to you.Is this guitar worth $500? To me, yes, Definitely! If you're lucky enough to be able to get one, you should! And even better, if you can pick one up on Amazon Warehouse deals ""used-like new,"" for a considerable discount, I highly suggest you do! If you buy it from Amazon Warehouse, you can return it, free, if it's not up to your standards. Hope this encourages you if you're on the fence like I was before dropping five bills on a guitar! :-)**Update Sept.2015***I still use this guitar qutie often. I play it about 50% of the time between my Fender Stratocaster. What I like about this particular guitar is that I can always count on it to get a very distinct  sound that works well for what I play, which is mainly Blues. It's hard to decribe a sound, but I'll say ""rich, warm, complex, slightly 'dirty',low, authoritative.""  I use it for real slow blues, Peter Green type sound.I can definitely tell the weight difference after using this one for the day! It is quite a bit heavier. But, sounds great still!Also, I never did get around to fixing that loose pickup. It NEVER makes a difference in sound  and I've been quite lazy about fixing it. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TGBMOPP5M48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WBEVIW#wasThisHelpful","R11TGBMOPP5M48","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this as sort of supplement to my Learn & Master Guitar dvds I own. I was looking for a way to practice actual songs and have some fun playing guitar rather than just drills and chords. The song selection on this dvd is pretty good. There are a few I haven't even heard before. I would say this dvd is ""aimed"" at a more advanced player, as there is NO slow speed or hand holding. There are however introductions to each of the songs explaining the music theory part of it and which scale boxes the notes are in. The song you pick out has 3 ways to view, pick hand close up, players view with TAB, and front view with TAB. The first song I started out with was ""Thrill is Gone."" It took me about an hour at JUST the intro part rewinding and rewinding and rewinding several dozen times to get it, but it was fun as I was actually playing something recognizable. The other song I am working on is ""Gamblers Blues."" I broke out a pencil and paper and actually wrote out the TAB as watching on the tv it goes by way faster then I can coordinate and play and decide which notes to pick. Very well produced program and the camera angles are clear and the sound quality is fantastic.Basically, if you REALLY want to learn, you can. One of my favorite features is you can turn the guitar part ""off"" during playback and then YOU are the guitar lead! Its GREAT for improvising and plugging in notes you figure out sound good by yourself. That was an added bonus for me, the ""discovering"" how certain notes sound really well together and jamming with the backbeat. This was also a great way for me to work on my skills on the entire neck of the guitar, not just open position. The backing tracks are studio good, NOT karaoke bad. All in all, being a intermediate guitar player, this can be a fun supplement to your progression. The teacher even plays a Gibson BB King guitar, adding to the authentic sound.  I'll most likely order more of these dvds. The only one thing I think could wish for, would be for the notes to light up like lyrics do in karaoke so you could see and hear exactly what and when to play it if you're stuck on something. Other than that, a great tool!Pretty much like with any new skill, you get out what you put in. I'd say give it a shot if you're wanting to branch out and learn some very recognizable songs!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUT9IBNH5Y6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FIPNQK#wasThisHelpful","R1TUT9IBNH5Y6H","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this set thinking that it would enhance and add variety to my already rigorous guitar practicing of the very very EXCELLENT ""Learn and Master Guitar"" course. I have tons of praise for that course and the instructor, Steve Krenz, who also teaches this course. It teaches you in a logical, methodical way so you so can really grasp what you're learning as you progress. Right now I am on Lesson 8, barre chords on the 5th string which is really frustrating so I needed a break and put this in. Well! This course is almost ENTIRELY different than the regular L&M course, in that he just jumps right in to things and kinda leaves you to figure some things out on your own time. There's no hand holding in this course, which there is gently in the regular course to lead you into the waters of playing guitar. I even went to the next lesson to see if maybe I was just being grouchy, but it was the same.That being said, if you already have a pretty good grasp of guitar and all the chord forms and are able to find and execute chords, notes and barres pretty rapidly, I would think this dvd set is great. Great production value, excellent online resources, and a great instructor. However, if you're like me, a ""beginner,"" then this may be a little too fast paced and frustrating.I'm thinking after a few more L&M lessons, I should be ready for this set.*****UPDATE:Oct.2014:Well, I've progressed to the ""Blues"" lesson on the Original L&M Course so I thought I'd give this another shot. I found it really irritating and frustrating. The concepts in Lesson 1 are basic, simple concepts. The I,IV,V chords, and then it's off to going into soloing using notes from chords and then into a Call and Response section. This would be fine if there was on screen TAB and or it was CLEAR on the screen what notes exactly he is playing. I would say if you're thinking about buying this as a stand alone to learn the blues, I would not recommend it unless you already have a really through understanding of music theory, know all 5 pentatonic scale forms, and already have a pretty good understanding of guitar and the fretboard. I wouldn't really recommend this for an absolute beginner, which is sad because the regular L&M guitar course is amazing. I would say if you're a beginner, go with the regular L&M course, as it offers FAR better instruction and covers a wide variety of genres, including blues! :-)***UPDATE:Nov.2014*** I skipped ahead and watched disc two and disc three. I'm so frustrated with this set!! It seems so jumbled and misguided. Its hard to follow. I'm not sure exactly who this set is aimed at. I'm a fairly advanced beginner, and the concepts in the dvd to me are all over the place with skill levels. Steve will display a complex chord progression or advanced figering and demonstrate at a fast pace, then in the next scene it will be a lesson about ""This is the key of A on the sixth string."" Then he'll slowly walk you thru the names of the notes on the sixth string. I'm thinking if someone could easily play the previous example, surely they would already know the names of the notes on the sixth string! I just am not getting as much out of this as I was hoping, considering the COLOSSAL help I gained with the original L&M course. Maybe the fact that it's titled ""Learn and Master Blues"" is what's bothering me. I'm not really learning or mastering. Not worth $90****UPDATE: DEC.2014***** Well, I've been doing a ton of music studying and decided to give this set another shot. I rewatched discs one thru three, lessons and workshops. Now that I have a better understanding of music theory, the course is a little more accessable. There are still some things I just don't understand why Steve is presenting and I'm not getting the logic behind them, such as ""while you're doing an E7 chord, your pinky is free to hit these other notes."" I understand the concept, but not the logic. I wouldn't know how to apply this example. And watching it again, disc one where he's demonstrating the basics, he DOES do some convoluted example with a hammer on and some other flair added in. This totally confused me the first several times I've watched it, as he just says ""this is an E7"" and then does this weird example and never really explains it. I'm going to leave my rating at 3 stars, as you CAN learn some things, but it's definitely not up to par with the original L&M course.***********OCT 2015*************I know a LOT more now than I did before so I decided to give this another shot, starting with Disc 3. Well, disc three actually turned out to be fine and I learned some things. BUT, this is after two years of constant studying and playing. I still have no idea who exactly this set is aimed at. So after the sucess of disc three I put on disc 4. Disc 4 is an absolute Sh**t show! I have no idea what is going on or the thought process involved in this. It is SO disjointed and unorginized. It's as if it was made on a weekend and rushed out after the sucess of the regular L&M course. I'd advise skipping this set. Lowered one star to two stars total, as lessons are jumbled, follow no real recognizeable plan, and just irritating in their sloppiness.Random Fun Fact: The Nashville session muscian drummer Steve uses in this video is now the drummer for Lady Antebellum.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19V8MW4WF9LTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984119337#wasThisHelpful","R19V8MW4WF9LTU","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lets start with a light rant and a little about me. Skip to paragraph three for guitar review.I'm fairly new to playing guitar, 34 years old, and I am finding myself really interested in all things guitar now. Needless to say, I read a LOT of reviews on Amazon and other guitar sites. I find that the majority of reviews for these ""low end"" guitars are unhelpful, i.e. (""not as good as my '54 Fender Made in USA Strat"") arrogant, (""decent for for a cheap guitar"") or just plain dumb, (""changed strings and now it sounds like a $2500 Fender."") Well, me, being a smart person and also now a real passionate about guitar person, I get books and read things and take those reviews with a grain of salt. I read a ""review"" about a Squire guitar on Fender's site today; the guy touted himself as a ""Semi Professional."" and then went on to say he had this Squire guitar for ""two or three years"" and then mentions not ever once changing the strings.!? I doubt most ""semi professionals"" play a $179 guitar and don't change their strings regularly. Likely story...So rather than trust these people who throw out a lot of common words that sound fancy and mysterious to the beginning guitarist, i.e. ""truss rod,"" ""intonation,"" ""proper set up,"" (which could mean anything) I tought myself about guitars; how they're made, what to look for, what produces what type of sound, importance of wood type, history of guitars, the makers, brands, types, body styles, all sorts of stuff. So MOST of the reviews I read about guitars make me really irritated. If you're looking at this guitar and you already own a real life Gibson Les Paul (not an Epiphone) or a real Fender Strat (not a Squier) and you write a review about how this $179 is a piece of ""crap,"" well, I compare that to those snooty wine snobs who think they can detect the difference between a $90 bottle of wine and a $14 bottle of wine. People buy what they can afford or what is the best value. This guitar is a great VALUE.Guitar review:I got the Lake Placid Blue, and it is very very beautiful. The prettiest, most ""Play me!!"" guitar in my small, humble collection. The chrome hardware and white pickguard just set it off!  The body is made from Alder wood and the neck is made from Maple wood.(This is important; remember this as I'll be discussing it later) It has a polyurathane finish. The pickups are ""Vintage-Style Single-Coil Tele.""  It has a 3-Position Blade switch. Position 1= Bridge Pickup, Position 2.=Bridge and Neck Pickups, Position 3.=Neck Pickup. It has two control knobs, one for tone and one for volume. It comes with Fender 9-42 strings. It was easy for me to change strings too. It has a slightly smaller headstock as is customary on a Telecaster. The tuners I've not ever had a problem with. The knobs all work perfectly, no scratchyness to them. I find it balanced well, not too heavy or light. Just right. The sound I like very much, as it's distinctivley different than my Fender Squier Delux Strat ""Hot Rails"" guitar. I have a Mustang 1v.2 amp. I think a lot of people are confused about guitars and amps and give guitars a lot more credit for sound then the amp. I find amps are really what makes guitars sound good or bad or different. But, yes, this does have differnt pickups then my other guitar so it sounds different. I suppose it has that ""twang"" that people talk about from a Telecaster. To me, I find this Telecaster the most ""easiest"" and fun to play. I don't know about it being ""fast"" on the neck or the radius or whatever mumbo jumbo some dork wannabe talks about to sound like he's in band. All I know is how it feels to me. And I pretty much LOVE this guitar! Proud to have this Fender Squire Tele!If you happen to be looking at those Fender Squire Bullet Strats for $129 like me, I've done a lot of research on Fenders website to compare the difference between that ""cheap"" model and their one step up $179 ""Affinity"" models. The only difference that I found is the Bullet is made from Basswood and the Affinity is made from Alder. The headstock is a little bit bigger on the Affinity model, as Fender touts it as ""Large 60's Style."" Their site also says about the inlays, the Bullet having ""White Dot"" and the Affinity being just ""Dot."" Everything else is excatly the same. The pickups are the same. Neck radius same. So the extra $40 may or may not be worth it to you I guess if you're a wood expert.Another reason to buy if you're on the fence; Fender American Standard Telecaster, $1729.99. Specs.ALDER BODY,MAPLE NECK. Same AS THIS $179!!!!! The reason for the $1600 difference? Maybe because the Fender has a ""urathane"" finish and not a polyurathane finish..??.....just sayin'. The Fender has different pickups as well. Oh, and it has the name ""Fender"" written on it. So save a thousand bucks and buy this and have fun playing and don't let anyone tell you its a ""crappy"" guitar. They're dumb. Enjoy!Hope this review helps you save $1500 bucks and you have as much fun playing it as I do!!!Shane","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PA3JG9WT96VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5QLYQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PA3JG9WT96VY","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this guitar here on Amazon for $59. It's been $59 for a while, and now I notice it's up over a hundred! I would NOT pay over $89 retail for this guitar. Here's why. First, I'm by no means one of those unhelpful guitar snobs who write reviews for a $400 guitar telling you ""its ok for a cheap guitar."" Well, to most people, $400 is a lot of money, and if it's just ok, why did you buy it? Must be nice to be so cavalier... On to the review.I purchased this as a guitar to bring up to work with me and since it was only $59, I wouldn't be too hurt if it got ruined in transit or damaged at work. I have other more expensive guitars, (none over $300), and after receiving it, I thought WOW this looks almost identical to my Fender Squier guitar! Very very similar in weight and finish, nobs, etc. I was very happy with it. If you're new to guitar, you've probably read a ton of reviews by guitar snobs who write about how ""crappy"" a guitar was ""until"" they did a ""proper set up"" on it, and the good ol' ""fixed the intonation"" or ""filed the frets,"" blah blah wow you play guitar, who cares. I didn't do anything to it, nor have I done anything to any of my other guitars, which sound just fine to me. My most expensive one was set up by the shop I bought it at, but my other ones were from Amazon.This Silvertone guitar looks great and is built well. Silvertone has been around for quite awhile and used to make guitars and such for Sears. I did put my own strings on it after a few days, not because the other ones were bad, just I like a certain brand. The only issue I would like to tell you about is that playing it without an amp, it's great, however, when I plugged mine in, it sounded quite a bit different then my other guitars, but in a bad way. ""Scratchy"" when turning the nobs, just didn't sound as good as my other ones. These issues may very well be fixed if you do in fact know how to ""adjust the truss rod"" or ""lower the nut"" or work on guitars. I don't yet, and I don't see spending money to get it set up on a $60 guitar. Mine did come with a cable that you plug into an amp, so that was cool!Another great thing about this guitar; I play for about two and a half hours a night, seven days a week, and I'm just learning chords and I really go at it. Well, this guitar stays in tune VERY well. Tuners are GREAT!I would highly recommend this guitar for beginners, people who need a fairly inexpensive guitar for whatever reason, people who want to modify this guitar, people who know how to work on guitars, or those of you who just need an inexpensive guitar to play ""Rocksmith.""I wouldn't pay over a hundred bucks for this guitar. I would recommend looking at one of the Fender Squier models for a low budget entry guitar priced over $100.Hope this review helps!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R213D34OIFQN9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G8271Q#wasThisHelpful","R213D34OIFQN9Q","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I was lucky enough to see Christina Perri live as she was the opening act for Jason Mraz. I didn't really know who she was at the time, but after seeing her and hearing her, I was a fan! She is GREAT! This album is a fantastic and beautiful album from the talented Christina Perri. Well worth buying, just as good if not better than her first album. Every song on the cd has melody, structure and they all seem to flow together beautifuly. They are all very well written, too, and they each have a story to tell. There's not a bad song on the whole cd! Probably my favorite song so far is ""burning gold."" The cd has a really pleasant, natural melodic flow to it, and Christiana's beautiful voice always conveys just the emotion she's looking for. All in all, if you liked her first cd, this one is a must have as well!

"This guitar set is the PERFECT set up for the beginner. The guitar itself costs $169 on Amazon. This set comes with a small practice amp, cable to attach guitar to amp, nylon guitar strap, a few pics, a guitar tuner, and a gig bag, which by itself sells for $19. The great thing about this is it is specificlly aimed at the beginner, and comes with everything you need to start playing right away, without having to do homework and figure out the accessories you want/need when as a beginner you don't really know and aren't that interested in, you just want to start playing! Well not only is the guitar in this set a really good quality guitar, you get the periphery items that will definitely work for you as you're just starting out, that you will very much most likely upgrade after you figure out what you want. The amp is a really nice amp. It is small and louder than you'd imagine. It has bass and treble settings, a headphone out jack, and an input that you can plug a standard ipod headphone cable into so you can play your ipod out the amp speaker and ""jam"" along. The cable that attaches to the guitar and to the amp is about ten feet long, one end is right angled. The amp runs off regular US 120V power. The guitar is much more beautiful in person than you can tell from the picture. It is very well made. Mine had a couple of very very small cosmetic blemishes that are hardly noticible. The sound of the guitar  is good as well. It does indeed sound different than my Fender Squire Stratocaster, but not in a bad way at all. It has a ""warm"" tone to it. It has some heft to it, but is not what I would consider ""heavy."" Epiphone is owned by Gibson, and the Epiphone line is much like the Squire line of Fender products; a beginner and cost friendly alternitive while having similar apperance to their much much more expensive brethern. The included tuner didn't have instructions, and took me messing with it for quite some time to figure out what it wanted, and is quite finnicky. It includes battery. It works fine. The nylon strap that connects to the guitar that you wear over your shoulder is highly adjustable, and could probably be adjusted down or up to fit a small child or a very large adult. The ""gig bag"" guitar case has a big pocket that you can use to store a couple song books or whatever. It too has a sling strap you can tote over your shoulder, or you can use its handle. The pics it comes with are just as good as any other pics. Mine was shipped in the box shown with a plain brown box with padding surrounding it, so you can order this as a gift and not worry about it being not wrapped.So why order this set for $30 more than just the guitar? Well, as a beginner you don't really know what you want yet. It's better to start out with decent, cheaper items and go up from there. Here you have a base to build upon. Since purchasing this set, I've upgraded the case to a hard case for travel, bought some new pics, and bought a Snark tuner,(<$15) and bought a nicer, stylish and  more comfortable guitar strap. So for $30, I figured out what works and what doesn't. The amp and cable and guitar are great, and in no way are needing upgrades for the beginner. The bag, guitar strap, and tuner work, and are fine, but I quickly grew out of them. All in all, this is very much worth $199!!!-As a side note for any future players interested in self paced guitar instruction, the set I chose after hours of research and is VERY highly reguarded as being excellent for beginners, is called ""Learn and Master Guitar."" by Gibson. They have a website and the more complete set which I got is right around $200. They also have it here on Amazon, but I'm not sure if you get all the extra ""bonus dics."" Anyway, the instruction is terrific and I never thought I'd be able to play guitar!-As far as the included online instruction that is included with this set, I never used it so I can't comment on that.Have a great time learning guitar!! :-)-Shane****-UPDATE-**** July 29, 2014Well, since purchasing this as my first guitar, I've since bought a few other guitars, most recently a Epiphone Les Paul Plustop PRO, $499. Well, build wise, the Plustop PRO is much fancier and stylish, heavier, and just way nicer to look at. Aesthetically terrific. HOWEVER, even tho the Plustop PRO has different pickups, different tone selectors, has a glued on neck, better workmanship, quite honestly the sound of this budget Epiphone LP guitar is really not worth the extra $330. For the looks, yes, but actual SOUND, not too much of a discernible difference. I wish it were a huge difference in sound, but in all reality, not so much. I get a few more sounds from the Plustop due to the coil tapping feature and the slightly better pickups, but, again, not a crazy noticeable difference. I notice after messing around for a bit with the Plustop, I grab this one,(its WAY lighter) and rip on it. Just as easy to play. I contend this Epiphone is still a GREAT buy! Also, if you want a little bit more fancier looking guitar, the next step up from this one is the Epiphone LP-100,($249), which has a some better color options and also has second set of tone and volume knobs, and is a bit beefier physically than this model. The pickups however are EXACTLY the same, so most likely you'll get the same sound as this one. So spending the extra $80 may be worth it to you if you want a bit better looking guitar.***UPDATE FEB.2015*** Well, I've since progressed quite a bit in my playing, and I've acquired many more guitars. This one has now been assigned duty as my primary Slide Guitar, as I use an open tuning on it. So, if you're thinking about buying this and wondering about progressing, you can still find a use for it! Still sounds great, and I think this is one outstanding purchase for a first guitar!*********UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2015***********I recently took a break from playin' the blues and picked up my AC/DC guitar play along book. ""Dirty Deeds"" looked fairly ""easy"" to learn the first few measures, so I went about trying to get the sound of Angus Young on my Fender Stratocaster and Mustang III amp. I just could NOT get that thick, whole, bass'y sound I was looking for, no matter how much I messed about with the knobs. This Epiphone Les Paul Special II, my first 'baby',  was sitting right in my closet, and I remembered how nice and full she sounded, so I plugged her in and found a good setting on my amp and bingo, PERFECT MATCH!! This guitar, while kinda plain looking, produces a  really full, thick sound. Great guitar. Still!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGUOV8YA2VAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6D50L0#wasThisHelpful","R1EGUOV8YA2VAJ","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this snow thrower primarily to clear my two car plus RV parking driveway that had around 13'' of snow buildup. The snow has been frozen, thawed, rained on and frozen again. It's about the consistency of pea gravel. A real pain to shovel.  The instruction manual has a guide for the correct cord size they recommend as well as the gauge and length. You can use a 16G cord on this. I bought a 50' 14G outdoor cord for around $35. Its a good idea to make sure your outdoor receptacle is GFCI protected. You can check your service panel, too, as it might be protected there, which you can see if it has a ""Push to Test"" button on the breaker.I ordered this model after reviewing the SnowJoe and seeing it had a mixed bag of reviews and only a two year warranty and a 18'' clearing base. Snow throwers at Home Depot and Lowes are a LOT more expensive. The gas ones can be up to $1500! This seemed like an economical chance I could take. It is a lot easier than shoveling, that's for sure. It was moderately difficult and took about two or three passes to knock down the hard snow, and quite a bit of heavy pushing to work it through. It was NOT ""easy,"" but the alternative would have taken hours and I would have been miserable. When I got to an area of fresh snow that was only about 4"" deep, it was about as easy as pushing a reel mower, very nice. But for the thick frozen snow, it requires a fair amount of work.  I was able to clear my driveway in about 2.5 hours. The wheels don't travel too nicely over bumps, so you'll have to do a fair amount of adjusting as you go.Overall, I am VERY happy with this purchase. Well worth $160. If you're considering this, it's a GREAT investment. But think about it like a lawnmower; if you go out there and do it right after a snowfall, it will be EASY. If you wait until it gets a foot deep and freezes and thaws and freezes again, it will be difficult and take a lot longer, but it will still work. So, like anything, if you're diligent about using it right away, it is an EXCELLENT product. About as loud as a vacuum. Also, once the handle is released to stop, the auger stops instantly. A great safety feature. All in all, works as hard as you do. I'm happy about this purchase. Recommend it to any homeowner that is doing a regular street driveway.UPDATE:2013 Dec.I've used this snowthrower three other times since the first time using it. I used it within 24 hours of some pretty heavy snowfall, total accumilation between 3-4"". It is SO much easier to use on fresh snow! Plows right on through it! Nice!! VERY happy with this little guy!UPDATE:2014 Winter:This thing is still doing great! Way easier than shoveling, great price, effective, and doesn't take up a ton of room in the garage. Good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHOVJFAQBBY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030BG1L8#wasThisHelpful","R1CHOVJFAQBBY7","A3AFNPL8179FV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFNPL8179FV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a Microsoft keyboard that would not lay flat and it shed its key cap legends after a couple of months. I picked up this keyboard as a replacement and it is terrific. It has some weight so it lays flat and stays put, same when using the elevating feet. The wireless response is instantaneous and the keyboard is USB rechargeable.The key caps are double shot so the legends are molded all the way through and won't wear off. They are also back lit so they are always clearly visible. The keyboard senses ambient light levels and adjusts accordingly. The key resistance is perfect, not to hard or too light for touch typing.  Excellent keyboard.Revised - Went back to order another within three days and the price went from $68, when sold and shipped by Amazon Prime, to $30 more from an Amazon reseller and fulfilled by Amazon. Great keyboard as I reviewed the first time, but not at a 50% higher price. I'm finding that resellers listed as Prime do not honor in spirit the free shipping benefit that comes with Prime membership.

"We operate a commercial shop. We often drill small diameter holes in various types of steel and aluminum that accept close fit solid and roll pins to hold stressed assemblies together. Rather than tie up a large drill press or mill on routine small hole drilling, we purchased the Proxxon for the purpose. In this application it has been excellent. It is quiet, vibration free and with sufficient speed range to handle anything withing the range it is operating. The unit we received was made by Proxxon Luxembourg.When we received the drill, like all new machines received, it had some rust preventive coating that came off with a quick blast of spray solvent. The supplied collets fit properly, the optional German Rohm chuck installed easily and worked properly. Motor speed remains constant with more than enough power when the proper speed range was selected. Used as intended, there were no high temperatures, rattling or belts that did not track and drive properly. We saw no need to invent ways to ""test"" the drill, we just used it per the instructions and good machine use practices. We were not surprised by how small the drill is as the published specs with the listing indicate it is 14 x 9.3 x 4.8 inches and weighs 8 lbs.We did not initially purchase the optional Proxxon 28132 Machine Vise, we went with a heavier Wilton 11681 1-3/4-Inch Drill Press Vise instead. However, we were so pleased with the drill we went back and ordered the Proxxon vise for use with the sliding guide bar.

The Rikon was purchased because I needed a small 1"" belt sander to do some quick rough out work on fabricated parts and I wanted to be able to move it to different locations within the shop, putting it on a shelf while not in use.The Rikon is nicely finished for a unit of this price. Yes, the belt platen was off 1/4"" to the left, but took ten minutes to correct. The belt is not centered to the platen, it is centered to the rollars, which should align it with the platen. The opening in the belt sanding table is a little rough, but both tables align correctly and provide good support. There is plenty of power for the size of material appropriate for this size sander. The belt tracked correctly as received, however, I did try adjustment and it drifted right and left just fine and stayed where set.I do have another more robust 1"" belt bench sander that has much heavier cast iron tables with lots of adjustment options.

"This ""racing"" game involves manipulating the character's movements by simultaneously tilting your device to control side to side motion while swiping up, down, or to the side to control other functions, such as jumping, in order to collect strings of objects scattered throughout the racetrack.There is no tutorial or slow-paced introduction to acquaint the user with how to play the game.  Occasionally, a ""tip"" pops up, such as ""don't hit your head!"" But these are not helpful.  The entire game, including the math section, is backed by frantic music that makes you feel as if you are racing against death or something.If your character hits a wall or other object, the game is paused while the user is presented with anywhere from three to five math questions in the format of ""N - x = N2"", for example, ""5-___=1"".  These are multiple choice questions with three alternatives, and the ""test"" is timed - anywhere from 10 - 20 seconds (I did not notice any rhyme or reason to the number or type of questions presented and how much time is given).  If you get one wrong, ""Game Over"" unless you have collected enough of the coins that are scattered through the racetrack, and then you can pay with them to keep going.As far as I can tell, all features of this game (including changing the type of question offered, adding ""power ups"" such as helmets to your character, or changing the character and setting), cost actual money. You are prompted to pay this actual money after EVERY ""GAME OVER"" even if you select the ""No"" button when it asks if you'd like to see how you can get access to the other characters and features (i.e. selecting ""no"" brings you to a lovely splash screen displaying a different character & setting, where for one click of a button that says $1.99, you can unlock said features).  So even opting OUT of wanting to see how you can unlock the full game does not work.So, essentially, a player is trapped in an infinite loop of running through a short maze, answering a few arithmetic questions, and then being asked for real money.  Even when you try to select only addition or only subtraction (all that was available for free, from what I could tell), you get what you get - which isn't what you requested, but a mix of the two, or one and not the other.What's more, these are essentially first grade math facts, but there is no possible way a six year old could either operate/play this game with any success OR answer these math facts in the time allotted, so any way you look at it you lose.  Even my eight year old, who is okay at apps and better at math, couldn't do anything with this game.  AND she said the music was AWFUL (a sentiment I share).If you are a game developer AND know something about cognitive psychology AND elementary education, then by all means, make an app that is fun to play and helps kids learn. If you are a game developer only, and think that because you passed second grade you can teach second grade, PLEASE just stick to making games and forget the so-called ""edutainment"" angle.I don't know about the permissions or adware/spyware so perhaps someone else can comment on this aspect, but for my part, this ""game"" will not just be deleted from the Kindle; it's getting deleted from my CLOUD.Note to parents: don't waste your time or RAM  on this one. I know there are not a lot of math games for elementary age kids, so it's tempting to jump on whatever you can get, but this Math Run is not only NOT helpful, it could even be HARMFUL to a child who already has some anxiety about math, because of its frenetic action and panic-attack-provoking soundtrack.As with any review, these are my own opinions, expressed after playing this with my eight year old for twenty minutes, and your mileage may vary.(Final note:  you are prompted to rate the app after the first few times you play and lose - about a 2-minute cycle for us.  Clicking ""remind me later"" lets the app know that you want to be asked to rate the app after EVERY time you play and lose, so, if you like being pestered half to death to rate an app you've only used for about 8 minutes, this is the one for you. Personally, I prefer to have a good hour of experience with something before I rate it, but then again, I don't think I could have stood to play this app any longer than I did, so maybe the dev was anticipating that.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLE5DZ062A15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUGU5DA#wasThisHelpful","RSLE5DZ062A15","A6P34Q7M983DN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6P34Q7M983DN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, please don't be fooled (as I was) by the ""8.5-Inch"" in the name of this device.  This is probably one of the reasons I give it four starts instead of five.  I believed that I was getting the version of this device that is roughly the size of an 8.5x11 piece of paper, which I had seen in a nationwide consumer electronics store that once-upon-a-time catered to people who liked to build their own radios and electronic devices, back when a ham ""wireless"" setup was referred to as a ""shack"" - I am sure you can guess which place I mean.I saw the larger size version of this device there for the same price I paid for the smaller version from this seller (E&B Electronics, fulfilled through Amazon).  I almost returned it for this reason, but the birthday girl's birthday was too close, so I decided to just buck up and keep it, even though the price was higher than expected for the size being smaller than expected.  (FYI, for those of you who, like me, don't already know, the device is measured diagonally, like a TV, so if you want the larger one, you should look for the 10.5"".)Otherwise, the product is nifty.  Its, as others may have said, just a fancy electronic version of that old waxed-board-and-cellophane thing that anyone over the age of forty probably had as a child, where you draw on the cellophane with a little stylus, which makes the cellophane stick to the waxed board, making darker lines where you have drawn, and to erase you lift the cellophane up, peeling the two layers apart.  Well, this is like that.  That's all.  Except you press a button to ""reset"" the image.There is no computer connection (although they DO make one that can hook up to the computer and transfer your valuable notes and sketches, for about four or five times the cost.)But for kids - why bother?  Did we complain back in the day that we couldn't ""save"" our drawings on the wax-board-and-cellophane-thingy?  No.  We just played tic-tac-toe and drew silly pictures and were amused on long car rides.  And the 8-year-old girl for whom this was purchased was THRILLED.  She has been using it to draw, write us notes, compose odes to her stuffed animals (never done this before!), and we can play dots, hangman, etc, in restaurants now without me having to drag my Kindle everywhere I go (hee hee!).The only way this device could have been better as far as my 8-year-old is concerned is if it somehow could convert into a stuffed animal, ha ha!  Highly recommend, but be forewarned about the size, triple check the price**, and understand that what you are getting is just a high tech version of that old waxboard-cellophane thing; if you consider all this, I doubt you'll be disappointed.**Amazon, I am appalled at how ridiculously you have jacked up your prices on many popular items this holiday season - things I've seen at local chain stores for $20 have been listed on Amazon, sold and shipped BY Amazon, for more than twice that! - way to treat your loyal year-round customers, guys.

"I bought this case not only because it seemed to get overall great reviews but also because I liked the name, since my daughter's nickname is Roo (I know, silly reason to buy something). But the price was right, and it looked like a great solution, with the different ways you could fold it and the magnetic on/off cover.Well, it was the perfect case for a couple of months. I would have given it four stars (minus one for just not being QUITE hard enough to really protect the device from a fall, but if you want that kind of protection, get an Otterbox is what I say).  It folded nearly and was useful for propping the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 at a couple of different angles for sticking movies, playing games, or reading.The problems came after a few months, when the case just became  too floppy to hold the device up. Further, the ""spine"" of the Roo Case for so soft and floppy that it didn't stay CLOSED and now it constantly slips open when the device is in a bag or something, turning on the Kindle and draining the batteries.So, long story short, great case for short term use (mine lasted about six months in unusable condition) until you can save up for something sturdier, but this won't last a full year. The ""pleather"" that it is constructed from just gets softer and softer, both on the spine and in the spaces between the firm panels in the front cover (these spaces are sort of like the ""dotted lines"" that are where you fold the case into its few positions).  Well, once the material that connects the stiff panels gets so soft, it obviously will not hold the weight of the device anymore, stiff panels or no.  This is particularly problematic where any two folds in the ""origami-style"" cover intersect, and the area of fabric is larger/wider.  Of course, these intersections are where you need the case to be the STRONGEST, not the floppiest, hence, collapse.  Same with the spine, which causes the cover to slip off in about ten student ways and get crinkled up in the purse or backpack in its own special version of ""origami"", leaving the device on and the screen exposed to damage from keys or whatever else is in the bag.I was surprised, given all the rave reviews, but then, I LOVED mine at first too.  Bottom line:  I would NOT recommend this to a friend (or an enemy even, if I had one) unless they made some serious design changes.  I give two stars simply because it DID work well for a few months, and deserves something for that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKAA4PXAMKYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096T97OG#wasThisHelpful","R1CKAA4PXAMKYN","A6P34Q7M983DN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6P34Q7M983DN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. What a captivating story, told in a unique and beautiful voice!  This book is written in the style of a first-person narrative from a (now grown, and one presumes, old) young girl raised by ""Tasmanian tigers"", long-extinct marsupial dog-like creatures, after being accidentally separated from her parents in the wilderness of Australia.  (Just FYI, Wikipedia has an absolutely essential companion-article on the ""Tasmanian tiger"" that will break the heart of any animal lover or environmentalist who hasn't yet heard the story of this poor misunderstood creature.)I read INTO THAT FOREST non-stop.  I just couldn't put it down!  Even now I am hard pressed to believe that this book is NOT actually a true story - so convincingly and skillfully written was it.  The story managed to be savage and beautiful and sad and joyful and very richly textured, all while being told in the voice of someone with supposedly limited English language skills; the ""under-educated"" dialect takes a few pages to get used to, but it is a big part of what makes the story so REAL.  This kind of writing is not easy to do, but the author pulls it off with tremendous skill.I am very fussy about what I read, and I typically won't even bother finishing (never mind reviewing) a bad book.  This book deserves a place among the great works of modern literature, however.  I will definitely be trying anything else by this author that I can find.  Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25J5P6SW819SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7XTOJQ#wasThisHelpful","R25J5P6SW819SE","A6P34Q7M983DN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6P34Q7M983DN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only reason I felt that I had to dock one star is that there were some overly graphic descriptions that I felt were unnecessary and anxiety-inducing to my tender heart.  I don't KNOW if this excellent story could have been written successfully without those descriptions, but I would like to have seen it tried.(That said, however, I wouldn't anticipate most people immersed in the media of our current age will even really know what I am referring to, so, Potential Reader, please don't let the vagaries of THIS reader's sensitivity deter you from this excellent story.)Again, as in my review of ""Containment"" (Christian Cantrell's superb and unputdownable -- yes, it's a word; I've used it before--  novel), I will not bore the reader of this review with a summary of the story, other than to say that the ending was unexpectedly elegant.  I don't think that gives anything away, do you, Mr. Cantrell?Thank you for another excellent read. Keep writing them and I will keep buying them.

"SummaryGame is cute and original. Object is to ""fix"" broken robots that come in after accidents (a still shot silhouette of an ""accident"" about to happen is shown - no graphic details of friendly robots getting mashed and mangled).  A variety of tools (hammer, pliers, etc) are provided and when selected, an arrow points to the robot ""patient"" wherever you are supposed to apply the tool. Even includes a roll of paper towels for viewing the robot's ""nose"".  A clickable checklist shows you how many of the repair tasks you've completed and what's left to go.ConsMusic is TERRIBLY ANNOYING.  Sound effects (mainly what the robots say as you work on them) are even more annoying:  ""ELECTRIC!"", ""what's that, Doc?"", ""hi, doc!"", ""OUCH! OW!"", ""that's much better"" and maybe two others.  They say these things over and over again, every robot says the same things in almost the same voice (although pitched differently for the ""girl"" (I.e. PINK) robot.= Minus one star for annoying sound track.Gender stereotyping promoted:  ""girl"" robot is pink, and for some reason she is the only one that giggles and acts ticklish.= Minus one star for perpetuating gender stereotypes.Game is very repetitive and provides no real learning or portion item solving opportunities.  Every robot has the exact same ""injuries"" in the same places.  Arrows ALWAYS show you where to hover your tools to ""fix"", so there is no aspect of having to learn or remember or figure out how to use the tools.=Minus one star for being repetitive (same injuries, same fixes, same things each robot says, etc.)  and= Minus one star for not providing any learning or problem-solving opportunities, such as having a setting for getting rid of the arrows that point to where to use the tool so that the child has to remember or figure out what to do.Now that we're down to the obligatory one star that AMAZON awards, here are thePROSGame has simple, clean look AND feel, and very easy interface for little kids. In my opinion, this is a game aimed at a three or four year old age group (preschool set), and I think they would find it simple to use and fun for a while (although screen time should be limited; please don't use electronics to babysit your children for long periods of time).= Plus one star for clean visual design.I experienced no crashing, locking, or freezing up errors on my device (kindle fire HD 8.9) and a clean exit via the back button was fully operational, including a confirmation dialog box for exiting.= Plus one star for no technical problems.Ads are appropriate and not overly intrusive. They appeared to be for other preschool-games by the same developer. A small banner was visible at the top throughout game. Further, an ad-free version with extra features (tools and options for working on and customising your robot) was advertised for $3.99, in this reviewer's opinion about $2 too much, but hey, they've got to eat too.= Plus one star for appropriate advertising (or for not having INAPPROPRIATE advertising, if you'd rather).NOTESI cannot speak to permissions or embedded malware, spyware, adware, or data-mining tools, as I don't know if this app contains anything bad like that, so please do your own assessment before deciding to keep the app.Personally, I will be uninstalling it because it is not appropriate for my child's age, and has no options for making it more interesting or difficult for an older kid who loves robots.Your mileage may vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CI7Q0KX19U8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL0RKYW#wasThisHelpful","R2CI7Q0KX19U8J","A6P34Q7M983DN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6P34Q7M983DN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to thank the author for writing this incredible story. I couldn't put it down. My house went untidied, my hair went unwashed, my dishes went undone - heck, my FOOD went pretty much uneaten - while I devoured this novel instead.  Enough people waste valuable words writing a complete summary (sometimes even spoiling the surprises!) of a book, so I will not even begin to tell you what the story is about except to say that it is, to my mind, TRUE science fiction, in that it actually contains the SCIENCE part of this oft-misused label.This, however, does not bog the story down but elevates the narrative to a level of believability that is not often found in much of the speculative fiction written today. The characters are intense and perfectly drawn, particularly the protagonist, on whom the story is focused.  The world is rich and well-realized; there are good (or good enough) explanations for everything.  Of course, I have no idea whether a biochemist or other expert scientist would agree, but for me, it was just great.  I highly recommend this book, and will be reading anything else the author has on Amazon forthwith. Thank you, Mr. Cantrell, and keep up the good work!And, as an aside, in case this didn't come across above, it's actually WELL WRITTEN, with good grammar and no typos and stuff, as I am very picky about that kind of thing.  :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFDSP1FO2X4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007264H36#wasThisHelpful","R1MFDSP1FO2X4C","A6P34Q7M983DN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6P34Q7M983DN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The first problem, I think, was 4/1, the next was 3+1, and so on, to things like 39-12, and finally to 247/14 or whatever.  Obviously this app is not meant for children to practise their math skills, or it would include the following:- Choice of operand- Choice of difficulty- Choice of answer total (up to 10, 20, 100, 1000, etc.)- Choice of using regrouping or not using regrouping in addition and subtraction- Choice of format (fractions, decimals, etc.)- Choice of number of questions asked- Choice of scoring method- Record and report time spent playing, scores on various operations, and anything else a parent might want to know if they are monitoring their child's educational app time.As I said, the app froze up my device twice and I was not inclined to pursue it further after this, so maybe it does include some of these things, but I could not access the settings menu, so I have no idea.  All in all, if you are looking for an app for your child (elementary school) - look elsewhere.  If you are using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, don't bother - the app doesn't work.

"I've played a lot of these types of games over the years and I've come to realize that though they may seem like time-wasters, there is actually some strategy involved, and it is a great way to improve pattern recognition, quicken reflexes, and, frankly, for me, relax.  Combine your basic ""match 3"" with excellent HD graphics, a simple storyline, and a lot of different modes and options to vary play (tournament mode, free play, adventure, etc) and you have a really good game here.  It's not your basic ""bejeweled"" - there are goals for each level and various configurations, money to earn for power ups, and just more than I even cares to write about.  I was happy to pay to unlock the full game after the trial levels, and I am pretty stingy that way.  I haven't been disappointed yet.

"I received the Idson Silicone Oven Mitts for Barbecue & Kitchen-heat Resistant Grilling Cooking Gloves with BBQ Grill Brush Set for review and these are a great value! The 5 fingered gloves stretch to fit my fairly large hands and are make it easy to handle some of the hottest items in the kitchen or on the grill. They were also the perfect choice for pulling out a strainer from a 3qt pot boiling oil used for french fries and fish and handling large cast iron dutch ovens I use directly over coals.The gloves resist heat very well but when you start feeling heat you should take them off and let them cool a couple seconds as they greatly slow heat transfer but when you start feeling them get warm you can expect they will probably get much warmer. On my large hands they are a snug, yet comfortable fit and were not very difficult to remove and cooled back down very quickly ready to put back on.When working with the hot oil, the gloves did get a little slippery, but generally they offered a good grip on most surfaces.Unlike fabric based gloves, these silicone gloves are very easy to wash in soap and water, you can even send them through the dishwasher. With clean silicone gloves I can directly handle meat that is still on the grill. This works great for a large BBQ roast, ribs, even quickly loading up a large grill cranked up for use at a concession stand with 36 frozen burgers.The grill brush works fine, but the handle is way too short, consider this a freebie included in the set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DAEDEVJVCWKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GYAQOW#wasThisHelpful","R2DAEDEVJVCWKY","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These comfortable Dare Color 6-Pack one-size-fits-most Low Cut Socks which were provided for review are comfortably thin when you want minimal fabric between you and your shoe. While they appear small and fit about a size 7 men without stretching, they do stretch to fit even my size 12 foot without overstitching the seams or elastic. However they are more of a stocking nearly see through when stretched and in addition to use when you just want minimal lining for your feet they also make great liners for blister protection under normal socks when hiking. The material breathes easily and will keep your feet dry and are also perfect for shoes that you may not want to normally wear with socks yet want to reduce the impact of sweating such as crocks or sandals.There is no seam in the toe and this area as well as the heel cup provides some additional protection, the low cut allows for minimal show of the sock with most shoes for a clean look.The 6 pack with a variety of navy, grey, and black colors arrived in a box rather than a display hanger and the box is imprinted on the inside with ""Thank you for your patience""  which seemed unusual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IS9UXV2OAA28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CKH36Y#wasThisHelpful","R1IS9UXV2OAA28","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SmaAcc Waterproof Floating Camera Strap(3-pack) which was provided for review are comfortable and durable neoprene covered foam tube wrist straps for anything you want to keep from sinking. Great for keys, point and shoot, action cameras, even waterproof bluetooth speakers . The bright comfortable wrist strap will keep nearly 2.5lbs at the surface and the durable plastic quick release won't give out accidentally with it large but easy to release squeeze clip.There were no instructions and they arrived in clear plastic with no information. To attach to a device you disconnect the quick release, pass the thin yet very strong ""string"" loop through a retainer on the device and then the quick release back though the loop. Once connected back to the wrist strap the device appears it will stay connected even in the harshest situation like white water, waves, wipe outs, etc.The wrist strap is not water proof and will absorb some water, but retains its full floatation capabilities even when soaked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291NRQV69IWLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF9PP5Q#wasThisHelpful","R291NRQV69IWLQ","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Simply Simily Stainless Steel Water Bottle which was provided for review, is a basic yet durable 9"" tall x 3.125"" wide at base. Rated at 34oz capacity, I found the bottle able to hold a full 36oz still allowing for a small air gap between liquid and cap.This is not a double wall insulated container and the a 8oz durable Stainless Steel container is thermally conductive and will be the same temperature on the outside as the contents.Similarly priced to plastic bottles, this non reactive bottle doesn't impart a taste and is easy to clean. The wall thickness is enough to withstand deformation with a reasonable high amount of pressure and the smooth edge in the screw top provides excellent durability assuring leak free use with no gasket necessary.The plastic lid appears to be a good quality resistant to cracking and the plastic loop retainer is easily removed for cleaning with all parts seeming to be dishwasher safe.The wide opening has a smooth edge which allows for easy cleaning and loading of ice and is comfortable to drink from directly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FERVYUNREKTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS903UM#wasThisHelpful","R3FERVYUNREKTH","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PREMIUM Liquid Chalk Markers provided by Home&Us for review are similar to liquid paint markers. The markers are labeled as Glass Markers and I found them easy to use on nearly any surface, semi permanent (water washable) on porous surfaces such as paper, easy to clean off even when dry on non-porous surfaces such as tile, class, standard chalkboards, chalkboard style labels, etc.The tip is reversible and has a chisel and medium point. When you get the markers the tip is dry, you shake the pen which seems to have a mixing ball inside, then press the tip to prime and start the flow. The liquid drys fairly quickly and isn't very susceptible to unintended smearing. The bright colors look great on dark or light surfaces, although the darker colors look better on white and the lighter better on dark. Overall much better than chalk on a chalkboard and dry erase pens on white boards. The priming action is a little more work to use than a stick of chalk or ready to use marker on whiteboard but the tradeoff is no chemical smell and easy 100% cleanup with no dust and no staining.Home&Us also sells chalkboard style labels which are great for labeling jars or storage containers that may change content from time to time. I would also recommend these for temporary signs such as daily specials, marking up car windows for game day, weddings, birthdays, etc. These are also safe, non toxic, and easy to clean off unintended use by kids including fabric.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKR1247V37RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VXC6O6#wasThisHelpful","R2VKR1247V37RM","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Wigwam Men's 3-Pack Rebel Fusion Crew are quality socks, thick and comfortable, well made with no loose ends.The elastic quality is very good, tight enough to stay up, but not too tight to cut off circulation. These socks breathe well and function as a wicking liner and sock all in one, perfect for hiking yet stylish enough for daily professional wear. The only advantage I can think of using an actual liner would be greater blister protection by assuring friction occurring between layers, but I have not had any hot spots hiking in these socks.Plenty of padding in all the right places, the variable thickness allows for comfortable fit on top with extra support in the heel and arch.The seamless toe construction moves the seam to around the natural gap between your toes and foot which helps protect from getting blisters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7QZOFY1TAZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9Z54X0#wasThisHelpful","R3R7QZOFY1TAZO","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My LuxoLite Headlamp LED - Super Bright CREE Head Flashlight w/ RED Light was provided for review. I have a few of these style headlamps and this set is my current favorite.Unlike other pairs that have a battery holder you have to remove the simple access door on the back of this headlamp allows easy access to the 3 AAA batteries which fit snugly and are easy to replace but last a long time.Packaging is nice enough for giving as a gift with but with little wasteThe headband is strong and easily adjustable, wide enough for no slipping, and thick enough that it should last without loosing its elastic properties.The headlamp allows for 3 click angle positions and the mechanism feels like it should last, 2 buttons provide easy access to white or red light without cycling through bright white to get red. You do have to cycle through bright to get low or flash, but once on in any mode and have been using the next press turns it off without having to cycle.The white light has good even dispersion, with a bright center spot and a good wide field of low level to aid peripheral lighting. You want to be careful about hitting a neighbor in the eyes on bright though.The solid red light is bright enough for looking at close up items, useful when out stargazing or other situations when you need to read, or adjust/find something in the dark without losing night vision.I found the best use of flashing red as a alert while biking, I place the headlamp facing backwards to alert drivers behind of my presence without hitting them with a bright light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3GIMJM9PTTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEKW3KC#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3GIMJM9PTTD","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the [Apple MFi Certified] Skiva PowerSkin IP5C Protective Battery Case (2000mAh) with *Unblocked Lightning & Audio Port* for Fast Charging of iPhone 5c [Model No.: AP107] - 1 Year Warranty & Lifetime Support which was provided at no cost for review and have been very happy with it. For normal daily use it adds a little bulk, almost doubling the weight, but with that adds drop protection. I have dropped many times and although it shows a little wear as any plastic hitting concrete would, it has held up well, protected the phone, and still functions perfectly.The best thing about this case is having an extra battery with you for unplanned emergencies at any time. But other battery packs also provide this, what is unique is the design allows direct access to the lightning port and headphone jack with no obstructions. I needed this as my car audio system requires connection to the lightning data port for full functionality and other battery cases charge only with the microusb cable with the lightning port being locked inside the case always connected to the battery. Plus when it comes time to charge you can charge both the battery and the phone at the same time so recharge time is greatly improved.The camera is unobstructed and volume buttons are easy to use.

"Adams Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is similar to the other monthly Flea and Tick applications but the included and reusable ""Smart Shield Applicator"" is an improvement over the disposable snap and squeeze dispensers as it is easier to control and doesn't plop the entire dose in one spot which leaves a bit of a mess and end up on your hands.  The reusable applicator also parts the fur to get the drops onto your pet's skin and not on your hands.The disposable part you place inside the reusable dispenser is similar to other products and could be used without the Smart Shield applicator, but the disposable dispenser is shaped specifically for the applicator so other products will likely not work well with this applicator.As for the treatment itself, it appears to be the pretty standard formulation:Kills fleas, ticks, flea eggs, and flea larvae.Breaks the flea lifecycle to prevent infestation.Kills and repels mosquitoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8AC2U0D3BGFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HE5N240#wasThisHelpful","R8AC2U0D3BGFI","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Skiva PowerFlow Duo C-3 was provided in consideration for this review.We have way too many devices in the car, this seems to be the place everything is low on battery life, and everybody wants access to a USB port.Until the car manufacturers start throwing in USB power ports like they did cup holders in the 80s this is the solution you need. We have one in the front and one in the back. No matter what anyone plugs in iphones, android or IPad tablets, everything seems to charge as quickly in the car as it does with a wall outlet charger.The build feels sturdy, did not get hot, did not introduce any audio system noise or high pitch from the device itself (a problem I have had with others) and fit well in the vehicles I tested in. The car charger did not slide out over time, the blue light made it easy to confirm it had power, and it was easy to remove when needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GI5K1324FSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N460IA4#wasThisHelpful","R16GI5K1324FSV","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Skiva PowerSkin IP5 Protective Battery Case (2000mAh) was provided in consideration for this review.I had been using other external battery cases for my iPhone 5s to deal with the iPhone's inability to last a full day on one charge. Unfortunately most all battery cases use a microusb port to charge the battery and don't pass anything other than power to the phone. This meant in my car I was unable to use phone features without removing the case.However with the Skiva PowerSkin I am able to access the Unblocked Lightning & Audio Port which allows two improvements over other power cases. I now can use the data, power, and audio features available with a proper lightning cable and I can charge the case at the same time as the phone as the case still charges with its own microusb cable.When it comes time to charge the phone from the battery in the case, I simply slide the lightning cable connector off of the back of the case and plug it into the phone. The short cable is durable and really doesn't get in the way of use. I can leave the cable connected charging while the phone is in my pocket, backpack, and while using it normally with any smartphone features.The camera opening is clear of any obstruction and doesn't cause distortion from shadows or flash reflections. Headphone port is fully accessible, and volume controls are easy to use. The shape and material are comfortable to hold and have a nice tech design look and feel. Battery power is indicated by 4 LED lights giving an approximate percentage power.The case offers good protection for your phone, although the case itself may not survive a drop as well as a soft exterior case. To date the case has survived all my drops so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13I96GA6EUZ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3RUAR8#wasThisHelpful","R13I96GA6EUZ1G","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Skiva AudioFlow BigSound Ultra Loud 15 Watts Portable Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with 8+ Hours of Battery (3000mAh) was provided in consideration for this review.Compact at about than 7.3"" x 2.4"" x 2.75"" and about 1.2lbs the rubberized finish and metal grill holds 2 drivers which delivers a good balance particularly for outdoor use. For its size the bass was reasonable, especially at louder volume levels. At low volumes the bass seems to drop off significantly. Sound was distortion free at full volume with no overdriven lows or highs, very ""listenable"" at full volume.The 15W output is not going to compare to a 100W stereo system, but offers enough volume to enjoy in a noisy outdoor environment. Using indoors at mid volume levels the speaker makes a good choice for background music in a bedroom, kitchen, etc.Three buttons, one for answering calls, + and - ;  tap for FF/Rew, hold for vol +/-And a three position physical switch Off, Bluetooth, Aux input is through a combo micro usb cable included.With a physical power and BT switch that triggers automatic pairing, I found it difficult to switch paired devices and the physical power switch left me with a dead speaker when accidently left on for a couple days.Overall a good value balance for price, performance, features, and volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EEGJQEO0WLAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RI9L514#wasThisHelpful","R2EEGJQEO0WLAT","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I did not insert the Lexar S35 all the way quickly, it seemed to handshake USB 2.0 and I would get the USB 2.0 speed on the USB 3.0 port even after inserting all the way. There seemed to be two stages of secure connection and if I hesitated any on the first stop it would not transfer at the high speeds.When closed, the S35 is smaller than 1"" x 2"" x 0.5"" when rotated to open the USB connector slides out as it rotates and extends the length from 2"" to 2.5""The colored plastic outer case can flex and if when you rotate it is possible to create a bind where the USB connector will not extend.My old USB dongle has a metal outer case that it rotates in and I much prefer the durability of the metal case although with the MUCH faster transfer rates, I will be using the new S35.There is a small hole and a 2"" long string lanyard with a small metal loop on the other end for attaching the JumpDrive to a keyring. simple push the string through the hole then pass the ring through the loop to secure.The JumpDrive includes EncryptStick ""lite"" with an option to upgrade to the full version which shows regular $40 and discounted to $13 as of this writing. It is not clear to me what features are added with the upgrade other than stronger encryption. EncryptStick was easy to use, could run off the JumpDrive and which made it easy to use on multiple devices. with encryptstick you must enter a password to unlock the drive files that are stored in the encryptstick vault. A nice feature is that the vault is sized dynamically so you don't have to decide when you start how much of the JumpDrive to set aside for the encrypted data.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3OWBFKVMGWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5V62VW#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3OWBFKVMGWD","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are videos for each session, monthly quizzes and more practice tests. Online access is only good for one year beyond registration and the registration process validates your purchase of the book by having you get a word from a chapter, section, paragraph in the book.Mobile was a complete fail. They promise an app, the online registration has a link to install the app, but it is not in the Apple Store. When I contacted them they said it is not available and they explained the mobile was intended to mean the PDF version of the book.Well the PDF was a fail too.

"The Tomcat Live Catch Mouse Trap is a easy to use mousetrap that can safely be used anywhere you have the space for it.When set the trap takes a space of about 8"" long, 2"" wide, and about 2.5"" high.To use you remove a small bait door and place drops or other bait to lure the mouse down the tunnel. You then open the trap door which acts as legs holding the trap in position. When the mouse enters it causes the tube to lift the legs which closes the trap door. If the mouse tries to push the trap door open, it can not for several reasons. The legs snap locked and you must pull them apart to open, and unless a cat or other mouse knocks the trap over the legs are under the trap which much be lifted to open the door.As long as you don't wait too long (mice won't live long trapped) you can safely release the mouse outdoor without any danger of coming in contact with the mouse by snapping the trap door back open and dumping the mouse out.If you waited to long and the mouse has expired, the durable plastic is smooth and easy to clean with soap and water, although the odor of a dead mouse is a bit difficult to remove. (my experience). Another problem if you leave them in too long, they could chew their way out. So far I have not had this happen in this trap but eventually all my plastic no kill traps end up with holes in them. I even had a shock killer trap that apparently just knocked out a mouse who eventually came too and destroyed the trap. But that is another review...The trap must be used on a smooth surface ir the legs may catch and not allow the door to shut. so you will need to place on something smooth if used on rough concrete, carpet, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390FUK263V9AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X7VM6G#wasThisHelpful","R390FUK263V9AR","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for NUMI Organic Tea Capsules, Jasmine Green, 16 CountNumi describes the Jasmine Green as ""Fragrant Flowers are laid atop organic green tea leaves as their scent is naturally embraced. Scented three times, this smooth green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight""The tea brews up a pale orange color, similar, but less intense to the color of the K-Cup lid. With slight hints of a floral note, the tea is primarily a natural green tea that is easy to drink, is not bitter, and can be easily consumed with no sweetener added.After brewing the tea leaves are a vibrant green and appear to be a good quality with mostly larger fannings.The cup is said to be recyclable but there is no tab for easy removal of the lid or fiber basket. Removing the cup is difficult and the mesh basket appears to be fused to the plastic.

When I plugged it in to charge the battery pack, it showed nearly a full charge yet it would not turn on to charge my device. After reading other reviews let me repeat for those reading here the solution.***** Turn on by sliding your finger across the touch pad from the left Unlock icon towards the right Lock icon with a LIGHT touch *****It wasn't the direction that was causing me the trouble, it was using a light touch.I apparently was pressing too hard which initially seemed to not have any effect. Interestingly enough after getting the hang of it I can not do it wrong now even if I try and it is super easy to use. With a touch pad control you don't have to worry about accidental powering on, but even then the unit will power down if not actively charging.There are so many great features with this battery pack it is hard to say which is best. But I have to same the form factor makes it great for travel. It fits in the same backpack compartment as my tablet, it easily slides in the side of my camera bag, and in use lays flat under my device.The unit has two input micro usb connectors for faster charging, although one works just fine. There are also two USB power ports, one seems to operate at 1A and the other at 2A but they are not labeled and the manual indicates 5V 6A  (3A, 3A)  output. For my use as a backup battery both ports worked fine and provided the power needed to recharge any 2 devices simultaneously from the 15,000mAh battery. I have used the Powervault to recharge tablets, phones, and cameras. All seem to charge at about the same rate as any other charging source I have used.Like most other external battery packs, the unit will not pass through a charge. If it is plugged into a power source, any device plugged into it will not be charged until the power source is removed.The design and finish is really upscale. The textured finish has a leather look with no fingerprints and the gold trim conveys the premium quality and can be used in any setting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSEC6IZXEFUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUTYUH0#wasThisHelpful","R2QSEC6IZXEFUU","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Alpha Grillers Best Garlic Press And Peeler - Solid Stainless Steel Mincer And Silicone Tube Roller - Crush Ginger was provided for review.This arrived just in time, I was really getting tired of my previous garlic press, and the Alpha Grillers surpasses my expectations.Not a big deal for me but the fabric lined box makes a nice presentation as a gift.The press is super easy to use, you can mince garlic in the peel or for a little better result use the included silicone tube peeler for quick, clean peeling with no garlic smell from peeling by hand, or knife cleanup using a smash and peel method. My only negative is the silicone tube had a bit of flashing on the outside from manufacturing, but it was easy enough to remove.The fit and finish on the press is superb, the hinge action is smooth with no wobble and the shiny chrome finish is easy to clean with a quick rinse or in the dishwasher. All the smashed garlic was expelled out the mincing holes, no leaking out the sides and the flip out mincer stays connected so there is nothing to lose while providing easy to access for thorough cleaning.Mincing ginger takes a little more pressure than garlic, but it works just as well. In either case the flush bottom of the press makes it easy to slide your knife along the bottom edge and remove all the minced pieces and juices. You no longer have any excuse to not use fresh garlic or ginger for your sauté, stir fry, soup, stew, marinade, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4FN80G8CCXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I937QEI#wasThisHelpful","R2G4FN80G8CCXN","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The base is a shiny black plastic with a similar steel base and plugs into a removable power cord that has a low voltage transformer 1'5""x2"" that connects to the wall outlet on the end of a 5"" cord.When operating the motor has a smooth sound that is not very loud and steadily removes the cork in less than 8 seconds. then another 8 seconds to eject the cork using the motor in reverse.While this may be overkill for some that find the task of opening a bottle of wine to not be very difficult, if you have trouble with manual openers then consider this upgrade as it is certainly effortless.I would like to see a better foil remover included. The one that fits in the base is a single piece of squared edge plastic side hinge with two solid blades. It is not very comfortable to hold, is a little small for my hands, and take a bit of effort to squeeze and hold properly as it scrapes around the bottle. I prefer a roller blade style that glides smoothly around the bottle with a larger rounder shape to hold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76NCJDMK68LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUFSSSU#wasThisHelpful","R76NCJDMK68LH","A17UNMURMLX0ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17UNMURMLX0ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doctor's Best Estrog-100 Nutritional Supplement, 30 Count seems to help and no noticeable side effects. at 50 a day it is not too expensive to try.The capsules are a little large but they contain a powder that is easy to take when added to food, drink, smoothie. The powder has a bit of a bittersweet chocolate flavor with a hint of green (grassy) essence.

"The is nothing wrong with the Victor Mini M754SN Rodent Repeller with Nightlight, 4-Pack - as far as I can tell...Night light is nice, you know it has power and you have some light in a dark room.Ultrasonic and nobody can hear it, even though I have some in my family that can hear high pitched sounds I can not. Had to buy a new TV once because someone said it made a terrible noise that I could not hear.I have several traps and poison bait stations around and over time I have seen less and less activity.

"An emotional, sweet, and absolutely fantastic romance, Sins of a Duke was an excellent read. I really loved this book. It had likable characters, a great story, and a lovely romance.Constance was great. She knew when to go after what she wanted but also refused to let herself be a doormat. She judged a person by merit rather than rumor and knew when it was time to forgive. She was lively, kind, and a really likable heroine.Lucan was interesting. At first, I was worried that he would come off as unlikable because he was using an innocent woman as a means for revenge. But, it quickly became clear that he had more of a conscience than he admitted to. His desire for revenge stemmed from the guilt he felt from being unable to protect his sister and, in the end, it wasn't in him to truly hurt someone. He showed that he could be very sweet and was willing to fight for the woman he loved, even if that meant just waiting for her forgiveness. I thought he was wonderful.The romance was perfect. Constance and Lucan were lovely together. They were such a sweet couple and an equal one. Constance knew when to let Lucan squirm for what he had done but knew that, when an apology was as heartfelt as the one Lucan gave, it was time to forgive. No melodramatics, thank goodness. And, they definitely had chemistry together that smoldered at their every meeting.The plot moved quickly and kept me hooked right from the start. The story was wonderful and the ending was perfect.Sins of a Duke was a delightful historical romance that I absolutely loved. It was wonderfully sweet, romantic and emotional. Everything about it was just perfect.

"A lovely romance and a wonderful continuation of the Notorious Flynns series, The Scoundrel's Lover was an enjoyable read. With passionate characters and a great story, this book was great and I liked it.Annabelle was a heroine who definitely had a will of her own. When she decided she wanted something, she went after it with everything in her. Sometimes, that was annoying, like with her insistence that she wanted to marry a proper husband rather than a man she would be happy with. It was annoying that she kept complaining about how she had to want the man she couldn't have when the only reason she couldn't have him was because she was set on a proper marriage. But, when she finally realized the mistake she made, she went after love and made amends for unintentionally hurting Marcus. So, in the end, I was fine with her.Marcus was amazing. He was definitely a survivor who had made something of himself that he could be proud of. He was protective and caring of Annabelle and just absolutely adorable in general. I just loved him.The romance was great. It was obvious that Annabelle and Marcus cared about each other from the start and it didn't take long for that to become love. Annabelle's issues made it a bit frustrating at some points, but I still liked them together. And the chemistry between them was super hot with scenes steamy enough to make you fan your face.The plot was fast paced and I was able to stay interested all the way through. Other than my issue with Annabelle, I really liked the story and the ending was great. I'm excited to read Crispin's story in the next book.The Scoundrel's Lover was a really lovely romance and I liked it.

"The Darkest London series continues with another fantastic book. Soulbound was dark, thrilling, and wonderfully romantic. I loved this book and I thought it was an excellent read.Eliza was a heroine who wanted nothing more than the freedom to make what she wanted of her life. She was strong, often stubborn, but also smart enough to know what to do in just about any situation. She had her flaws, sharp tongue included, but that made her seem like a more real character. I really liked her.Adam was wonderful. Like Eliza, he had his flaws, namely his impulsive actions in trying to claim Eliza in a way that was guaranteed to make her run. But, he was also very protective of his GIM, whom he considered his children, and determined to make Eliza love him. He came off as gruff, but he was really sweet. I thought he was great.The romance  definitely came off to a tumultuous start. But, once they were able to get to know each other beyond Adam's desperation and Eliza's suspicion, they were clearly perfect together. And they definitely had chemistry that sent more than a few sparks flying.The plot was fast paced and had me hooked from page 1. As with every book in this series, there were twists, thrills, and plenty of surprises along the way. The story was wonderfully dark and the ending was great.

"A lovely second chance romance that I thought was sweet, Lady Vice was a great historical romance and I really liked it.Lavinia was okay. On the good side, she was strong and resilient enough to survive whatever situation faced her. On the bad side, I found myself getting frequently frustrated with her apparent determination to think the worst of Max, even though he never gave her a reason to think that way. It was especially frustrating because she berated him for not trusting her but was clearly unable to trust the best in him. So, that got on my nerves and brought down the book a bit for me. But, overall, I was fine with Lavinia's character. She just wasn't really my favorite heroine.Max, on the other hand, was perfection. He was so sweet, so devoted to Lavinia and determined to prove himself worthy of her trust. He had made a name for himself, facing some real danger along the way, and he still remained humble and kind. I just adored him.The romance was sweet. I thought Lavinia and Max were great together. It was clear that, despite the years apart, they loved each other as much as ever.The plot was good, well paced enough to keep me engaged all the way through. There was kind of a mystery involved, but it wasn't much of one considering there was only one suspect at the start who turned out to be the culprit. But, it was a surprise to see how crazy this person was. Overall, I enjoyed the story and the ending was sweet.Lady Vice was a lovely historical romance and I enjoyed reading it.

"With plenty of thrills, secrets, and lovely romance, Of Silk and Steam was a fantastic steampunk romance. It had engaging characters, plots and betrayals, and I really enjoyed all of it.Mina was a great heroine. She was very strong, clever, and loyal to those she cared about. It definitely wouldn't do to underestimate her. My only issue was that I got vaguely frustrated at how she was unable to let herself trust Leo. He had proven himself her match and earned her trust but she still held on to hesitance. I understood her reasoning, but I was also somewhat annoyed. But, other than that, I really liked her.Leo was wonderful. He knew and loved Mina exactly as she was and he strong and smart enough to be able to keep up with her. He was also sweet, compassionate, and just overall adorable. I really liked him as well.The romance was lovely. Mina and Leo were perfect together.

"A sweet historical romance, Miss Winters Proposes was a lovely read. Not particularly memorable, but an enjoyable romance that I liked.Both characters were likable. There wasn't anything special about either, but I found Juliet to be determined and Benjamin to be sweet when he wasn't trying to push people away. So, I was fine with them both.The romance was okay. I wish there had been more of a transition from Juliet and Benjamin being strangers to being in love. As it was, we missed the whole falling in love with each other part. Also, I wish that they had actually tried to fight for each other more, rather than just being to scared to change the original terms of their marriage and running away at the first conflict. Despite these issues, though, I did think they were good together.The plot moved quickly and I was kept interested all the way through.

"An absolutely amazing YA read, filled with magic, thrills, secrets, and sweet romance, The Storyspinner was a brilliant read. I LOVED this book! It was a beautifully written, fantastic YA tale of epic proportions and I loved every bit of it.The way the story was told was interesting. It was different, but it really worked for the book. Two separate story lines are told concurrently, until they converge near the end of the book. On one side was Johanna and Rafael and their lives in the human world, while the magic-wielding Keepers were on the other side, trying to find the lost princess to restore balance to their worlds. Meanwhile, the point of view shifted between each of the five main characters, plus a couple of scenes from another's perspective. Normally, I would find this annoying, but it was very well done in this book. The transition between characters flowed and I never got confused about whose head I was in. All of this worked really well for the book and, along with the beautiful prose, I thought it was all very well written.The main human characters (Johanna and Rafael) were both great. Johanna was strong, clever, and very protective of her brothers. I thought she was just lovely and I really liked her. Rafael seems cold and distant on the surface, but it doesn't take long to realize that he was a very honorable person who was extremely dedicated to his people and super sweet when he wanted to be. He was wonderful and I totally adored him.The romance with these two was so sweet. It progressed naturally, which I appreciated. They were perfect together. Though after a certain revelation near the end of the book, I wonder if (and how) their relationship will change. We'll see...The Keepers (there were three of them) were also great. Jacare was very honorable and determined to do what was best for everyone, in both worlds. Pira was strong and very independent, though she could sometimes cross the line into a shrew, acting rude and judgmental . Leao was very sweet. But, be careful not to underestimate him. He might seem naive and innocent, but he was also a force to be reckoned with. I thought all three of them were wonderful characters.There was a light romance between Pira and Leao. It developed slowly, due to Pira's bull-headedness, but I'm interested to see where their relationship goes.The plot was fast paced and I was totally hooked the entire way through. There were plenty of thrills to keep me on the edge of my seat, along with secrets and political games. And, the atmosphere of the characters' world really drew me in. I loved the story and the ending has me itching to get my hands on book 2. Can't wait to read it!The Storyspinner was a brilliant YA read. I absolutely LOVED this book!

"An utterly charming and delightful historical romance, Wicked, My Love was a wonderful read. With sparkling wit, lively humor, and a lovely romance, this book was fantastic and I absolutely loved it.Isabella was a lovely heroine. Scary smart and defiantly independent, she was definitely no shrinking flower. Until she was put amongst people and her social awkwardness revealed itself. She was likable in her flaws and I thought she was a great character.Randall was such a charmer. He could wrap someone around his fingers with a few well-thought out words and charm the whole of society to adore him. Except for Isabella, who was too knowledgeable of his tricks. But, past that, he was smarter than he was given credit for and he truly wanted to help people with his political career, rather than be a pretty puppet. He was also sweet, kind, and just an overall adorable character who I really liked.The romance was well done. Isabella and Randall had known and hated each other since they were children. But, it didn't take much for all that energy to change to lust and for them to realize how much they cared about each other without the habit of animosity. They both understood and accepted each other, flaws and all. Not to mention that the chemistry between them was steamy and definitely turned the heat up. I thought they were great together.I had two small issues with the book. 1) The pace was slow in some places. Not enough to be boring, but enough that it was a noticeable change. And, 2) it was somewhat frustrating how tightly Isabella clung to her old hatred. I understood her reasoning, but I also wanted to shake some sense into her. However, these were both very minor issues and I still loved the book despite them.Other than the aforementioned few places along the plot that slowed down, most of the story moved quickly and kept me fully engaged. The humor in this book was delightful and had me full on smiling more than once. I really liked the story and the ending was simply lovely.Wicked, My Love was a dazzlingly lovely, sweetly romantic book that I really liked. It was a fun, enjoyable read.

"The best compliment I can give a book was that it was different and unique enough to surprise me. Waiting for April was able to do just that. Beautifully romantic, packed with secrets and twists, this book was brilliant. It took the used-before concept on reincarnation and made it into a new story that had me absorbed from page 1. I absolutely loved this book.April was a great heroine. She wasn't perfect. She had flaws and made mistakes but, at the end of the day, she was kind, determined, and admitted to her mistakes. I thought she was lovely.I absolutely adored Scott. He was so purely devoted to April. To him, her happiness was of the utmost importance, even if that meant stepping aside and letting her live her own life. He had been through a lot in the years he repeatedly lost and found April and that made him a deep and easily sympathetic character. Not to mention he was totally swoon-worthy and so sweet. I just loved him.The romance was a delight. Things started off rocky but there was never a doubt that April and Scott loved each other, even before April knew the truth of her past. They were the type of couple who would die for each other or wait for each other, whatever needed to be done so that they could be together. And, there was some seriously hot chemistry between these two. Let's just say they couldn't keep their hands off of each other. I thought they were perfect together.The plot moved quickly, keeping me hooked right from the start. There were a few twists along the way, along with some secrets that took me by surprise. I loved the story and the ending just about shattered my heart. There had better be a sequel because there is so much more of the story to tell and my heart can't accept the ending as it is.

"A sweet YA romance that was different enough to be truly memorable, I Remember You was a fantastic read. I really liked this book. It had sweet romance, as well as a few surprises in store, and I thought it was excellent.Juliet was a great heroine. She started out narrow in her way of thinking but she slowly became more accepting and, consequently, more mature and ultimately more likable. I really liked her character.Lucas was interesting. The whole question of why he had certain memories that hadn't happened yet was an engaging mystery. The reason why definitely took me by surprise. But, past that, he was also super sweet and totally adorable. I really liked him as well.The romance was great. The future memory thing added a deeper element to it, with Lucas already knowing how much he would love Juliet when they met. It made the nature if their relationship intense. The romance took a few unexpected turns along the way. Did it end well? You'll have to read to find out :)My only issue with the book was that Rosemary, Julie's friend, annoyed me. She was somewhat cold and cynical in her way of thinking and I didn't like the cruel way she led Dex (a sweet guy who liked her) along. It also made me annoyed with Juliet for not calling her friend out on her behavior. So, that brought down the book a bit.The plot moved quickly, keeping me hooked from page 1.

"Wow. This book was one hell of a ride. With constant twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, Red Queen was an amazing YA fantasy. This book managed to take me by surprise more than once and had me completely hooked. I absolutely LOVED it!Mare was an amazing heroine. She had a lot of growth, just within this one book. She started off with a strict view of the world, always sure that she was right. But, as the book went on and so many secrets were revealed, so many games were played, and she started to realize that nothing was as it seemed and the black and white view of the world she had didn't allow for all those shades of gray. And, throughout all that, she was consistently a strong character who did everything she could to not only survive, but protect her loved ones and make a difference. She was an excellent character and I can't wait to see how things go for her in book 2.The two princes, Cal and Maven, were both interesting character. They were both complex and hid quite a few secrets. And those secrets meant that their roles changed as more and more of them were revealed, all the way until a huge betrayal that set the stage and totally blew me away. They each had their own motives and things with them weren't so easily split into ""good"" and ""bad."" I can't say more without giving too much away, but I thought they were both delightfully enigmatic characters.The romance in this book was light. The focus was on the political games at play. It did, however, play a role in the story and add another element to the manipulations that were pulling everyone's strings. Though after that ending, things are looking dark in the romance department. I'm excited to see how it plays out, or if it even does, in the next book.The plot was fast paced and I was utterly riveted the entire way through. The political intrigue, secrets, manipulations, and betrayals kept things unpredictable. With all the twists and turns and unexpected surprises, I was totally one the edge of my seat. And the final betrayal that was revealed left me reeling and completely changed the game. I loved the story and the ending has me itching to get my hands on book 2. I can't wait to see what happens next!Red Queen was a brilliant YA fantasy that I absolutely loved. It was thrilling and unpredictable, complete with twists, secrets, and shocking betrayals. And I enjoyed every bit of it. YA lovers, this book is a must read.*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WBEXU9OZ0IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062310631#wasThisHelpful","R6WBEXU9OZ0IV","AL0LTL9QRB3KY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL0LTL9QRB3KY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An enchanting sequel full of magic and romance, All That Burns was a lovely YA fantasy. It had a few twists, a great tie in with Camelot, and it was definitely as good as the first. I absolutely loved this book.My favorite part of the book was how the history and characters of Camelot were tied in. Maybe it's because I just finished watching ""Merlin"" but I've been fond of the story lately and it was nice seeing it worked into this book.Emrys was great in this book. After giving up her magic to be with Richard, she was facing the consequences of that. Those consequences weren't sugar-coated. She struggled with the changes and had moments where she missed her magic and wondered at the wisdom of her choice. That struggle made her an interesting character and ultimately made her resolve stronger. She proved that she was tough with or without magic. She was already a great character and, in this book, she was even better.Richard was still absolutely adorable. He wasn't in this book as much as the last one because he and Emrys were both dealing with their respective crises. But, he showed how loyal he was to Emrys and how much he would do for her and he was as sweet as ever.The romance was lovely. Emrys and Richard were both so devoted to each other and building a world where mortals and fae could live together. They were a perfect couple.The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. There were plenty of twists and unexpected surprises that kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved the story and the ending was lovely.All That Burns was a fantastic YA fantasy read that I really loved. It was a lovely sequel and I really enjoyed it.

"I really liked this one. Charming, sweet, and delightfully romantic, The Spinster Bride was a wonderful read that I really liked. It had moments of humor, suspense, and sweetness and I loved every bit of it.Marjorie was a lovely heroine. A kind, friendly-to-everyone type of person. But, she was also sick of following her mother's rules, particularly when it came to her future happiness. So, we also saw how determined she could be when she set her mind to something. I thought she was a great character and I really liked her.Charles was adorable. He was a sweet, genuinely kind, charming, and wicked when the time called for it. I loved how sweet he was not only with Marjorie, but with her brother, who I'll get to later. He was just perfect and I really liked him as well.The romance was wonderful. I was a bit worried that I would get frustrated with the character, as I sometimes do in situations where one is trying to match-make the other. But, in this case, it worked very well. Even while they were on a bride search, Marjorie and Charles grew closer and they didn't try to hide their feelings. And, when they decided that being together was worth the obstacles that they would have to overcome, nothing would keep them apart. I thought they were great together.Marjorie's brother and mother played an important role in the book as well. Her brother had something along the lines of Asperger's syndrome, if I'm reading it correctly and Marjorie was very protective over him, particularly because of how harshly her mother treated the odd young man. I really liked his sweet, not-a-mean-bone-in-his-body character and the fact that Marjorie and even Charles were so protective of him made me like them both that much more.Marjorie's mother, though, was a whole other story. She was mean at first and I flat-out didn't like her. When we started getting chapters that flashed back to her earlier life, I wasn't much a fan. But, as the book went on, those chapters allowed me to see why she was the way she was. And, in the end, when she had a moment of realization about what was really important, those looks into her life made me understand her more. So, in the end, I thought she was, if not a character I could really like, at least one I found interesting.The plot moved quickly and kept me hooked all the way through. There were a couple of surprises along the way, but it was really the character development that kept things going. I really liked the story and I thought the ending was perfect.The Spinster Bride was a fantastic, truly excellent historical romance that I loved from start to finish. It was charming, with both fun and serious moments, romantic, and genuinely enjoyable.

"Earls Just Want to Have Fun was a lovely historical romance. Sweet and with a delightful couple of characters, it was a fantastic read and I really liked it.Marlowe was a great heroine. She was definitely different than the mold, having been raised on the streets as a thief. She was clever, tough, and unimpressed by wealth and titles. She was definitely a fun heroine, with her entertaining reactions to the life of the aristocracy. I thought she was lovely.Dane was, to be honest, totally stuffy and pompous at first. But, over the course of the book, Marlowe's influence opened his eyes to the realities of the world. He loosened up and became a more accepting type of person. And, through it all, he was always a kind, honorable man who had his sweet moments. He was a wonderful hero.The romance was lovely. Marlowe and Dane were an odd couple, with their different backgrounds, but they were perfectly matched. And, they definitely had a ton of chemistry that turned the heat up.

"I really enjoyed Temptation Has Green Eyes. It was a nice read, though not perfect, with a strong heroine, intriguing secrets, and good romance. I thought it was a sweet read.Let me start with what I liked:Sophia was awesome. This lady was smart, strong, and certainly tougher than people assumed her to be. She was the best part of the book for sure and I thought she was just wonderful.Max, when he wasn't letting his cynicism overtake him, could be very sweet. He was clever enough to match up with Sophia and caring of his loved ones.Now, to what I didn't like, which was a few minor issues that became enough to bring the book down.First, sometimes, Max could be so frustrating. He let himself cling to suspicions and act like an idiot, while Sophia was trying to navigate her new life on her own. It wasn't until the very end that he managed to scrape together enough trust to change that. So, that was annoying.Second, the romance was honestly not what I hoped it would be. It didn't get much of an actual relationship with them. It was mostly them going between acting distantly to not being able to keep their hands off of each other. There was no in between until near the end. Now, I still thought they were well matched and, when someone (Max) wasn't specifically trying to distance them, they were sweet together. And, they definitely had chemistry. However, it just wan't as deep of a relationship as I hoped it would be.Last, the whole secret thing. On one hand, I really liked how Sophia handled it and the secret itself was intriguing. However, it was somewhat of a letdown that the entire book was spent building up to the moment of revelation and that moment was almost anticlimactic. What saved it for me, though, was how much of a badass Sophia was when she refused to fall in to another person's game.These issues brought the book down, but I was still able to enjoy it overall. It wasn't a perfect read, but it was a perfectly nice one.Temptation Has Green Eyes was a good historical romance. Despite any issues I had, I still enjoyed the story.

"An interesting YA read with a really cool premise, Soulprint was an enjoyable read. I really liked the whole idea of soul identification and it turned out to be a lovely story.Alina was a fantastic heroine. She was definitely easy to sympathize for, having had her freedom taken away and being constantly judged for a past life she had no control over. It seemed like to matter what she did, her past life affected how people treated her (well, most people). But, despite that, she was strong, smart, and determined to find freedom. I really liked her.Cameron was good as well. He had a bad past of his own that he was judged by (though in his present life, not his past), so he understood Alina more than most people could. I wish there had been a little more depth to his character, but I still thought he was sweet and likable.The romanced was light, but sweet and I thought Alina and Cameron were great together.The plot was okay, though definitely slow in some places. The first half was only mildly interesting and it wasn't until the second half, when secrets started coming into light, that I was really drawn in. Those secrets definitely took me by surprise and really brought the book up for me. I enjoyed the story and the ending was great. It wrapped a few thing up, but left room for a sequel, should there be one.Soulprint was a great YA read that I really enjoyed.

"An absolutely epic conclusion to a fantastic series, Shadow of the War Machine was simply amazing. With lovely romance, shocking secrets, unexpected twists, and enough thrills to keep me on the edge of my seat, this book was wonderful and I absolutely loved it!Meg once again proved how strong of a heroine she was. Even in the direst situations, she wouldn't admit defeat. She was tough, clever, and had grown into an admirable character that I really liked.After Will having been absent for most of book 2, I was happy to see more of his in this book. He was just wonderful. He was clever, resilient and a more worthy man than he believed himself to be. Not to mention he was so sweet and devoted to Meg. I absolutely adored him.The romance was lovely. With Meg and Will together, it was clear to see how much they cared for each other, even if it meant having to wait to truly be together. They were a perfect couple.The plot was fast paced and I was completely hooked the entire way through. There were so many twists along the way, tons of thrills, and plenty of surprises. The reveal of who the culprit behind all the threats took me by surprise, especially with how it connected to Meg's family.

"A Most Improper Proposal was a nice historical romance. It was a quick, sweet read and I enjoyed reading it.Isabella was a good heroine. She was loyal to her loved ones and, despite a few outlying circumstances, did her best not to judge anyone until she got the full story. My only issue with her was that I wish she would have lightened up on the whole 'poor me' attitude. After so many pity parties, it got old and somewhat annoying. But, overall, I was fine with her.James was great. He was sweet and the first to admit when he had made a mistake. He wasn't the most memorable character, but I liked him just fine.The romance was a little iffy for me. On one had, I thought Isabella and James were very sweet together. They didn't bother to deny their feelings for each other and those feelings were never in doubt. However, I got little sense of an actual relationship between them. Most of their relationship was them thinking about each other rather than actually interacting, if that makes any sense. So I didn't get to see how they were as a couple. It went from them barely knowing each other, to each other them constantly thinking about the other without much transition or any interaction that would have indicated getting to know each other. So, I was okay with the romance, but it wasn't my favorite.The plot moved quickly and managed to keep me interested all the way through. I did enjoy the story and I liked the ending.A Most Improper Proposal was a good historical romance that I liked. It wasn't particularly great, but it was a nice read.

"An overall sweet, witty, and entertaining read, The Duke's Guide to Correct Behavior was a good romance. It wasn't perfect, but I did like it was a lovely book and I ended up liking it.Lily was a good heroine. She had made her own way in life and was a strong character. There really isn't much to say about her, other than that she was a likable character.Marcus was surprisingly sweet. I loved how caring he was for his daughter and how taking responsibility for her made him strive to be a better man. And, when he knew what he wanted, there was nothing that would stop him from chasing after it. I thought he was adorable.The romance was sweet. Lily and Marcus were great together. I liked how they both had the same sense of humor and often shared private jokes. It was really cute. And, they definitely had chemistry from the moment they met. I thought they were a lovely couple.I liked how Rose was her own character. She was a little sweetie and I liked her character.There are a couple of things that I didn't like about the book. 1) The writing was just clunky in some places. I've read books by this author before and, though this book had the same wit, it didn't flow as well as her other books have. There were several times where I had to reread a sentence because the meaning didn't come across clearly. 2) It seemed like the whole ""big bad duke"" thing was there for about the first 5 pages and it wasn't a part of the book after that. The first scene of the book is of Marcus lounging around after a debauched party, but then Rose showed up and he cleaned up his act fast. And, he didn't even resemble a careless rake after that. It's not that I didn't appreciate that he was determined to fix up his life for his daughter's sake. It was that his rakish reputation kept being mentioned, but I didn't really see that in his actions. But, despite these issues, I did still like the book.The plot moved quickly and I was kept entertained the entire way through. There was a lot of wit and humor that just make this book fun to read, much like this author's other books.

"A highlander romance that I enjoyed, Black Raven's Lady was a lovely read. It had its flaws, but it was a great romance.Raine was a likable heroine. Strong-willed and clever, she was definitely a force to be reckoned with. She could be frustratingly impulsive but, in general, she was a lovely character.Keir was good as well. He put on a gruff face but he was really quite sweet. I liked him as well.The romance was good. Keir had had feelings for Raine for a while but thought she deserved better and didn't act on them, while Raine finally realized that she felt more for him than exasperation. They were sweet together and definitely had chemistry.I had a few minor problems with the book. First, I wish that I had seen more of Raine actually realizing the good qualities that Keir had and falling for him based on those. As it was, her feelings only flipped when she thought they had been spelled together by faeries. It took down the book a bit because I didn't get a sense that she loved him for him. Second, both of the issues that Raine and Keir had with their parents were a bit odd. Raine thought that a man she saw in a vision with her mother was her birth father and Keir believed the rumors that his father had kidnapped and raped his mother. It was strange because both issues could easily have been resolved if Raine an Keir had actually asked their mothers about it. They had their reasons but I just didn't buy them completely. These issues did bring the book down for me. I still liked it but I just didn't love it.The plot moved steadily and I was kept interested the entire way through.

"A wonderfully romantic, sweetly emotional historical romance, Dare to Love was a brilliant read that I absolutely loved. I expected a standard rake/wallflower romance going into it, but it turned out to be more than that and I really enjoyed it.Nivea was a wonderful heroine. She was definitely outside of the mold. Heavy-set, somewhat plain and too sweet to trade sharp set downs with the rest of the nobles, she was a different type of heroine. And, that's what made her a more memorable character. She was a genuinely kind, loving person who could bring love to a man stubbornly opposed to love. I thought she was just lovely and I really liked her.To be honest, Dare was a complete ass at first. He was so repelled by the idea of love that he often said hurtful things and pushed people away. After hearing about his family life and how they twisted love into something hateful, it become much more understandable. But, that wasn't what sold me on him. What really made me like him was that he changed over the course of the book. After letting himself trust Nivea, he realized that he had been wrong about love. Not only did he apologize for his behavior, he did his best to make up for it. He proved that, without the shackles of his past, he could be a very sweet and kind man who was a worthy hero. I thought he was wonderful.The romance was great. Nivea had loved Dare for a long while, seeing the good qualities in him that he tried to keep hidden. Dare, on the other hand, started off as dismissive toward Nivea. But, as he learned what more there was to her, he slowly fell for her as well.

"A darker historical romance full of secrets and manipulations, Never Judge a Lady by Her Cover was definitely an enjoyable read. With its romance and schemes, it was definitely a really great book.Georgiana was certainly a strong heroine. She had power over some of the most powerful men in the country and she wasn't afraid to use it. But, besides that, she was also very loyal to the people she cared about and determined to be a better mother to her daughter. My only issue with her was that she had a slightly annoying tendency to be stuck in her ways. But, it was understandable, so I liked her overall.Duncan was definitely Georgiana's match. He was just as powerful, loaded with secrets, and clever and wouldn't let her get away with her usual tricks. And, he could also be very sweet when he allowed his softer side to show. I thought he was great.The romance was good. As I said, Georgiana and Duncan were definitely each other's match, both being so strong and clever. And, they definitely had chemistry.

"A lovely romance about a love that finally had the chance to bloom, Tall, Dark, and Royal was an enjoyable historical romance novella and I really liked it.Chloe and Dominic were both great. Chloe was stuck in a bad habit of hiding from her problems but, as the story went on, she faced that issue and proved herself as a brave heroine. Dominic was definitely strong, clever, and extremely protective over those he cared about. I thought both were likable.The romance was lovely. Chloe and Dominic had loved each other years ago and that never faded. It was obvious that they still loved each other and they just had to clear away a few long-standing issues in order to be together. I thought they were a great couple.The plot moved quickly and kept me interested.

"A delightfully sweet, absolutely adorable romance, Tempting Mr. Weatherstone was a wonderful historical romance novella. It was simply lovely and I really liked it.Penelope and Ethan were both likable. They were both creatures of habit and that predictability made them both happy. For Penelope, though, the stasis that her relationship with Ethan had fallen into made her restless and encouraged her to be more assertive in what she wanted. Ethan was very sweet. He obviously cared about Penelope more than anything, but was terrified that, in trying to change their relationship, he would lose her. I thought both characters were great.The romance was a delight. Penelope and Ethan clearly loved each other. It was just a matter of finding the courage to take the first step. I thought they were perfect together.The plot moved quickly and kept me engaged all the way through. For such a little novella, there was a surprising depth to the characters and the emotion. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was perfect.Tempting Mr. Weatherstone was a fantastic historical romance novella that I truly loved.

"With a sweet romance and intriguing espionage, Twice Tempted was a lovely book and I enjoyed reading it.Fiona was a mostly good heroine. She was extremely smart, very protective over her sister, and unrelentingly resilient. For that, I liked her. However, she also had a tendency to assume the worst, which was somewhat justified given her background. But, it became vaguely annoying when she kept up with that habit in regards to Alex, even after he had done enough to earn her trust several times over. Especially when it led her to do some uncharacteristically impulsive things. Other than that, though, I thought she was great.Alex was likable. He was sweet and very loyal to his loved ones. However, I wish there had been more to him. I got that he was a good man who carried the burden of guilt heavily, but not much of a deeper sense of who he was. It wasn't an issue, but it would have been nice to get to know more about him.The other two major characters who had their own secondary romance were Chuffy and Mairead. I thought both were great. They were both out of the ordinary, but they were perfectly matched for each other. Chuffy was so genuinely kind and adorable and Mairead was an interesting character herself. I liked them both.The romance between Fiona and Alex was good. I did like them together and they definitely had chemistry. Oddly enough, though, I was actually more invested in Chuffy and Mairead's romance. Perhaps it was because I found them to be more interesting or maybe it was because they seemed to fit perfectly together, but I was really into their relationship. But, I thought both romances were lovely.I had one final issue with the book and it was that there was just too much going on. There were a lot of conflicts introduced and it didn't feel like they were all resolved.Take Minette Ferrar, for example. She was introduced and seemed like she would act as a major obstacle but, other than a few further mentions, I didn't get anything else about her. An unnecessary blackmail scheme was another extraneous conflict. I just wish that one conflict had been focused on and delved into deeply.The plot was good and kept me interested. Despite the issues I had, I still enjoyed the story and I liked it overall.Twice Tempted was an enjoyable historical romance. It might not have been perfect, but it was a good read.

"An okay New Adult romance, The Shape of My Heart was a good read. Not my favorite, but I did enjoy it.Courtney was a likable character. Strongly opinionated and very loyal to her loved ones, she was a good heroine. I thought she was great.Max was a total sweetie. He had a tough time in life and had to work hard for everything he had, but that made him humble rather than bitter. He had a reputation as a player, but he was really very sweet and caring. I absolutely adored him.The romance was good. It was both sweet and super spicy with a ton of chemistry between Courtney and Max. I thought they were a lovely couple.The plot was well paced and I was kept interested the entire way through. The problem, for me, was that, after reading the previous two books in the series, the plot started to feel rather formulaic. I thought the first book in the series was great, but the second was less so and, with the third, it just became very predictable. That brought down the book for me. I still enjoyed it, but it made it so I didn't like it as much as I could have.  Overall, though, it was a nice read.The Shape of My Heart was a good New Adult romance.

"An emotional, intense New Adult romance from an author who is a master of storytelling, I Need You was a wonderful read. I really liked this book. I had high expectations and this book definitely didn't disappoint.Jane Lark is brilliant at crafting realistic characters and Lindy and Billy were no exception. Like all her characters, they were deep, realistically flawed, and, above all, likable.Lindy was, for lack of better term, an emotional mess. She was hung up on Jason, stressed out about her mother, and unable to let go of her crippling self-consciousness. She did a lot of growing up over the course of the book, finding her self-confidence and moving on to make her own life. My only issue with her that she occasionally came off as selfish and bitchy. What bothered me the most was how much blame she put on Jason for their breakup and basically everything else that went wrong. It takes two to make a relationship and her actions had just as much impact on their breakup as Jason's. Those traits got better over the course of the book but not quite enough that I stopped being vaguely annoyed with her. Overall, though, I did like her.Billy was an absolute sweetheart. He had loved Lindy for a long while and finally had the chance to act on it. He truly wanted what was best for her, even if it meant putting her needs before his. The one thing about him that bothered me was that I wish he had held Lindy more accountable for how much she hurt him. But, honestly, I also thought it made him all the sweeter for standing by her no matter what. He was simply adorable and I really liked him.The romance was great. Billy had loved Lindy for years and Lindy slowly came to the realization that Billy had been the one for her all this time. They were lovely together and had some super hot chemistry. I thought they were wonderful together.The plot was fast paced and I was engaged the entire way through. The emotions were well portrayed and kept me drawn in.

"An enjoyable New Adult romance that was both sweet and hot, Her Winning Formula was a really good read. It was fun, sweet, and I liked it.Felicity and Lucas were both great. Felicity was socially awkward in a way that made her easy to relate to. She was crazy smart and, despite her tendency to accidentally offend people, she was likable. Lucas was simply a good guy. Sweet, funny, and definitely adorable, he was just great.The romance was okay. I felt like it moved well at first, then got stuck in a rut before it moved on to its final steps. That part where it got stuck in stasis was a little annoying, but not a major problem. They were a sweet couple and they definitely had some hot chemistry. So, I still thought they were great together.The story was well paced, other than the aforementioned part that dragged a little, and enjoyable.

"I really enjoyed The Rogue's Folly. It was a delightfully sweet read, with a few thrills and secrets along the way, and I really liked it.May was a great character. She started out being somewhat judgmental, after seeing her mother destroy her reputation and ruin May's childhood because she had no sense of self control. But, as the book went on and she realized that things weren't as black and white as she believed, she became a much better character. And, overall, she was strong, kind, and I thought she was likable.Etienne was good as well. Like May, he had his flaws. He had allowed someone else's bad advice ruin his life, but he was truly trying to fix his mistake. I thought he was very sweet and I liked him as well.The romance was lovely.

"A richly captivating and lovely YA read, I Wish was definitely a great book. From its well portrayed emotions to the engaging characters, this book was wonderful and I really liked it.Lacey was definitely a strong character. Her father had died when she was young, her stepfather died a few years later, and her mother fell off the deep end after dealing (or not dealing, I guess) with all that grief. That left Lacey to taking care of her catatonic mother and little brother. She was certainly tough, protective over her family, and determined to do anything to take care of them. My only complaint is that her strength became stubbornness on a couple of occasions, when she was stuck on seeing other people's kindness as pity rather than a friend helping a friend. Other than that, though, I thought she was great.Grant was good as well. His character was a little more shaky. On one had, he had some great character growth. At the end of each chapter, there was a report on that day's wish that he would send to his boss and I liked how his mindset and tone changed as the book went on. Not to mention how sweet he was and how caring he was of not only Lacey, but her mother and brother. However, at the same time, I didn't feel like we got to fully know his character. Things like his past, his true thoughts of his job. Basically anything about him that didn't pertain specifically to his happenings with Lacey's family was left out and that kept his character from being as deep as he could be. But, overall, I still liked him.The romance was light, but worked really well. I thought Lacey and Grant were great together, though after that ending I wonder how things will go for them.The plot was steadily paced. This author really does a great job of drawing the reader into the story with the captivating language and richly emotional world she creates, so that made sure I was kept engaged all the way through. I really liked the story and the ending has me curious to find out what happens next.I Wish was a lovely YA read that I really enjoyed.

"An interesting YA read about a looming presence that saw Earth as an experiment, Earth and Sky was an enjoyable read. It had a couple of issues but, overall, it was a good read.First, let me start with what I liked about the book.I liked Skylar's character. She was perceptive and braver than she gave herself credit for. Overall, I liked her. Win was also great. He was charming and I liked how he learned to respect humans as fully capable people as he spent more time with them. He was sweet and likable as well.The romance was light, more like a potential for romance, as Sky and Win got to know and mutually respect each other.I really liked the overall idea for the book. The idea that an alien group would use the whole of Earth as an experimental zone was interesting and it definitely had me curious enough to stay interested throughout the story and be interested to see what happens next.However, the were some problems that brought down the book.First,  I didn't feel like I fully got to know the characters. The book was so focused on the action that I didn't get enough of the characters. Also, it was a little unbelievable that Sky would so quickly agree to become a renegade time-traveler. Maybe it was because I didn't know her character well enough to believe it but it just didn't strike me as realistic.The biggest problem, though, was that there were too many holes in the world building. It was a great idea but the explanation just didn't convince me. For example, apparently this had been going on for many years. While the aliens had originally intended to colonize the planet and just do a few experiments to make sure it was stable, they decided against it when their experiments started to have consequences. But, they continued their experiments. Why? Why did they continue to poke around at humans? What purpose did it serve? Why even bother? The only explanation I got for that was that the Kemyans (the aliens) were very set in their ways and didn't like change. But, I didn't feel like that justified why they would continue pointless experiments for many, many years. And there were a lot of other plot holes that just didn't quite fit. And that really brought down the book because I wasn't able to fully believe in the situation.Though I liked the story, I didn't believe in it.Despite this, I did enjoy the story overall. I was curious enough to keep going and I'm still curious to want to know what happens next. I hope that we'll get more solid explanation and characterization in book 2, because I think this story had a lot of potential and I hope it meets it.Earth and Sky was an overall good book. There were issues that brought it down but I was still able to enjoy it. I don't know if I would recommend it but it is worth looking up.*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R82DMA3KRNENF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDO8520#wasThisHelpful","R82DMA3KRNENF","AL0LTL9QRB3KY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL0LTL9QRB3KY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sweet romance about two people who didn't want a true marriage, but fell for each other anyway, Strangers at the Altar was a lovely read. It was an enjoyable romance and I liked it.Ainsley was a great heroine. She had some interesting growth throughout the book. During her first marriage, she was timid and afraid to express an opinion that she knew her husband wouldn't listen to anyway. At the start of the book, she was done with bowing to another's wishes and she showed that she could be strong-willed. But, as the book went on, she struggled with falling back into old habits, even though she knew that Innes would listen to her advice if she chose to give it. But, she got better at asserting herself and ended up as a stronger character. I thought she was lovely and I liked her.Innes was wonderful as well. He was sweet and a fair-minded man. When it came to both his wife and his tenants, he wasn't too proud to listen to advice and really tried to do what was best for his estate. He was great and I liked him as well.The romance was good. Ainsley and Innes were smitten with each other from when they first met, but neither of them could admit it. As their feelings grew deeper, they still couldn't admit it to each other, until they both finally realized that they were just making themselves miserable by not accepting their feelings. They were great together, the kind of couple that made each other better. I thought they were a lovely couple.I had 2 main issues with the book that knocked it down a peg. 1) Though I did think that Ainsley and Innes were a good couple, their stubbornness was a little frustrating. Particularly with how they kept going on about how their marriage wasn't real. It was totally legal and all they had to do was decide to make it a full marriage and it would have been so. It just seemed like the used that as an excuse to hide their feelings, which was rather annoying. 2) The whole reveal of what happened to make Innes think he didn't deserve happiness was properly dramatic. However, I never got to actually see the resolution of it. I wanted to see Innes face his past fully. Without it, I felt underwhelmed because this whole drama was revealed but the resolution for it was just a few pages long. Other than that, though, I liked the rest of the book.The plot moved quickly and I was engaged the entire way through. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was perfect.Strangers at the Altar was a lovely historical romance that I really liked.

"Romantic and thrilling, Witchrise was a good conclusion to the Tudor Witch trilogy. I wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, but it did a nice job of wrapping everything up. So, while I was a little disappointed, I did like it overall.All the characters were still great in this book.Meg was still just as strong, willful, and independent as ever. She was determined to take don Marcus Dent and do what was best for herself. When she realized the full extent of her powers, she was definitely a force to be reckoned with. I already liked her before and I still like her now.Alejandro was still adorably sweet and devoted to Meg. He put her safety above all else, even when she was rejecting him. He was loyal, clever, and just all around wonderful and I adored him.We get to see more of Richard in this book. He was smart, though still prone to brooding, and loyal to Meg despite being heart-broken about her. Honestly, I felt really bad for the guy. He really did love Meg and he was a good guy. I thought he was great.***SPOILERS AHEAD***I really wasn't happy with romance. While I liked the intensity between them and how they were both so loyal to each other, there were some things about it that I didn't like. For one, most of the romance in the book was Meg thinking ""I love him so much but I can't marry him because I would have to give up my magic."" Over and over and over again. It got SO repetitive. And, Alejandro never asked her to give up her magic. It was just assumed that practicing magic as a nobleman's wife would have been too dangerous. But, he never asked that of her because he loved her too much to force her into giving up something she loved. But, what really bothered me was how it was all resolved. Even after Meg had rejected his proposal and refused to continue their relationship, he went back to Spain and gave up everything because, to him, it wasn't worth anything without Meg. I'm not saying that Meg should have given up magic because I know it was important to her and I didn't think she should have given it up. But it just seemed unfair that Alejandro didn't think twice about giving up his titles, land, and wealth even when he couldn't be with Meg, just because it wasn't worth as much to him as the woman he loved. Meanwhile, Meg didn't consider giving up magic for one second. In the end, Alejandro gave up his place in the Holy Order, all his titles and wealth, and leaves behind his family and his home for her, while Meg never considered doing the same. Again, I'm not saying that I wanted her to, I'm just saying that it turned out to be unfair to Alejandro. I think a relationship should always be equal in how much each person compromises and this one wasn't.One last thing about the romance. I really didn't like how Meg allowed Richard to kiss her 3 times and told him that she wished she had fallen in love with him instead of Alejandro, while Alejandro was sitting in another room, brokenhearted because Meg had rejected him. That was just really badly done of her, both in regards to Alejandro and Richard, and it made me upset with her.***END SPOILERS***Despite my issue with the romance, I still enjoyed the story. It was fast paced and kept me interesting. I was a bit underwhelmed with how the issue of Marcus Dent was resolved, as well as annoyed that Elizabeth and her other servants never gave Meg any credit for basically saving everyone from the psycho. But, I still liked the story and, in the end, all the loose ends were tied. Though this wasn't quite what I was hoping it would be, I still thought it was a good conclusion.Witchrise was an enjoyable YA read and a nice tie up to the series. While I didn't love it, I still liked it. I'm not sure what other fans of the series will think, but it was, most importantly, a satisfying conclusion.*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJ72COBSVIQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211023#wasThisHelpful","R1OJ72COBSVIQM","AL0LTL9QRB3KY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL0LTL9QRB3KY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She was thrown into an entirely new situation and kept both her head and her sense of humor. She was tough, clever, and a truly likable character.Dexter was the love interest in this book and he was wonderful. He stood by Harper no matter what and he was very sweet with how he treated her. I thought he was a delight.The romance was light but well done. I liked the progression of Harper and Dexter's relationship, going from infatuated friends to a devoted couple. After the events of this book, I'm hoping that they manage to hold on to a happy ending.The plot moved quickly and kept me interested the entire way through. There were twists along the way, as well as an unexpected secret that really took me by surprise. I enjoyed the story and the ending has me curious about what will come next.I really liked Paranormal Keepers. It was an enjoyed YA paranormal romance that had a few surprises along the way.

"A delightfully imaginative, truly excellent YA fantasy, The Griever's Mark was a brilliant read that I absolutely loved. It had a richly built world, engaging character, and a few twists along the way. From start to finish, it was a fantastic read.The world-building was great. The world that the author created was lush and drew me in completely to the story.Astarti was a wonderful heroine. She was a dynamic character from the start. She held a lot of hate for the person that Belos had made her become, even as she fought him in her own small ways. Even with the Leash, she was determined to find a way to do what she felt was right. She was a strong, clever character and I really liked him.Logan was just as great. He was impulsive and determined to do what he believed was right, even if that meant bending or breaking a few rules. He was wonderful, sweet and intent on protecting Astarti no matter what. I absolutely adored him.The romance was very sweet. Astarti and Logan had a connection from the start and it only grew as they got to know each other. After that ending, I'm just hoping they can find a way to be together.The plot was fast-paced and I was totally hooked the entire way through. There were plenty of twists along the way, and a few unexpected secrets revealed. I loved the story and the ending has me anxious to find out what happens next. Can't wait for book 2!The Griever's Mark was a fantastic YA fantasy. I absolutely loved this book. It was simply amazing.

"A lovely conclusion to the Whisper Falls series, Whispers from the Past was a sweet and enjoyable read. It was a perfect end to Mark and Susanna's story and I really liked it.Susanna was great in this book. Having started to settle into the modern world, she wanted to be independent and not have to rely on Mark and his family to take care of her. She preferred to work for herself, even if it was difficult. And, above all, she wanted what was best for Mark, without having to be a burden. She was a lovely character, from the start of the series to the end, and I really liked her.Mark was wonderful as well. As sweet and kind as ever, this boy was just adorable. I had one issue with him in this book, which I'll explain later, but I still adored him. He was loyal to Susanna and determined to help her adapt to the modern world, though that did lead to some overprotectiveness. He was a perfect, swoon-worthy, absolutely adorable hero and I just loved him.The romance was perfect. Susanna and Mark were so simply and purely in love. They both wanted what was best for each other and, even when things looked rocky, the only thing never in doubt was their feelings for each other. I though they were an absolutely sweet couple.***Spoilers ahead***The one thing that bothered me in this book was something that happened about it the middle. Susanna, thinking that she was holding Mark back, broke up with him. Mark was devastated, of course, but still loved her. However, just a few days after they broke up, he let himself be pulled into a relationship with Gabrielle. Gabrielle basically proposed that they be a couple for her public appearance and he kind of just shrugged and let it happen. And, when everyone, including Gabrielle, assumed that it was a real relationship, he was totally passive about it and just accepted it. That didn't go with his character at all. Especially during moments where a jealous Gabrielle, knowing he would never love her as he loved Susanna, said negative things about her and Mark didn't say anything. It just seemed so unworthy of him as a character and made me think a little less of him. He wasn't fair to both Susanna and Gabrielle and the whole situation didn't strike me right. I just couldn't understand how Mark could be so passive about it and I didn't like it. It brought the book down and made me annoyed with the character. Not enough to ruin anything, but enough that I got irritated.***End spoilers***The plot was steadily paced and had me drawn in the entire way through. There were a few twists and some unexpected uncertainty that made me anxious to find out how Mark and Susanna would manage to find their happy ending. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was a perfect wrap up to the series.Whispers from the Past was a fantastic YA romance that I really enjoyed. It was a perfect conclusion to a wonderful series and I just loved it. Fans of the series, you won't be disappointed with this conclusion. And, YA lovers, this is a series you won't want to miss.*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUE9HJOOF61F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939392217#wasThisHelpful","R1DUE9HJOOF61F","AL0LTL9QRB3KY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL0LTL9QRB3KY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice historical romance about a second chance at love, The Forgotten Fiancee was an enjoyable read and I liked it.Dianna was a lovely heroine. On the day of her wedding, she was timid, somewhat naive, and unable to separate a happy life from Miles. The years apart made her stronger and a more independent person. By the end, she proved herself to have more strength than even she gave herself credit for and I thought she was definitely likable.Miles was good. Despite the heartbreak he had left in his wake, he knew that both he and Dianna couldn't go through with the marriage the way they were. He was too full of wanderlust and Dianna was too desperate to please and their marriage would have been terrible. For the most part, I found him sweet, and the man that he was 3 years later was much more generous and inclined to think of others before himself. However, I didn't like how easily he gave up. He went on and on about proving to both Dianna and his sister that he wouldn't leave again. So, I expected that, even when they were mistrustful, he would stay with them and earn their trust through his actions. That didn't happen. It was like he expected Dianna to be able to forgive him and be able to trust him again just like that because he badgered her a few times about it. I just thought it was stupid of him, to be honest. He wanted to prove that he wouldn't leave again but, when things weren't looking to go his way, that's what he almost did. It made be want to smack him upside the head for being an idiot and that brought his character and the book down a little for me. I was still okay with his character, but I didn't love him as much as I could have.The romance was okay. Because of Miles' issue, I didn't get as into it as I hoped I would because I wanted to see a more gradual process to reconciliation where Miles actually stuck it out. But, I still did think that Dianna and Miles were good together.The plot was well paced and kept me interested the entire way though. Despite any complaints I had, I still enjoyed the story and the ending was lovely.The Forgotten Fiancee was a lovely historical romance that I quite liked.

"An absolutely brilliant YA read, The Book of Ivy was simply amazing. Full of secrets and unexpected twists, it was thoroughly enjoyable and I totally loved it.Ivy was great. She started out the book fully believing in what her father had told her. It didn't take long before all her beliefs were challenged and she was left with the task of trying to make sense of everything. She realized that nothing was quite as black and white as she thought and she wanted nothing more of being a pawn. She was a loyal, clever, and determined character that I really liked.Bishop was wonderful. Right from the start, he was challenging all of Ivy's preconceived notions. More than anyone else, he truly cared about the people and their well being, rather than the power that being leader would grant him. He was truly adorable.The romance was well done. Ivy didn't trust Bishop one bit at the start. But, over the course of the book, trust grew and so did their feelings for each other. After the ending, I'm not sure how things will go for them, but I'm sure hoping for the best.The plot had me hooked from start to finish. The world-building was well done. There were plenty of secrets and betrayals that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved the story and the ending has me itching to find out what happens next.The Book of Ivy was a thrilling, absolutely fantastic YA read that I loved from start to finish.

"An intriguing YA read that mixed magic, danger, and romance with more serious issues, The Last Changeling was a fantastic book. I really liked this fantasy romance. From start to finish, it had me totally drawn in and I enjoyed every bit of it.Elora was a lovely heroine. She was raised in the treacherous faerie court, but she developed her own ideals about treating all creatures fairly and started a grass-roots revolution to change it. And, when she got to the human world and saw the unfairness of bullied students, she wasn't going to let that sit either. She was a very active character, unwilling to turn a blind eye, as well as kind and clever. She was a very likable character and I thought she was great.Taylor was so amazingly sweet and wonderful and absolutely perfect! He didn't have the easiest life, with his brother's death, his parents' neglect, and the school bullies. But, even so, he didn't let that make him bitter. He remained truly kind and generous, the best kind of person. He was simply amazing and I adored him.The romance was very sweet. It moved slowly and it worked for the characters and their situations. Even when they were still hesitant about a relationship, though, their growing feelings were always clear, which I thought was very sweet. I'm not sure how they'll find a way to be together, but here's hoping they get a happy ending...The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. There was never a dull moment, especially with all the secrets that came about. Along with the thrills and romance, though, there was a deeper theme of equality and I liked how it was included. It wasn't so in-your-face that it became preachy. Instead, it was included in the characters' ideals and actions in a way that worked well. I really enjoyed the story and the ending has me anxious to find out what happens next. Can't wait for book 2!The Last Changeling was a fantastic YA read.

"A charming, sweet, and delightful historical romance, The Accidental Countess was a lovely read. It was thoroughly enjoyable and I really liked it.Cass was a lovely heroine. Quiet, thoughtful, and kindhearted, she was definitely likable. And, over the course of the book, she learned to become stronger and live for herself and not others' expectation. I thought she was great.Julian was wonderful, as well. Sweet and the epitome of a gentleman, he was simply adorable. I thought he was a perfect hero.The romance was very sweet. Both Cass and Julian already loved each other and it was simply a matter of them finding a way to each other. However, that was also a little frustrating. It took so long for them to actually admit their feelings to each other (in the end, it wasn't even one of them taking the first step to say it). They fell trap to miscommunication and assumptions and it became frustrating. But, overall, I thought they were a good couple.The plot moved quickly and I was kept interested the entire way through.

"A sweet historical romance novella, An Heiress for All Seasons was a lovely read. It was a quick, light, and enjoyable book that I quite liked.Violet was an okay heroine. On one hand she was independently minded and determined to marry someone who loved her for herself. On the other, I felt like she unfairly judged Will. At first, I could understand why she thought he was a fortune hunter. But, later, after she had fallen for him, I got annoyed that she persisted in thinking that way despite how he had acted to prove that he wanted her for her and not her money. It wasn't a big problem, but it was annoying. Otherwise, thought, I thought she was a likable character.Will was sweet. Despite appearances, he didn't want to marry a woman for her fortune.

"A sweet, emotional, and lovely New Adult romance, Promise Me This was a great read. It was another wonderful book in an already fantastic series and I really enjoyed it.Jessie was a great heroine. Tough, independent, but also kind and compassionate. I really liked how she helped Nate face his issues, encouraging him but never pushing him farther than he wanted to go. She was a lovely character and I really liked her.Nate was also wonderful. He had trust issues but not with other people. Because of his violent father, he had difficulty trusting himself and that had him keeping women at a distance because he didn't trust himself not to hurt them. But, in reality, he was very sweet and a truly good man who would never knowingly hurt someone. He was great and I really liked him as well.The romance was lovely.

"Awesome set of cutting boards. I love the sizes of them and the quality is excellent. They are thick, sturdy and very durable. I've had them for a few months and really wanted to try them out before placing my review. I have labeled each one on the red handle with a sharpie marker with what I use it for.  The large one is for poultry, medium for meats and small for fruits and veggies. It's great to have a set of three to prevent cross contamination.The function of the boards is great. They are strong enough that the knife barely leaves a mark, assuring me these will last for a long time. Clean up is a breeze in the dishwasher.

"These tags holders are awesome. I cruise a lot and the cruise luggage tags are awful. You have to print them out so they are just made of regular printer paper, you then fold them longwise and staple or tape around your luggage handle. It's not very secure and it's quite bulky. My paper tags actually tore and fell off one time and my luggage never showed up at my cabin and I spent two hours tracking it down, not a fun way to start vacation. These holders are the perfect size for the cruise tags and since it's clear on both sides you can see both sides of the cruise tags (which is a nessecity for the cruise line). No more laminating my cruise tags with shipping tape and hoping they don't fall off. The pocket is wide enough that I was also able to write my name on the edge with a permanent marker and still have the entire tag show. The thickness of the plastic pocket and strap is very nice and durable. These are not flimsy in anyway. The package of six is a generous amount since most luggage tags come in packages of two. The value and quaility is great.

"Great fit and support.  My husband has a bad knee but still wants to have an active life with a good amount of walking. After a minor knee surgery a few years back he experiences some additional weakness in his knee so he has been on the search for the best knee brace for him. We've been through a few others that didn't quite cut it until I found this one. The difference that makes this one works is the length of it (goes a good but above and below the actual knee) which gives extra stability to the knee and mid leg,  the ease of putting it in and taking off with the Velcro closures above and below the knee.

"Ever since my daughter was a baby, her father and I would give her at Thanksgiving an ornament, that when she was an infant and toddler was placed on the family tree and when she reached school age she had a tree decorated in her bedroom where we would put all her ornaments. It is fun to look back over the years because each year reflect what she was ""into"" at the time. She has ballerina or two marking her ten years of dance classes, that only stopped when she joined the high school dance/flag team early at the beginning of eighth grade. There was Wizard of Oz, Cabbage Patch Kids (of course), Frogs, Cupcakes, ......and as she grew older and moved out on her own we continued to find ornaments that were beautiful and depicted her interests. Well this September, she got engaged to her perfect soul mate. She waited a long time never settling and shortly before she met her fiancé, Dave, she commented that it seemed that every guy she went out with was closer and closer to what she felt she was looking for. She always had he dad wrapped right around her finger from the day she was born. She began dating Dave, about 10 months before her Dad passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, so we are grateful that the two got to know each other and we found over and over that the two were very much alike, so I guess it is true that if a girl has a good relationship with her father, the man who she chooses to marry will be very much like him. I am so glad that she had Dave to support her during that difficult time and he and her dad had a discussion at the hospital shortly before he passed away, and her asked my husband's approval to marry her. That was two years ago and more and more we see the similarities.They were engaged in mid September, so I wanted to get an ornament this year that would be a memory for both of them. The seller was excellent, personalizing it exactly the way I requested, even spelling my daughter's name correctly (Tracie and NOT Tracy, Tracey). The ornament is pretty and it is obviously a diamond ring and I put just like on the sample ""Engaged"" and ""2015"" and finally, both of their names. I gave it to them this weekend because it came earlier than I expected (which was terrific) and since we are going to spend Thanksgiving with his family. The both loved it and it will be on their tree this year. They will be putting it safely up on the tree and her collection will not be on the tree this year.....They have two really good girl cats which belonged to my daughter, who are very respectful of the tree and love to sleep under it and watch the blinking lights.....but they became ""parents"" when they together adopted (from a shelter of course) a very frisky boy kitten, named Sami. 🐱 Happy Holidays!!!🎄💎","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MCFIBGXD6CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TOPU78#wasThisHelpful","R13MCFIBGXD6CT","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think we have all bought dashboard phone mounts that never fit the phone even though it was supposed to and after a short while it was falling off the dashboard. Well at least I have.The Smarteck Dashboard/Windshield Car Phone Mount seems to have solved my problems. It attaches securely to the dashboard and is a firm grip. The adjustable phone holder, fits many different makes of phone. Mine is an iPhone 5c and it fits well and securely. What I like about this holder, that my last one didn't have, is that it holds the phone in either portrait or landscape so you can determine which way you prefer to look at the display. This mount is also adjustable up or down so that you can set the exact line of site depending your height or seat adjustments. You set to see your display at a comfortable height.I have been using this mount for several days and I really like the customization that helps me to position my phone to the optimal position for my comfort. If there is any change in my evaluation in the future, I will update at that time.

"I have a problem with my knee and I can't carry anything heavy. I found a container on wheels for my cat's dry cat food and bought a scoop so I just have to roll the container over to the food dish, scoop it out of the container and fill the bowl. This works well for me so....I like the Clump and Seal Cat Litter, but the formula that works great happens to be the heavy littler formula, not the newer lightweight formula. They come in boxes that are 19 pounds and 38 pounds, so I got another of the same container to store the litter in, so I can leave it near the litter box or tool it over to the litter box to replenish the litter in the litter box. I looked in Amazon and got this scoop so I ca scoop the clean litter into the box. It seems to wok well and it is large enough to replenish the litter with a couple of scoops. It seems to be strong enough for the purpose I need it for.If there is any change in my positive use of this scoop, I will update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JNO2S8I6BKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IWGI3C#wasThisHelpful","R29JNO2S8I6BKI","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had my cat/buddy, Toby since shortly after my husband passed away last year and I downsized. I had also experienced probably the worst thing that can happen to you after a knee replacement(wont go into details, but think someone put an IED into my leg). Because of that and the fact that although my unit is on the first floor, I need to walk up ten steps, so needless to say I can't take out my garbage. For a couple of months I cleaned out the litter into a plastic bag that went into the garbage, but there was a smell that I just could not take. I looked at the automatic litter cleaners, but reviews were mixed and I didn't want Toby getting caught in a moving rake thing. I figured I would give this a try. Haven't they had something like this for diapers for years?  At first I thought it was no big deal, you scoop the clumps into the hopper and pull the spring door out the clumps drop and the spring door snaps back into place. After I started using it, there was an improvement in the smell of the garbage. My daughter comes a couple times a week to empty garbage but it takes longer than even two weeks to fill if you shake contents down. She wasn't able to get over when it was full so I went back to the plastic bags. I use a rollator so I would put the bag onto the tray scoop and bring the clumps up to tray height to deposit the clumps. Well, this became a disaster of sorts when the clumps fell towered the outer side of the bag and flipped the bag over, sending the clumps to the floor where they broke up. I realized that the height of this receptical is perfect and the clumps can't fall out. When the receptical is full, you just pull the bag out of the cartridge enough to cut it and tie it off. Then you just pull the plastic material out of the cartridge and tie it off the you are ready to go. It takes quite a long period of time with one cat and there is absolutely no odor. You just buy the receptacle and it comes with a beginner cartridge with the plastic material. Each regular cartridge lasts a good amount of time. I have been using this for about a year and I like the convenience and no odor!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GMSYLX8MEAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085TVBRO#wasThisHelpful","R27GMSYLX8MEAS","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All preschools should have this book and should be required to read it to all the children! We have all read about people who have positions of authority who violate children and not only that, as we have seen with people like the Duggars, children can be violated by family members and other members of the family will cover it up rather than getting help. Of course those children were homeschooled and perhaps the state should send teachers into the homes of homeschooled children to read the book to them, so that they know that secrets are not good even when the secrets involve something family members might do. Young children have no off button so a discussion of secrets could result in any secret being spilled, which is just what should happen and whether the children are in preschool or homeschool, the message needs to get to them at an early age that secrets about what Daddy is getting Mommy for her birthday is a big difference from child molestation which cannot be covered up or ignored, whether homeschool parents like it or not.

"I read about this online and read a lot of positive reviews. I have been having trouble falling asleep and really didn't want to take another prescription. I ordered it and it arrived quickly. I have taken it two nights now and it seems to be working well. Before I would not be able to fall asleep. First I tried a dark room and that never worked. Then I tried to put some documentary type shows especially the ID network and I would still be awake two hours later when I had programmed the TV to automatically turn off. I put the same type of shows on now but I actually fall asleep. I was a nurse who worked 3-11 and 11-7 shifts so my sleep schedule was always a bit off especially with having a husband who as a police officer working all three rotating shifts for many years until he became a detective and worked the day shift most of the time. Neither one of us went to sleep too early after all those crazy schedules. By the time our daughter went to school, he was doing the days and I was doing the two later shifts so that one of us was usually home with her. I will be using these to hopefully get on a normal sleep time and a normal wake time, even though I am no longer working.One of the other reasons I had trouble sleeping was that my cat, Toby, would get up on my chest put his paw out to my cheek and I would wake up to his furry little face staring at me and he would get up by my ear and purr loudly enough to wake me up. This happened every night and I don't have the heart to correct him, but the past two nights with taking this, I don't know if he has been doing the same things, because I am actually sound asleep.One of the ingredients in this was very popular a few years back, Melatonin, but as usually happens, some people decided to take way more than the directed amounts and they would get sick or die and instead of holding some idiots responsible for their own actions, they removed Melatonin from the shelves. It was helpful, when I had a few back to back 11-7AM shifts, and had to get sleep during the day until my daughter got home from school and it also worked well. My suggestion would be to only take these capsules AS DIRECTED ONLY. If you are still not sleeping try not drinking coffee or any other high caffeine beverage too close to bedtime or make an appointment with your doctor.I recommend Somnapure PM for wakefulness or inability to fall asleep. I has worked for me but if there is any change in my opinion, I will come in and update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XMAJ6W6UZKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKQECYA#wasThisHelpful","R14XMAJ6W6UZKC","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This outfit was part of a shower gift for my niece's baby shower. So this review is only regarding the quality of the product.  I bought a few sizes ahead because everyone gives newborn and small sizes that the babies seem to grow out of so quickly.My daughter is now a 37 year old woman, but I still remember that most of my favorite clothes for her when she was little were Carter's and Oshkosh ( it is too bad that Oshkosh no longer has the ruffles on the shoulders of the overalls). I was glad that this outfit still had the same quality I remembered. Since I am buying larger, I try to get something that can be used at any time of the year. This set has a onesie with short sleeves, then there is a long sleeve onesie that could probably still be used in the warmer months if you are going to be taking the child somewhere with the a/c on high. The pants and the long sleeve onesie have a cute fire truck on them (the baby's Dad is a fireman).  As far as the fit, the size seemed to be good holding it up, but I guess that someone who is already using this outfit could give better info on size.Of course, as my niece's baby grows into the outfit I will come and update the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCD1AAB31XH3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEN51RW#wasThisHelpful","RCD1AAB31XH3F","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love the Sistema Klipit family of plates, cups and bowls. I purchased the Sistema Noodle Bowl almost a year ago. I used it for oatmeal, soups and reheating of stews and casseroles, but if it was in the fridge for the next day's lunch I was out of luck to using it. I am a klutz and forever dropping things and I really hate it when stuff boils over or splatters all over the microwave. I had a knee replacement that failed and blew my leg open from the knee to just above the top of my foot. Thanks to medics and helicopter staff taking me quickly to the Medical Center I had my surgeries in, an fantastic surgeons who not only saved my life, they saved my leg too. Due to some weakness I use a rollator for balance and can put my meals on a tray and wheel them from the kitchen to the living room when I am alone (my husband died unexpectedly three days after my leg blew). I love using this for oatmeal or grits for winter breakfast and cold cereals for summer. I love the strong clips that keep the lid on firmly and the steam vent that you leave open when cooking to release the steam. I can then close the vent do that on the very rare occasion when I drop it, or it falls off the table, I don't have to clean the light beige carpeting. The oatmeal comes out fine with no boil overs. This can be used to heat up other food like vegetables, pasta, or stews or casserole leftovers. Any of the different pieces can be used for multi purposes. These are made in New Zealand with safe plastics. They are very well made and I have never had a problem with any of them. I have purchased the Medium Plate, the Noodle Bowl, the soup cup and this Oats To Go Bowl.There is only one problem and it isn't even the kind of problem that would require the loss of any stars, is that with many of the sellers, you cannot pick the color. You get whatever color that they sent you. As a result I have red in plate and soup cup, purple in the noodle bowl and bright blue in this bowl. It isn't a really big deal because all the colors are fine so you really can't go wrong. I only mention it because some people want everything to match so you might have to shop around to find sellers who will let you choose.If there are any unforseeable problems that occur, I will come in to update this review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S6TN39R0VOPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSUQURS#wasThisHelpful","R3S6TN39R0VOPF","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that more and more in this country we are being forced to learn Spanish. Although it is very annoying (face it for many years we have been a nation of LEGAL immigrants and the English language has held up as the language that would tie everyone together), our politicians have dumped millions of Immigrants, who really don't care about assimilating and expect US to accommodate THEIR language, with nurses, police officers,etc...being required to learn Spanish, it seems to be the time to pick up a few words. I was in a store the other day and the woman working in the women's clothing department had no idea what I was saying when I asked her something about the availability of a particular size. I have purchased a couple of apps for my iPad, but they teach as if I was in school, learning all the parts of language and I am not planning to travel to Mexico or South America, so I don't really need conversational Spanish and if I need to find something in a store again I will just use the word and let THEM try to figure out what I want.This seems to have it all and for a great price. There are several dictionaries and books, games and for pronunciation the voice is clear and easy to imitate. I have found it to be very helpful. For a while I will need the direction booklet, because it IS an electronic English/Spanish learning handheld computer and you do need to read the instructions until you learn the basics and if you want to learn full conversational Spanish, they have everything you need. It would be very beneficial for those who speak only Spanish to learn English, because we have people living here from all over the world and for the most part in order to be an integral part of the US, they have learned English for centuries with no problem.I recommend this for everyone from those like me who just want to start by learning words that you might need, ( like ordering from your local Taco Bell😃) to those who want to learn more conversational Spanish.If there is any reason for me to change my opinion of this Franklin Electronic Spanish Learner, I will come back and update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCUTCDTF5PNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063A9R3W#wasThisHelpful","R2PCUTCDTF5PNI","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using this litter after doing much research on different litters, including reviews and ratings.....It worked well and had firm clumps that were easy to scoop out. My only problem was that since my husband passed away a couple of years ago, the weight of the package was harder to get in from the porch with the Amazon delivery, so I figured that I would go for the Clump and Seal Lightweight Formula Cat Litter.  I noticed that the clumps were not as firm and broke up into small pieces when I was trying to scoop out the clumps. I gave it a while making sure that I only scooped when my cat had gone for a while without using the litter, but the clumps still break up. I have decided to go back and start using the regular weight formula, since the little pieces slip through the slots of my long handled litter scoop. There is no odor noticeable t all, in both formulas. I Had to downsize and was forced to put the litter box right before the little hall leading to the bedroom and bath, so it is closer to the living room/dining room than I had where I lived until last year. I notice no odor at all, even after he just used the litter and after being out for several hours, when I return there is no odor at all.I recommend this litter over all the others and over the years, I have tried them all. You can probably check out both the regular and lightweight and decide which is best for you.If there is any reason to change the opinion I have now of this litter, I will come back and update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REIVMMC2DLK0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJJUS2K#wasThisHelpful","REIVMMC2DLK0F","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a great idea. After I had my daughter several years ago, my husband and I would go shopping and find larger size clothing on good sales or clearance, especially from one of the more high end department stores in our area. I always tried to organize, but a couple of pieces would get caught up and she would almost be out of the size before she could get good use out of it. These are great to organize the sizes so that you can grab all the next size clothes from the right size selection. I bought these for my niece's new baby boy. I am sure she will get a lot of use from them especially since many of us have given her larger sizes so that the baby will get the most use out of them. Along with this I also got her a terrific fire truck outfit (the dad is a fireman) in a size 24 months!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VEH4S6764SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005BU51#wasThisHelpful","R35VEH4S6764SK","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been purchasing Clump and Seal for several months after researching reviews on all different cat litters. I wanted to be sure that there would be no odor because I downsized about a year ago and found that the best place to put my cat Toby's litter box right before the hallway going to the bedroom and that is about the only place it can go. I have had absolutely no problem with odor at all. I originally used the regular weight litter through Amazon, but I didn't realize how heavy 19 pounds is so I switched over to the Clump and Seal Lightweight Litter. Again there has been absolutely no odor problem, but at the same time I noticed that the clumps seemed to break open when I began using the lightweight formula. This could just be a coincidence, but I am now going back to the regular weight litter and I will then see how hard the clumps are. Either way, the biggest concern for most cat parents is odor from the litter box and the Clump and Seal Litter has been the absolute BEST in dealing with the odor problem that I found with other brand name cat litters on the market. I took away one star because of the difference in the firmness of the clumps and the only explaination would be that at the time I noticed it was when I switched from the regular weight litter to the lightweight litter.If, after I have switched back to the regular weight Clump and Seal I find that the clumps break open, I will come back and update my review to reflect my experience with the clumping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWJDQI4LVB00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S82T3SM#wasThisHelpful","R1FWJDQI4LVB00","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first tried Sistema Noodle Bowl about a year ago. My husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly two years ago and three days before that my knee replacement failed tearing my leg opened from my knee almost down to the top of my ankle. I was taken by helicopter to my Medical Center where some very excellent doctors saved both my life and my leg. There is some weakness so I use a rollator to get around my home. I tend to be klutzy anyway, and when I want to take my meals in the living room when I am eating alone, sometimes things happen. With beige carpeting I try to prevent disasters whenever I can. The Sistema Noodle bowl was great for soups, pasta and oatmeal or cereals. I love the way the sides clip firmly so there is no way of spills and when microwaving, the rocker vents in the covers work well because after leaving the vent open while cooking for steam to escape, it can be clipped shut for transporting. I decided to try a few of the other products so I purchased this plate for meals. It is the perfect size, because I am dieting and it makes it easier for portion control. For someone who want more food on their plates there is also a large size plate. There is also a soup cup that is ample enough to hold a Progresso or Campbell's Homestyle soup contents. I also purchased the porridge bowl for hot cereals. All have that steam vent and I haven't had any food disasters using them. They would also be good when bringing leftovers to work for lunch. I have found the clips to be strong and stay firmly closed. They wash up well, and I have to say that I wash them by hand, so I am not sure how well they would hold up in the dishwasher, although since they are dishwasher safe there should not be a problem if washed as directed. They are also freezer safe so you could freeze food and microwave the food all in the same container.The only problem, although it is such an insignificant problem that it doesn't warrant taking away a star from the review of the actual plate, is that with a lot of the products, you cannot choose the color. It is kind of weird because you can't get a set of the same colors to match. I got a red plate, a purple noodle bowl a red soup cup and a bright blue porridge bowl. At least all the colors are nice so it isn't a problem for me but someone else might have to search to find sellers who sell by the color.If I find that if there is a change in my initial assessment of this plate, I will come back and update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8PTLVC4H89D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D6Y0I4#wasThisHelpful","R1H8PTLVC4H89D","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wash clothes are large enough and are great bargain for the price. They are premoistenèd and come in packages of about 80 each with a touch to open system like the one on the baby wipes packages, so you for the most part can use one hand to open and close it. These wipes are premoistened and there is no rinsing required.I recommend these for any kind of washing up and they are disposable so you don't have to wash washcloths and they are great to keep in the car for emergency uses.If fo any reason I feel the need to change my review of this product, I will update it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQ8FFRE7D89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MCCDJA#wasThisHelpful","R1EQ8FFRE7D89","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years I have toyed with the idea of the over $100 automatic cleaning systems for our cats but the reviews were tepid. My daughter took her two cats when she and her fiancé found a place, my husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly and I found myself needing to downsize and I adopted my cat, Toby, from a local shelter. Toby is a Lynx Point Siamese and is very clean and spoiled rotten. He actually walks by his litter and sniffs it before he uses it. I had a problem with my legs and need to use a rollater for a while, so trying to clean out the litter into a plastic store bag really didn't work really well because it was difficult to use the bag and get everything off the scoop, and into the bag while maintaining balance. I researched everything out there for litter and actually this Litter Genie System got the best reviews and explainations, so I figured I would give it a try. The cost was not that much, so even if it really didn't equal all the positive reviews, it would not be a bank account blasting loss.The system works well and is simple one you get ahold on how it works. There is a cartridge with plastic wrap inside. You pull it down and knot it well on the bottom. Then you replace the cartridge and close the lid. Scoop the clumped litter out and pull the string loaded door that is about half way down. The litter falls down into the bottom and each time you use it the clumped litter falls down until it is full. You cut it off and tie it up and throw it in the trash. It is neater and less wasteful than using plastic bags every day. There is no odor that I or anyone else has noted and I have been using it bout a year with no problems. I recommend the Litter Genie Litter Disposal System for an easy way to maintain the cat litter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BVURAJYQKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IRMTXE#wasThisHelpful","R33BVURAJYQKX","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently started Nutrasystem and over and above the breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert that you purchase, there are other morning and afternoon snacks that should be easily taken with you on the road. I have found occasional snacks like sesame sticks, rice crackers and vegetable chips (BTW these are delicious) that I weigh an ounce and close up the bag (you don't realize how much you eat when you snack right out of the bag! These small containers are small but they are great to throw in your bag or purse to take with you while running errands or coffee breaks at the office. These would be a bit too small for one oz of chips, but there is a clear box shaped container from Sistema with blue snaps on it that is perfect for the chips without wasting space in your bag. They are versatile and can be used to store almost everything.I recommend these little containers for versatility in that they could be used in a variety of places outside of the kitchen. The only reason I gave these products four stars instead of five is that an owner of several Sistema Collection of products, I know that with the Klipits are usually very strong and thick and I noticed that these clips are of a thinner quality clips and I am not sure how long it will be before they break. Nothing at all has happened with them, so I am hoping that although the material on the clips is thinner, it may be stronger.I plan to use them a while and if the material hold up, I will come back and adjust my review up to five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388LO5LWJT68B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O469778#wasThisHelpful","R388LO5LWJT68B","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a long time of reading reviews from all different places and making comparisons, I recently purchased a bathroom scale for the diet I am starting. I was so impressed by this company, not only in the value and specifications, but in what I could see was a remarkable customer service record. When I realized that a kitchen scale would be a great addition, I saw that the same company made these kitchen scales, and again I saw comments and noticed that this company also reaches out to consumers who may have had a problem, but did not let the company know that there was a problem and allow them to make it right.This kitchen scale is very easy to use and will weigh foods up to 11 to 12 pounds in weight. There are also other measurements  that you can shift over easily if your recipie requires other weight specification, with a simple push of the button. You can press the button to turn the scale on, place the container to hold the ingredients you are using and then press the Tare button and it will zero out the weight so that you are only weighing your ingredients. This is so easy that you don't have to be concerned about your ingredients rolling off the scale or inaccurate weights from trying to figure out the approximate weight of the container. This is a digital scale so thankfully you don't have to figure out the dial and where the hand is on the dial and with the older style scales the position of the food can actually effect the weight. The digital kitchen scale, like the digital bathroom scale are very easy to read, which in the case of the kitchen scale will make for correctly weighed ingredients. I tested the kitchen scale, and like the bathroom scale it displayed the same total weight when tested several times.As I stated before, this company is a very Consumer Service friendly company which is rare these days. Not only are they very helpful on the phone (I called them with a question about my bathroom scale), but they also reach out to reviewers who may have had a question about the product or had a problem with a product and never contacted Ozeri Customer Service for assistance. I, like many other reviewers recommend this Kitchen Multfunction Digital Scale.If for any reason, I find that I need to change my review of this product, I will update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRNOHVWOFWZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004164SRA#wasThisHelpful","R3VRNOHVWOFWZY","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I went to my niece's baby shower last month I found what I originally thought when I first looked at it for a VERY unusual feeding system for baby which looked like the water bottles hamster and mouse cages. After really looking at it, I realized that it was a prank box, that you put the real gift into, but when the expectant mother first unwraps it, she thinks that it is a real product, because the box has everything on it that a real product would have and a flap that tells her basically that it is a prank and her real gift is inside! That was right up my alley so I bought it on the spot.Like all Amazon's product pages, there was the section that says that if you liked the product on the page, you will also like these other products. I originally thought that the title was on a removable jacket on the book. My daughter was over and told me that there were a few of these books, and what you see is really what you get. I brought up the ""Look Inside"" and started reading what was the first few pages and sure enough, the title WAS a strong indicator of the story inside, but you could cover up the the part that says the title and still read the book. Again being the person that probably would do what many would be afraid to do I ordered the book to go into the prank box (relax I did get my niece several really nice gifts that were on her registry). What was nice was everybody got a laugh from the book and the box and they probably woke up a couple of the older ladies who were probably napping a bit. As I said, the story in the book is really cute and normal, basically it was the title that keeps showing up, so you could use white out for the obvious word(s) or just tape a little piece of paper over the words and then they could get a good laugh from a older child. I may be older in age, but I still have the sense of humor of a young adult. These type of gifts add some entertainment to the Baby Shower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGZLNE96KE1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617750255#wasThisHelpful","R1TGZLNE96KE1V","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I LOVE the Sistema brand of containers. I had the Noodle Bowl cup for the past year and used it all the time for soups and oatmeal,etc. I didn't realize that they also made juice containers, until I started a diet and had to drink more water. I like ice water when it is hot out or if I am very thirsty, but for the most part I don't really like water.I figured I could improve the taste of water by cutting up oranges, lemons and limes and let them ""steep."" This pitcher is made well and you have a knob on the top to open and close the pitcher, which with Rheumatoid Arthritis in my wrists, is very important. I was always been a kind of a klutz, but now it is ridiculous. All of the Sistema Klip Its are very help for freezing, cold drinks, reheats and especially with soup. The pitcher washes up easily and even after leaving the oranges, lemons and limes in the pitcher for some time there does not seem to have any odors, which is important when having a variety of other cold drinks in there.If anything occurs that require a change in my review, I will come back and update this review.''''''''''","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVLCLHZ4FAYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00284AG64#wasThisHelpful","RJVLCLHZ4FAYO","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how to put this....After my knee replacement, I guess that my replacement malfunctioned a few days after surgery while , luckily I was still in inpatient physical therapy and my entire right leg blew open from the top of my knee down almost to my ankle. It looked like there had been a bomb in it. I was medivaced to my Morristown Medical Center, where the very competent doctors not only saved my life but also saved my leg. The apparatus that malfunctioned sliced my nerves in the lower part of my right leg and I was not able to pull up my toes to point upward and had no feeling. I was told if I was very lucky the nerves would begin to repair themselves but it would only be about 1 millimeter per month (an extremely small measurement). I have gotten some of the feeling back but not enough to be able to drive a car. Since I live about 30 miles outside NEW York City, the traffic is horrendous at any time of day so driving is pretty much out of the question for a while, so I needed to have my daughter and friends get my groceries (oh yes believe it or not, my husband of 43 years died unexpectedly three days after my knee incident). I found that these HUGE and they are HUGE rolls of Bounty are great, especially the select a size so when I only need a sheet for a small job, I can just take a small sheet and there is much less waste. Some people are right, that the rolls might be a tight on some of their paper towel rack and I had that too. When I had to downsize after I was finally released from inpatient therapy after 4 months, I moved to a new place where the kitchen had just been renovated beautifully, but the top cabinets where the paper towel rack extends from, must have been put up by 7 foot men, because the cabinets are so high that it is difficult reaching the stuff in the top cabinets unless it get on a step stool which I am not about to do. I purchased a paper towel holder that sticks up under the cabinet and I did place it on the underside of the top cabinet and it is pretty easy to replace the roll and to dispense the amount of paper towels I need for the job. And the rack is plenty big enough to hold the huge rolls with absolutely no problem. The towels themselves are great and stronger than those other brands so they are great for cleanup. And I am kind of glad that they are not printed since I sometimes wrap a burger on a bun in the paper towel to reheat or to quickly cover the dish, although I now have the silicone covers that work great for that. These rolls last me a long time and I get the free shipping courtesy of my Prime Membership. I must be using the average amount because as soon as I get low the box appears at my door with a whole new supply and that is even that I give my daughter and her fiancé a pack of two rolls when the delivery arrives! I plan to keep using this method of receiving my paper towels because these rolls are larger than the ones I have seen in my local store, the quality and these ease of shipment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCTSVSTUN1LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQ2T06#wasThisHelpful","R1MCTSVSTUN1LK","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I moved into my new place the kitchen had been renovated very nicely, but the paper towel rack was difficult for me to reach to change the roll. I know it seems like a stupid thing to have to fix, but I also have rheumatoid and Osteoarthritis, a torn Rotator Cuff that was left I repaired by a surgeon I later found to be lacking, and fibromyalgia and a severe back injury, that all together make it very difficult to reach higher than normal. The person who did the renovation must have been very tall because most of the work (like cabinets...etc) is installed higher than usual.This towel holder was super easy for me to install myself. It was simple peel and stick. It is VERY strong adhesive hold and is easy to change the paper roll. I recommend this as a quick and versatile answer so that you can easily replace the towel hold where YOU want it located, without using nails and screws.

I looked through a bunch of boring black ones, but since it is for home I wanted something fun that wasn't really expensive. I found this one with different colors to choose from and chose the green color. I received it quickly and tried it today. It worked very well.

"I downsized and moved last year  after my husband passed away suddenly. We had a knife block that came with the knives he liked and over the years some were lost. I purchased a few Cutco knives including a set of steak knives. The old block we had for about thirty years and it really needed to be replaced, but I could not believe how expensive a knife block with no knives was about the same amount as one with knives. I searched last year through several places and found nothing. I also only needed about ten slots because I really only used those Cutco knives and one or two of his occasionally, but there wasn't much difference, the block was still expensive. I had kind of stopped searching because there didn't seem to be anything in my price point. A lot of time passed and all of a sudden this appeared on one of the pages and decided to get it because the price was definitely in my range. But for the price I really wasn't expecting much, but if it held my knives and stood up on four bottom pads (our old one had finally reach the tipping stage because two of the pad were lost.I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It is nice looking and it has weight to it. It seemed to be wood throughout because of the weight but I am not positive. I really like that it is all black and looks nice on the counter.

The was room for the big thick knife from Cutco and a couple more of the cooking knives and it also holds my six, wait scratch that five Cutco steak knives, with no problem. I did not notice a spot for scissors, so I just put them in the drawer with the rest of the things that aren't worth displaying as sit in the drawer waiting to be used.

"I have been using a hand mixer for many years in spite of my husband wanting to buy me the very expensive stand mixers. I feel that $350 -$700 for a stand mixer is ridiculous. My husband passed away almost two years ago and I downsized. In my new kitchen I decided to make the theme color orange because I really hate to cook for the most part and figured a happy color might raise my mood when I have to go in there to cook or bake. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia and discovered that I really needed a stand mixer, but wanted to get a good mixer without paying a ridiculously high price. I compared different brands and prices and when I found this one, nostalgia set in. My mother had a Sunbeam Stand Mixer, that looked very much like this one. When I compare items I also check out the customer reviews (a lot of reviews) and the reviews were very positive. A few reviewers even metioned that they had conditions similar to mine and had good results using this mixer. The mixer arrived quickly and arrived last Thursday, and I wanted to bake a cake. First of all I was impressed with the quality feel of this mixer. I liked how the beaters can be raised horizontally to take the bowl out. I positioned the bowl correctly and the bowl turned throughout the mixing  cycle. I stopped mid cycle and checked the bottom of the bowl and there was no dried part of the flour that had not been mixed in.  When I finished and was going place the batter into the pan, I noticed that the batter was smoother, with a more fluffy consistancy. There seemed to be more batter when put in the pan. The cake itself was tasty and had a nice texture. It was easy to clean up and the beaters and dough hooks can be stored right in the bowl for easy access. The several colors that this mixer comes in can match your kitchen. I picked the orange color that matched my kitchen colors beautifully. They also have this mixer in Sapphire Blue, Red, Pastel Pink, a pastel sage green and a few other colors.  the beaters and the. Dough hooks are especially well made. Especially the dough hooks, which are very large and sturdy. I'm sure I will be getting good use from this mixer and I would recommend this stand mixer to the average everyday cook. The only negative comment and it really doesn't apply to the Sunbeam Heritage Stand Mixer.....I wish they had included a smaller bowl along with it because since I live alone I need to make smaller size recipes and could use the smaller bowl much more.  But that said I realize thatIncluding the smaller bowl would drive up the cost and I have found a bowl that is supposed to be for this mixer at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDSSWNJGDRQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P6H23A#wasThisHelpful","RGDSSWNJGDRQZ","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I downsized and moved to a smaller place last year I purchased a Lysol Dish Soap Automatic Dispenser, which was not at all expensive when I originally bought the dispenser which came with 2 eight oz specially designed dispenser bottles. The sticker shock came when I went in to buy more bottles of soap for the dispenser, thinking that it was Lysol so how expensive could it be. Sellers were selling two  eight oz refills for $29.99, which is beyond ridiculous. My sister bought me a four pack from BJ's for $9.99, but I found out that those refills that looked exactly like the ones that came with the dispenser were actually for the bathroom dispenser and we're just a very slight difference that made it not work on the kitchen dispenser. We didn't see the refills in any local stores so that avenue was out. They were still selling the kitchen dispenser with the two refills for $9.99, so I bought a couple of sets which lasted me through the winter. I found refills for the kitchen dispenser for eight dollars for the 8 oz refill, so I bought two. When they were done I realized that I was paying a ridiculous amount of money just to put soap in the dispenser. I purchased an automatic dispenser and bought these to fill it with. There are two 36 oz bags for around $9.99 here on Amazon so I am now getting 72 oz of dish soap for almost the same as buying one Lysol eight oz refill. I have dumped the Lysol Dispenser. I just couldn't afford it!The soap has a nice citrus orange scent and seems to work well with the new dispenser. All I have to do is refill the well. I recommend spending a bit more for a dispenser but you will save a lot in the long run.

The shower head would just hang down because I could not reach the bracket that the shower head is supposed to sit in for regular use.

I went in to take a shower and realized that one of the cleaning people had placed the shower head up in the top bracket that I cannot reach and I have a grabber, but I couldn't get the shower head unsnapped from the bracket. It was almost funny because all the previous cleaning days no one had done that. Luckily my daughter lives down the street and was able to stop over the next day to bring it down. I ordered this after seeing it on Amazon. I serves its purpose well and so far the suction has stayed firm. Now I place the shower head in the clamp and it should send a message to whoever is cleaning the bathroom, that is where the shower head should be.I recommend this for anyone who uses the long hose shower head if for any other reason , then to hold the shower head while soaping up or shampooing. Also bath seats are becoming more common and it is better to have the shower head at a proper height. If there is any change with this review I will come in and put an update on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SSVVPF6FIVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GPGLVK#wasThisHelpful","R30SSVVPF6FIVA","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this mat for more secure footing because the mat I had was long enough, but constantly wrinkled up in the bottom of the tub  and was a bit slippery. The grassy texture I figured would not be as slick. It was listed as a bathtub mat, so I figured the length would be ok. I removed it from the package and realized that it was not long at all for even a normal size bathtub that had been installed about a year ago. I have several problems including two knee replacements and two hip replacements and a permanent severe back injury that prevents me from standing for any length of time, so I have a shower stool. I can put the bath mat from right before the drain and it goes up about one half of the tub in length. It seems to cover the area my feet are for standing up and when I move the stool back further to swivel the seat and get out. The grassy texture feels good on the feet and didn't seem to be too slippery. There are several suction cups underneath, but the mat still moves around. I am going to wet down the surface of the tub floor and try to get the suction cups to adhere. It is difficult because I can't get down on my hands and knees to push on every suction cup. Plus I have cleaning people who take the mat out for the regular cleaning.Right now I am giving it three stars because calling it a bathtub mat is stretching it because of the length and I have had bath mats in the past that just by putting it in the bottom of the tub, the suction cups would quickly adhere. I should have measured the length of the tub before ordering and would suggest anyone planning to order should do. The color is a nice green and adds a pop of color to a boring white bathtub.If there is any change in my evaluation of this mat I will do an update here in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3582SKQCULV1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNZB16M#wasThisHelpful","R3582SKQCULV1Q","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed reading this series. Actually I didn't know it was a series when I started reading ""Going Home."" It begins with a man trying to get home after an unspecified event spun the country back to a time without electricity, refridgeration, and rendered more modern cars useless. It does allude to this man being somewhat of a ""Prepper"" but not a crazy one. Just a guy who wanted to make sure his family would be OK in the event something happens. Going Home chronicals him trying to get home with not only the trouble you would imagine with no food, electric, access to doctors etc....but a more lawless world like we sometimes see today when people see or create an opportunity to take anything they want and to hell with anyone else. A world where you trust no one even children and never turn your back on anyone. He will see some really bad people, but will also meet others, who may be people that will be needed in the future. There are a total of five or six books but do not read this one first. Your enjoyment and understanding of relationships and occurances will mean so much more when read chronologically.  I was hoping there was going to be another, but nothing right now so I will keep checking. What happens in the books will show how far a man has to be pushed to save his friends and family and how important trusted friends and family are.  As I said there is quite a bit about the difference of being prepared in case of something happens with far reaching effects and not being prepared at all, but I did not feel that the author was beating me over the head with a one ton weight to get the point across. I recommend these stories that in order make up a very satisfying book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRYURWZYM2XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWDJ2J8#wasThisHelpful","R1TRYURWZYM2XN","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this toaster here on Amazon and kept putting it into the save for later file. My kitchen major color is orange so I was thril'ed that an orange toaster was available. I was shopping on Walmart for other items and this came up at a price majorly lower than here. So I grabbed it. They said that the orange color was exclusive to Walmart so I don't know.......This toaster looks great on the counter with the sides an orange color and shiny chrome on top and front panel where the controls are. It is very lightweight. The orange color is more like pumpkin, not some crazy neon. I toasted a bagel this morning and it came out great. I would suggest setting the dial at a bit lower than the center for average toasting.it has a crumb tray that you can slide out and clean. The directions say that you can store the cord underneath when not in use. I use mine almost every day, so I just leave it plugged in. I also says that if you are toasting bagels or English muffins, you should put them in the toaster with the rougher inside toward the center. Depending on the amount of counter space you have, you could put it horizontally so the colored side is facing out. I have very little counter space, so I need to position it vertically, but the color still shows. This seems to be a good toaster, not only in appearance, but in operation and uses. There is a button for bagels and the direction booklet tells you how to toast frozen bread right from the freezer. I recommend this toaster, just shop around for price. This toaster also comes in several fun colors, maybe here on Amazon or where I got mine. Some of the colors I saw were red, pink, purple, teal, blue....","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PSYHV4PJX5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJY6FDK#wasThisHelpful","R19PSYHV4PJX5H","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this brush, but I wish they made it in a large size too. This one is small, like a brush you would carry in your bag. I came in to Amazon looking for this brush, just larger and the only one I found had a wooden handle and seemed to be the same size as this one. I needed several surgeries on my knee and with the brutal winter we had with bitter cold weather and snow every few days, I didn't get out much and my thin, fine hair did what thin fine hair does best and tangled horribly. As luck would have it, the day this brush arrived, I had a doctor's appointment and since I can't drive two of my friends drove me and surprised me with a appointment at the hair salon, so by the time I used it, my hai was much shorter. But from what I can tell it works like a brush should work, nothing more, nothing less. I also have a problem with my rotator cuff so on the one side, I can brush the front and the side, but because the brush is small I can't get the back.I actually believe this brush is only perfectly sized for young children and like I said to throw in your bag when going out, but you would still need a full size brush in my opinion. It is for this reason it gave it three stars instead of four.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WFGGT5ZRCQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLO0YGW#wasThisHelpful","R30WFGGT5ZRCQB","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They were one of these Seen On TV items and they seemed interesting, but my daughter tells me that I am a telemarketers dream......I didn't order them through the OSOTV order phone number because for some reason it takes them six to eight weeks to mail them out and by the time they arrive you forget you even ordered them. So I found them and ordered them here and got them right away under Prime. Anyway my daughter took them shopping and it seems that they do just what they are supposed to do and they do it well. My daughter told me that our local grocery store has a scanner on the cart so you scan the item and put it in the bag and when you are done you just take the scanner to the register and pay.  These bags are really good for that because the bags are already packed so you can just pay and go. They are very roomy, not like the reusable bags sold by most of our local stores. They are larger and they stay straight up in the car and they don't fall over like other bags. If you self scan or clerk scan, after groceries are on conveyer, just position the bags in the cart and either you or the clerk can just put the items in the bags after scanning at the register. If you have a larger family you probably need more than two. My daughter even said that she would like one of these bags in the insulated style for the upcoming summer, when it gets hot in the car and you can't leave groceries in the car very long. I have a problem with my knee right now so I can't drive, but when I can I am going to pick up a couple for myself.I or rather my daughter, recommend these bags. Make sure you get the Grab Bags brand since there seem to be bags that look like these also sold, but these are the bags that I bought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVPB9D9AUXIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTSV3BG#wasThisHelpful","R3BVPB9D9AUXIF","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I collect watches. What I have noticed that I miss is the day/date feature that isn't on most watches. Some have the small date number at the three o'clock position but since I only need glasses for reading, I can't just glance down, but I have to put on glasses. Just to see the date. This watch has all the information and I actually don't need glasses to see the info I am looking for. It is exactly the color in the picture. It has an indiglo feature and it lights up bright enough to see everything on the face of the watch. It also has timers and stop watch settings that I don't use and it can be set to chime on the hour which I do have set. It is not so loud as to be annoying or probably even noticed by anyone else. You can leave it on in the shower and use it for swimming but not diving. I have only had a couple of weeks, but it is keeping time very well. It also has 24 hour (military) time, but I use the 12 hour AM/PM time.I recommend this watch if it has the options you are looking for in a watch.

"I purchased this after I moved and one day I realized that I didn't have a plunger. Good thing I hadn't needed a plunger💩!This set fits perfectly. One reviewer said it was too big for and apartment bathroom. Well I have lived in several apartments in my lifetime and none was as small as I have now which is a one person occupancy only!🚹 Anyway I put it alongside the back side of the vanity between the vanity and the back of the toilet and it fits fine. I have had it since October and it looks great, but of course I haven't had to use either piece. The cleaning ladies come every other week and in between the continuous cleaners work well.I am pleased with the purchase as one can be with an item such as this....I mean I don't conduct tours to show it to visitors or anything, but it certainly looks a lot better than those ugly brown plungers and the equally ugly brushes that usually were on the floor of the linen closet. My linen closet is in the hall now and is carpeted so I wouldn't want the brush in there.

"My husband purchased this brush for me because I have a problem with rotation of my shoulder. At first it seemed to work, but this past several month I couldn't get out much and didn't get my hair cut and with longer hair it would not get down to the scalp, especially in the back where I really needed it. It kind of glides over the top layer. Also it is not good at all on hair that tangles after washing. It does not brush without painful pulling. The nubs at the end each plastic bristle fall off and make it very difficult to clean the hair out.I came in to shop here to get another long handled brush, only to find out that it appears THIS brush under different names is the only one made. That is terrible but not surprising. I seems many aids for people with ability problems, are made by one company with no competition which translates to terrible products because they don't care to improved parts, like the horrible bristles on this brushI guess I will look around, but for now it seems this brush, the same brush under different names is the only games in town and don't think these companies don't know it!UPDATE.....5/19/15 I again checked out all the brushes and purchased one by Drive Medical. The bristles are firm and when I comb the back the brush goes down to my scalp. I also just got my hair cut. I am hoping that the bristles stay in an upright position. The old brush had many bristles that were more horizontal than vertical.  I plan to review the new brush on the Amazon page for it and I am hoping this brush lasts longer and serves me better. As I said above, it seems that aids for disabled people are priced very high with little selection. The people are so happy to have anything that they give it five stars no matter what. That is why these companies do not see the need to re evaluate items that  have received reviews outlining real world problems.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14LNBLHH1BN43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M25QGY#wasThisHelpful","R14LNBLHH1BN43","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last summer I adopted a new cat that I named Toby. He is a Lynx Point Siamese with beautiful coloring. He is also smart and crafty. When I first got him, I used to joke that I didn't ever have to wash his dish because he cleaned off every little morsel. I still can't believe that he was almost euthanized in a southern state, but was saved by one of our local shelters. I figured that the volunteers at the shelter taught him well. After a few weeks, I realized that if a cat could be a vegetarian, Toby was it. He eats his kibble well, but he has a strange affinity for stuff on the meat or fish, but not the actual meat or fish. I tried a lot of different foods and he loves the Gravy Lovers cat food....he eats all the gravy and leaves the meat or fish. I get it for him because he drives me crazy every night for his YumYums! He also loves the cat food called Broths.So. every time he eats his gravy or broths and cleans off all the meat/fish, he does what a call the Poopie Scoopingg maneuver, where he moved as in covering the food . Sometimes if  he hasn't quite finished all his gravy/broth I don't want to take it away. He also loves to scoop out pieces of kibble and chase them around the kitchen floor, sometimes dumping over the bowl of kibble onto the floor. I have purchased several bowls for his food. Some were too small and even if the size was all right the bowl was too light and still too easy to flip over.These bowl are a nice size and have just enough weight to prevent tipping over by Toby. They are also attactive, well made and wide enough to clear his whiskers,, that I read about that if the eating area too small,  It can hurt his whiskers .  I must have put the dish in the cart twice, because when they arrived, it indicated that I ordered two. The inside is a pretty sky blue and the outer edge is like a black/dark brown with a raised sky blue mouse on the outer edge. Toby eats well out.of it with occasional Poopie Scoop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAMOPFNDKWHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CRBBNO#wasThisHelpful","R3PAMOPFNDKWHH","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the colors in this valance. I moved a few months ago after my husband passed away. We were married 42 years and my husband, a policeman/detective loved his home and his family and we usually picked out items for our home together. So when I moved into my new place I realized that I would have to decide what colors etc...I wanted. Since cooking is not really a passion for me, I decided to make the kitchen nice and bright. I did an accent wall in a bright pumpkin (not neon) color. I bought a set of Rachael Ray cookware in orange and bought other items in orange. I bought a set of typical cafe curtains, but the top part was way too short and looked terrible. It was now November, so I found a  really cute valance with snowmen that looked good over the blinds and left the lower part of the window open for my cat Toby to take his naps. I spent hours looking a valances and nothing jumped out until I found these.First of all the valance, in my opinion is even nicer than the picture. The colors pop nicely without being tacky. It is not pleated like it appears in the picture. Also it first appeared to be, at least to me, to be made of a heavy lined material. It is NOT. The material is a bit thin, but not cheesy. I actually like that the valance is not pleated and heavy because those styles would be better in other rooms than the kitchen.Reading the reviews, I understood that the material was more or less breezy, but my problem was, how breezy. I also have blinds on the window, so I realized that the blinds would keep the light from giving the colors a washed out appearance. My window itself is 34 inches wide and I realized that if there was enough material, it could be arranged to appear more robust. I bought two valances, we put them up and they are perfect. One of the colors actually matches my accent wall. It is tightly bunched together, because it  is 144 inches of material and my actual window itself is 34 inches, but it looks fine and the colors do not get washed out by the light coming through the window, even when the blinds are all the way up or open. I imagine that if one valance is not enough, you could get the two and cut off a few inches from the second one and it would not be noticeable due to the way you can bunch it.Bottom line, I recommend this valance (s). It is colorful, bright and happy! I hope this review helps. I have tried touch on all the points that you might need to know in order to make a decision. As always, if anything changes my opinion from what I have shared here, I will update this review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Q5UUIA4ABFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNE8H0E#wasThisHelpful","R19Q5UUIA4ABFH","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i had a set of Corelle about 30 years ago and loved them, but my husband hated them, so after months of his whining😢, I gave in and we bought stoneware. My husband passed away a year and a half ago and I moved last summer. I bought new things for the new kitchen including the orange Rachael Ray cookware. I did bring the multi colored stoneware and bought the Fiesta silverware. I have RA, and the stoneware had become just too heavy, especially since for the first time in forty years I don't have a dishwasher🙀.  I was looking at the Corelle dish sets and came upon the ""Happy Days"" pattern and loved it. It came in the Amazon Prime two days and I was impressed with the way it was packed. It was in an Amazon shipping box with air pillows and the box with the dishes was well wrapped in bubble wrap taped securely so it stayed on. It took me quite a while to get the inner box open, but it was great because the set arrived perfectly with no chips, cracks or breaks. The pattern has the pop of color that the other Correlle patterns seem to lack. The dinner dishes are huge. The salad/dessert plates are more the size of my stoneware dinner plates, but they are all lightweight and easy to handle. As many other reviewers have stated, the dishes are all made from the well known Corelle materials, BUT the mugs are stoneware. I really don't know why, because the set we had all those years ago were made from the same material as the dishes. The mugs are a bit larger than my old stoneware mugs. I have an original one single serve Keurig Coffee Maker and the mug just fits. The dishes even match my kitchen curtains and accent walls.The only thing that is a bit strange, but I noticed seems to be the same with all patterns, is that the bowl is all white with a rim that matches the rust colored flower on the dishes. Even a flower at the bottom of the bowl would tie the bowl more in with the dishes. I don't find it a huge problem just an observation.Finally, I STRONGLY suggest you read the use and care instructions included with the dishes. There are some guidelines that you might not think about. The one that stuck out to me was not to use the dish in the microwave with food that includes a crisping sheath like Hot Pockets. Again, not a huge problem, but good to be aware of. Otherwise I recommend the Corelle dishes and especially the Happy Days pattern!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AY1CR8BV05F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EZU7WU#wasThisHelpful","R2AY1CR8BV05F8","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two kitchen dispensers last summer expecting to use one in the bathroom. My sister was in BJ's and picked up a 3 pack for$9.99 and it said Hand Soap but looked the same. I decided to try it and it didn't work because there was just a small fraction of difference between the Kitchen Refill and the Hand Soap Refill. I came back on Amazon and purchased a Hand Soap Dispenser. What really annoyed me was that greedy sellers were selling two refills for $29.99 which is ridiculous! So I got inventive and got out a small cake decorating set I bought on Amazon which included a syringe like apparatus (where you would put the icing) and a narrow round tip. I inserted it into the empty bottle and pulled out the air and filled the syringe thing with my regular liquid soap and stuck the tip and syringe fill with soap into the hole on the empty bottle. I pushed the plunger and filled the bottle with my own soap and it worked. That is what a seller gets when they charge too much! before I figured out the refill process I bought 2 more kits with the dispenser and 2 refills for $11.00.I was surprised when I came in looking at the hand soap and found six refills for $22.00' which is a good price, plus it was Prime with Two Day free shipping.My hand soap dispenser must have sensed that I bought a years supply of soap (the refill for me goes a long way), because every time I left the bathroom I would hear it dispense soap. So I came in a bought another Hand Soap Dispenser because they are very handy to have. It will be delivered tomorrow. Last night I took the badly behaving bathroom dispenser and inspected it. It looked clean except right by where the soap comes out. I cleaned it and while I was at it I washed the sensor and tried it again. It has been 24 hours and not one unneeded blob of soap. I still have the same batteries that I installed when I got it and they still seem ok, the clocks change tomorrow, so maybe I will put in new batteries so I won't have to worry.My kitchen has peach and orange colors so I bought two of these refills, which were still way cheaper @ $8.50 each than the $30.00 for two,","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DFB6YJ8114G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IOYZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R4DFB6YJ8114G","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love these Tunnels! Got 2 tunnels for less than the cost of one. At first my cat, Toby didn't know quite what to make of them, but now he loves them. He moves them around himself and he had a round scratch pad with a ball in a track around the outside. He hits the ball and runs into the tunnel which ends at the scratch circle and hits the ball again and hides from the ball in the tunnel. The tunnels are well made and keep their shape!10/16/15 UPDATE I have had these tunnels for almost a year and I really want to say that if you are on the fence about getting these tunnels, take the plunge. I bought these for my 2 year old cat named Toby. They were very well priced when I bought them and for the price, I didn't expect much. Well I am very impressed. They have retained their shape and they stand up to Toby running through them, back and forth. I have one of those circular scratch pads with a ball that spins around on the track on the outer edge. Toby goes to the end of the one tunnel and hits the ball so it goes fast around the track and he runs around and ""hides"" in the tunnel and then does the same thing over and over. With the smaller tunnel, I position it so the opening is in front of the track and he goes in the tunnel reaches out and smacks the ball so it rolls around the track and he backs up so that ""wacky ball can't find him!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3US9IMS0RO33X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2G83K0#wasThisHelpful","R3US9IMS0RO33X","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a BIG bowl. I like it better. After over 40 years caring for kitty family members, my new cat TOBY is a real trip.he is very interested when I roll the container with his cat food over by his dish and scoop new food to fill the dish. Shortly after I hear noise in the kitchen and he is dumping the bowl over. He also likes to take pieces of the kibble and plays what I call food hockey around the kitchen! I bought him a bowl a couple of weeks ago that was wider and flatter with rubber around the base. At first I thought that it would do the trick but even though it is supposed to hold two cups of food,it seems to empty too quickly and it is so light weight that TOBY pushes the bowl and the tray it sits on around the room and I almost killed myself falling over it where it wasn't supposed to be! I decided my quest for the perfect bowl was not over.When this bowl arrived today it almost looked too big, but once I washed it put it down and added food it seemed good. TOBY seemed to sense the bowl was for him as I worked to get it out of the bubble wrap and tape. (All the tape and bubble wrap is good because it does not come in a box and it arrived in good condition. So far bowl it upright and food is all still in it and it has been a whole four hours. It seems sturdy and well made and not too light. Right now I am pleased with this purchase. If there is any change in my review of this bowl I will update at that time.UPDATE: 5/25/2015Well, if I could give this bowl ten stars, I would. Even though he has tried, my cat Toby cannot dump this bowl over, no matter how hard he tries! It fits a nice 2 very full scoops of the dry cat food and I don't have to constantly refill it often. He also cannot seem to move the bowl and the plastic kitty tray it sits on more than a couple of inches. He still tries to dump the bowl right after I fill it and I don't have any idea why because he eats it all the time. As my daughter tells him...sometimes he is  a little weirdo! So with the way this bowl has worked so well for me for the past four months I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFU1J59TQSFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O68Z5E#wasThisHelpful","R1WFU1J59TQSFY","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter introduced me to the Contigo brand a few months ago when she showed me a 16 oz travel cup and explained how they really don't leak. Until then even the ones that say leak proof always manage to leak. I bought that one in the store that day and loved it. I am very klutzy and am forever knocking over glasses, cups, you name it. I recently moved into a place with the scourge of my existence....beige carpeting!  The cup worked very well and even when I knocked it over, it didn't leak a drop. So I went on Amazon and bought the same type of travel cup in 20 oz for going to Dunkin Donuts, which had a great addition. There is an additional fail safe on this cup that locks the AutoSeal button so that it cannot get pushed by accident in your bag. All the Contigo Cups I bought have AutoSeal which is that when you want to take a sip you push the AutoSeal button and as soon as you take your finger off the button it automatically reseals. Then I found cold drink cups that have a lid that seals so you can shake up your drink like a smoothie or iced coffee after you add cream and sugar and then you push the straw through the straw opening.Finally I found these water bottles. They have a few different colors. I bought myself purple and bought my daughter the light green one. What I love about this water bottle is that you don't have to unscrew the lid Like so many water bottles have. The is no little cap to lose. This water bottle has AutoSeal technology too and like the travel cups you push the AutoSeal button, sip the water and let go of the button and it reseals. I use all the cups for different beverages almost every day and they have had no degradation in the AutoSeal and I have not spilled a drop, not one...which is big news for me.I wash all the cups and glasses by hand. I bought a package of acrylic replacement straws in case something happens to the straws that come with the Shake bottles (the water bottle and travel cups have no need for straws since they have the complete AutoSeal and the Shake bottles also reseal when the straw is not in place and I haven't had a spill even when the straw was in place). In with the replacement straws was a brush to clean the straws and I bought a bottle cleaner to get the bottles and cups clean. Some people use a dishwasher, but I think the parts will last longer with hand washing. When hand washing I depress the AutoSeal button and run hot water through the opening. Some of the cups have an inside lever that you pull up while washing.I highly recommend these cups. They are the BEST I have ever used. And I purchased every one of my cups. I did not receive any free for a good review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WCOCAKHM9EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A74ZU18#wasThisHelpful","R20WCOCAKHM9EQ","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat TOBY just loves to tip over his dry food bowl right after I fill it. We can't figure out why he does that because he likes the food and eats it up. I looked at all these different bowls and it can drive you crazy because some reviewers say that their cat knocked over the bowl and others say that it is great and the cat can't flip it over or send it flying over the tile Kitchen floor. The one thing that I did notice was that mostly all of the qcat food bowls seemed to come in one cup capacity. It is hard to picture how big the one cup bowl really is, so for the dry food, I went with the one bowl I found that had two cup capacity for the dry food.At night I give TOBY either the Broths or a three oz can of Gravy Lovers Dinner. I add a little water to especially the Gravy Lovers, and I guesstimated that the one cup capacity bowl would be fine. When the two bowls arrived on Thursday, I was a bit surprised by how small this one was and I was glad that I went for the two cup capacity bowl for his dry food.With this bowl I put the three ounce can of gravy lovers into the bowl and I add the water an stir. When take it to where he eats it is pretty full and now I am thinking that I should have just gotten two of the two cup dishes. Well time will tell if there is a major problem with this smaller size bowl. The bowl itself is nice the color is very close to the picture and with the wider base there would be less chance of it being flipped over.  It really depends how much you plan to feed your pet as to which size is the right size.As always if I need to I will update this review.UPDATE: July 21, 2015I used this bowl for a little while but Toby was constantly trying to tip it over and sometimes he almost did. I finally found a stoneware bowl that had substantial weight, and he definately has not even come close to tipping it over. Problem solved and some little kitty waiting for their furever home will have a nice little dish to eat from at our local no kill pet shelter where I donated the bowl to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKOI2F726R01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AHUDQK#wasThisHelpful","RUKOI2F726R01","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently moved and needed to replace the under the bed Rubbermaid Clear.Storage Container which was shaped like thi but it had wheels.I figured I would buy this because I read something about inserts and I thought the inserts were portioning off spaces in this container. Well I was wrong. The inserts were wooden pieces slid into the outer was of the container because unlike the clear plastic one if you don't put the inserts around the perimeter, the whole top will cave in. Even with the inserts in place,  it bends and wobbles because the inserts are not like four pieces one for each side. Instead there are several and in between the pockets you put the inserts in there is nothing to stabilize the rectangular shape and it goes into all kinds of configurations which makes it difficult to place under the bed. I did finally find one of the plastic ones and I gave this to my daughter so she can put her winter clothes in it and take it to the storage unit.I would not recommend this especially if you plan to use it like it do for shoes nesessitating pulling it out from under the bed when you want to get out different shoes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QW1RD89GXYKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JF5R8Q#wasThisHelpful","R1QW1RD89GXYKD","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat TOBY, has a plastic base on his food dish 👩😴with 2 indentations to place metal food dishes.  For some reason right after I  fill the bowl with the dry cat food, he flips it over. He eats the food completely and seems to like it so I just figure he thinks that it is funny when I end up having to sweep the food up. I bought this bowl in blue even though the picture is pink. It does hold about 2 cups of the Friskies Grillers and it looks like the picture but it is not heavy or weighted at all. It is very light. I only took one star off for that. The reason I am giving it four stars is because it looks like it does on line, it holds quite a bit of food AND I put it down Thursday night and filled it with food and he hasn't flipped it over........YET!!! If he does I will come back to update this review.I would recommend this bowl and especially this size because a large amount of cat feeding dishes are half this size at one cup. Toby is a 10 lb cat and I really can't see using any of the one cup bowls for him.I give him one of the 3 oz cans of  Gravy Lovers Cat Food and I add a little water to the food in the one cup bowl I bought him for that purpose and it fills the bowl right up.UPDATE: I finally purchased a stonewere bowl with some weight to it and have had no problems since. I did not take away any stars, because technically my cat never tipped the bowl over, which is why I bought the bowl in the first place. It IS a very light bowl for it's capacity and I am sure that a larger cat would find a way to dump it over. I finally donated this bowl to our local pet shelter so some other cat can get a really nice looking bowl to take home or a kitty ,who is waiting for their furever home will have a nice bowl to eat from!☺️💜","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKSSRUQAUOAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HSQRDK#wasThisHelpful","R2NKSSRUQAUOAV","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Living Room/Dining Area. The Living Room Area has 2 accent walls in blue and in the Dining Area I have an accent wall behind the table in green. I fell in love with this pattern immediately when I saw it but just to make sure I scouted thru Amazon for a couple of hours. I still liked these the best followed by another set named Little Italy. When these arrived they were even better than on line. The colors are vibrant and the pattern is beautiful. They do tend to move when my cat, TOBY jumps up but other than that they are more stable than the cloth ones and definitely better than the Bamboo Slat set I got before this one. The Bamboo ones had green colors and not only did they slide around but the collapsed inward because there is thin bamboo slats woven together so if you were to hold them on your hands, whatever was not actually sitting on your hands, will just flop down.These are made of vinyl, nothing fancy but as I said beautiful. They wash off very easily and if they slide perhaps check on line or a crafts store for some kind of silicone pads that you could put in each corner so that they grip the table. I am going to see how much they actually slide and then make adjustments.  These will be great right through the spring/summer. I definately recommend them because they are BEAUTIFUL and I usually get excited about placemats!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6K3PFIMXLND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J1RXUC#wasThisHelpful","R1G6K3PFIMXLND","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen all different types of chalk boards on my shopping trips through Amazon, but really didn't think I needed one. I just moved and downsized following the unexpected death of my husband, and somehow my canisters ( Flour, Sugar, Rice, etc...) somehow didn't make the journey😧. I bought OGGI clear acrylic canisters and decided to put chalkboard labels on them for something different and while I was at it I have a big wall in the kitchen that I hadn't figured out what to do with. In addition to the labels, I decided while I was at it to do a chalk board on the wall.This is a really good buy compared to others I saw. I didn't realize how much product there was. I read up on some of the other larger sized chalk board paper and the biggest complaint was that they were folded before packaging and when buyers open them the seams were difficult to get out when trying to apply them. Since I can't hang a picture straight, my daughter came over to help. It was great that the contact paper was on a roll so there were no creases to make application more difficult to apply. We cut two good size pieces one I plan to put notes on and the other would hold my shopping list. They applied easily and look good. There was even enough for my daughter to have a good size chalkboard for her place, all from this one roll.

"I just received the salt and pepper shakers and grinder (the set). Out of the box they look fine for a bit over $10.00. But when I held the salt shaker it seems awful light to have salt pre filled as it states in the product page description AND on the box. That is why I bought this particular set. It says on the product page ""Comes prefilled and ready to use"" and on the box it says ""Proudly Filled in the USA. Since it is indicated in two different places I am not wrongly expecting a filled set, because that is what ""ready to use"" means to me! I am planning to contact seller to advise them to change what the product page says so that this won't happen to someone else. I am glad that these were for my own kitchen and not a gift, as that could have been embarrassing. I have seen lots of prefilled Salt and Pepper sets in stores and BOTH are filled.As to the buyer who had so much trouble filling the salt. I simply put a piece of tape outside of the salt shaker, covering all the holes, turned the shaker upside down and filled it. Put the cap on and turn it up right and remove the tape! I didn't lose any salt doing that. In reply to the reviewer who couldn't get the cap open on the salt, I thought mine was hard to unscrew, but then I remembered the old saying ""Lefty Loosy and Tighty Righty."" I attempted to turn to the left and it worked.As I stated, it only cost $10.98, and it does have at least the pepper filled, so other than the omission of the salt, they don't seem bad at all. I didn't expect stainless steel or any other metal for the price. On a more positive note, the are a good size, which is great for me because I hate filling the S&P!

"I wanted to label my canisters, so I decided to try something I had never used before and get chalkboard labels and chalk markers. I also bought a large chalkboard sheet for the wall to decorate and write notes and shopping lists. I also went crazy trying to figure out which markers to buy and I decided to go with a very inexpensive set of bright dry erase markers that some other posters had recommended. For what I wanted that was a mistake, so I went back into Amazon and found this set of liquid chalk markers and the difference was like night and day.These markers are large and when you shake them you can feel the fluid in the barrel. The colors are nice and bright and they write smooth clean lines that are more like a marker. They are versatile with a tip that can go from chisel tip to bullet tip by just turning the tip around. I noticed that you can erase your work completely by using a damp cloth, because some remnants remained when I used just a dry paper towel. It does completely erase though. I recommend these markers, rather than less expensive choices (these are NOT the most expensive at $18.99, with many sets well over $20.00). Your final product will look really nice!IN REGARD TO COMMENTS MADE BY A REVIEWER NAMED ""CRAZYHAPPYMOMMY"" who has NOT PURCHASED THESE MARKERS yet GAVE THEM A 3 STAR RATING.....I did NOT receive these markers for free or at a reduced price. I paid $18.99 for them after studying reviews for hours before settling on PURCHASING these. I have NEVER written a positive review for anything that I didn't feel earned it!

"I purchased these placemats to place n my table that has oak edges with terra cotta tiles in the main part. I was surprised when they arrived and they were not stiff and firm like most placemats are. If you were to place the mat in the palm of your hand, the only part that will stay straight is what is on your palm. The rest will flop down. Also there is no backing, so they slide all over the tiles on the table ANF will not stay in place. May I should have considered the possibility of these problems, but I don't think that most people would foresee these problems. It would cost me more to return them so I will probably give them to someone who can actually use them!UPDATE 5/25/15. I tried to use these again and still found them to be very annoying. A breeze could make them move around the table and it makes the table look messy add that to having a cat and the fact that my table is near the front door because I have a Living room/Dining area, they just are not of any use to me. I can't even give them away because my friends and relatives can see that they would have the same problems as I have been having. It is a shame that there is no stiff backing that has a non slip surface. A positive note is that they are separate bamboo sticks woven together so you can just roll the placemat up to store it and when you use it, it lies flat right away. I am sure the problems I have had with these placemats might not be a problem for someone else, because they do look nice, so it is up to each individual what works best for them.

"A few months ago I purchased a single one of these Oggi canisters for my flour. I had just downsized and moved to a place with less storage, and my canister set had seen better days so they didn't make the move. I realized when I needed flour that I would have to get something to put flour in so I found the single Oggi and decided to try it. It worked so well that I decided that I needed one for sugar and after I received a rice cooker I wanted for Christmas, I would need a canister for the rice. I priced the single canisters and saw a three or four canister set that was about thirty dollars when I came across this set with FIVE canisters for twenty one dollars and it was on Prime.  The largest one used about three and a half pounds of sugar and the second largest held I believe four pounds of the five pound bag of rice. I also bought chalkboard labels to label each canister.

"After my husband passed away suddenly last year I decided to downsize and I moved last summer. A lot of things from our forty two years of marriage ended up in storage and my daughter is doing a phenominal job on doing our family tree, so we are going through pictures. She wanted to scan pictures and save them onto an external hard drive so they all could be together, so she used some of the Amazon Gift Card I got her for Christmas to buy the hard drive. I realized what a great idea that was, so I spent some time on Amazon checking out all the different models and the pros and cons of each. I knew that I wanted 1TB so that narrowed it a bit, and I read tons of reviews on each. What I liked about this one was that it was shock proof, scratch proof etc...I am very careful with my electronics, but everyone drops things occasionally, so I was really interested in what this one had to offer. I liked the way the USB cord wrapped and attached to the Hard Drive Itself. I figured there would be less chance of it getting lost. My daughter put all the pictures we have scanned already on to mine. She said it was fast and worked well.The only negative thing about it and it was not enough to take away a star was that the cord attaches to two clips, one on each side. However the small black clips are not permanently attached to either the hard drive or the USB cord and they fall off quite easily. They fell off the first time a couple of minutes after I took the hard drive out of the box and again when my daughter gave it back to me after adding the pictures. I originally planned not to buy a case, like I usually do for all my electronics, because of the shock proof and scratch proof properties. I decided to get one so that I could be sure that I didn't lose the cord or one of the clips. All the cases come in as different sizes as there are portable hard drives. I took the dimensions of the hard drive from the product page and then compared them with the dimensions of available cases in the price point I wanted to pay and I found an Orico case on Amazon which was reasonably priced. I chose the green color and was surprised when it arrived that it fit the hard drive like a glove and the green almost matched the green edging on the hard drive.I would recommend this portable hard drive because it works very well and has plenty of space for a lot of storage. As I stated, the loose clips to fasten the cord onto the unit does not effect the way the hard drive works, so unless that would be a deal breaker, you could pick up a case and be assured you won't lose the cord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPEW4W6MF6AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN0P5Q0#wasThisHelpful","R1NPEW4W6MF6AB","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had purchased the set of five Oggi Clear Acrylic Canisters and wanted to label them for Flour, Sugar, Brown Rice and White Rice. I also got Decorative Chalkboard Labels. I noticed that one reviewer suggested these to write on the labels. She said they worked well and were much cheaper than getting the chalk pens. She was right these did work well and they wiped off cleanly from the label when I wanted to do a couple over. The price is only a fraction of the cost of the chalk pens, so you might want to try these out.UPDATE: I dropped stars from 5 down to 3I purchased a large chalkboard wall sheet for notes and shopping lists that I wanted to decorate and wanted more vibrant colors ( as I looked at the canisters I realized that the colors were really muted and not as bright as pictured. I looked on Amazon and found a set of eight bright markers with more of a selection of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink and white by the name Vegas Wand). Of course, they were more expensive at $18.99, BUT they are larger and when you shake them you can feel the liquid in them. The reason, however I dropped the stars from 5 down to 3 was when I wrote with them the difference was VERY noticeable! The colors are very vibrant and they write less like chalk and more like a marker with clear smooth lines. I really felt that I should at least put this information out there for your own evaluation. If you don't really want to do anything artistic and you are just going to make notes that are going to be erased shortly anyway, the Expo Dry Erase Markers should be all you need. However, if you want to decorate and want your project to look more polished, I would definately go with these. The only other info you would need is that you might need a damp cloth to wipe off the chalkboard when you want to erase anything and it will come up clean. With a dry paper towel, it appears like when you were in school and the teacher used the eraser to wipe the chalkboard.

"I purchased a set of clear acrylic OGGI canisters and got these to label them for my flour, sugar, brown rice and regular rice. These look really nice on them. They are easy to write on, they peel off easily and go on to the canister smoothly. They are a perfect size to look nice. I made a mistake on a couple and they wiped off clean and very easy.I recommend them for any labeling needs.

I hadn't dropped or banged it on anything, so I don't know how it could have cracked like that. I still like it but I think I will reserve it for special occasions. It is very pretty though and it looks just like the picture. Everything is three dimensional. There are no decals and they give you a couple of extra gems, I guess in case you lose one.

"I would think that a company like Bissell whose name is synonymous with floor care would not put out poor quality products.I have a Rocket  vacuum and since I have people come in to clean well every couple of weeks, I wanted for everyday pickups on the kitchen floor and in the carpeted living areas, something light and easy. I started with a Bissell Cordless Stick Vac which proved to have to dismantle at least 3 pieces in order to empty the dust cup and poor suction in general, even with all my troubleshooting. I had a Shark for a few years, but the price and write up was pretty good on this so I figured I would get this one. There were a few reviews that stated that after a month or so it would be dead, but as one reviewer on something else stated, with thousands made you are probably going to have a few duds.Out of the box it was very simple to assemble. I followed all instructions and charged it before using it for about 24 hours. I worked, it was quiet and it seemed to pick up okay. Then after about a week and a half I went to use it and it would not turn on. I had charged it and I know the electric going in was fine because the light was lit. I tried everything and could not get it to start again. Very disappointing. I will be calling Amazon today and I do not want another one because I am done purchasing Bissell products. I do remember there being some comments in the reviews that people had been told by Bissell to ignore the light, that it doesn't mean anything. My question is, if it doesn't mean anything, why is it there. Obviously it is a problem so why didn't Bissell fix whatever the problem is. This model is the newer model of this particular sweeper, so you would think that Bissell would have addressed all the problems people have been contacting them about. Me, I am contacting Amazon today to return it and I plan to buy a different brand.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYWQZEJ3ZNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K316IB6#wasThisHelpful","R3NYWQZEJ3ZNO","A2O9NU8P1PHZMY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O9NU8P1PHZMY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only had it for two weeks but I'm impressed. The first 2-3 shaves were disappointing and I almost sent it right back. I know they say it takes weeks or a month for your face to adapt but I wasn't hopeful about this working out the first few tries. But, then something changed - maybe I got better at using it - maybe my face adapted. I'm not sure but I like this thing and it really is about as close to a blade shave as I can imagine. So, I'm a convert.It was probably just technique and I needed more practice time. Anyway, this is the first electric I've used in 20 years and I'm impressed.

"Broken in right out of the box? That is a new one for me. I've only had that experience with Ecco shoes. These were a little pricey but they're also much much better than all the others I tried so it's worth it.- Light- Nice 'roll' to them - toe to heel - while walking- The soft walking on clouds feel (likely the gel) allows me to go further than usual- Great tread- Much better padding around ankle than usual. This likely aids in the ' no break in'- Sizing was right onI always have issues with new shoes, sneakers or sandals - a little break in period, a couple of blisters etc. I experienced none of that with these.If they hold up, this could be my new 'go to' sneaker.

"Seamless wools socks rock. I've been adding more to my collection and tossing the older cotton ones. I think I've found a winner with this brand. I wear size 11 and the large is perfection. Be aware these are a little stretchier than expected. For that reason I started with an extra large but found them to be a little too stretchy - they get bunched up at the ankle. But the large is perfection for size 11.What I Like:- Seamless- Great price- Like me, made in Vermont- Sizing was right on- Quality is obvious- Lifetime guarantee? I'll take it.- The 'cushion' thickness is right on - just what I like - mediumDislikes:- I wish there was a higher percentage of wool in this model.

"I had my doubts but they are amazing. I've wanted the over ear version for a while and finally decided to buy them before a long trip to Cambodia. Saw these and had just enough time to order, try and then return for the others if they disappointed. They did not disappoint. These are keepers and I've used them on a few flights now so figured I would write a review.What I love:- with a click of a button, it's like I'm in a library and not on a plane. Awesome.- I've used the MIE2i headset for years and already thought it was the best out there in terms of comfort.- One thing that always kept me from buying the 'over the ear' version was the size factor. I already have a ton of stuff in my backpack and couldn't imagine fitting these in there too. So, I've always gone with the cheaper 'in the ear' headsets before now.- These fit perfectly in an eyeglasses case - and much better protected. The case that comes with these headphones is pathetic and they should be embarrassed to send us this.- Thick tangle proof cords have pros and cons. Yes, they're thick and can be annoying at times. And, kind of tacky so they get caught on clothing sometimes. But, the cord is heavy duty and feels like it can handle some travel abuse. The pros outweigh the cons for me. I want these to last and I'm surprised but I think they will.The rechargeable battery would not have been my first choice. But, it lasts 16 hours, charges fast, and I always have a battery in my bag so I could charge it in the airport before boarding if I forgot to charge it or ran out of juice unexpectedly.Lastly, yes, using these with music or a movie on a flight is a slice of heaven. But, I use them alone too -  just for the noise canceling for the entire flight - and since they're 'in ear' style, I can snooze too.If you can spare the cash, you want these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WXC1C42QX5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D429Y12#wasThisHelpful","R18WXC1C42QX5W","A3977M5S0GIG5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977M5S0GIG5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to buy shoes like this when I was younger and was always surprised by the quality for the price. They lasted a long time and the soles were so good you could easily go outside once in a while. Not so much with these. I returned them.I didn't like:- the general quality was below my expectations.- loose threads, etc. They wouldn't have lasted long.- The sole was weak and cheap - not even close to the pairs I used to buy years ago.Even at this price, they're not worth it for me. I spent a little more and went with leather mocassins. If you wanted to really save some money and didn't mind a little effort, get a leather moccasin kit and make your own - the kit is less than half of just buying the mocassins already made. I bet you can get a kit for under $20 and they're going to last a lot longer.

"I was concerned about the fit and read all the reviews. My foot is 10.5 exactly but I almost always go with size 11 - they feel better, more roomy etc. I like things loose. In this case, because these are all leather, I went with my exact shoe size of 10.5 figuring they would stretch a little. And, they did - and I love them.These moccasins work beautifully for me. They felt a little rough at first with the laces rubbing the top of my foot a little uncomfortably. After a few hours, everything started to come together and they were stretching to fit my feet like a glove. I should say I only wear these barefoot. For socks I definitely would have had to go with size 11. I should say, I had to loosen up the laces - they were tied to tightly out of the box and that's why they were rubbing annoyingly on the top of my foot. New sneakers are the same for me every time.I'll probably do the water trick and wet them down and wear them for a few hours so that they truly fit my feet perfectly. But, they're so close already at this point, after a few days, I may skip that trick.Very happy with these. If they last for any length of time - like a year or more - I'll buy again in a heartbeat and they have a customer for life.

"We've had the thicker, heavier Bear Motion leather case on our full size iPad for a while now and love it. I tried this Yooboa because I wanted to see about the weight difference and maybe save a few ounces. It looks like you save about 4oz and get thinner leather for about $10 or so more. I'm happy with the purchase so far. I'll change my review if there's a durability issue. The Bear Motion was bomb proof and my wife and I both think they're outstanding cases.For the Yoobao, I like the following:- Quality leather - has a very nice feel to it - will be enjoyable to carry around- Looks sharp- Corner protection - in fact, total edge protection all around- Light - thinner leatherDislikes - but I can live with them - personal choice:- These kind of cases protect from scratches primarily - I don't think they'd make a big difference if you dropped the iPad. But, still I've had both and much prefer this kind of case to the Otter Box kind that adds bulk. For pure protection, Otterbox rules. In other words, if you drop your iPad, it won't have any scratches on it - but it will be broken. Personal preference - I prefer leather and just try to be careful - YMMV.While I loved the Bear Motion case, I always thought the lack of corner protection was its Achilles Heel. You could still get the corners scratched and bang it up a little while in the case. But, that being said, we never had any problems. This Yoobao has total edge protection all around - that was one of the deciding factors for giving this one a spin too.I don't think you can go wrong with either this or Bear Motion - if you're not sure, order both and return the one that doesn't work for you. I'm happy with this one so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OB3XDW85OOCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFFV4GE#wasThisHelpful","R3OB3XDW85OOCJ","A3977M5S0GIG5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977M5S0GIG5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, these are a great value. I normally wear 36 pants and they would normally feel baggy. These 36s fit perfectly just not quite the bagginess I would want for a hot, humid, trekking kind of vacation. So, I went with 38, and tightened the belt a little - fit perfectly for my needs.I took off one star because of the zippers and flimsy velcro on most of the pockets. But these are a solid 4 and great value. I'm not sure about durability but even with the few issues, these should last at least 3-4 trips. And, at this price, it's an easy decision for buy again despite the opportunities for improvement.What I like:- they're great shorts - nice long inseam like board shorts- incredibly light and easily packable pants- multi functional brilliance in terms of travel clothing- adding/removing the leg parts is pretty easy and fast- material is very thin and breathes well in hot, humid climates - or sitting on a plane for 12-hours. It seems rugged and rip stop so it should be durable - it's just so thin I can't help but wonder. I'm pretty sure the zippers will fail first.- Dry very fast - easily washed on the go and dry by morning - very nice.- front pockets are nice and big and deep- easy hemmed for fit perfection (no side zippers)What I didn't like:- zippers could be better - left cargo pocket couldn't be closed with one hand because of cheap zipper getting caught every time. Annoying. Better zipper choices would have been better.- right cargo pocket should be zippered instead of tiny little piece of velcro. While the velcro was handy for grabbing a camera lens or park ticket for quick access - I kept checking to make sure I didn't lose something. I never did but it made me self-conscious since it didn't close securely.- more and better zippers; back pockets are just small little velcro patches (like right cargo pocket) so they're really unusable - you can't trust them - especially in crowds - too easy to pickpocket.Update:OK, I'm changing my review to 5-stars. Despite the room for improvement, at this price I have to call these as 5-stars. I hope they make the improvements and just up the price a few bucks.

"I bought a few pairs of convertible pants to compare before a big trip. These were the best - no question. If you want convertible pants, get these - you will not be disappointed. The sizing was perfect - except for the length - see below:Pros:- Thicker, higher quality material- Better Quality design and workmanship - really excellent- Zippers, pockets everything very cleverly done; quality all aroundCons:- Tailors said the side zipper at the bottom made them very difficult to hem/shorten - insert sad face here.I absolutely loved these but i wasn't going to spend $50 to have them hemmed at the one tailor who would take the job. I really needed a 29"" inseam and 30"" was the shortest. And, the trip was coming up quickly.So had to return them - hoping one day they'll have more inseam choices in the future - if so, I'll buy these in heartbeat!!Bought the Colombia Silver Ridge Pants instead - they're fine; were easy and quick to shorten; cheaper.

They're both super comfortable also but the double dry feels like silk and this one is just shy of feeling that way - close and very comfortable but just not silky. They're both winners and I'm glad I bought both - they're like $12 so why not. I highly recommend both.

All favorites of mine. It had all the right ingredients - great acting, great story and the filming had that hard to describe sort of European thriller grittiness - like you believe this is actually happening and you're peering through a window.Brit Marling was awesome - over the top awesome - I saw her on Bill Maher a few months ago plugging the movie and She and Bill were right - yeah, I really liked this movie.

I've seen a friend use this for small vape pens as well as those e-cig devices that can be a little fragile and susceptible to breaking if bent at all. This carrier keeps anything you have inside very safe and completely protected.Sidenote: it's significantly heavier than I expected. But, it does the job perfectly.

"For the price this is ok. I bought the 47x35 with the lip and wish I'd bought the bigger one. With the bigger one, the constant moving around or drifting of the mat might have been less irritating. I have to constantly adjust this. And, I have a medium pile carpet for sure - I even measured it.So, I would strongly recommend a bigger one and seriously consider this version for thicker carpet so that the spikes are longer and hopefully there would be less drift.

"I've had to update this review and downgrade it a few stars. While the product seems top notch - I just couldn't get it to work well for me. I was looking for a Phone/GPS/intercom solution. The music feature didn't work out at all - the sound isn't rich enough for it to be pleasurable. But, in the end, I had to return this because I couldn't even hear/understand my phone/gps while riding - even around town and with a full face helmet on. It just wasn't usable for me. Maybe it's my hearing - I don't know. Others seem very happy with this. But, sadly it just didn't work out. I really wanted to like this product. Here's why:I had this working with my GPS and Google Maps on my Samsung Nexus phone in 2-minutes.- Easy to install (Arai Vector 2)- Low profile and very modern/cool looking- GPS / Smartphone / Intercom abilities are a homerun - until I used it while riding.- Impressive battery life- At this price, I think it's an incredible value if it worked for me.You may find different results but I was disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL85N59J2RPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NB1IW#wasThisHelpful","R2SL85N59J2RPM","A3977M5S0GIG5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977M5S0GIG5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't expect deerskin to be this soft. These gloves have a really nice feel to them. And, for this price, I'm happy with the purchase. I would say the sizing is right on. I always get large and this was no exception. In fact, if they stretch out, these will be extremely loose fitting. For driving, that wouldn't be a problem. For a scooter/motorcycle, it may be an issue for some folks. I'm hoping the already loose feel will translate into being cooler in the summer - we'll see. I'll update my review once I've had time to test these out on some hot days.The only cons I can think of:- these are double-stitched; some of the stitching looks a little sloppy. But, at this price, I think they're still great.- the wrist is very loose. Take that with a grain of salt - my wrists are small and watches are sometimes a problem. I would have preferred a tighter elastic feel around the wrist.But, they feel great and I'm happy with the purchase. Note the leather is very thin - but at least as thick as the $75 motorcycle gloves I see at the shops. I only hope they're thick enough for a spill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U98JWKRIRQI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006X3O0N6#wasThisHelpful","R3U98JWKRIRQI6","A3977M5S0GIG5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977M5S0GIG5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The number of skeins it can hold will depend on the yarn weight--up to 8 skeins of worsted weight, fewer for chunky weights.  the bag has opening in its lid for yarn to spool through and there are four small pockets on the outside to hold needles or hooks and accessories such as a gauge, scissors, etc.  It is lightweight and made of a sturdy blue cloth that won't show dirt and lined with cotton fabric.

"This solar powered light is easy to use.  You need to leave it bottom side up (the solar panel is there) in the sun for 8 hours or so to charge it up.  Then, when you want to use it, press the power button on the bottom.  It has three modes:  press the the power button once to get a flashing light, twice to get a dim light and three times to get a bright light.  The light is good, even on dim.  That said, the light doesn't last very long at all.  On bright you get only  1 - 2 hours of light.  On dim I got about twice that.

No instructions are included, but none are needed as it is obvious how to wear everything.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the toe separator on the bunion pad is a bit too wide for me to be able to wear all my shoes with it on.

"This paranormal novel goes nowhere fast.  The first book in the series, ""Mr. Hartley,"" was a short and somewhat interesting introduction but this second book is just plain bad.  There is no character growth at all--the protagonist Zach Hartley and the other characters stay at a boring level all the way through.  Even when it turns out that Zach is a Messiah-like individual there's no change in his character.  In a word, Zach is nothing short of perfect.  He never gets angry or even annoyed with anyone.  He always has a timely and perfect way to resolve conflicts.  Everything comes easily to him. Everyone is always in awe of him.  He's so modest it becomes annoying to the reader though not to the other characters because, well, he's perfect and they're in awe of him.  Yeah, it goes in circles like that.There's a lot of sex.  No, this isn't erotica or porn.  It's too matter of fact for that. There's just a lot of sex.  All the females of whatever species want to have sex with Zach or get sexual relief channeled to them by him.  Even some of the males want it.  A large number of the females even live with him--so many that he has to buy a larger house and is considering buying an even bigger one.  The women have designated nights to have him all to themselves, but in between times they are performing fellatio or giving him hand jobs or massages.  That's when he isn't having to pull the shirts up on various and sundry women, laying on hands and shooting sexual energy into them that way.  This is constant, literally constant, throughout the book.So basically this is an adolescent boy's wet dream with only enough plot line to get you from one sex act to another and sometimes not even that far.  It's a how-to guide on making sex boring.  Also has some editing errors sprinkled throughout.  Since it's obvious that nothing's going to change I won't be going on to the third book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUJ548R2AESW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAZI6E#wasThisHelpful","R2PUJ548R2AESW","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice little lantern.  Although it is only about the size of a large soup can, it puts out more light than another lantern I have that is twice the size.  It is lightweight, with two metal handles that fold up and down, and a small compass in the lid.  To turn it on all you have to do is pull up on the handles which can also be used to hang the lantern.  The compass works well, too.  It is powered by 3 AA batteries (not included).  I would be a bit worried, however, about losing this lantern on camping trips due to the camouflage.  This is a great little lantern!So why did I give it 4 stars instead of five?  The SMELL.  When I opened the shipping box I was hit with an incredibly strong petroleum/plastic odor.  I left the lantern outside for several hours and the smell reduced and over the next few days it faded even further.  However, if you put you nose right to it, the smell is still faintly there after 5 days.But all in all, I like this lantern.  It works well and puts out a lot of light.

"Coming-of-age SF.  Set in a future in which an alien civilization has conquered Earth and made it part of their empire.  It's protagonist is orphaned at the start and is adopted by a Tarchein viceroy.  This first book in the series covers his experiences at the military academy to become a star pilot and his first forays into battle.  I enjoyed this book--the author is a great storyteller--but I found that it jumped from one experience to the next without enough detail to any.  Tommy's relationship with his adoptive father isn't gone into at all and we get no sense of internal conflict for him between that and the treatment given by some of the Tarchein to their human compatriots.  There is a ""glass ceiling"" for humans in the empire that is mentioned a couple of times but nothing is made of that either.

"I have been looking for a replacement for a very old similar style wallet and am very happy with this one.  I frequently go on outings where carrying a purse is inconvenient and this slim wallet is handy to slip into a pocket.  There is a spot with a clear window for my driver's license on one side, and on the other two slots that can hold two cards each.  There is also a center pocket that can hold cash or more cards if desired.  This is perfect for a man or woman who doesn't like carrying a bulky wallet.  When it first arrived I was a bit concerned because smell of the leather was overwhelmed by that of the inner parts, but that soon faded, I am happy to say.  I would have given the wallet five stars, but the fact that there is no opening in the clear window to allow me to easily push out my license when required is a small drawback.  Also, the wallet is well made but I think the price is a tad high.I was asked to give an honest review by the manufacturer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OV3X65YJS70A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR6QUPK#wasThisHelpful","R3OV3X65YJS70A","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great set of dog hair brushes.  I have four dogs with varying coats and these brushes did the trick for all of them.  The de-matting rake did a fine job on my longer coated dog who has fine fur that seems to mat at the drop of a hat.  The brush is double-sided for use on different types of coat, which worked out well for my other dogs, and the undercoat rake works like a charm.  The only thing I would change on the set would be the handles--I have larger hands and would like the handles to be a bit bigger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67KF2FCNMTCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI2GM36#wasThisHelpful","R67KF2FCNMTCF","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I tried them with all sorts of music, from classical to hard rock and all sounded good, with no hissing in the high range or boomy sound in the bass.

"This fantastic  charger is definitely going into my emergency ""go bag.""  It is the size and weight of a smart phone and has two power sources--solar and electricity.  It comes with a short cable that can either be plugged into a computer or a USB wall plug.  When I received it, I put the Mengo in the sun for an hour to charge it (LED lights indicate how much of a charge is available).  Then I plugged my iPhone in and it was fully charged within two hours.  Doing that used up half the power,  but in an emergency that isn't bad and a bout in the sun remedies it.  At the moment I am using it to charge my Kindle ereader.  There are two USB ports and a built-in flashlight which is turned on & off by clicking the power button twice.

"Naturalist Sy Montgomery renders the story of her pig, Christopher Hogwood, with love and insight.  The effect he had on her life and those of others who met him and the town that adopted him was as immense as he was.  Christopher embodied joy for life, intelligence, and many of the characteristics we humans like to claim solely for ourselves.  From the time he was adopted as a tiny runt no bigger than a cat to his death at the ripe old age of 14 & 750 pounds, this pig's life was filled with love.

"Each of these short horror stories are well done, though the third one, ""Rail 715,"" was predictable, and the second one needs more detail about the demon who terrorizes the protagonist.  I wish that they'd all been a bit longer in order to provide more detail because the story lines were so intriguing.  While the Edge is referred to in the first two stories, I wanted more detail about that as well.  The first two stories, ""Worst Things Than Death"" and ""Desert Fun Amusement"" are heavier on suspense that the last one, which is a straightforward horror story in a classic vein. On the whole these three stories are well written, though the price point ($2.99) is a bit high for 59 pages.

"Where to start?  Atrocious editing and a nearly non-existent plot that is an adolescent boy's wet dream,Our intrepid hero Matt Molter joins a ship fresh out of Fleet Academy and quickly plunges (pun intended) into sex, sex, sex.  Women on this ship outnumber the men, and due to some mysterious effect of high velocity travel they are driven to aggressive sexual appetites--and the faster the ship goes, the more they're driven.  Not to mention that the men develop longer ""staying power.""  You can see where the wet dreams come into this.  The female crew members are constantly exposing their breasts or getting naked at the drop of a hat.  They are endlessly masturbating, performing fellatio and having group sex.  And all of them have humongous breasts due, we're told, to light gravity, raging hormones, and frequent massaging of said breasts.We see little of the other male crew members as the ""plot"" mainly consists of Matt constantly being pursed by every female on the ship.  A superior officer orders him to have sex with her and 87% of the way in even the Captain propositions him.  Did I mention that at one point the Captain orders Matt to never become monogamous as it might cause rioting?  Oh the horror. The women frequently cry if Matt refuses to have sex with them.  They are constantly launching themselves at his neck to kiss and hug him.  They ogle and fondle him.  They beg him to ""take"" them.  He is constantly told how wonderful he is.  Two women who broadcast their desire for him while out on an EVA assignment are ""punished"" by having to stay naked for the entire day while on duty.  For some reason, given the way women strip off constantly, they are mortified.  So Matt increases their punishment by forbidding anyone to touch them, denying them ""release.""Now, don't think it is all sexual hijinks.  There is action, too.  This action mostly consists of major accidents.  This has to be the poorest maintained ship in the Navy judging by all the equipment malfunctions.  There are four in the first week and a half Matt is on the ship, and four others over the course of the book.  Matt is, of course, a hero in these accidents and that makes the women all the hotter for him.  It's really no wonder that these equipment failures occur--whenever the women are performing important tasks and repairs, they are so busy getting off talking about sex that they mess up.  The amazing thing is that women are allowed to pilot shuttles and carry dangerous weapons.  They're a danger to the ship's safety.Within 5 days of coming aboard, Matt has earned two silver stars, one bronze star and is made a lieutenant JG.  Due to one of the accidents he has also been made acting commander of his section when his superior dies.  In a few more months he is made a full lieutenant.  At the end of the novel the Captain sends him for advanced command training, telling him that he will only have to take the second half of the course, he's so good.Editing. Editing.  Wherefore art thou editing?  Words and letters are left out in several places.  The author has a real problem with commas (the lack thereof can change a sentence's meaning) and apostrophes.  He uses ""were"" when he means ""we're""  (and this is on almost every page in the book) and ""your"" when he means ""you're.""  He never uses apostrophes in possessives--for example, ""Captains"" when he means ""Captain's.""  Then there are improper words throughout, such as:  ""bear"" instead of ""bare,"" ""breaking"" instead of ""braking,"" ""loosing"" instead of ""losing.""

"This book turned out to be a take-off of John Wayne's movie, ""Angel & the Badman."" There are a few changes, which allow a lot more romance as well as a couple of understated sex scenes, but it's basically the same story. Even the main character's name is close to the movie's--Colt Evans instead of Quirt Evans. Now, I've always loved the movie (which wasn't based on a book), so this didn't bother me. The book does need a lot of editing, which led me to give it only three stars.  There are words left out here and there and the author has a lot of trouble with idioms, sometimes to the point that the opposite of what was meant is said.  I like this story line enough that, for the most part, I could overlook the poor editing, but I did find myself shaking my head a couple of times.  This author really does need to use a proofreader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28W0NNT6OT4Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KA3ORW#wasThisHelpful","R28W0NNT6OT4Q1","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kept waiting for this story to really get going, but it never did.  Which is too bad since the concept of a human social worker for supernaturals is an interesting one.  The heroine finds herself in a battle between two vampires who are in a battle for control of a substance, the Tears of Christ, that can give vampires the ability to be active during the day amongst other things.  Sounds good as far as it goes.  But that IS as far as it goes.  She stumbles from one attack to another, never willing to bring complaints against her attackers and generally acting like a milquetoast--until she doesn't, suddenly becoming a kick-ass 3/4 of the way into the story.  The Tears never make an appearance in the story and other than a brief mention nothing more is made of their powers.  There is a tiny bit of a romance angle, but nothing comes of that either as the heroine keeps protesting that she likes her job too much to do more than kiss the werewolf who is her supervisor, so why bother including this angle at all.  So the book is essentially a montage of attacks on the heroine by vampires, with a witch and a werewolf running interference and no resolution at the end.  Perhaps the only explanation is that the author is setting up for a series--but it's not a very good explanation.The book also needs some serious editing.  There are missing letters here and there and quite a lot of misusage of words throughout the book.  For example, ""close lined"" is used when the author means ""clotheslined.""  this throughout.It's really too bad.  I kept plugging along hoping the story would come together but it never did.  If there is to be a sequel I would think twice about buying it based on this first book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWUFPXBNIGJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA65PEM#wasThisHelpful","R1MWUFPXBNIGJI","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel starts slowly and never really picks up, despite a premise in which the protagonist is dragged into an alternate pocket-world in which Washington D.C. was magically taken over by vampires in the late 1800s.  The magic is breaking down and the vampires need a rare magician to maintain their world (which seems to consist of nothing but Washington).  Cue our heroine.From the point at which Quinn is drawn into that vampire world, the plot devolves to endless scenes of BDSM.  Rape features prominently.  Our heroine is too stupid to live and keeps believing her vampire owner despite his lies and mistreatment.  I wasn't even able to finish this novel--couldn't even get halfway through.  At the point when the vampire who rules all the others wraps a spike-studded strap around his mammoth-proportioned schlong in preparation to raping a human slave, enough was enough.Amazingly, this doesn't even have the excuse of being independently published, and HarperCollins should be ashamed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXWL4FL4LBJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9V2IXC#wasThisHelpful","R3SXWL4FL4LBJD","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is one long slog of...stupidity.  Because, according to the author, everyone in it (with the exception of himself and one or two nurses) is stupid.  The prisoners most of all, but also the system he's working within.  Bureaucracies are noted at different points as Nazis and donut-eating ignoramuses.  And he doesn't, we're told, like to take orders in any case.  His interactions with the prisoners he treats are all on the same theme--prisoners make up symptoms, want drugs, and ignore the doctor's diagnosis and advice.  After a while the unending litanies become as boring and dreary as the monochromatic paint adorning every site he works in.  And the author manages to contradict himself.  Despite noting to his wife that he doesn't even ask what his patients are in prison for because that's not what is important, with every single inmate interaction he gives us what the inmate was in for.  He tells us that the job is easy, with lots of down time, then tells of non-stop inmate interactions.  He tells us at the end that inmates are still human and deserve his best care, yet throughout the book, in dealing with inmates, he is off-hand, sarcastic, and gives mental notations that give the opposite message.I wish the author had given more details about himself and less of the history of the Colorado Penitentiary.  And more varied interactions between himself and staff and the prisoners would also have made the book more interesting.  Its really too bad, because this is a topic that is very interesting to me and I was hoping for better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10P2605BCMJGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGZ8II8#wasThisHelpful","R10P2605BCMJGE","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't get me wrong, Electric Moon is a great story.  I wish I could have given it more than three stars. It has good world building, well-rounded characters and an interesting take on shifters.  If the story hadn't been so good, I would have given it two stars due to all the editing mistakes.For this book (I don't recall this problem with the first one), the author decided to dispense with editing and rely solely upon spell-check.  That is the only possible reason for the innumerable errors throughout where a word is spelled correctly but either isn't the correct tense, or is entirely the wrong word (ex: lesson in place of lessen).Please, Ms. Brutger, don't ruin your books by neglecting the all-important editing. I'll stick with you for the third book in your series because I like the story, but if it has the same massive problem I doubt I'd buy the fourth.

"This self-published romance is set in the 13th century Highlands.  The protagonist is reminiscent of one of Julie Garwood's heroines, leaving disasters in her wake in her determination to find a home and acceptance when her father makes her marry a neighboring laird to gain an alliance.  The laird in question is fierce, distrustful of women due to a past problem, yet fascinated by his new wife.  Outside of the time period, there isn't much actual history and the story revolves mostly around the struggles involved in the romance.I would have liked to give this a better rating--the story is good and the characters are appealing.  But the editing of this book is atrocious.  Needed punctuation is lacking is many places.  It often seems as if the author changed her mind about the structure of a sentence midstream and never removed the rejected words. Or words are left out entirely and the reader must spend a few seconds parsing the sentence.  And some words are misused--""and"" for ""but,"" for example; and throughout the word ""cottar"" is used to mean a cottage, instead of villein or peasant farmer as is proper.Too bad the author didn't give her book the care it deserved.

When the only elven relative who will speak to her ask Harri to find out what happened to the siren he loves, she dives head-first into the mystery.  The story is set in Australia and the plot moves swiftly, with a lot of action as Harri deals with elves, dragons, trolls and ogres--not to mention the father who hates her.

"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which is a science fiction spoof.  Its protagonist is Hank, a 4th degree mutation who lives on a space station at the edge of the Colmarian Confederation.  For the most part, the inhabitants of the station are criminals and Hank is a neutral go-between who alternates as muscle-for-hire and mediator.  He's not particularly smart, but he is street-savvy and holds the respect of all sides.  But life gets sticky when powerful mutants, robots, the space navy and an invading civilization all show up.  In short order Hank finds himself at the center of trouble.  The novel is told in a tongue-in-cheek style and the story is fun.  The one drawback for me was the need for a strong suspension of disbelief I occasionally had to draw upon due to some flaws in logic & physics.  Projectile weapons, including a cannon that can destroy buildings, being used inside a space station is one.  Another is a statement that a 35 ft.-tall being had few bones due to its height & weight (we had dinosaurs--one 56 ft. tall--that had no problem with their bones).  There are a couple others that I more easily overlooked.  But overall, the story is good and fun to read.

"I read this series when it was originally published and was pleased to find it finally available for the Kindle as my paperback copies are worn out.  A.P.B. is the first book in the series and introduces Walt Pynchon, a special investigator for the local DA and despised by the local cops who resent his interference.  Pynchon is a hard-bitten, irascible and suspicious man who longs to for early retirement to a warmer climate but keeps getting pulled into cases.  The case in this book involves a serial killer who murders the wives & girlfriend of police officers.  And it doesn't help that he is attracted to a woman who represents a form of life he hates:  reporters.  A great mystery for fans of hard bitten mysteries.

"I couldn't even come anywhere close to finishing this book it is so bad.  I'm a huge Jane Eyre fan and was looking forward to reading this. What a disappointment.I felt a premonition at the very first sentence of the preface: ""Dear Reader, do you remember me?"" Then came a recital of the events in Jane Eyre. One of the most famous novels in the world doesn't need a recap. The fact that the author almost injures herself trying to imitate the tone of the novel doesn't help. And it is painful to read it is so awkward.It quickly becomes clear that the Jane in this sequel has a very low opinion of Mr. Rochester and an inflated opinion of herself: ""I was pleased to see my generous nature was influencing my companion's tendency towards pettiness, and the marriage ceremony only ten minutes old!""She gets mean on their wedding night, blowing hot and cold for no reason. Then, after 4 months of marriage she becomes a resentful shrew who feels that her husband is selfish and though she has gone out of her way to serve him without his asking her to be a slave (she even tastes his cherries before he does to make sure they're not too tart!) feels put upon, feels that he has nervous fancies and is ""not cruel, but merely conjectured my service to him was a pleasure."" Then she gets ticked off if he takes any time away from her. Sheesh.Finally after treating the poor man to a series of mood swings and pettiness (she's even upset that marriage doesn't improve England's climate for her) that cause him to withdraw she says: ""What his struggle was that took his attention from me I could not ascertain by a survey of his pagan mien.""!!!That's it. 12% into the book and I couldn't take this crap anymore. Because the rest is surely as bad or worse.  I wasted 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A6QUKBN0UWQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DNWEFO#wasThisHelpful","R1A6QUKBN0UWQ2","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a good story struggling to get out. The author has some intriguing and different ideas for her vampires' physiology and lifestyles. Unfortunately, after reading a bit more than half of it, I was forced to admit defeat because her writing and editing buried everything else. Poor sentence structure combined with constant misuse of words made reading difficult.  ""Seen"" is used instead of ""seeing"" throughout, as is ""bolder"" for ""boulder.""  And there are a lot of boulders and lots of seeing in this book.I also felt as if I was reading about a teenybopper slumber party rather than vampires due to the amount of giggling going on.  I'm serious.  There are very few laughs in this book--everyone giggles.  The protagonist, the vampire head honcho, macho soldiers, the stud muffin who wants to bed the protagonist...they are all constantly giggling.  The only ones not giggling were the pitbulls. Yes, there are vicious pitbulls (that's the way the head honcho likes them) who of course drool all over the heroine.  But that's not unusual because everyone else drools all over her too with the exception of the stud muffin's numerous concubines.Speaking of the stud muffin, he acts more like a spoiled, acne-spotted teenager than the commander of the army and Heir of the head honcho. His pouting and juvenile posturing are not attractive. Yet the heroine pants, albeit reluctantly due to her past, after him and you can't help wondering why.The author's two favorite words are ""vampire"" and ""speed.""  We quickly learn this because ""vampire speed"" is used almost constantly.  The characters lift things with vampire speed, they block things with vampire speed, they move with vampire speed.  Well of course they do.  They're vampires after all and the reader is informed about vampire attributes at the beginning of the book so it goes without saying.I really wanted to like this book; there's a good story crying to get out but after being told that the heroine is naked underneath her nightgown I finally gave up. That's noteworthy...why?  The image of someone wearing a nightgown over their clothes immediately sprang to mind and suddenly I just couldn't continue reading.  I wanted to reach through the book, slap the author upside the head, and tell her to a) get an editor and b) get honest criticism before publishing in order to avoid sabotaging her own story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21L10JIQ97ELC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XHT9RE#wasThisHelpful","R21L10JIQ97ELC","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of the Solar Clipper series and waited eagerly for this book to come out.  Unfortunately ""Double Share"" does not live up to expectations.  It has major plot holes. 1)If the line owner knew about what the captain was allowing to go on, why didn't he just fire him?  The line that he couldn't do it ""without cause"" doesn't hold water; at the very least the owner could have run an upfront investigation.  2) What was the captain up to in his cabin & why were a couple of crewman constantly being seen coming out of it looking embarrassed?  3) How does the mere idea of Ishmael having sex with women on the crew protect them?  After all, the First Mate and his henchmen are rotten to the core so that shouldn't stop them & they'd certainly not stand for Ish ""hogging"" so many without a LOT more retaliation than happens.  4) It takes very little to get the dissolute crew turned around--good coffee,clean passageways and the idea that Ish has a larger harem than the First Mate does soon has most of them singing kumbaya together.  5)Very little comes of all the sexual assault and harassment in the end--for example, one of the biggest perps gets off scot free because ""he fell in with bad company.""  What?!?All in all, ""Double Share"" is a big come-down from the earlier books in the series.  And there is an added problem with the Kindle edition: the editing is poor.  There are missing words in a couple of places.  And at least half of all the periods are missing.  This book was held up at the publisher for an entire year--the editing should have been perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZGEN322RCR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZRVQ2W#wasThisHelpful","R21ZGEN322RCR2","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Mercy Thompson series and was looking forward to River Marked.  I happily paid the inflated price for it.  What I got was a small taste of a great series & character, but none of the ""calories.""  The lack of substance had me zipping through it in record time and when it ended I was left with a ""this is it?"" feeling.Everything is rushed. Subplots are so briefly touched upon that I wondered why they were included at all. Mercy and Adam are dispatched on a mission by the Fae on their honeymoon but the reason is incredibly vague.  Exactly who are the Otterkin?  The river monster is impressive, but her history and and motivation are glossed over. Stephen makes a brief insubstantial appearance. Yo Yo girl is mentioned but nothing comes of that. A toe is dipped in Mercy's Native American heritage, but other than finding out that Coyote both is & isn't her father, she & we don't really learn a lot about it.  Other Native American totems pop onto the scene with no warning to help defeat the river monster and then disappear again.And as for the marriage of Mercy and Adam, it is nice finally see it but other than the sweet affection they evince, it mostly for the purpose of Mercy constantly growling ""Mine"" at every opportunity whether deserved or not.  And while Adam is an Alpha, a lead bullet conveniently wounds him gravely so that Mercy can do her thing without much interference from a take charge kinda guy.River Marked would have been a great short story or even a novella, but for a novel is is lightweight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUGT89JQJ4D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049U4IZK#wasThisHelpful","R2OUGT89JQJ4D4","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for action, action, action, space battles, space marines, hot sex, evil aliens or vast star empires in conflict, this is not the novel--or series--for you.Half Share is the second book (following Quarter Share) in a marvelous series that is reminiscent of Andre Norton, early Heinlein and other great science fiction of the past. It follows the shipboard life of the protagonist, Ishmael, his interaction with fellow crew members and his growing expertise as a trader along the ship's route. This is a good old-fashioned SF coming-of-age story and Nathan Lowell presents it with a masterly hand.  Hopefully the third in the series will be made available for the Kindle in the very near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8HDZ26P0V1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GUSA02#wasThisHelpful","R1L8HDZ26P0V1D","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are also great for wearing to bed on very cold nights.

"OK, I'll be honest--the pattern on my slippers is butt ugly.  The only pattern that was in stock when I purchased was the ""Chocolate dots.""

These slippers are wonderfully warm and the memory foam is great for tired feet and there is enough width that your toes have nice wiggle room.

"Desperate for a job, any job, spacer Art Gordon hires on as ""housekeeper"" on an alien ship.  He is the only male on board, as the Tani'Anneray are bound by a vow of celibacy while in space & have segregated ships.  While learning to do his job on his own (his employers don't believe in manuals or training) he becomes disgusted with their pecking order system in which the lowest ranked crew member is made miserable, thereby allowing the rest to ""safely"" blow off steam.  Gradually, he falls in love with the put upon Choon. Eventually he makes up his own version of a Christian marriage rite and takes her as his wife.  When the ship's captain learns of this, Art is dumped on a planet and left.  Not giving up, he makes his way to Choon's home world to plead his case.The plot plods along. A quarter of the way through the book it was obvious that it wasn't going to get any better but having purchased it (on the strength of the description--a lesson to *always* get the sample first) I was determined to finish it.  I have to say it is great as a soporific: even when the ship is blown through a rip is space into an alternate universe & chances for survival are between slim and none, there is a lack of tension, suspense or excitement.  It is also waterlogged: Art is constantly tearing up or weeping over one thing or another. The plot is further dragged down by the character's continuous prayers and droning on about his faith and his religion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30HYYWHVTPLLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043D2DQE#wasThisHelpful","R30HYYWHVTPLLO","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version of Jane Eyre is one of my favorites. I excitedly preordered this DVD a month ago when I found out about it.  Unfortunately, I can only give this DVD two stars. That is one star better than the last ""remastered"" release that I reviewed...the extra star is due to the fact that THIS one is at least not missing an entire scene.Far from being remastered as claimed this release is, if you can believe it, even worse than the other I reviewed.  First, it is dark & muddy--I had to crank up the brightness on my TV up almost all the way in order to see any detail at all.  Second, the picture is almost constantly filled with long scratches (sometimes right through the middle), both white & black ""drop-outs,"" and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen throughout the entire front credits.  Third, the color fluctuates several times throughout the film.  Fourth, in some scenes the sound is a bit scratchy.And to top it all off the release company (VCI Entertainment), not content to lie on their packaging, had the GALL to insert ""This Special Edition motion picture has been digitally restored to its present condition"" before the film.  There's 'truth in advertising' for you.I can't figure out why it is so impossible to get a GOOD release of this film.  But I am tired of releasing companies lying about remastering it.

"I was hesitant to buy this cover mostly due to the pictures in its listing, which seem to show a light that doesn't even extend to the opposite corner. The fact that I have not been impressed with the Amazon's Kindle covers in the past didn't help.  I went ahead and purchased it because the cover I wanted isn't available yet and I don't like to take my Kindle out and about without a cover.  Now I am glad that I went ahead and bought it.PROS:1. The light is much better than I thought it would be. Using it in a darkened room I found that the light did the job very well.  In a pitch black room, it performs even better. While the screen corner opposite the light is a bit dimmer than other areas, there is no problem reading the page at all.2.  The light gets its power from the Kindle itself, through the gold-plated hinges which attach it to the cover, so batteries are a thing of the past. When your Kindle goes to sleep, the light will go out as well.  It will also turn off when you slide it back into the case.3. The cover is slim, well-fitted and very easy to attach and detach using the hinges.  The inside has good padding. The leather outer surface has a nice pebbled texture with the exception of a smooth area along the edge of the front. While stiff enough to protect the reader, the cover is slight flexible and the front easily folds behind when reading so you can hold your Kindle with one hand if you like.4. A great plus is that the cover has an elastic cord that fits into a groove on the front of it.  This holds your cover closed (unlike the original Kindle 2 cover that would flop open in your purse & let things slide into it) and easily distinguishes the front from the back--important as many owners of the Kindle 2 cover accidentally opened it from the back, which could cause cracking along the Kindle's spine.CONS:I haven't found any, really.  The light Is a bit hard (stiff) to pull out of the cover, but then you wouldn't want it to be flopping out when you don't want to use it so that is more of a Pro than a Con.The one concern I do have is about pulling the light in and out--I wonder if whatever wiring or conductor that is used to get the power from the hinges to the light will eventually break.  But that is something to find out down the road.  Right now, the more I use this cover, the more I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS7F4X7CZ89N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DZ165W#wasThisHelpful","RPS7F4X7CZ89N","A377FNOAFVI9SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A377FNOAFVI9SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoy murder mysteries and have read quite a few.  A friend who is like minded recommended those by Cora Harrison, so I checked into them.  I had my reservations with the first book I read (My Lady Judge), but gave them a chance and found them quite satisfying.  I subsequently read 10 of them over the course of a little over a week (when I’m in the mood to read, that’s all I do and can read up to a book a day, depending upon the content).I found the characters enjoyable and distinct, especially the children of the Brehon’s school.  For some authors it’s difficult to make children seem individual; they often come out two dimensional stereotypes. Harrison does a great job of individualizing them; one never confuses one with another despite the fact that there are several of them.  They are also age-appropriate and exhibit considerable development over the course of the various books; they essentially grow up and have lives like real children do.  In this way, these books remind me of the Harry Potter series. The author’s biography indicates that she was a teacher, and if the attitude of her central character is anything to go by, she must have been a good one.  The various children are give instruction, support, responsibility, and gentle correction individualized to the personality and needs of each specific child. You couldn’t ask for more.The mysteries themselves are quite methodical; that is to say, they obey the rules of classic mysteries.  I never felt I’d been “cheated” by a heavy handed maneuver introduced to make things come out “unexpected.”  The only literary criticism I have to offer is that the author’s environmental descriptions seem repetitious, mechanical and a little dull.  Once read, they added little to the actual narrative, and I found I tended to skip over them.  Some of the strong points are that one learns a lot about the early culture of Ireland: its history, its relationship with the English, its distinctive laws, colorful language and its monuments.  I looked up some of the sites the author mentions on Wikipedia and found out that they do in fact exist.  Because I'm interested in history, I found the author's attention to authentic detail impressive.The stories harken back to a slower and more intimate time when everyone knew everyone else in a neighborhood, and people’s behavior could and was kept in line through opinion.  Apparently it was also a time when murder was dealt with in more humane ways almost impossible today.  In general I found that the books made me think through my own opinions on a lot of things one takes for granted.  In some ways I think we’ve come a long way, in others that we have lost our way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFMVSGQ6AZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N06C1K#wasThisHelpful","R1BFMVSGQ6AZY","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago I had to take French in order to finish a BA degree.  It was a miserable experience.  Not that it actually had to be, but at the time the material for reading was pretty limited and mostly “high minded.”  We started, very a propos, with Les Miserables.  I’m not much into “high minded” even in English, so the whole experience was torture.  More recently, and especially on Amazon, many more volumes of French material, high minded and otherwise, are now available.  The Harry Potter series is one of them.  I read this volume in English when everyone else did at the end of the 90’s (see my review of the English and French versions) and then later in French, when I found that I knew a lot more than I thought I did.  Since that time, I’ve read the Kindle version as well and found that the introduction of a French dictionary to it has made it even more approachable for the English speaker to manage—one no longer feels one is trying to wade knee deep in molasses, looking up every word in a separate dictionary!  One further improvement has now arisen:  I can sit with my Kindle version of the book and listen to my audio version at the same time, allowing me to follow the story, identifying individual printed words with the spoken words on the CD, learning vocabulary, pronunciation and rhythm at the same time.  At last, the real hour for learning a foreign language has arrived, and it can actually be fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0K6AZPRVQB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2070655970#wasThisHelpful","R1A0K6AZPRVQB6","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This type of book is a great way to improve your reading French.  When I first took French in college, it felt like pulling teeth.  I can handle grammar lessons—I like to understand how languages function and have taken quite a few, including Egyptian hieroglyphics and Sumerian—but I’m terrible when it comes to vocabulary.  Part of the problem was that the course focused on classic French literature, and I’m not really even an English literature type person.  I couldn’t read French because I didn’t care what it said in the first place!  Other books in French at the time were virtually non-existent, but over the years more have become available, especially through Amazon.  My favorite literary genre is the classic murder mystery, and when I found this book in French, I got it.  I read Mysterious Affair at Styles years ago in English when I was working in Saudi Arabia—there wasn’t much else to do but read—so I already had a handle on what the book should say.  Since the Kindle book comes with a dictionary (albeit in French) it helped to check my understanding of some of the words as needed, just as I would for something I was reading in English. This version also saves the reader the painful process of looking up every word in a separate dictionary which is time consuming and frustrating and often is the primary cause of “giving up” on the project. The definition pops up when you highlight the word.  By the end of the book, I had a clear feeling for the environment, the cast of characters, and the crime; I even had a good idea as to the culprit, just as I did when I read it years ago.  This story is one of Christies’ earlier works—in fact I think it’s her first book—so it’s a good place to start.  The vocabulary and sentence structure are simpler than her more developed style in later books, and the French translation seems to follow closely to the original. If murder mysteries are your guilty secret too and you want to improve your reading French, this is a good way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66YN343BME24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V55Q3Q#wasThisHelpful","R66YN343BME24","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an impressive volume, definitely the most impressive of its kind that I’ve ever read.  Not, to my certain knowledge anyway, has anything like it been published on a single specimen, a single individual.  As far as I know, neither the much studied King Tut nor the famous “Otzi the Ice Man” has received such thorough discussion in a single published work—collections of journal articles maybe, but a single volume, no.That said, however, I would also have to say that the book is not for the average reader on anthropology, archaeology, or paleontology.  You’d certainly have to be an uber-fiend of an amateur to get much out of it.  I’ve a very broad educational background including some of these disciplines, and I had difficulty wading through some of the chapters. (I had to look up anadromous fish, for instance, which I thought might be single gender or alternating single and dual gender animals, but which turned out to be fish migrating between fresh and sea water habitats.)  This is a scientific, multi-disciplinary work.  As such it’s full of details and professional jargon likely to either bore or overwhelm the casually interested reader—expect to keep a dictionary close at hand.  If you want to look at the book and pick out specific interests or at least read the conclusions, I’d recommend a library copy if you live in an area with a large public facility or have access to a university library.  Smaller library systems will probably not carry the book unless someone specifically provides for it by way of a donation.  Because of its expected limited audience, it’s somewhat expensive, about the price of a modest textbook ($60+ on Amazon when last I looked, though the Kindle edition is $40+).  If your budget is like mine, definitely limited, you might prefer to buy other books.This is more a professional’s book, and I suspect that even a professional will pick and choose among the chapters for specific information when he or she reads it.  It’s a book designed to be “referred to”  in pursuit of data (it has incredible end-chapter bibliographies); information about what happened in the discovery and study of the skeleton and about specific aspects of the skeleton itself, information perhaps relevant to a research project being undertaken by that reader.  For such an individual the purchase price may be a steal, especially if they expect to do further work in the field.  It should definitely be in a research facility’s or university’s professional library if they specialize in any of these areas of interest.The book might also make a good addition to a class syllabus for anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, ecology, etc.  It provides such a thorough discussion of each aspect of the study subject, that it becomes a good educational tool for students.  Selected chapters will show what can be learned, what can’t be, what the pitfalls are, the legal issues that arise, etc.  To some extent it also illustrates technique, the importance of documentation, and the effects of changing technology on what can be gleaned from both specimen and site, the importance of good conservation for future research, the significance of collecting specimen and samples in situ by professionals, the importance of comparative data from research and other similar specimen, the use of statistical approaches, and what different specialties have to contribute to the overall project.  Importantly it shows that even specialists within a field may not agree on interpretation or even on what they see in the physical remains and that with time and more information interpretations change.  Archaeology is definitely no longer a lone explorer armed with pick and camel hair brush looking for buried treasure; it’s a very expensive and elaborate collaboration of specialists trying to find answers to clear cut questions.  Used with consideration of course intent and of the abilities of likely students, it would be a very useful and demonstrative tool.  Permission might be obtained to reprint desired portions of the book at a nominal price to limit expense to the student; I’d check with the publisher.More interesting to both the average and the professional reader might be that part of the book which is a history of the pursuit of knowledge, in this case about the Kennewick skeleton, and more especially about the right to pursue such knowledge.  It features the legal processes needed to actually access the skeleton for scientific study and ultimately directs itself to the question of whom, if anyone, has an exclusive right to the past.  This is an ongoing argument, much like the battle between individual and group rights, but one that this particular specimen brought into the public spotlight and the courts possibly for the first time, at least in this country.  It’s certainly been followed with interest throughout the world, probably because there is often a socio-political undercurrent, with significant vested interests involved.  The need to resort to the courts established legal precedents and put the issue on the road to social integration as a concept—one has to recognize a problem exists to solve it equitably.  As with most such arguments fraught with emotional content, one legal battle will not write the outcome in stone.  There is passion on both sides which ensures an ongoing conflict unless some degree of detente can be reached—always difficult when large numbers of people are involved and a consensus even on one side is difficult, let alone on both. One should however remember that this book is written with a specific point of view, that of the scientists, and does not in any way advocate for its opponents.  To be perfectly fair one should probably read a book about the topic written from the perspective of the other side (in this case Native Americans)—after all, to have a really good argument you do need at least two sides; ask any husband and wife!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3FJ8ALF8ZW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623492009#wasThisHelpful","RF3FJ8ALF8ZW8","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though I once had a better ranking among Amazon reviewers, I’d given up doing reviews for some time for personal reasons; but this book really deserves a good review, and it’s getting one.This is probably the best book I’ve read on these subjects (The origin of life, DNA, Photosynthesis, The Complex cell, Sex, Movement, Sight, Hot Blood, Consciousness, and Death) in literally ages.  I was amazed at the amount of new insight that has been achieved over the past few years in many of the sciences and technologies involved in illuminating these areas.  I was so impressed and found the read so satisfying that I returned my library copy of the book and bought one for my Kindle, so I could reread it; something I almost never do, on the premise that there are far too many books and way too little time to read them all.  I can definitely say that this one is worth a thorough re-read.Not always the easiest, even for someone who has followed these subjects, the book is yet approachable.  (Those with a newer education, especially high school, than mine—I graduated with my last college degree in 1993 and refuse to admit how long ago I graduated from high school!!—will undoubtedly find it much easier going than I did.)  It took me two days to read it, a long time for me.  (Though I admit that I have an inordinate amount of time to read at my disposal on any given day.)  Through similes and metaphors, sometimes poetry and often humor, the author does a tremendous job of making the subject matter accessible to the nonprofessional/nonscientist among us.  He definitely has an entertaining style—in short, I was not bored.  He uses an historical approach in dealing with each subject, so that the reader gains some insight into how scientists have teased apart the various threads of information over time to achieve an ever closer approximation of how these aspects of living organisms arose.  This may be  a little confusing for some—it was for me—since the reader may feel he/she has come to “understand” the topic or feel they “already know” the material, only to discover down the line that new data have changed the story, sometimes drastically.  I can only say that this reveals how science is actually done and more importantly how it is experienced by the people doing that research.  It definitely gives one an appreciation for the very clever minds at work on these subjects.  More importantly it also makes clear how the various disciplines and technologies involved intersect and potentiate one another, creating an almost exponential amount of information by doing so.  This fact alone makes science one of the most potent tools ever created by the human mind. I enjoy this type of reading material because, as I’ve said before in other reviews, I see it as “weight-lifting for the mind.”  Since it changes so much over time, it challenges one to keep up with what’s new.  Of all the topics the author chose to discuss, I was most impressed with the advances in origin of life studies.  After plowing through a work by Christian De Duve on the subject years ago, I had sort of given up on the subject as virtually unknowable, at least to me, at the time.  I see that there is new hope for a fascinating subject and for my own ability to understand it at least superficially.  Like origin of life, each of the other areas also shows remarkable advancement.  There was not a single chapter where I did not find that what I thought I “knew” had had a major overhaul or had been totally overturned by new evidence.  Talk about a mental work out. I especially appreciated the graciousness of the author in his willing acknowledgement of the key researchers who contributed to the advancements under each category—in fact, sometimes under several categories.  He never spoke disparagingly of any one’s work; something that in my experience is not always the case in treatises of this kind—where the reader at least learns that scientists, too, are people and given to human weaknesses.  He also paid due attention to research that led to false starts or outright failure.  While disappointing to the research team, failures are important too, since they reveal what doesn’t work or isn’t true or simply needs a different approach—a point which the author himself made.  While it doesn’t lead to Nobel Prizes, all of this is information.  (I once had a professor who said he thought there ought to be a journal especially devoted to failed research for just this reason.)  I also found interesting and encouraging the number of women whose work in various fields was cited.  As a woman myself, it was nice to see that not only do women contribute but that their contributions are recognized and appreciated.An incredible book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4EF39HPF1P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D9ZLLO#wasThisHelpful","R3V4EF39HPF1P6","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm more than a little disappointed in this cell phone.  Many of the apps I enjoyed on my Driod X are not available on this one and aren't apparently available in the app stores either.  Furthermore the feature I most enjoyed on this phone, the capacity to print from my photo gallery to my printer, they just removed in my latest ""upgrade!""  The commercial apps for this feature that are free are either for a limited use only--and therefore not really free--or have received low ratings of 1-2 stars from users.  The highest starred app is $13, so I'd have to pay $13 to get what I was getting for free before.  I can't help but feel there's a definite correlation here!

"This is a beautiful little book from the Hallmark Editors.  It was first put out in the late 1960's as one of several pocket sized, hard bound books of works by noted poets, each illustrated by some of the finest artists of that company.  The Rubayyat has wonderful, almost dreamy, collage-like pictures of a Middle and Far Estern character that portray scenes from some of its cantos.  The overall work is a haunting tribute to the transitory nature of human life and beauty as translated from Persian into English by the 19th century poet and eccentric Edward Fitzgerald.Arguably the most famous and oft quoted of the passages is that of the Moving Finger:The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,Moves on; nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.My favorite however is:'Tis all all a Chequer-board of Nights and DaysWhere Destiny with Men for Pieces plays;Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays.Visually and emotionally lovely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5J0ZIUMBEXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00128YDN4#wasThisHelpful","RD5J0ZIUMBEXS","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the First half of the second season of Bonanza and both the quality of the writing and the broadening of the characters has improved tremendously since the 1st season.  The themes have begun to show a little redundancy, however, a problem which arose for exactly the reason actor Pernell Roberts (Adam) suggested it would; if you don't allow the lives of the characters to follow a normal life trajectory, the number of situations that they can find themselves in becomes more limited.For those of you who enjoyed Adam (of which I am one), there are two nice romances featuring him, ""The Hopefuls"" and ""The Savage,"" both a delight to watch.  Hoss features in a sad romance, ""The Courtship,"" which has him in love with a gambling addict, and Ben has a serious romantic encounter in ""The Mill,"" and a semi-comedic ""marriage"" in ""The Bride.""  As throughout the series, Little Joe has several romantic encounters, especially ""The Spitfire"" and ""Silent Thunder"" which give his character a little more of a serious weight than heretofore.Dan Blocker's character, Hoss, is further developed as a compassionate man in ""The Last Viking,"" where he encounter's his mother's brother whom he has idolized since childhood and with whose actual history he has to come to terms, and ""The Ape,"" where he tries to intervene in the life of a man with problems similar to his own with sad consequences.A more comedic episode, ""The Abduction"" has Hoss and Little Joe trying to find and rescue a rebellious female friend who has fallen prey to a pair of carnival workers bent on becoming wealthy by ransoming her back to her father, a silver mine magnet.  It works, but O'Henry's ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" and it's comic situations came immediately to mind and put this to shame, I'm afraid.  The comedic pairing of Dan Blocker and Michael Landon in the series is always a delight to watch, and here presages the combination that managed to carry the series itself through the elimination of Adam as part of the crew.Wonderful entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB4HJGBYIPV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044RFTDI#wasThisHelpful","R2OB4HJGBYIPV0","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Midsomer Murders is one of my all time favorite BBC series, and this set ranks with the best of the collection. The entire format was based on the novels of Caroline Graham, whose first Inspector Barnaby novel, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift,"" was published in 1988 and named as one of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time.The tone of the series as a whole is one of dark humor and stark contrasts.  Murders are often spiteful and apropos of the victim's life ways, in short they often get their just deserts.  For all the insanity of the small village murders, their suspects and victims, Barnaby's private life is completely normal.  He argues with his wife over the details of their life together, forgets, remembers or inadvertently misses important events, and manages to make up for his mistakes in agreeable ways.  Joyce is a woman used to doing things alone.  Forced by her husband's career to endure his absence, she has become a strong central character with a life of her own; my favorite statement by Joyce about her policeman husband is that at their wedding, ""Instead of saying 'I do,' he said 'I've got it!'""In this set and as usual, the evil doers are a bit crazy, the victims numerous, and inspector Barnaby quite ingenious. My favorite of the set is ""Secrets and Spies"" which features 007 types in later life; one does tend to wonder what happens to the James Bond types when they hit their late 60s and early 70s).  Here an attempt is made to sideline Barnaby to prevent him from getting too close to the truths behind past deeds kept hidden for years. Frustrated by ""old school ties"" that prevent him from doing his job, he resigns, leaving those now in control to sort things out as more people die. Proving by inaction his value as a skilled policeman and as a brilliant solver of mysteries, he is quickly reinstated and given back control over the case, which is then speedily resolved.  Lovely story.The regular characters are a treat as always. Their interpersonal relationships are a pleasure because they are so normal amidst the insanity of events. Joyce's responses to Barnaby's resignation in ""Secrets and Spies"" is so typical of their life together.  Barnaby may be a genius at crime detection, but to Joyce he's her spouse and treated accordingly and endearingly.Loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYDT6T9GU1WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AE3QUS#wasThisHelpful","R2JYDT6T9GU1WY","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second half of the 1959/60 Bonanza season, and continues with the gradual increase in quality that the later episodes of volume one (for which see my review) began. Many of the iconic features of the series have begun to arise, including the lovely watercolors that introduce the credits at the beginning and end of the episodes, the costumes of the central characters, their individual personalities and interpersonal relationships, etc.The bad guys continue to have very little by way of ""grey"" areas to them.  However, though they have very few redeeming features, the writers are now beginning to realize the benefits of exploring grey areas in order to vary their plot lines and add depth to the series. While they provide a script like that for ""Blood on the Land"" where ""bad"" is way bad--for which think virtually psychotic--they also provide that for ""The Stranger,"" where a ""bad"" guy comes to realize that his hatred of Ben has been an excuse for his own personal failures.Plot lines are generally good, though they moralize rather heavily which was characteristic of the time.  The viewer might well believe that virtually every day harbored unique and often unpleasant major events during life in the Old West, where in fact, as in every age, 99.99% of life was probably more deadly-boring than deadly-deadly. The riskiest events in one's life at the time probably involved working oneself to death with scant benefit in return.The scripts seem more even in quality, though from time to time one is left wondering ""where that came from,"" as with the episode ""Dark Star."" Here both the plot and the acting seemed a little over the top.  I couldn't help feeling that it was a script for a modern dance production!Again the series provides the viewer with selected comedic episodes.  That entitled ""San Francisco"" (April , 1960) in which Ben, Hoss, Little Joe and Hop Sing tangle with Shanghai crews, is a good example. The fact that it is Ben himself who falls victim to all the perils of which he had warned the boys and is the one who has to be rescued, is especially delightful. It also shows the man off as more than just an ""elderly parent"" and ""grandfather in waiting,"" but as a vital, physically active, and quite sexy guy who just happens to have three grown sons! The episode ""The Gunmen"" also shows that the authors of these scripts have at least a nodding acquaintance with the Greek classics, too, as this feature gives a noticeable nod to Aristophanes play, ""Lysistrata."" Here given a Western twist, the women of a small Texas town go on a sex strike to prevent their menfolk from killing one another in an on-going feud. Cute.Again, kudos for the speed of development, for wonderful memories, and plain good fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMG8HKCFZO4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DPH91S#wasThisHelpful","R2TMG8HKCFZO4Y","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first half of the first season of Bonanza, one of my favorite early TV shows.  I adored my Dad, and his favorite types of film and TV show were westerns, so of course they were mine also.  We watched Black Saddle, Two Faces West, Cheyenne, Sugar Foot, The Rebel, Have Gun Will Travel, The Big Valley, Wanted Dead or Alive, Lawman, Rifleman, etc.  Recognize some of those?  If you're over 50, you probably do.I have to admit though, that as a girl, not all westerns were quite a ""good fit"" for me.  A fairly gritty series, like Gunsmoke for instance, tended not to hold my attention a great deal.  The in-your-face realism was a little too intense for me, especially at twelve and up.  Though I can remember many of the cast members very clearly and even remember most of the actor's names to look them up on Wikipedia, I couldn't recite even a single plot to you.  I'd bet most of the guys could though.  Gunsmoke is what I would now call a little ""too testosterone overloaded.""  The ingredients in it appeal primarily to the male of our species; not because there is anything particularly sexual about it, but because it involves the challenge and rawness of actual western life--it's sort of camping out without even camping equipment, something most sensible women would never do!Bonanza on the other hand, and though with a splendid balance, has a lot more estrogen on board.  I doubt I recognized it at the time, but as an adult viewing the DVD it becomes ever so obvious.  You start out with four very attractive male people--without social attachments--who live in a very comfortable ranch-style house, dress nicely, are usually clean and tidy except when the demands of their situation prevent it, have fine, even elegant, manners, maintain a physically active lifestyle, and have impeccable standards of behavior which they usually follow though not to the point where they are stuffy and boring--i. e. they can be naughty but only just (this is TV in the 1950's after all).  Many of the plots and most of the scenes involve males being males the way women most like to see them.  When in motion, they are vigorous, purposeful and decisive.  When they are standing still, they assume characteristically ""dominant male"" poses.  If you are a woman, you know exactly what I'm talking about; if you're male and don't, you'll just have to figure it out and try it.  Some of the posterior views are to die for.  Adam has a backside that is positively a work of art; it should be hung in the Louver, though whoever decided on the baggy blue jeans in later episodes should be tried for desecration; it's like putting a beard on the Mona Lisa or putting diapers on Michelangelo's David!  Overall, though, I can't help but feel that somewhere there had to be a fairly influential woman involved in making this show, and that she had a pretty clear idea of what would appeal to the female part of the audience.Not that the male members of it were forgotten, though.  With an all male cast of eligible bachelors to identify with, the men in the audience are treated to an entire array of beautiful female guest stars chosen from some of the most famous beauties and some of the newly arising stars of stage and screen, most of them costumed with an eye to enhancing the female form.  I would note here, too, that the 1950s enjoyed the skills of some of the most brilliant couturiers of the century, ones who devoted themselves to the artistic display of the female form, any female form.  Women were not simply display racks for dresses designed as art forms themselves and the main focus of attention--not that men are particularly distracted by the modern behavior of couturiers.  The attractions of a JLo or an Angelina have nothing to do with the dresses they are wearing.  Here I would say that the costumer of Bonanza was actually pushing the envelope a bit for the 1950s, with its heavy censoring of ""family TV"" series, since not many ""nice"" women received male guests in their hotel rooms dressed in peignoirs!  If a dramatic point of character was being made, it was perhaps a bit heavy handed for the time; you have to admire that daring.  This was after all the McCarthy era, a very straight laced and politically tense period especially in media, though by 1959/60 its influence and power was being challenged and perhaps this infraction by the producers of Bonanza reveals this.The outdoor scenery is quite breathtaking, but much of it seems ""foggy,"" perhaps the effect of 50 years on the film.  Most of the set filmography is quite vivid and high in quality (possibly due to remastering?)  Some of both are reused extensively from one episode to the next, probably for reasons of budget.  The introductory shot with the Indian and the Chinaman exchanging something on the main street of Virginia City (left lower corner of the screen) is much overused in this volume and the second, for instance.  The sound stage sets leave me amazed at their versatility, some of them reappointed and used for different purposes.  I enjoy live theater, and the sets of Bonanza are very well used and strongly evoke the ambiance of that venue.  They invite the audience member to suspend disbelief and become part of the drama in doing so, in a way that modern realism in set design does not.  With the former you become a part of things by actively using the ""virtual reality"" of your mind.  With the latter you are a passive audience caught up in the illusion created in front of you.While the first episode is almost laughable and would never have found a sponsor in today's very competitive market for series, it is endearing for a naiveté, so representative of the time in which it was produced.  The words put into the mouths of the actors--""Fire and Brimstone!"" says Ben on finding his eldest and youngest sons fighting in the living room like a couple of bear cubs during episode one--are so trite, you feel embarrassed for them.  It really is quite painful in some scenes.  Furthermore some of the deliveries leave you wondering if the casting office hadn't picked out actors whose styles shared much in common with that of Edwin Booth (November 13, 1833 - June 7, 1893), that is to say pre-audio equipment theatrical bombast.  Believe it or not, the young Michael Landon (about 20 at the time) is the only one of them who manages to look like he's not just out of acting school and that despite what he's asked to say or do.  Fortunately for the modern viewer, the dialogue and the acting (or probably the directing?) become infinitely better with each episode.  I suspect this is partly a matter of the actors (or directors) becoming more comfortable with their characters.  It may also be partly a matter of the maturation of the medium of TV.  Theater and movies create characters presented with specific tasks in a specific time and place, and they present this to the audience once or several times.  TV on the other hand creates characters who have on-going lives with episodes that continually try them as people and create a sense of development and growth.  The concept was still something new in the 1950s, and given this the speed with which the series found its footing in season one is amazing and suggests the true caliber of the cast and the directors.The overall plot line of Bonanza leaves one feeling a little lost as a modern audience member.  I'm not sure that it didn't even at the time.  I think Pernell Roberts, who played the eldest son Adam, was correct when he complained that his character never quite grew up and never married.  Part of the real drama of human life is doing just that.  It became quite a joke by the end of the series that being in love with a Cartwright male was positively lethal; almost no woman in love with any one of them ever lived beyond the episode.  I agree with Roberts, this was a big mistake, since it sent Bonanza's plot line into a sort of  repetitive ""loop"" that got a bit unimaginative in a way that just wouldn't have happened had the lives of the men actually progressed through normal trajectories.  Add 4 women to any household of 4 men, and you're bound to find infinite interesting permutations: arguments, standoffs, risky behavior, warm family holidays, children, etc.  From the point of view of the female audience, this was probably a mistake.  I suspect it was one made with them in mind however; since they could fantasize themselves as The Woman in their chosen hero's life ad infinitum.  This however mistakes the capacity of women to empathize and identify with a role model.Probably one of the things I admire most about the series was its magnificent sense of comic relief; Shakespeare would have been so proud.  From time to time an entire episode was produced that broke with the sense that life on the frontier was one long fight for survival, one long parable of right and wrong.  Though not in the first season, one of my favorites of this type of Bonanza episode is that of Hoss as the Easter Bunny.  I haven't seen it in 50 years, but I still remember it vividly.  In this set, ""The Saga of Annie O'Toole,"" which involves Adam in comic complications,  and ""El Toro Grande,"" which involves his two brothers Hoss and Little Joe in a series of comic situations, are two that are very enjoyable examples.  Also akin to Shakespeare is the introduction of levity even in the midst of a serious episode, as for instance ""Enter Mark Twain"" and ""The Magnificent Adah"".  Some of the scripts were designed by very skillful writers.For rapid development, for understanding the female audience, for shear nostolgia, this is a tremendous set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OAFZ25KFW7H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DPH91I#wasThisHelpful","R3OAFZ25KFW7H3","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nancy Atherton's book Aunt Dimity:  The Vampire Hunter, is another in the collection of the Aunt Dimity series of mystery/suspense/paranormal books.  Like the others in the set, this one is charming for its English rural village ambiance, its lovely characters, and the simple openness of the heroine.  As usual, Aunt Dimity appears only as automatic writing in a diary from a soul who collects information and redirects the heroine and her search--rather as Nero Wolfe does Archie in that series, Over My Dead Body (Nero Wolfe Mysteries), Some Buried Caesar (Nero Wolfe Mysteries).  Though the story is not a murder mystery, which is my preferred fiction, and shares something with the gothic romance, my least preferred genre, I enjoyed the story, which involves the discovery of a missing person and a dissection of love and worthiness. I thought it was lovely.In style and vocabulary as well as in the mild naveté of the stories, this book like the others, are suitable to even young readers, those at 4th or 5th grade, even 3rd for those who have adequate reading skills.  The style, grammar and plot line are no more complex than the ""Little House"" series by Laura Inglas Wilder, Little House in the Big Woods Book and Charm (Charming Classics), Little House On The Prairie, etc.The countryside and the citizens of it, here including Oxfort, are well described and keep the reader's interest.

Like the others in the set, this one is charming for its English rural village ambiance, its lovely characters, and the simple openness of the heroine.  As usual, Aunt Dimity appears only as automatic writing in a diary, as good advice from a wise soul.  Though the story is not a murder mystery, which is my preferred fiction, and shares something with the gothic romance, my least preferred genre, I always enjoy the stories.In style and vocabulary as well as in the mild naïveté of the stories, the books are suitable to even young readers, those at 4th or 5th grade, even 3rd for those who have adequate reading skills.  The style, grammar and plot line are no more complex than the ""Little House"" series by Laura Inglas Wilder, Little House in the Big Woods Book and Charm (Charming Classics), Little House On The Prairie, etc.As much of the mystery here is created by the first person point of view, one that is usually conducive to identifying with the narrator of the story, the younger reader may find it difficult to make the jump.  Here the role is an American wife and mother living in England and raising her twin sons; not something a 3rd or 4th grader will have a lot to compare with.  It will allow older ones the opportunity of playing such a role.  In the context of the mystery itself, the first person narrative means that the reader knows only what the heroine knows--or thinks she does; this fact brings about confusion and misdirection until the mystery is ultimately solved. Because this is not a classic murder mystery, the author can leave few to no clues for resolving the conundrum, though she usually provides at least some.  Red herrings are, however, quite thick on the ground, which contributes to the misdirection of the reader.The countryside and the citizens of it are well described and keep the reader's interest.  The tales are noted mostly for their description of human relations, past and present, and while they deal with some of the problems that arise among people, there is no real violence or graphic unpleasantness--goodness knows we get enough of that on TV.A charming and enjoyable book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GZBFUYPANH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143114794#wasThisHelpful","R21GZBFUYPANH2","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a number of murder mysteries set in early England,  Candace Robb's Owen Archer The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08) and Ellis Peter's Brother Cadfael A Morbid Taste for Bones being my favorites, though Michael Jecks' Knights Templar mysteries A Moorland Hanging (Knights Templar Mysteries (Avon)) is also quite good, though a little darker.  Pat McIntosh's ""The Rough Collier,"" a member of the Gil Cunningham series, set in Early Scotland is an excellent addition to this genus of the murder mystery family.The characters are very well rounded, Gil and his wife are a lovely pair, and Gil's mother, the widowed Eigida, is a likable person.  The ambiance is Scotland during the 15th century, the period of Henry VIII in England.  The author creates her setting more by way of local color, dialect, period behavior and technology than by frequent allusions to historical characters and events, which would probably be poorly known in the rural area where the action takes place.  While making some comments on national and international news, she does so only in passing, which keeps the reader focused on the immediate local events while putting them into perspective and timeframe.  This very subtle technique of orienting the reader keeps them fully grounded in the fact that local events are more important to their participants and that the behavior of early people was much like our own, though limited by slower transportation, a more limited technology, and--with science only just beginning to take form--grounded more in religion and superstition than in facts as we know them.  More than anything it is the attempt to be fair and to place events on factual footing that makes these people so much like us.  While there are those who might be overly credulous and superstitious, accusing others with little or no evidence, there are people just like them in our own world.The opening is riveting, especially for anyone who has read anything about the ""bog bodies"" of Europe, since the book begins with the discovery of what is probably a sacrificial victim buried in a swampy lake that gradually became the peat bog from which the characters cut their fuel.  The murder itself is discovered very incidentally to that and the mystery devolves upon the discovery of the missing man mistakenly believed to have been the bog body.Unlike many of this type of novel, there is far less dependence on what modern readers believe to be the violent lives of the middle ages.  This is not a swashbuckler by any means.  The lives of the people are primarily governed by the day to day need to survive, not by the huge events of history books.  The simplicity of the average individual, the heavy labor required of them, the hierarchy of the tail end of the feudal era, and religious and superstitious beliefs are at the core of the story, not the deeds and misdeeds of the political elite.Since some of the characters are healers and the author describes some of the afflictions well, I particularly enjoyed diagnosing a case of diabetes from what I know of the symptoms--though I suspect a bit of hepato-renal syndrome working there too.  The clues are well distributed, and though clear are not necessarily easily picked out, though I knew who the culprit was well before the dénouement.While the mystery entertained me, it was primarily the interactions of the various characters, even the ancillary ones, that I liked most.  I enjoyed spending time with them and will probably read another of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Z3KJAKEAP86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569475814#wasThisHelpful","R18Z3KJAKEAP86","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure I'd like this book, but I did.  The book is sort of a cross between a romance novel and a dark secrets novel.  The characters are agreeable, the ambiance was enjoyable (present day in a remodelled 19th century faux abbey), and the concept of automatic writing intriguing.  Familiar as I am with major snow storms (I live in Minneapolis) I also enjoyed the mildly cozy, if somewhat claustrophobic aura of the setting.  (Now that I'm retired I can feel more generous about these kinds of events; those who still have to shovel their cars out from under 3 feet of snow in order to avoid being either plowed under even more snow or towed and ticketed from a snow emergency route, or hazarding their way to work at 6am will of course feel differently about it.)While no murders take place, there is a mystery.  The author does an amazing job of keeping the reader convinced that there is in fact a mystery in the rather innocuous events as they proceed.  So good is she at it that she keeps one reading even when nothing much unusual seems to be happening at all.  Just when the reader is convinced that Lori's imagination is running away with her, something becomes clear and the story takes off.I found the pink bunny an interesting touch and the automatic writing diary almost Harry Potteresque!  Shades of Tom Riddle!!  Enough at least to read another if not several more of the books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5CQ1L8DLQ9OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143034588#wasThisHelpful","R5CQ1L8DLQ9OL","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure if I liked the characters in this book or not.  I felt much as I do about the Agatha Raisin novels, where I enjoy the collateral characters much more than the central protagonist.  I think I finally came down slightly more on the ""do"" rather than the ""don't"" side, or at least enough to try a second book.  I found the characters a little abrasive, though I couldn't help feeling the author in the background.  He seems to dislike everyone famous.  Since he works for Disney, perhaps he's met a lot of them and found them unpleasant.  He certainly trashes as many famous names as he can in 291 pages.  Perhaps that's really how ""famous movie stars"" feel about their coworkers.The murder itself is pretty straight forward.  It doesn't violate any of the ""rules"" of that type of fiction.  By the time the character is ""polished off"" one wonders why it hadn't happened long ago.  In fact I wonder why I hadn't done it.  The clues are there, scattered appropriately, but rather obviously.  I already knew who the murderer was well before the end.  I read mostly for the ambiance; murder aboard ships and trains always has a bit of an appeal, hence my favorite Agatha Christies' ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""Death on the Nile.""  I also find myself less nostalgic about the 1970s (when the central character was said to have been famous) than say the 1920s and 1930s, which I actually think of as ""history.""  (I gather the author was born well after midcentury, say about 1960s?)  Somehow I don't think that mystery writers colonizing the late 19th and early 20th century with sleuths and victims have much to worry about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1JY1QV3S9MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758229402#wasThisHelpful","R1F1JY1QV3S9MO","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Diamond of Darkhold"" is another entry to the Ember series.  It carries on the trials and successes of the combined citizens of Ember and Sparks using many of the familiar characters, including the main protagonists, Doon and Lina and their respective families.While I continue to enjoy the characters and the ambiance against which their activities are carried out through time, I found this book a little less impressive than the first two.  There are fewer lessons taught, and I found the idea of 13 year olds exploring a cave on their own a little alarming as a role model.  While their idea of finding useable items to help the stressed and struggling citizens of their town by a return to and a search of their old home Ember a good one, I found their decision to do that exploration on their own without telling anyone a little alarming.  A message left where it would not be found until it might be too late to help stranded children is hardly a good idea.  Nor is the suggestion to young readers that it might be a good one.  While I agree that it is something that children of that age might think logical and actually do, I think the lack of wisdom of the adventure as it was planned should have been brought home more clearly.I was also disappointed in the rather abrupt advance to the future in the final pages of the book, where Lina and Doon's lives are charted very clearly.  It set a stamp of finality on the story which I was disappointed to see.  The reader should have had the opportunity of growing with the young people, learning the lessons that they learned along the way.  It felt as though the author had tired of her characters and their story and simply put ""...and they lived happily ever after"" as a sign that there wasn't anything more to say.Seems to me there would be a lot to say about growing up in the world of Sparks and beyond.  Laura Ingals Wilder didn't seem to have any trouble, and the Embers series is essentially a modern style ""life on the frontier"" story about making do, self reliance, helping neighbors, being innovative, etc.  Wilder would have loved it.  Furthermore new characters had been added that I felt would have benefited from development in future episodes.  Old characters that had left, such as the rabble rouser Tick, might certainly have been reintroduced to stir things up a bit.  And the suggestion that bad people, rather than just wolves, might attack the unsuspecting town of Sparks, as had apparently happen to a town mentioned in this story, suggests that life would not be dull in the future.  The author's incredible capacity to see beyond the surface of characters to reveal hidden depths and her ability to see two sides of a character's story, would surely give new episodes much to teach the reader about people and about fortune and fate.  I feel like she threw this opportunity away.While I understand that actually growing to adulthood can be daunting and often disappointing, things don't end till they end.  J. K. Rowling seems to be the only author of children's stories to understand that life doesn't end at thirteen, and that the children who loved her story when they were 13 will probably love to read the adventures of the characters at 14 and etc.  Read any book on developmental psychology or pediatrics and one will be told that each growth stage has its tasks to learn and its own trials and tribulations in learning them. Part of the task of children's literature is helping children to learn these tasks and lessons from good role models, children with whose conflicts and confusion they can identify.  By the time they reach young adulthood, other types of fiction and nonfiction, college, work and starting a family will take over where the children's books left off.  By that time they already know that ""happily ever after"" is a euphamism for ""who knows what happens next?""  By that time, they'll be better equipped to deal with whatever it is.My guess is that the author doesn't like to ""live"" in the world she has created if she has to live with young people learning ever more serious truths.  Goodness knows the Harry Potter children ended up living through a war that took the lives of some of their best friends and major adult influences.  That's a pretty grim thing; unfortunately that's the world.  Ms. DuPrau's characters have already lived through some extremely grim events and have taught us all a little about living life the right way, even if it is difficult.I just hope she changes her mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N366S4GP2IU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375855726#wasThisHelpful","R2N366S4GP2IU3","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt"" is probably not a book for everyone, even for those with a casual interest in the Pharaohs of Egypt.  The latter might glean some of the basic history of the succession and of the basic events of the pharaohs, but almost 2/3 of the book is dedicated to the known individual members of these families and the physical record that supports both their identities and their relationships.Most interesting for the general reader will be the proposed relationships between some of the dynasties.  It would appear that in many transitions from one ruling family to the next, there was at least a tenuous link between them often by way of collateral members of the previous dynasty.  These links, however, are made somewhat tenuous by the fact that similar names reoccur, not only through the generations but sometimes within a generation--often as the result of one person with the name dying and a newborn brother or sister being given the same name again.  Proposed links are often made on the basis of other data identifying the individual, usually similar titles, or by more specific information taken from the tombs or other property of relatives or official subordinates.  The roundabout way of creating biographies of these people is truly ingenious.  It shows how thin on the ground actual historical evidence really is and how and on what Egyptian history is written.  The importance of the tomb data from officials and collateral family is very clear.I was surprised to find that a number of details in the histories of individual rulers had been changed based on new interpretation of old data.  Ramses II had been believed to be a usurper of the throne and guilty of the murder of his presumed elder brother, but recent scrutiny of the monumental data for this supposed event has since exonerated him of the crime of fratricide.  Apparently the ""elder"" son did not exist, the fragmented data on which his existance was based is actually about another person, apparently a minor military person.A personal error of my own was also clarified.  I have been in the tomb of Amenhirkopshef, whom I knew to be the eldest son of Ramses II by his Queen Nefertiry (possibly the son who died in one of the plagues in the Bible) but as it turns out that particular son was buried in a group tomb, KV5, built for the sons of Ramses II while that which I had seen (QV55) was of another younger man of the same name who was a son of Ramses III.  (The tomb contains beautiful paintings, comparable to those of Nefertiry, from the Ramsid era).It would also appear that there is more information about Nefertiti's possible origin; Ay having been suggested as her father and also as the brother of Queen Ty, which would certainly explain Nefertiti's considerable political presence at the Armarna court during her reign and Ay's unusual succession to the throne after the death of Tutankhamen.  (One can't help but wonder what kind of major drama was taking place at the end of the 18th Dynasty.) Previously it had been suggested that she may herself been a Hittite princess, which would have made her daughter's request for a Hittite Prince as consort reasonable, ie. a cousin marriage.  Having since seen the translation of the original letter, I would say it's arrogance suggests there was little sense of family.The identity of Akhenaton's secondary wife, Kiya, as Tadukhipa, the daughter of the Mitannian king Tushratta, also seems plausible.  I had read years ago that it was believed that Tadukhipa, while sent to be a bride for Amenhotep III, had become instead the wife of his successor, Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton).  A previous marriage of a daughter of Shuttarna II the previous king of Mitanni, Gilukhipa, actually does seem to have taken place with Amenhotep III and is recorded by a marriage scarab.  The likelihood of successive dynasts of the two kingdoms re-engineering their international contracts in this way is strong, and the name Kiya might easily be in keeping with either of the ladies.  Given the power of Queen Ty and Nefertiti at their respective courts, it is hardly surprising that nothing much else was heard of either of the foreign princesses.Interesting book, but probably more for those with a high rather than casual degree of interest in Egyptian history.  For the latter I would suggest Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign-By-Reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt by Peter A. Clayton.  (""Product link"" does not work for this listing or the author, but the book is listed under its title.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RROKHRGDDYETA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0500288577#wasThisHelpful","RROKHRGDDYETA","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is listed as a prequel to the series ""The City of Ember"" and ""The People of Sparks.""  Though it is, it doesn't become clear that it is and why until quite late in the book.  Unlike the Star Wars prequels, which started off the whole idea of prequels in the first place, this book doesn't start with an understood lineage of characters.  Though the clues are clever, they don't quite make up for the lack of actual continuity.  As a result there is a great sense of disconnect that I found disconcerting, like I was treading water while trying to find something familiar to grab hold of and anchor me to the other books.The ""People of Yonwood"" was kind of a scary book because it so mirrors our own unstable world.  While the problems of the present decade appear to be more financial and environmental than military, the worldwide problems that could impact the viability of the human species and bring on Armageddon are still with us.  Its impact on people's behavior, and especially on the concerns of children growing up with it, is very clear in the book.  To that extent it is probably a better book for parents raising children during difficult times than it is for the children themselves.The Prophet of Yonwood begins with a surprising premise; that the babbling of someone, perhaps suffering from a stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) or even sunstoke, might be taken as the prophetic prognostications of approaching doom during a moment of international tension and start a bizarre series of events in a small town.  The town of Yonwood becomes a microcosm of the world; the citizens' strange ideas of what ""God wants"" leading to attacks on the civil rights of unpopular or different townspeople, even to the temporary export of the town's canine pets in order to comply with His dictates and in order to forestall disaster at least for their own small town.  In the midst of this a young girl and her friends grow up, deciding whether they are to be led by this extreme behavior among the adults or try to steer a more sensible course by the guidelines of a more universal code of ethics.  Young and inexperienced, they occasionally find themselves confused about what is the ""right"" way until events give them a clear idea of what the adult alternative in Yonwood actually means.One thing the author failed to deal with was the occurrence of self-fulfilling prophecy.  In the book the town goes back to normal--maybe because there were still enough people who hadn't bought into the whole thing.  However for those who had done what they thought God wanted, seeing the threat of international conflict deescalate would have seemed like ""proof"" that they had been ""right"".  In most cases the individuals would have seen their actions as having ""caused"" the de-escalation.  At least in Yonwood people would probably have remained a little bizarre for quite a while.A good education in thinking for yourself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJJLTG2CJ6AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440421241#wasThisHelpful","R2JJJLTG2CJ6AT","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The People of Sparks"" is a follow up to the ""City of Ember"" by Jeanne DuPrau.  I'd read an introductory chapter of it in the latter book, and decided I'd to read it too.  I was not disappointed.Many of the original characters appear again in this book which deals with the ongoing trials of the people of Ember as they attempt to learn how to live in a world totally alien to them.  Lina and Doon lose their premier place as ""leaders,"" as the people of Ember, including the two children, discover that they must go through a difficult process of making their way among native people who have a lot to lose by helping them.  Misunderstandings and outright sabotage by individuals from both groups, each with an agenda of his own, put both populations at risk of outright war until Lina and Doon step in and change the trajectory of events.The book is again a good display of what really occurs in the process of growing up and of the mistakes that can and do occur, and having occurred cause mishaps of varying degrees.  Both Lina and Doon can be attracted to those who present themselves as role models, but neither do so without consideration.  Doon especially takes time to decide whether the charismatic Tick is all he seems to be, noting that Tick's ideas, while they get everyone going on projects, never seem to come to fruition.  He also notes that Tick himself never dirties his hands; he's strictly an idea guy. The story is very much a cautionary tale, pointing out the folly of blind adherence to the directions of charismatic leaders and the destructive nature of mass behavior that can lead to as much damage to the ""self"" as to the ""other.""While the situation is entirely fictional and futuristic, it is not without accuracy.  If anything the book makes it clear that anger about events can lead to escalating violence, and that ""group think"" can make it difficult to reverse the tide leading to deadly conflict.  It also illustrates that though it takes a good deal of courage to rise above the anger and change direction, it can take as little as one individual to start the trend, that one person can indeed make a difference.A good sequel with a lot to teach.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6OH59NG6WC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375828257#wasThisHelpful","RC6OH59NG6WC5","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read all of the books in English and three of them in French, seen all of the films up to this one, and have enjoyed the series immensely.  I have nothing but admiration for the creative mind of the author--well a little jealousy too perhaps.This was a great finale to a fine series of books and films.  While I was very disappointed in Part I, which was essentially a gorgeously filmed travelogue, and almost didn't go to Part II because of it, I'm glad I broke down and did. I'm still confused as to why they didn't get to the point and just do Deathly Hallows as a single film.  I assume the Deathlyl Hallows was going to be hideously expensive to make, and a less expensive Part I would help defray the cost of the whole without making the film prohibitively expensive to audience.  You saw Deathly Hallows on the installment plan so-to-speak!Part II is essentially a very ""dark"" film, both cinematically and metaphorically, but it brings about a dénouement that has been building up for almost a decade.  The film follows the book closely with just a slight alteration in the role of the Snape character.  This was totally acceptable in my opinion, since although I could understand both his behavior and his motivation, I wasn't always certain that the books themselves made either very clear to the reader.  One had to do a lot of reading between the lines, which for an adult was not that difficult, but which for younger readers might have been.  I think it was important, because it revealed yet again that one cannot always assume one knows what's going on beyond the surface that people present to us.  I think it was also a good source of character development for Harry, since he came to understand at the moment of the man's death, that his life had been lived in almost constant sacrifice for the love of Harry's mother and for Harry himself.  It was a beautiful and well played role, and I think Alan Rickman deserves public acknowledgment for creating it so superbly.As usual for a ""good versus evil"" film, there are deaths of a number of familiar characters, but that happens in any war.  In fact the entire build up to the event would have seemed familiar to those who grew up before WWI and fought during it, and definitely to those who grew up to fight in WWII.  Likewise, characters that had been taken rather lightly as children grew up to take a far more active and dedicated role in these events than their friends would have expected or even they themselves might have predicted.  Even characters who had been considered evil, who may even have been evil at the moment, stepped up to the plate when it became obvious that no one could stand on the sidelines and expect to come out of the fray unaffected.  Nor were acts of courage, sacrifice, or kindness forgotten.  Wonderful lessons.A great climax to a beloved series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAYSCQH96ZPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UV4XIS#wasThisHelpful","R1OAYSCQH96ZPA","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fun movie.  It was made more so by the restrained hand of the scriptwriter and the selective care of the director.  While it was an extremely improbable plot, and it would certainly have lent itself to complete kitsch or camp, it didn't seem to wander that direction at all.  It was played almost entirely straight like a classic western (a la High Noon (Collector's Edition), The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition), and Shane) with just enough humor to break the tension in order to rekindle it to new heights later in the film.  Shakespeare would have been proud--Heck, Shakespeare would have had fun with the concept had it occurred to him!The story partakes of a bit of both sci-fi and the western, creating a sort of ""what if?"" ambiance.  It pits the grit of late 19th century Southwesterners intent on reclaiming their family memebers, dead or alive, or die trying against a higher tech race of aliens bent on taking over the planet--or at least its gold supply.  Though the weapons of the former are primitive by comparison to their enemies, their ability to bury their differences and risk their lives for a common goal is their strong suite.  Furthermore, it is ultimately not their vulnerability that counts but that of their alien enemies.  The aliens are at base no more immortal or immune to harm than humans are, and their apparent contempt for humans proves their undoing.The use of CGI in the film was admirably restrained.  In short it was never introduced to the point where it dominated the screen or the live actors on it.  The animated characters were there as the ""bad guys,"" not to impress us with the quality of computer graphics---with which even the elderly are probably more than familiar by now.The primary heroes were all consummate actors; Harrison Ford, who is very used to the concept of animation and blue screen techniques, seemed especially comfortable in his role, and Danial Craig was wonderful.  His deadpan affect was just what was needed in the role of anti-hero pressed into the service of mankind by circumstances.  I also appreciated the director's take on a well shaped derrière framed by leather chaps!  The heroine, Olivia Wilde, was mysterious and engaging; her placement in a role of self sacrifice was moving; so often it is a male character that makes the ultimate sacrifice for human kind, making it seem as though women are either unwilling or incapable of doing so.  It was a good choice.  So was the fact that she did not return to give the film a standard ""happy ending.""  Again a remarkable sense of restraint in a film that could have gone way over the top.In all an entertaining film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y19MCKGHV9KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPYZSK#wasThisHelpful","R2Y19MCKGHV9KJ","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a cute movie, but oh so hard to watch at the end.  I actually enjoyed Marmaduke more because they didn't deal with the animal's final moments and they included the dog's point of view.  One is always so joyous over a puppy or even a young dog, but no matter how long-lived the breed, for a loving family it is NEVER long enough.  The pain of the last ""goodbye"" is in direct proportion to the amount of love one feels for the animal, and it is a moot point when dealing with the anguish of loss over a good and loyal friend and family member whether it is worth going through it ever again with another.Anyone with a pet of any kind will understand the ups and downs of the Grogans and their Labrador Marley.  I gather from the content that the movie is based on a true story, which I can believe.  Though I didn't have as much trouble with my Great Dane Courageous, I had at least some of the issues.  (If you think a Lab can drag you along on a ""walk,"" try walking a 175# Great Dane!)While some reviewers suggest that the movie isn't for children, I have to disagree.  I suspect small children will deal better with the end than adults will; I'm always amazed at the resilience of children.  Perhaps it's that they have no clue about what dying really means.  Having worked in Pediatrics, both in ICU and in bone marrow transplant, I can say they are a whole lot more stoic about the prospect than adults are, even when it's the possibility of their own death that looms.  I think the end of the dog's life was dealt with well and would help children understand and deal with a forthcoming loss in their own lives.  One can collapse into an hour and half the entire life of a dog, see its contributions to family life, understand that everyone gets old, that sometimes even though it's sad for us because the family member or pet is no longer with us, death comes as a natural thing, even a welcome thing at the end of a well spent life.Dogs have a lot to teach us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB82SCIJGY0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001REZM6K#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB82SCIJGY0S","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't often give a negative review but this one deserves it.I was very disappointed in this book, which I'd expected to provide new data that answered legitimate questions about pre-dynastic Egypt.  There are a number of them, including from whence the classical culture came, when it arrived, where writing originated, etc.  I expected discussions of climatic changes, the recent discoveries of settlements in the western desert, an ancient burial that exhibited what appeared to be among the first real embalmings in the area, etc.  A lot of research has gone on in Egypt, particularly its oases regions, and I had hoped for a book that brought some of the data together in a coherent and meaningful way.  I didn't get it.  It seemed promising on first reading some of the chapters, and I even made an effort to suspend disbelief enough to gain some new perspective; the author just took a few too many liberties with my capacity to believe.This is a good book for anyone interested in aliens founding human civilizations, for followers of the Atlantis legend, or for those who think our ancestors knew ""something we don't,"" etc.  I'm not.  The author sort of lost me when he started talking about some standing stones in the Egyptian western desert as providing information about the comparative recessional velocity of certain distant stars in the constellation of Orion.  Not to mention the really stunning information that the Great Pyramid of Giza was actually not a burial chamber but some sort of transistor and power station that produced electricity.  The book reminds me a lot of Erich von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods, or Twilight of the Gods: The Mayan Calendar and the Return of the Extraterrestrials, or Immanuel Velikovsky'sWorlds in Collision, both of whom made wonderful light reading but didn't do much for history, religion or astrophysics.  (I remember reading a book by Carl Sagan that said he told an historian he was impressed by the history of Velikovsky but not by the physics, and that person said he'd been impressed by the physics but not by the history!)  Here again, anyone with any degree of understanding of both fields will smell a distinct odor in these pages!I suppose one should have suspected this by virtue of the author's vita.  He is ""a software developer and historical researcher with particular interest in how religious texts may serve as eyewitness accounts to historical events [from the cover].""  While I do not mind reading well researched history by a journalist, even an amateur, I expect more than an attempt to write something different that panders to popular entertainment.  I suppose I should have understood the genre the author was writing from the subtitle:  ""Egypt's Mysterious Prehistory.""  Lest anyone think I am unwilling to entertain alternative hypotheses, I have read Schoch's work on the sphinx and am willing to accept an alternative date to the features present providing others find similar supporting results, and it would appear that not many have.  In fact, it would appear that there are now several theories as to how the sphinx became so eroded.  I await a verdict.  Since I have a nearly complete degree in geology, an MA in ancient history (I was a straight A student in Egyptian hieroglyphics), an interest in cosmology and physics, have lived in Arizona, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia which gives me a degree of understanding of these arid environments, and have seen the sphinx many times, I'm all ears when it comes to ideas!  Though I find the subject interesting on many levels, so far the historians still have my vote on the subject. Similarly Mr. Malkowski's other ideas regarding history leave me a little surprised and doubtful.Mr. Malkowski tends to stretch his data to extremes.  Approaching it with preconceived ideas, he finds what he's looking for; this is particularly apparent when he deals with the lithic remains at Nabta Playa.  As other astronomers have often said of interpretations of Stonehenge and other early megalithic structures, you can find whatever you decide to find.  Particularly in this instance, once the author defines what he wants to find, he then chooses the ""age"" at which this is most likely to have been, then decides that the early builders must have had this knowledge and built the configuration accordingly.  This is very circular reasoning.  Furthermore, it denigrates the actual accomplishments of our ancestors.  It wasn't good enough apparently to have survived massive climate changes?  It wasn't good enough that they created some pretty astounding foundations for later civilization?  Not for the author.  For him they must have understood high tech astronomy and used electricity.  They did a lot and they did it by using their heads and available human energy.  Technology and cultural advancements proceed in tandem.  This is evident even in a popular series like James Burke's Connections, and Connections 1 (5 - Disc Set).To diminish the opposing view in the reader's estimate, the author tends to use emotive words.  He denigrates the standard view as ""conventional,"" their objections as ""fevered,"" or the new ideas as ""an academics worst nightmare.""  This could easiy suggest that there is a collusion to prevent alternate ideas from being aired which isn't the case.  Any archaeologist worth his salt would love to prove the Great Pyramid was a power station or something exotic--talk about immediate tenure and wildly lucrative publication rights!!!--but the data just aren't there.  In general I doubt that the phalanx of creditable scientists and archeologists are in anyway intimidated by the findings the author cites in favor of some of his observations.  Like most of the sciences--and even a social science like archaeology partakes hugely of the sciences these days--the proof is in the original data and in finding further evidence that supports it.  Even Dr. Schoch's discussion of the sphinx data is proposed as a hypothesis to be discussed and supported or refuted.  That's how science is supposed to be done.I give it a two for entertainment value only.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZMIJR3S0Q5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591430488#wasThisHelpful","RTZMIJR3S0Q5O","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Harry Potter came out I ran across an internet article that described a number of children's films as more or less Harry Potter wannabes that failed to capture audience share.  The comments posted on the article suggested that a number of readers felt this was a harsh assessment, so I decided to view some of these films and read the books upon which they were based. The Golden Compass was one of those cited.The story is hardly a Harry Potter wannabe, though it probably owes a lot to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Movie Tie-in Edition (Narnia).  While it deals with the same issues facing young people--friendship, courage, loss, development of an identity--these are all things that are part of the genre and not specific to Harry Potter.  Almost all literature is based to some degree on predecessors.  There is probably only one children's book I can think of that seems truely divorced from all other formats and that is Alice in Wonderland, though Through the Looking Glass: Complete and Unabridged might be said to have given even that a ""copycat.""The story of The Golden Compass essentially describes what actually happens to children in society at large.  Schooling, society's priorities and stern discipline of infractions do indeed mold people to ""fit,"" whether they want to or not.  In essence children's spirits, or here their ""demons,"" are forced to conform or be lost.  The question isn't whether or not they are, but to whose agenda they are ultimately molded, and that is determined by a society almost always dominated by adults.  It comes as no surpise that it is the child's own mother who is among the forces suppressing other children and their families while protecting her own daughter and her demon from similar forces.The universal ""correctness"" of society is what the young always question, and it is usually the young and spirited that force society itself to change by degree over time.  It is for this reason that life now is so different from life in ones grandparent's generation.  The difference is easier to see when looking back three generations.  It is hardly surprising then that it is children that are perceived as ""dangerous"" by the adult powers in this story.  Adults have a heavy investment in the status quo; any changes can work to their distinct disadvantage and to that of their children.  At base, the Golden Compass might be seen as an unbiased guide to how society is ""supposed to be,"" which is why the adults want to suppress it and why only a child can ""read"" it.Although I have yet to read the book, I did watch the film.  I was a little disappointed in it.  While it certainly deals with the issues facing children, it seemed to lack charm.  I couldn't help wonder if the problem was less the children and more the adults.  A number of high profile actors played adult roles and did so superbly.  However, the quality of their acting ended up overwhelming the child roles, creating a sense that the story was more about adults and less about children and the ""magic"" of youth.  This is an odd way to convey philosophical information to adults, most of whom know it already and a disappointing way of presenting it to children.  (For myself I worried less about either and more about the animal ""demons"".)  Somehow it just didn't come together well.Perhaps the problem is that the actual goal of the film--which was probably about making money and not about messages at all--even perhaps of the book on which it was founded, was indeterminate.  Was the story about adults who feared change?  Or was it about the spirit of children and the necessity, even imperative, of change.  Maybe it was simply left to the audience to decide for themselves: sacrifice security and tradition and endure rigidity and loss of creativity, or endure anarchy and shifting fortune for the privilege of creativity and change.  In the end the film seemed ambivalent.  History tells us that time is not.  (Evolution tells us that it cannot afford to be.)The film is a nice blend of CGI characters and live action (though I couldn't help feel that the whole metaphor of the ""spirit"" of youth captured in ""demon"" animals was a little heavy handed).  I enjoyed all of the animals immensely.  The genre has come a long way since Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Vista Series)!  The sets and costumes were beautiful and evocative of the 1930s and that quintessential of all ridged and totalitarian regimes, the Nazis of the same period.  It was precisely this that made the decision for the viewer that change and creativity must be more valuable than stability.  It usually is, but the question is always for whom?","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301SMLTQ2EEGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00139W3NE#wasThisHelpful","R301SMLTQ2EEGR","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the book cover and some of the accompanying acknowledgments the book was written by a young man, starting at the age of 15.  I'm amazed.  While I thought the book was rather wordy, I can't fault the author for his stunning descriptive narrative and his polished dialogue.  There was never a time when I did not have a complete visual take on where I was and what was going on there.  Furthermore the vocabulary was amazing, meaning that there was very little sense of monotony or repetition.Mr. Paolini also seems to have had a good overall handle on life during a period that might be described as mythic ""early medieval,""  where magic and dragons serve as the science and technology of their time.  The ""ancient language"" appears to have a flavor of Celtic, possibly Welsh---I've seen some words like ""tuatha du"" in titles of chronicles/poems from the period--about it that ties in well with the notion of giants, trolls, mountain dwarves, dragons and elves.The action takes place logically and carries the reader through to the end smoothly.  While I found the many episodes a little redundant for my tastes, I can't fault the degree to which they helped character growth.  The appearance and demise of a number of the characters also suggested that the author enjoyed creating them but then didn't quite know what to do with them over the course of the narrative, so eliminated them.  This of course provided motive for the central character and contributed to the force of the story--though it perhaps blatently manipulates the emotions--but I was disappointed seeing such carefully crafted individuals ""wasted""--though certainly waste of good people happens in real life, which may have been the point of the story.  My favorite character was the dragon, probably because I'm very fond of animals.  For a character even younger than the hero, she is very sensible, courageous, and caring.  The degree of her vulnerability makes her actions and sacrifices real and poignant.  She reminds me a little of my Great Dane, Courageous, who also seemed wise at least to me.More than anything, I think the book shows that life is an ongoing struggle and that the valiant youth of one generation become the disappointed elders of the next.  There is no ""happy ending"" or even ""unhappy ending"" in real life.  The struggle continues until the end of time and ""happy"" is a relative term affected by a number of caveats.  As Solon of Athens told Croesus of Lydia, you can't decide you are the happiest and most fortunate of men until your death.  At best there is a temporary status quo that benefits one or another group.  It is often that status quo that is upset by the anarchy of youth that leads to new growth and a new golden age.  Perhaps in the end it is only the struggle that counts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1678ECQ3TETZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SI8T44#wasThisHelpful","R1678ECQ3TETZ6","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these characters and have read all of Rhys Bowen's Royal Spyness series.  Though my favorite is still the first volume, Her Royal Spyness (A Royal Spyness Mystery)) since it has the most truely outrageous comments on life among the royals, this one isn't a bad installment.  Having read Dracula--an unusual book written in the form of diaries by all the central characters--I found it enjoyable seeing the ambiance and details of that story woven into a modern murder mystery.Anyone who has read earlier stories will find the reintroduction of the odious ""fishface,"" Prince Siegfried of Romania--who really was an unpleasant person in real life--and the on going collusion among the royal houses to get Georgie married to the man familiar.  She again has a ""close call.""  My favorite character is, as usual, Georgie's rather self-centered mother, a beautiful former actress, though her friend Belinda is a close second.  They're both tell-it-like-it-is types and capture in personified form the essence of the era as it has come down to us in the films of the period.  I was a little disappointed in their not taking more of a key part in the stories; it was as though they put in appearences because readers would expect it.  They really do deserve a greater role in affairs than they have had of late.  The introduction of a new character, in the form of a bumbling lady's maid, also deserves fleshing out in future books.I think part of the allure of the series is the delightful balance of classic murder mystery and screwball comedy, both popular film types during the period of the 1920's and 1930's in which the narrative is set. Furthermore, as with the mysteries by Anne Perry, (We Shall Not Sleep: A Novel (World War One Novels)) and Jacqueline Winspear (Maisie Dobbs (Book 1)) the reader, aware of the looming threat of world war two as they almost must be, cannot help but enjoy the events for what they are, a brief interlude of peace and prosperity before disaster.  This fact gives the stories a high degree of poignance, as we know that Georgie's world will be forever changed in the future.  Her would be lover might not survive the conflict--given his personality will almost certainly play a key and dangerous role--and her world will be forever changed after it.Now we just need someone to make them all into a PBS/BBC mystery series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IHH2W9WIEQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425234460#wasThisHelpful","R14IHH2W9WIEQP","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a book that deals realistically with Hatchepsut.  I first ran across this queen when I was about eleven years old in a book in our school library entitled, The gift of the river;: A history of ancient Egypt.  I subsequently ran into her story on many occasions in the course of my reading on ancient history, and as Dr. Tyldesley notes, usually written in the terms of either great disapproval or of romantic melodrama.  It occurred to me, even at that young age, that something about the story as it was interpreted by the historians recounting it just didn't make much sense.  Why would any ruling queen give the command of the army to any person whose absolute loyalty she had any cause to suspect?  Why wouldn't she just discretely bump him off?  And if she was really all that appalling, why didn't someone just bump her off?  I had already read biographies of Queen Elizabeth I of England and knew that a queen was quite capable of playing ""hard ball"" with the best of them and could pick competent advisors just as well as any king could.  It just didn't add up to me, not at eleven and not since.Having since gotten a Master's Degree in history and recently taken an interest in English history, I must say that England's experience with monarchy, especially with succession issues, is a very good illustration of just the types of problems that can arise and what types of problems the elite of Egypt might also have been trying to contain during the Tuthmosid period.  When power is up for grabs, everything can fall to pieces, leaving it anyone's guess how it will come out.  Heads may well roll, but they may not be the heads you expected it to be!  More importantly, once they start to roll, sometimes they keep rolling until very few are left unaffected by the bloodshed.  Part of the great concern of Henry VIII in his pursuit of a male heir was the avoidance of just that question over succession that had led to violence in the past.  The Egyptians of Hatchepsut's time cannot have failed to notice that failed succession in previous dynasties had led to disorder and collapse, the failure of ma'at as the author notes.It would appear that there had already been a problem over succession earlier in the dynasty, since Amenhotep I had associated the non-related Tuthmosis I, Hatchepsut's father, with him in order to secure a smooth transition.  It would appear that this king himself was unsure of the likelihood that his son own son would survive to rule, since the Royal Princess was not married to Tuthmosis II until quite late, as though the family were holding her back for another candidate should it become necessary.  From what the author suggests, it would appear that the viability of young Tuthmosis III might have been inquestion, that he was possibly a very young child, even an infant, when Tuthmosis II died.  That the Queen Consort should take over as regent on his behalf is hardly surprising.  That she waited almost 2 years before making herself king suggests that there may have been something going on that necessitated the move.  Though the author suggests a possible threat from collateral family, I'm inclined to believe it may have been a threat from outside.  Maybe the latter brought on the former.  By making it apparent that Egypt had a strong adult king on the throne, there were less likely to be problems on Egypt's borders, at least none that couldn't be dealt with and without risking the young heir.As to her relationship with Tuthmosis III, Hatchepsut certainly did nothing that a reigning monarch would not have done; she made him co-regent.  Co-regency had been started during Dynasty XII, primarily because of the assassination that had brought that dynasty into power; essentially they weren't going to risk a similar instance in their own rule.  It made eminent sense to associate a young junior king with the senior.  It gave the younger man time to learn diplomacy, government, and military affairs in a stable environment.  It gave the elder a chance to set aside some of the more physically demanding roles of kingship--essentially the two ""double teamed"" the country and the world.  Since it would appear that Hatchepsut may have undertaken military activity early in her reign she probably made Egypt's continued strength known at her borders.  Certainly it would appear from his inscriptions and his later military activities that Tuthmosis's military training was not stinted.  I think it's safe to say that when he was old enough to command in the field, he probably did.  In short the transition took place as usual.By taking advantage of the inherent duality of the role of pharaoh, Hatchepsut could function as ruler in her own right; that meant dealing with the gods--which was probably something taken very seriously at the time--dealing with possible malcontents in her own country, and presenting the outside world with the face of a stable monarchy.  It was the role, not the person that actually mattered.  The author notes that the male elite of Egypt made no apparent attempt to unseat the queen, which suggests they were fully aware of the costs to Egypt of doing so.  Whatever they may have felt about a female pharoah, these civil servants continued to function as usual.As far as how the young king felt about the matter of a woman ""dominating"" him, I suspect, having been raised from childhood by a family member with an interest in preserving their dynasty, he probably had far greater attachment to and respect for her than is evident in the documents.  Certainly she kept him safe from other claimants, made certain he was adequately trained and educated--especially as it appears that he was literate and widely read--and then pushed him forward into the limelight when he was fully ready to take the responsibility.The great flap over Hatchepsut's missing mummy as a sign that her heir ""hated"" her is hardly a smoking gun; nearly all of the ancient kings and queens were migratory after their deaths, because tomb plundering became a big business in Dynasty XX.  There are actually documents of trials and accusations of corruption against high ranking individuals in Thebes over this, even a whiff of an Egyptian mafia ""rub-out."" I agree with the author, if he did damage her monuments later it arose from political expediency rather than personal enmity.  He owed her a lot and probably knew it.  Dr. Tyldesley's suggestion that the bulk of the damage was due to much later religious changes under later dynasts is a good one, and one that I had never considered.  It certainly made me think.Great book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAMXL2NL5XAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140244646#wasThisHelpful","RIAMXL2NL5XAE","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't quite as taken with ""Deep Ancestry"" as I expected to be.  It does relate some of the newer data being found in a worldwide investigation of human genetics and history, but it really has been discussed elsewhere in a more interesting manner that may appeal more to the novice.  It's not so much that this book is too detailed, as it is too little too late.The actual implications of what is learned about history from genetics were covered very ably by Bryan Sykes in his books, written much earlier in the process of the investigations, The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry(2002), Adam's Curse: A Future without Men(2005), and Saxons, Vikings, and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland (2007).  These follow the science in a more contemporary manner, and go into considerable detail about the use of the mDNA and the Y chromosome for research, the history of their discoveries and the historical meanings of what is encoded.  They do so, more importantly, in a more engaging narrative style.While Sykes examines primarily the Mediterranean and the Western and Northern European data--since much of his data come from these more easily accessed gene pools--Dr. Wells discusses historical genetics more globally, so it does provide a less biased focus on human history.  More importantly, he presents a great deal on present day hunter gatherers, something that definitely needs to be examined before we damage these people irreparibly. If nothing else perhaps the book will encourage its readership to support the preservation of these ancient cultures in the fragile political environments that are currently destroying them.Both authors also address the question of Neanderthal contributions to our own genetics, and why we might have succeed where they failed.  Personally I'm not sure we will ever know the answer to that question; though I'm inclined to believe it had more to ""pure dumb luck"" than we are ever likely to admit!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S67LWMTU06KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426201184#wasThisHelpful","R1S67LWMTU06KZ","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the recent internet publicity for the last of the Harry Potter films, there appeared an article on the so-called Harry Potter Wannabes and their ""failure"" to capture public attention.  The author of the article was somewhat rough on these books and films, so I decided I'd do a little research of my own.  I selected some of the DVDs of the movies and the books upon which they had been based to see what I thought of them myself.One of these was City of Ember.  I was really quite impressed with it.  It bore nothing at all that seemed to be in imitation of Harry Potter but was completely its own self.  While it was also a children's book/film and taught truths about society and about growing up, it was not a Harry Potter Wannabe at all.  It simply followed the rules of its genre; I would have considered it inappropriate if it had not done so.  That the film makers were taking advantage of an upsurge in interest in children's literature is hardly strange; money follows public interest in almost any field.  Personally I thought that it was a good thing in this instance.The main characters, as expected for children's films and books, were a young boy and girl--younger in the book than the film--whose lives are defined by the environment into which they had been born.  This is no different from our own experience except that theirs is not quite the environment that we know.  Like ours it is a very fragile, insular and manmade environment and one that, as ours may, is about to collapse. It is, however and unlike ours, entirely underground with all the caveats that that introduces.Since things started out quite comfortably for this community, the gradual slide into decline over some 250 years was ignored by some, denied by others, and ineffectively worried over by the balance.  It is particularly bright and attentive children that notice that the world into which they have been born and raised is tottering on the brink of extinction, but none of the adults want to deal with it.  Some continue with their lives as they are able accepting that they can do nothing else, others form friendship groups that devote themselves to a philosophy that ""help will come"" from some outside source in the eleventh hour if they just ""believe,"" while some put by hidden goods to sustain at least themselves during the ""end-of-days.""  In short we have a pretty broad section of human reactions to slow pending disaster.  Ember is a microcosm of our own world.  Furthermore, just as in our world, political entities have a vested interest in keeping everyone in the dark--sometimes literally.  It is therefore the children who are left to save the society of Ember, and they do so at great risk to themselves--which makes for a very good story.The book was well written and engaging.  The opening captured the imagination, and the odd culture of ""make-do"" was arresting and kept the reader moving from chapter to chapter.  The subtle evidence that all was not right in Ember kept mounting, lending a sense of urgency to the children's discoveries and their will to save the people of Ember from their fate.  None of the adventures the children had was beyond the capacity of young people, though luck played a strong part--as if often does in real life.  It is not so much the happenstance events in life that make or break but how they are used, as Doon's father tells him early on in the story.  More than anything, these are not superheros against the super villains; these are average young people with an above average sense of curiosity and desire to do something profound for their society; Abraham Lincoln would have understood them completely.  Even the villains share the same sense of self preservation that we all recognize in ourselves.  Having more experience, they have a greater sense of the implications of things; some do what they can for others, some think only of themselves.  Most of us have done both in our time.A great tale of survival and courage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6STXBERJ6DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385736282#wasThisHelpful","R3K6STXBERJ6DA","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is no different from our own experience except that theirs is not quite the environment that we know.  Like ours it is a very fragile, insular and manmade environment.  Again like ours may do, it is one that is about to collapse.  Here however it is underground with all of the caveats that that introduces.Since things started out quite comfortably for this community, the gradual slide into decline over some 250 years was ignored by some, denied by others, and ineffectively worried over by the balance.  It is particularly bright and attentive children that notice that the world into which they have been born and raised is tottering on the brink of extinction, but none of the adults want to deal with it.  Some continue with their lives as they are able accepting that they can do nothing else, others form friendship groups that are devoted to a philosophy that ""help will come"" from some outside source in the eleventh hour if they just ""believe,"" while some put by hidden goods to sustain at least themselves during the ""end-of-days.""  In short we have a pretty broad section of human reactions to slow pending disaster.  Ember is a microcosm of our own world.  Furthermore, just as in our world, political entities have a vested interest in keeping everyone in the dark--sometimes literally.  It is therefore the children who are left to save the society of Ember, and they do so at great risk to themselves--which makes for a very good story.The film managed to keep quite close to the format of the book; important--and sometimes difficult--if one is to keep the original audience of the book who will probably know every detail.  There were really only minor changes.  The adult roles were well played by skillful actors who had a capacity to reign in their egos in favor of the young, less experienced actors in the cast.  This shows incredible professionalism.  It also shows a good deal of common sense; my main complaint with Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was that the central adult actors, Jim Carey and Meryl Streep, overwhelmed the younger actors and even the story itself.  Here the young actors were allowed to shine in their roles and were very competent and comfortable with them; one thought entirely about the character and never about the actor playing it, which suggests either excellent talent or skillful direction--or both.Though many films these days get carried away with computerized graphics--to the point where they might as well be computer games--this one was a nice combination of live action and CGI.  One was never allowed to forget that this was a book about children and about a society at risk.  The city of Ember was a delightful set; a combination of almost medieval society and watered down 20th century, with cultural lacunae designed to get one thinking about what was actually happening here and why.  The set was dark and brooding, almost as much as one of the Alien films where humans made their lives in the midst of unearthly landscapes.  It gave the viewer a distinct sense of ""what had been lost,"" as The Builders had said and why they had prevented knowledge of the outside world from being known.  Costumes were designed to suggest poverty but an ongoing sense of human pride, even in adversity.  The population was poor, but they seemed to have made, not only the ""best of a bad situation,"" but a virtue of making do.  Furthermore, while there were people who were willing to lie and cheat to cushion themselves from difficult times, there were also people who were willing to make sacrifices for others, sharing what little they had.  Even The Builders may well have done so at the very beginning of ""time"" in Ember.  If there is anything about people that will help us through what may be a very difficult time in our own future, it will be just those psychological assets.It was a wonderful film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IPRY9X0M8IAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LPWGBO#wasThisHelpful","R3IPRY9X0M8IAR","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost anyone who has read on the topic of human evolution, blood groups, genetic archaeology, etc. over the past 30 years knows something about the work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.  His name looms large in almost all publications on these topics, so it was interesting to actually read something written by the man on the topic.While the book is actually a very general discussion of human migrations throughout the globe and includes material derived from a variety of disciplines beyond the author's own, enough of it is discussed from the point of the author's specialty to make it truly informative.  I enjoyed it for its ability to stimulate my own thinking on the topic of modern humans as living members of a multi-species genus. While I found the topics of genetic and linguistic history and their contributions to the illumination of the human diasporas of interest, I found the author's original work in blood groups, especially on the Rhesus differences, most intriguing.For years there has been a discussion of how speciation occurs and even of what exactly a species is.  In particular the occasional occurrences of successful interbreeding of different species within a genus, confuses the definition usually applied.  Generally speaking a species prefers to mate with its own group, and on occasions when it mates with another species produces non-viable or sterile offspring, if any at all. The archetype of the definition is the mule, which is a horse-donkey cross breed and which is always sterile; the fly in the ointment being the wolf-dog cross breed which is usually viable and fertile.  The author's work in Rhesus differences seems to suggest that a division between species might arise by virtue of something as invisible as a mutation in blood groups.Given that without modern technology, a Rh+/- cross breeding will lead to a drop in productivity of such pairs due to the death of all infants after the first, one might see the Rhesus differences as a genetic event on its way to speciation of modern humans into two biologically incompatible groups with virtually no other visible distinction between them, including mental or cultural characteristics.  The fact that we have not done so may be due largely to our technology.

"""Cro-Magnon"" is an interesting book by Brian Fagan, whose primary approach to archaeology and pre-history is generally speaking that of the paleoclimatologist. Here, though he again examines the effects of extreme climate on human populations, he is primarily interested in the question of Neanderthal and early Sapiens and their cultural responses to the environment, especially in respect to the extinction of the former and the spread of the latter.  He paints a rather more different picture of the two than the usual, since he almost sees the Neanderthal as simply moving away from extreme climate while the Cro-Magnon embraces it.  I'm not certain I agree with that, since the earlier species spread and flourished for several thousands of years in a climate of widely swinging temperature domains before the arrival of Cro-Magnon and seemed to exhibit a suite of cultural traits that enhanced that survival.Even though the presence of two populations of humans placing demands on limited resources was bound to produce a differential in survival, I'm more inclined to agree with Clive Finlayson (The Humans Who Went Extinct: Why Neanderthals Died Out and We Survived) who suggests that chance played a greater part in the process.  Both Dr. Fagan and Dr. Finlayson note that both types of human ended up disbursed among various residual domains of habitability during climatic downturns, some with less interconnectivity than others.  Dr. Finlayson, however, places a greater emphasises on the resulting isolation and its pronounced effect on genetic variability and overall decline in species viability. The cul-de-sac into which Neanderthals found themselves during the last glacial maximum may simply have reduced a stressed breeding population beyond its capacity to survive, with or without the pressures of a rival species in the environment.Observations on evolutionary tracks and other phenomena, where events of different magnitudes are possible and can have major effects on outcomes, have been made by a number of researchers in other fields under the rubrics of ""self organizing criticality"" (Stuart Kaufman and the Sante Fe Institute, The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution and Per Bak (how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality) and ""complexity or ubiquity theory"" (Mark Buchanan (Used & New from: $7.00 Ubiquity: The Science of History . . . or Why the World Is Simpler Than We Think]) and [[ASIN:0609809989 Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen) and the resulting concepts suggest that chance occurrences can indeed have exactly this type of effect on natural systems, including species survival.  When it comes down to which species made it through to modern times, it may have been as much a matter of ""shear dumb luck"" as it was of increased cultural complexity and changes in mental outlook.  In fact even our understanding of the differences and similarities which may have existed between the cultures and mental realities of the two populations is as much the outcome of a differential in chance survival of artifactual remains as it is of actual quantifiable differences in the two species of human.Our sense of superiority, not only to extinct species of our own genus but to our existing distant cousins the great apes, may only be an illusion in the long run of things.  I think it's very telling that most genera have more than one species, and that genera that don't are usually those that have undergone or are undergoing serious stress of some kind.  Our uniqueness as a species in the world may not be such a good sign.Nature doesn't care about our ego or our technological successes; it only cares about numbers and sustainability.  Our short run of success may ultimately be leading to our final demise as our numbers bring pressure to bear on sustainability and lead to collapse.Interesting book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGWOFBOMHTOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608194051#wasThisHelpful","R3GGWOFBOMHTOB","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It emphasizes the qualities that led to his success as an adult, a good sense of humor, approachability, an insatiable interest in learning, and a degree of persistence that many so-called average people share. As a first book on Lincoln, the book gives children an accessible portrait of the man as a boy much like other boys.

"""Vanished Ocean"" is a fairly thorough introduction to the life and death of the Tethys Ocean and how geologists know what they do about something that has not been around for several million years.  I certainly found a biography of the ocean an arresting way of bringing attention to its central feature in both earth history and life history.  Oceans are so much a part of our world that we often overlook them as a primary shaper of that world until they rise up out of their basin and drown some of us or otherwise intrude themselves into our awareness.  That is part of our problem with global warming and species loss.  This book points that out quite neatly when the author describes the Permian and end Cretaceous extinctions.I suspect the book will appeal most to those with at least some college background in earth sciences.  Though the author does a good job of defining terms (in fact he includes a short glossary) and of describing processes, there is still a lot of pretty heavy science here. (I haven't heard the term flysch in years, not since my degree program in geology). If the reader has read extensively in geology as a hobby, they might also feel comfortable with what is described.  It will probably be heavy going for those with no prior knowledge of the field.To some extent the book seems a little disjoint because there are so many digressions into personal history or into what amounts to a travelogue of distant places.  I know this is intended to bring the reader and the author into a sort of vis à vis relationship, but I always find it distracting.  This so interrupts the central narrative that it's sometimes difficult to follow the scientific information the author wants to impart.  For those who enjoy this type of chatty prose style, or those who want to know something about the ""glamorous"" life of a field geologist, this is the book for you.  I suggest also books by Peter Ward(Gorgon: Paleontology, Obsession, and the Greatest Catastrophe in Earth's History), and in anthropology/paleontology Donald C. Johanson (Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins) whose prose styles are very similar.  Certainly young people looking for fields of endeavor in which to find a future career may find these books illuminating for this reason.I was most impressed by the author's more balanced approach to the demise of the dinosaurs.  This debate has been such a media circus that it has been the media and its effect on popular opinion that has had the ""final say"" on the issue.  Like it was possible to vote on the subject.  I've no doubt that the dramatic character of the theory has made a lot of people a lot of money.  About how much the notice has helped earth science I'm less sure, though the author assures us that real research continues to shed light on the subject.I also found the information on oil and gas production interesting.  While I had known the ""how,"" I had not known that so much of the oil and gas we use today was produced in the Tethys.  I suppose it shouldn't have surprised me, since much of any such product from earlier times would have been destroyed by the same processes that led to both the creation and the demise of the Tethys. The discussion on anoxic bottom conditions is particularly informative because we are seeing this occur in our own times, and Dr. Stow's discussion is therefore very current and very informative; we would do well to pay heed.  Another book on the eutrophication of the oceans is by M. J. Benton When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time who tells a similar cautionary tale.An interesting and informative discussion","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZ13ZTYRDVL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019921428X#wasThisHelpful","R1DZ13ZTYRDVL7","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started the book I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it.  It has a pronounced bardic style common to the genre of children's fantasy fiction that takes a little getting used to for an adult who has been away from it for a while.  This said, however, I loved it.  I think it's almost in the league of Harry Potter in many respects.Unlike the Potter series ""The Sword of Darrow"" takes place in ""deep time"" rather than in the present.  The venue has much of the early middle ages about it (though admittedly the presence of castles suggests a later period.)  Certainly the authors seem to know something about life at the time:  their descriptions in the ""gong farmer"" episode suggests as much.  There are plenty of mythical individuals filling out the cast on both sides of the ""good and evil"" battle lines, individuals that force the reader to set aside prejudices with respect to those who are different.  Minotaurs, Trolls, a dragon, a Scorpion Man, and other even more imaginative creatures appear as friends and enemies.There are also any number of grey areas that make the reader think from a different frame of reference than his or her own.  The goblins, for instance, do evil things, but they do so out of a mistaken need for revenge that makes them as much victims as are the hapless human citizens of Sonnencrest that they attack.  The spiritual development of two of the characters and the way in which this develops bring the reader to see that often times anger and the need for revenge are more damaging to the individual who feels them than they are to those who elicited the feelings.  I think this is very cogent.  (Being a former nurse I know that these feelings raise the serum cortisol level and the blood pressure, neither of which are good for you!)More than anything the book suggests that the happy, easy life of even the best of kingdoms can always change; it takes vigilance and dedication to keep such an era going; and such times should be valued and recognized for what they are great good fortune and something to be treasured.  In the end the people of Sonnencrest realized that the treasures that had been plundered from them by the Goblins were not nearly as valuable as their freedom, their families, their belief in themselves, and their willingness to come to the aid of their fellows in time of need.The lessons learned by the young protagonists are definitely similar to those of Harry Potter:  self discovery, the worth of good friends, overcoming personal weaknesses and cultivating strengths, learning that bad things sometimes happen to good people, that there can be negative repercussions to taking a stand for even the best of causes but that sometimes it's worth it anyway, that even a good cause can suffer setbacks, that people we love die, etc.  Here the lessons seem to jump out rapidly one after the other, where the labors of the Harry Potter children are dealt with in a more leisurely manner over the course of several books. Here all the lessons are learned by the end of 342 pages.  There is a beginning, a middle and an end that is rather final in The Sword of Darrow, leaving no sense that there is a ""next story.""  This is rather sad in an era of sequels, prequels and series.  It leaves nothing to look forward to which is too bad.  I think J. K. Rowling's understanding of that need is what made her books so tremendously successful.  She didn't hurry her characters; she let them grow through a series of adventures tailored not only to the emotional level and age of her targeted readers but using their vocabulary and level of sentence structure at each stage.  That takes a great degree of self-control and foresight.The authors are obviously very able spinners of tales with a very literate vocabulary and grammar style, though I doubt it is outside of the reading range of most individuals among the older grade school or middle school or of the average adult.  Even where it might be, it's good to stretch the mind a little.  Younger, preliterate children will probably enjoy having it read to them and will enjoy the many pictures that accompany some of the chapters.Given the mélange of venues, characters, and episodes I think The Sword of Darrow would make a wonderful children's film.  The overall arrangement of the events would certainly provide a good script:  there is an attention capturing beginning, a good flow to each episode that keeps the story moving and an excellant dénouement.  There are a number of good roles for experienced adult actors and very strong roles for younger actors.  The range of mythical characters would give a good field of play to makeup specialists and to model and puppet artists.  The scores of goblins in the goblin army, the attack of the spider army, and the activities of the evil wizard, especially in his human whirlwind form, would provide opportunities for the CGI specialists to show off their particular talents as well.  Hopefully the right people will see that.A lovely story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3601DAFQSR0NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935618474#wasThisHelpful","R3601DAFQSR0NH","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Saxons, Vikings, and Celts"" is another of Bryan Sykes ventures into genetic archaeology.  It makes fascinating reading and gives rise to some interesting results.  Some of the material appears in his earlier works, The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry and Adam's Curse: A Future without Men, the foundations that explain the nature of genetic research in the area of human evolution and migration and in the history of mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome as keepers of human history.The book does not require any great knowledge of biology or genetics to be understood.  Anyone with a standard high school education, especially those given to watching programs on PBS or Discovery Channel, will find the book very accessible.  Those interested in archeology and anthropology will find it an invaluable window onto what the field of genetics has to say about human events.  Often the reasoning from cultural remains is very circular because what the presence of material culture actually means to the human drama is very ambiguous.  As the author also points out, any interpretation of the ambiguous can be heavily biased by personal agendas and beliefs, but genes are incapable of lying or dissimulation.Professor Sykes has a very readable style and a good handle on the history of the United Kingdom and is able to weave both the history and the science of his work together into an interesting tale.  Though some of the discussion on the scientific aspects of his research may lose the reader in details, in general the results are perfectly understandable and very arresting in the human tale they tell.An enjoyable peek into human history from a genetic perspective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PDTF5J1B84G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393062686#wasThisHelpful","R12PDTF5J1B84G","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Elixir"" is one of the many books by Brian Fagan, The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization, Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations,  that deals with paleoclimate and its effects through history on human societies.  In this instance he looks specifically at water and its uses by human beings, both modern and ancient, of various technological levels.  As in his book The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations, he notes that the more technologically innovative the society and the more wedded to agriculture it is, the more vulnerable it is to sudden, long term and extreme climate changes.  He cites world wide examples, some of them also described in ""The Great Warming,"" to illustrate his point.For the most part it would appear that higher technological societies are a victim of their own success.  By divorcing themselves from the transhumanance of hunter-gather societies and thereby from the natural tendency toward smaller populations, the settled groups became subject to the upwardly spiraling demands of increased population, to diseases arising from crowding and from living close to herd animals, and to episodic malnutrition during climatic downturns.  The author--and others writing on the topic of early agriculture--suggest that far from being a superior lifestyle to that of the hunter-gather, farming as a way of life tended to anchor individuals to a location near water and decent soil, reducing the surrounding abundance of wild plants and animals by a continued need for land.  He also noted that while the benefits of society accrued to a few elite individuals, it was often not the primary producers who benefited from surpluses.  Thus by subjecting land to management, people subjected themselves to management and ultimately to a far less satisfying life; that fact continues into our own times.In gradually worsening climate, those having invested ever more time, energy and materials into a location were loathed to leave it.  Furthermore, the damage that agricultural pursuits wrecked on the natural environment by over exploitation meant that there were fewer emergency food sources during hard times and more people making demands on what there was.  Given that increased population pressure ensured that even the less desirable property was harnessed to feed the increased number of mouths and at further and further distances from the core development, when transhumanance became necessary, there were  often people already in the region where a migratory people might go.  Unless the various groups had participated in some form of reciprocal helping strategie, as they may have done among some of the early societies of the American Southwest,  (David E. Stuart describes some of these strategies and how some may have failed because of drought and water shortage in his book, Anasazi America: Seventeen Centuries on the Road from Center Place) the migrating people may not have been welcome, and war may have ensued.  (My little short story, The Tale of Little Crane: A Fairy Tale for All Ages is a parable based on this idea.)  The history of the Ancient Near East is rife with stories of migratory people living in marginal regions suddenly overwhelming settled society during periods of climate change.  (The author describes this as a ""pump"" phenomenon in this book and in The Great Warming.)  In some regions like the Maya Yucatan, the drought may have been so widespread that there were no close places to which to migrate. (Richardson Gill describes this in great detail in his book The Great Maya Droughts: Water, Life, and Death).It was interesting, to read the author's take on great droughts, especially that of the Maya penninsula, since he is disinclined to see a ""migration"" of people and wholesale death of large numbers in a drought ridden region.  (Richardson Gill's work on the subject makes very grim reading, though his work is also very extensive in its discussion on the effects of global climate change.)  Rather he sees individual families as deciding to leave the area, and moving to other locations, probably to relatives or reciprocal help groups, long before the duration of the drought has taken its toll.Along the lines of the ""fitness landscape"" of the Santa Fe Institute in its very interesting discussion of The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, those with less desirable land--i.e. lower on the peak of fitness--would be the first to abandon it, having less to lose by moving across a possibly bleak landscape to another peak.  Those in a better place to ride out the drought and with a great deal to lose--i.e. those at the peak of the fitness landscape--would remain until the drought proved an agricultural life to be unsustainable irrespective of the human investment.  These people would either leave or die.  In either case, the culture to which their control of resources had given rise would certainly go extinct.  Dr. Fagan discribes a number of these episodes including the Moche and some of the dynasties of China and Southeast Asia.It would appear that the concept of ""meme,"" (The Meme Machine (Popular Science), is very applicable here.  The ""idea"" of farming spread widely, and while the immediate consequences might have been positive, the ultimate outcomes were often not.  The meme, like the gene however, is oblivious to the wellbeing and happiness of the carrier; it just mindlessly promotes its own replication.  While there is much debate about the usefulness of the meme concept, it certainly seems applicable in this instance.  The lifestyle to which the human dedication to agriculture has given rise is certainly far more convenient--for those at the top of the heap anyway--even if not necessarily happier than living a life of constant movement in search of food.  As the author points out, however, it also leads us further and further out on a limb of unsustainability that may lead to a major disaster in the not too distant future!Just as in his book on the Chaco culture, Chaco Canyon: Archaeologists Explore the Lives of an Ancient Society, Dr. Fagan notes that climate can change abruptly and can leave a high risk population with few alternatives.  He seems to extol the water management skills of the simpler cultures that make use of gravity alone for their needs.  He notes that gradually mechanizing and enlarging society's demands and forcing nature to give up its water supplies beyond its abilities to recharge them, has brought many civilizations to extinction.  The reader is left in no doubt that this applies to the demands of our own world; the entire last chapter, ""Mastery?"" is dedicated to examples of modern societies blindly pushing nature to its limits.  Like Life's Matrix: A Biography of Water, by  Philip Ball, there are a number of warnings about damage to non-renewable water sources and about the future changes that global warming may bring to even those resources that have not been stretched to the limits by human demands.  As he points out, water may be the next ""oil"" crisis.  It is undoubtely in our best interests to pay attention to that fact, but given that not everyone is on the same page and that many vested interests have reasons to prevent any changes, it seems unlikely that we will be able to avoid these perils.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6NLCAGKPSZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160819003X#wasThisHelpful","R3R6NLCAGKPSZJ","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brian Fagan's ""Chaco Canyon,"" like many of his other works (The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History, 1300-1850, The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations, Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations), deals with climate and its effect on the human condition, here the ancient pueblo societies of the American Southwest.  Chaco Canyon as an archaeological entity is a series of abandoned settlements dating from roughly 800 A.D. to 1100 A.D.  The book is a discussion of its archaeology, culture, history, probable social trajectory, and likely reasons for abandonment.Although the book discusses climate at some length, as readers of other books by the author will notice, it does not go into lengthy detail about the air and ocean currents that bring about these changes.  He does discuss the drought years, where they occurred, how long they lasted and how native people responded to these changes at different times.  He sees the entire phenomenon of the Chaco rise and decline as a human response to climatic changes.  Interestingly he notes that their flexible response to these changes allowed them to endure in the area for a long time despite drought conditions.  He credits their heavy investment in agriculture with an increase in population and a gradual limiting of their options to remain flexible that brought about the final abandonment of the area.  Severe drought contributed, yes, but an inability to rely on former practices because of the destruction of habitat was the prime factor.  If this is true, it definitely has implications for our own society.More than anything this study is a narrative of the archaeological history of the region, beginning in the late 19th century and continuing to the present day.  The author notes the change of focus and techniques of each generation of workers at the numerous canyon sites and what they contributed to our understanding of the region and its people.  I was particularly impressed with his unwillingness to engage in the pointless condemnation of earlier fieldworkers and their motives; not all authors have been this gracious.  I was especially impressed by his admiration for the patience and focus that field researchers exhibit and the minutia that they mine from the data to contribute to a thorough picture of ancient culture.  (I've always been more impressed with their apparent willingness to work in very unpleasant conditions; anthropologists, archaeologists, field geologists and paleontologists all seem to end up working for months on end in barren deserts dealing with heat, dust, snakes, spiders, limited water, etc.!  An online friend, an Austrailian field geologist Roger McEvily positively thrives on it!  That's dedication!)The book discusses some of the research techniques that have developed over the past decades that allow archaeologists to gain a clearer picture of the life of the area, particularly at some of the larger ""Great House"" sites like Pueblo Bonito.  Building styles, construction techniques, pottery characteristics, and burial modes are all discussed with respect to what they have to say about contemporary society.  Though such discussions in other books can be pretty burdensome to the average reader--I know because I've read some of them--this volume does not carry it to extremes.  The author acknowledges that there is much information out there but that the casual reader is not necessarily going to benefit from an in depth exposé.  Instead he gives short sidebars of information that illuminate the facts he provides in context.  His excellent endnotes give a number of resources for those interested in further information about the various aspects of the material record.The author, who admits to being a ""parachutist"" in his archaeological approach, puts much of the data in the context of the entire region, addressing such points as whether the Chaco culture had close ties to other areas, whether these associations went beyond kin ties to actual domination of other regions, etc.  I was very impressed with his ability to stay within the limits of what the data can actually tell us about these issues.  Unlike others who make more flamboyant claims for these people, Dr. Fagan points out specific data that lend support to or tend to contradict such claims.  I thought it was a very balanced discussion of these themes.While some authors seem to buy into the fairytale of the southwest, seeing conquest, hierarchies, exotic trade goods travelling on major highways through the desert, and a great collapse, Dr. Fagan sees small, insular populations that cooperated with extended kin groups in important projects and in times of need.  He sees a population that probably shared many of the common beliefs and behaviors of other subsistence farmers around the world and particularly those that still occupy the southwest, behaviors and beliefs shaped by the realitites of nature.  Where others see ""collapse and migration,"" Dr. Fagan sees worsening conditions and a gradual disbursal of individual families from the area to other regions where they shared kin ties and reciprocity obligations.  Those on more marginal land probably moved first and not until there were few to no outside groups around them from whom to draw support did those living in the Great Houses depart as well. They had the most to leave behind having invested greatly in their buildings and agricultural projects.  He--and others--see groups like the Hopi and Zuni as being modern descendants of the Chaco people.  Since these modern heirs to the region share myths of kinship with the ancestors of the abandoned sites and visit them for spiritual input, I suspect he's correct.Interesting and informative book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MC3ZGBGJE2HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195170431#wasThisHelpful","R2MC3ZGBGJE2HV","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of Dr. Fagan's books have to with paleoclimatology (The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History, 1300-1850, The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization, Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations) and the effects of sustained types of weather on human society.  This one is no exception.  Having looked at the Little Ice Age in a previous book, he now looks at its opposite, the Medieval Warm Period, a climatic event that has reprocussions for our own future.Studied from proxies for environmental change preserved in ice cores, sea and lake bed sediments, and tree ring data, the history of climate both locally and globally can be illuminated with fair accuracy, revealing the environmental conditions under which contemporary societies lived their lives.  The Little Ice Age brought with it both winners and losers as global climate changed, with wetter, cooler regions in usually dry areas and colder, drier or stormier conditions in other areas.  Populations of people, less numerous at the time, moved into or out of areas as conditions changed, shaping the course of history.  (I was once invited to go on an expedition that was to explore the Katarah Depression in the Western Desert in Egypt looking for evidence of a settled society that lived around the oases during a wetter time in Egypt's climatic pre-history.) It is thus no surprise that the Medieval Warm Period also saw winners and losers with people moving into or out of adversely affected areas, again shaping history at least locally.Dr. Fagan suggests that climate is a history shaper.  He looks at some of the world's most significant historic events, like the migrations of Genghis Khan and his Mongolian people, the collapse of the Maya and the Moche in Central and South America and the migration of the Pueblo people out of the affected areas of the American Southwest, as the outcome of environmental changes that made top heavy, centralized civilizations collapse under their own weight.  When droughts diminished the agricultural output on which they depended, these societies ceased to exist as entities.  Each of the book's illustrations is covered in limited detail and could support a book on its own---in fact some have entire books on the subject well worth the reading (The Great Maya Droughts: Water, Life, and Death, Anasazi America: Seventeen Centuries on the Road from Center Place, The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization (Peoples of America), etc.).  Certainly he makes a clear case for the instability of agricultural societies in both China and India where populations have historically been very large and consequently climate disasters of staggering proportions.What makes this episode in climate history so significant is that it provides a window into the possible future as our own climate swings into a heat overdrive.  As Dr. Fagan suggests, however, it is grist to the argument mill for both those who believe climate change to be an urgent matter in need of attention and to those who think it's just ""business as usual on the old home planet, and we made it through it last time.""  The author makes a very cogent point when he writes of winners and losers and of the staggering number of fatalities and human misery that resulted from these changes in the weather of an age.  It's not about ""making it through it;"" it's about who will and who won't make it through it.  He also points out that much of the globe bares far greater numbers of people than it did during the Great Warming and in many places already far greater than the agricultural carrying capacity of the land.  Climate changes like those of The Great Warming will cause even larger migrations, greater chances of military violence, higher mortality rates, and far greater social disruption if and when they occur.  No one will be able to opt out of the chaos.Far more interesting are the implications in this scenario.  Great civilizations were not immune to the downsides of the climate change of their era.  In fact they were even more susceptible to it, because they encouraged, though indirectly, population growth and an increased use of even marginal land for agriculture.  This put them on a ""fitness landscape,"" to quote the self organizing criticality group at Santa Fe Institute and other institutions, (At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity and how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality), that prevented them from morphing easily into something else, and the civilization collapsed.  Modern day First World countries seem to think their technological advances will indemnify them from abrupt change, but they may be in for a big surprise.  They could find themselves unable to respond rapidly enough to changes or to be able to deal with the massive numbers of migrants fleeing the climatic devastation of their former homelands.Interesting are some of the self defeating behaviors that we practice in the US and that put many areas in danger of irreparable long term danger.  My favorite is the massive draw-down of the Ogallala aquifer that supplies eight of the western and southwestern states including Nevada.  I had once read that there had been more water in that aquifer than in Lake Superior, and that it is and was being rapidly consumed, much of it by Las Vegas.  I'm not sure that it is rechargeable, but even if it is, much of the mountain run off from melting snow upon which that process depends may cease to exist if warmer drier conditions overtake the system.  This may well leave Las Vegas a ghost town in the future.  Likewise California, Arizona and Nevada have already had dust-ups, as early as the 1920s and 30's, over the water of the Colorado River upon which their heavily populated cities and the irrigation agriculture of each depend.  While daming the river in the 1930s and routing the water according to legally established guidelines helped stay the violence, the Colorado is a mere shadow of itself these days and the western states are again facing a waterless future.  Just like the Maya and the Moche, we might have poised ourselves for collapse, at least in some regions, by the growing dearth of water in those areas.Still more interesting is what the author says of the collapse of areas where lack of water was often not the problem.  He discusses the Moche of Peru, the Chinese, and India as suffering as much from a superabundance of water and the resulting effects of floods as from droughts.  In the US, where there is abundant water, there is also sometimes major flooding.  Much of the richest agricultural property in the country, land that feeds not only the US population but many countries overseas as well, occupies flood plains that are occasionally devastated by the heavy rains in watershed areas upstream.  These seem to be increasing in frequency--the 100 year crest levels coming almost every other year if not every year--and in quantity of water drained.  Those of this year (2011) are a prime example.  The loss of agricultural production will have serious implications not only for the US but for many of the world's poorer countries.That things are changing is becoming overwhelmingly apparent.  Even if one looks upon the weather statistics as just extreme variations around a norm, there are other indicators that suggest that something unusual is going on in the world.  That climate's effects on human society have already begun is becoming clearer with each decade.  Problems in Africa, the Middle East, Central and South America, and India are already causing social unrest and/or migration.  Some of this is due to the fact that elites have everything they want but that the bulk of the population, never well provided for to begin with, is starting to suffer considerable want in even the basics.  As the author states, many areas in the third world have neither adequate clean drinking water nor decent sanitation.Egypt, actually a very progressive Middle Eastern country with universal education and health care, fed the world during the Roman Empire and during the early Islamic period; now it can barely feed itself.  Population there when I first visited the country in 1979 was 40 million people spread along the thin strips of green land on either side of the Nile and in the fertile and well watered Delta area.  The fellaheen had a difficult go of it even then, with national activists pointing out their plight and the government making efforts to encourage reduced birth rates.  Almost 40 years later, about two generations among the fellaheen or one and a half among the middle and upper classes, Egypt supports 80 million people on the same property and faces the same issues.  Now it shares out what there is among twice the number of mouths.  It's no wonder there was a political revolution; however, it remains to be seen if an appropriate social revolution will follow that can save the country from total disaster.In the US illegal immigration has gone from a trickle to a deluge in the Southwestern part of the country, encouraging some of the affected states to enact laws that will limit the flood.  Violence is not unknown along the borders and citizens in these states are feeling a threat.  That migrating people are escaping very difficult living conditions in their respective countries is obvious in the fact that they are willing to undergo great discomfort, even death, at considerable financial cost to their families just to get into the US to find work, any work.  Even some of the drug wars suffered by Mexico may be in part due to a need to rechannel labor into something that brings in more income for unemployed farmers and urban poor than farming now can.  If that is the case, the war between drug trafficers and the central government will be ongoing, violent, and unwinnable by the government because there are too many people at the bottom of society who have too much to lose if they abandon it.Though history is not a repeatable thing according to historians and scientists of complexity theory (Ubiquity: The Science of History . . . or Why the World Is Simpler Than We Think, Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen), it does tell us one important thing about the world.  As one of my geology texts said, ""If it has happened, it CAN happen.""  This says nothing, of course about when, where, how or how big, but it definitely tells you that it can and will, and when it does, ""this is what it looks like!""  Experience also tells us where it's likely to occur.  It may not, but I'd hedge my bets and plan for it.  Long lives gave our ancestors ""elders"" who could remember longer and longer periods of events that helped them survive changes.  Over the course of a 50 year life span, a lot of odd things happen at least once--I know they have in mine!  Modern society has recorded memory and scientific enquirey that extends these ""memories"" even further back in time.  If we don't make use of it, we suffer the consequences.An interesting--though somewhat depressing--book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTHV78FIGI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031MA8TC#wasThisHelpful","RWTHV78FIGI1","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't help but wonder what personal crises in Professor Sykes' life make him so completely down on his own gender!  While the book contains a wealth of information on genetics, its technology, practices and results, I find it a little difficult to believe that a single gene can have the ""ambitions"" that he ascribes to it.  I have to admit that he puts the arguments forward logically enough.  Not being a geneticist myself, I certainly find it difficult to argue the point.  All of the research and many of the author's case histories, including his own family history, make the book much more interesting than dry data would be, and a good place for those interested in the subject to start.I had heard of the Genghis Khan data before, the first time as the spread of the famous ""blue spot"" at the base of the spine among a large modern day population which is apparently a legacy of the Great Khan.  The actual relatedness of the various clans of the MacDonalds was new to me, although the relatedness of the Cohans, which had been discussed in journals some time ago, is very similar to it and much more impressive.The entire history of the discovery and interpretation of the Y-chromosome is well worth the price of the book.  I had no idea how clever the early scientists had had to be to narrow down the entire data set prior to the current technological advances.  There are a lot of very smart people out there.I found the author's discussion of homosexuality particularly interesting.  I have to admit that I've often wondered if it doesn't arise when population density and violence affect the sense of well being and safety of women.  While I could see a chromosomal origin for the characteristic, it seems much more likely to me that it would be a hormonal thing, perhaps methalation or demethalation of segments of DNA to take them off-line or activate them.  It's not that homosexual males can't be violent, but their stereotype is for greater compassion, a nurturing behavior, and less aggressiveness; I can't believe that that stereotype has absolutely no reality to it.  If certain hormones, such as cortasol or other chemicals involved in stress, reach a critical level in the mother's blood perhaps the fetus, while its gender is already determined chromosomally, may have its behavior altered in such a way that it is less likely to lead to increased violence in the mother's vicinity.  Alternatively--or additionally--it may lead to a greater likelihood of the survival of that child in an environment that is frought with violent male behavior.The whole discussion of mitochondrial DNA sabotage of the Y-chromosome was also very interesting, because I have recently met a person whose daughter seems unable to carry a male child to term.  The possibilty that it is similar to the rH problem might give researchers a handle on the problem so couples are able to have the children they want without so much heart ache.I had already read the author's book, The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry, and was amazed at the degree to which human travels and disbursal times could be determined from genetic studies of mDNA.  This book does for the Y-chromosome and the male line what that one did for women.  It was interesting to see the data on migrations during the Norse invasions.  Having studied the period from historic and archeological points of view, seeing the degree to which genetics could clarify it even more was amazing.  I had taken a course on archaeology of the Anglo-Saxon era in England and was amazed at what the data suggested of the period.  More than a ""take-over"" of the land from the inhabitants, it would appear that much of the land had been emptied by the withdrawal of military personal--and presumably their families--back to Italy to protect Rome from invasion.  Furthermore the Anglo-Saxon cemetaries yielded burials that suggested that while the men may have been from Europe, many of their wives were drawn from the local population.  It would be interesting to see if the genetics also suggested this, as it sometimes did according to Dr. Sykes for the Norse population movements.Fascinating discussion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PI3HU7Y4X4LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393326802#wasThisHelpful","R2PI3HU7Y4X4LZ","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read the Jared Diamond's books Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition quite some while ago and was thoroughly impressed with the author's incisive look at humans in the natural world, particularly their effect on the other members of Earth's biota and on one another.  The former book is an absolute classic and makes such thorough sense of what occurred in and after the 15th century that it should be required reading in most history courses.  These and the present book are often cited in works by other authors, and since I had not read The Third Chimpanzee, I thought it was about time.There is a lot of very interesting information in the book.  Though some of it I had read before in other contexts, here what are fragments of data in other books are arranged in a way that their importance to the whole picture of human history can be more easily understood and appreciated.  The author definitely has a handle on the wider perspective.  As a naturalist and professor of physiology, he sees humanity as ""Homo sapiens,"" and animal much like other animals.I had read about the concept and content of ""Indo-European"" languages years ago when studying ancient history.  It was known even in the late 19th and early 20th century that the shared words of various languages probably belonged to the parent, but I was still very intrigued by the more recent ideas about the primary homeland of the speakers of the early language, their lifestyle and their degree of connectedness with modern languages and people.  Diamond is quite honest, however, about what professional researchers in the field of linguistics think about these efforts, which is not much.What surprised me the most about language, however, was the degree to which other animals also ""speak"" in their own way.  I suspect anyone with a pet comes to realize their capacity to communicate with their owners on subjects of interest to them! Animal art is also something I'd heard of before--I knew that the Phoenix Zoo had an elephant that painted--but as the author states, the artists in this case live in captivity, are subject to human contact, and have very little else to do.  I worked as a volunteer at the Minnesota Zoo for a year and often wondered how the animals kept from going completely insane in such a small fragment of what would have been their ranges in the wild.  Perhaps participating in ""art therapy,"" especially for the brighter inmates was a good outlet for a mental life no longer devoted to the rigorous activity necessary to ensuring safety and nutrition.  As the author points out, observations in the wild have yet to observe these same animals participating in art projects---though he indicates elephants in the wild do make designs in the dust with their trunks.The book is also a little depressing.  Unlike Clive Finlayson's book The Humans Who Went Extinct: Why Neanderthals Died Out and We Survived, which suggested simple chance put paid to the Neanderthals rather than aggression from our own species, Diamond--and many others--seems inclined to lay the whole affair at our doorstep.  Similarly he convicts us of destroying the megafauna of North America.  In fact, he, like Bryan Sykes, Adam's Curse: A Future without Men, seems to see humans as thoroughly destructive animals.  From the evidence of our current world, I'd have to agree.  In The Sixth Extinction: Patterns of Life and the Future of Humankind Roger Lewin and Richard Leakey liken the spread of humans throughout the world as a cancerous, terminal disease of the biosphere and opine as to whether the rise of intelligent life isn't the end stage of the disease.  While Dr. Diamond does not seem quite this negative, I suspect he might agree to some extent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TO4B8ZNPKX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099913801#wasThisHelpful","R39TO4B8ZNPKX0","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They so have Great Danes down in this movie.  It was a delight.  Having had three of them at one time or another, I can definitely guarantee it.  Seeing Marmaduke sit on the couch, like a human would do, reminded me so much of my first Dane, Courageous who used to sit side by side with me watching TV.  Even the fictional character's unwillingness to engage in a fight with another dog was so like my dogs.  It was sort of ""let's discuss this"" with Courageous.  Even the dominant dog in the park scene was familiar.  I took my dog Tempo to a dog park starting as a puppy.  A cane corso mounted him every time to prove he was dominant over Tempo.  Then one day he walked up to Tempo, saw that his butt was actually too high up off the ground to actually even attempt it, and just walked away.  After that it never came up again.  Taking the human for a walk, even the complaints about hearing the comments about ""where's the saddle?"" all the time are also familiar!  For anyone who has never had the blessing of being loved by one of these wonderful animals, this is a perfect introduction.  I adored my Danes and loved the movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN48JW2L5D86Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG98DC#wasThisHelpful","RN48JW2L5D86Q","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I'm not sure I go along with the Multi-regional Theory of human evolution, I do think that Clive Finleyson's book ""The Human's Who Went Extinct"" touches on some very cogent points that often get overlooked or glossed over by those with their eyes on the Out of Africa Hypothesis.  I certainly found them enlightening and have tried to incorporate them into my own way of thinking about the human species.More than anything, while authors often give lip service to the fact that people are animals too, they often neglect what that actually entails especially for early humans.  Many of the patterns of behavior among early people, regardless of their genus and species, were dictated by necessity and what was possible--even by sheer luck.  These writers also seem to ignore the fact that most genera have more than one species in it and that those few that don't are usually under some degree of distress.  I think this is something we should pay more attention to than we do when we look at our Neanderthal cousins as ""failures,"" since it has ramifications for our own kind. In this context the author points out that this means that, far from one species ""succeeding"" another and winning the sweepstakes, there may have been many types of humans alive at any one time, each occupying their own little niche, much as other species in other genera do.  That our co-genera species are no longer with us may have something important to tell us about our own contract with Mother Nature.  One does not usually blame most extinct species for being ""too dumb to live,"" as we are prone to do with our own ancient ancestors and their peers.  All species are suited to the environment in which they evolved; it's only when nature changes the game plan that they may find themselves in trouble.  The author makes this evident in his work on human species as well.  I found that refreshing.From the point of view of the archeologist, dealing with material remains from such a long time ago, the author notes that there isn't much by way of fossil evidence.  He notes that many grand theories that massage the hubris of modern man's notion of himself have been built on next to no evidence.  What there is of cultural material is biased toward what lasts in the record, stone and pottery--what there is of it.  As he points out, this gives a much skewed perspective of what happened and who brought it about.  His most interesting contribution is a discussion of just what technology is useful in what environment.  Here he notes that it is probably the habitat in which any given human found himself that dictated the materials employed, what shapes were created and how the resulting tools were used; and not the intellect or the species of the individual user.  He makes a number of references to modern, non-human animals who perform many of the feats of hunting and even trans-marine travel without nearly the mental ability of our distant ancestors and their contemporaries.  I think this is very important.  It is perhaps uncomfortable for us to believe that Neanderthal or Heidelberg men could become extinct, at least without our help, unless they were somehow mentally or physically defective.  (This attitude brings to mind the old biases regarding races other than ""our own."")  To do otherwise puts us in the awkward position of having to admit that our success has as much to do with dumb luck as it does with our much vaunted ""brain.""  It also makes it more evident that our luck could just ""run out"" one of these days just as it did for other species of human in the past.  Here the author refers often to Jarod Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies which makes similar points about the European contact with the inhabitants of the Americas.I found the author's reference to the ranges of some modern animals, particularly the collared dove, very interesting and grounding.  One tends to forget that the ""great migrations"" of our distant ancestors took place as they did and do with other animals and not as some grand manifest destiny.  As population density increases, part of the group moves over a bit to have space and resources with which to raise their own ""kids.""  Over generations, the range of the species expands until it hits some obstacle it can't go over or around.  If major change occurs pockets of species may remain in refugia waiting for better times.  If better times fail to come along, these populations may become extinct.  With humans one tends to get the impression of a great ""mission"" or ""destiny"" with the expansion of ancient human populations that just isn't there anymore than it is for other animals.  Even in more recent times, most people left their homes to find new ones so that they could promote their own interests.  While a Genghis Khan might bring about a major migration for the purpose of conquest in the post agricultural world, in the pre-agricultural world this is most unlikely to have been a motivator.  For one thing, ""conquest"" or ""exploration,"" even ""migration"" would have to have been concepts that could even have arisen, and I'm not sure they could or did at the time.  It's very unlikely that the ancestors of the Native Americans suddenly decided to mass migrate from Siberia to North America one day.One of the issues that the author brings up with respect to which individuals survive hard times to populate the environment was particularly interesting and relevant.  As he notes, it was those who lived marginal existences around a settled and conservative population that managed to navigate through whatever bottleneck occurred.  This seems to have been the case with most plants and animals.  He also suggests that the modern individual is essentially as ""domesticated"" as are the plants and animals upon which and with which he or she lives.  The ""wild form"" of our own species is rapidly being crowded out of existence.  While no human is less ""modern"" than another, some live closer to the ""wild"" existence than most of us do.  In the event that a catastrophe occurs that brings about the collapse of society as we know it, it would be this ""wild"" population that would probably repeople the world--that is if we've allowed them to continue to exist--because they have the greatest experience with ""making do"" with almost nothing. I know I couldn't; I'm not sure I'd even want to. We might remember that destroying the dissenters of the world--like those living in the mountains of Afghanistan, the forests of South America and other marginal areas--may well put paid to the human experiment if and when Mother Nature decides she's had about enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHWJO437XA0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199239185#wasThisHelpful","R2NHWJO437XA0Z","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The First Human"" by Ann Gibbons was a bit of an eye opener for me.  Although I have studied anthropology at the college level and have followed it in the popular literature since then, I had not realized how much ego went into the research.  I guess I'd expected disagreements and arguments; that's what science is all about, thrashing out the ""true"" story of how nature works.  But I'd expected respectful discourse.  After the book though, I ended up thinking that not many of the key researchers in the field were really very nice people and that I'm glad I didn't/don't know any of them!In general Ms Gibbons' account suggests individuals who are vain, selfish, horrendously competitive, cut throat, and sometimes not entirely ethical.  It's a wonder that anything actually gets done in the field.  I suspect there are those who feel it doesn't.  More than anything this not terribly flattering account of anthropology suggests just how much resilience science as a field actually has, since it manages to make progress DESPITE rather than BECAUSE of the motives and agendas of individual scientists.  This has been pointed out by other scientists in other fields before, most notably physics, but ""The First Human"" makes a definite statement of the fact:  The ""SYSTEM of science"" is what corrects and redirects what is known about the natural world.  Medical research is another case in point.  It has been suggested that science makes a leap forward whenever a given generation of researchers passes away, relaxing their grip on their field of interest.What makes anthropology and the origin of humankind a difficult field is that the specimens from which composite concepts and developmental phylogenies must be drawn are few and far between.  Even their exact relationship to one another is a matter of disagreement.  Clive Finlayson takes up this issue in The Humans Who Went Extinct: Why Neanderthals Died Out and We Survived and does a brilliant job of approaching the problem from an ecologist's point of view.  When the fact that careers are made and fortunes and grants acquired on the basis of having the ""right"" fossil specimen and the ""right"" understanding of human evolution, one wonders that the disputes aren't more lethal than they are!

"This is a nice little book of holiday patterns.  Essentially many of the designs are combinations of patterns that have been used in more complex doilies, but here they have been rearranged to create lovely angels, trees, stars, and snowflakes.  Anyone who has actually mastered the mechanics of tatting--pulling the right thread to make a slip knot rather than the wrong one and creating a plain old knot--can perform these patterns.  Interestingly, there is a nice pattern using half of the tattting knot, something one doesn't often see.

"I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy these stories or not, but I decided to give them a try.  I was concerned that they would all be ""tear jerkers,"" capitalizing on the viewer's love of animals by dealing with sick and dying animals in a maudlin manner.  While to some extent this is true, it was more of a natural mix of real stories.  Based as it is on the semi-autobiographical novels of James Herriot, a veterinarian who practiced in Northern England during the early part of the 20th century, the stories are a delightful concatenation of animal stories and the lives of some of the eccentric people in the area--my favorites being Mrs. Pumphry and her pekinese Tricky Woo.  (At one point after James tells the wealthy lady that the dog must get more exercise, she has her gardiner carry the dog around the garden three times a day).  The interactions among the central characters, the brothers Siegfried and Tristan Farnan, the ""new"" vet James and his wife Helen Harriot, and the marvelous housekeeper Mrs. Hall are wonderfully balanced.  The acting is exceptional, creating a sense of real people, people one would like to know.  There are disagreements, as there are in any family, pranks and jokes, and a loving support in hard times. (When a dog owner takes his own life after his pet must be put down, James feels responsible for the man's death and is supported by his wife and friends, subsequently able to rise to the occasion when another pet owner threatens suicide in a similar incident).  In the background is the rising threat of WWII; knowning as the viewer does that the charming world of these people will be irrevocably altered once the storm breaks, makes each episode a treasure to be remembered, and one can empathize with Siegfried when he sits on a hillside trying to remember every nuance of the landscape as it is before it is lost forever.  By the end of the series, when the two senior vets go off to take part in the war, the viewer feels all the emotional tugs of seeing close friends leave without any assurance that they will ever return again, and sharing a clear knowledge that even if and when they do, things will never be quite the same again.  I think in part that intensity comes from our own experience with the world as it passes from the ""once upon a time"" into the vague and distant future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8O1NTRPY3F9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DUBAZS#wasThisHelpful","R8O1NTRPY3F9M","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The King's Speech was probably one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  While I can't say that the central character was a ""true"" likeness of the future king of England during World War II, I think as a dramatic creation he certainly ""rings true.""  Colin Firth did a fantastic job of portraying him.  The sense of frustration, anxiety, sadness, and isolation he created for his character was amazing.Most surprising I think, though it probably shouldn't have been, is the degree to which the prince was subject to what would be considered patent child abuse today.  It probably shouldn't have been, since the power that came to individuals favored by the king since childhood was often formidable, and the Prince of Wales was to have become king, not his younger brother.  The wonder isn't that he stuttered but that he wasn't considerably more impaired than he was by his experiences.  The fact that he could overcome his more overt signs of that oppressive upbringing with the help of the individual he consulted reveals his considerable determination as a person and the great emotional support he received as an adult from others in doing so.  His personal conflict over becoming the king was very poignant.  One is generally led to believe that individuals would--and did--kill to become king; watching someone try everything he could not to be was enlightening.  It also puts into perspective the desperate circumstances of former usurpers; the threats to them and to the country had to have been major, not only for one to undertake treason but for one to undertake the headaches of rule.The character of Wallis Simpson, while she did not appear often in the movie, was one that was pivotal to history.  She was well portrayed in the film; part real person, part public perception.  While I have not read her own history, I have read books in which she featured, and it would appear that she was part of the 19th century phenomenon usually practiced by wealthy 500 families in America, that of marrying a daughter to a financially strapped noble family, sort of  ""aristocrat"" by proxy.  I strongly suspect that Mrs. Simpson, who was definitely not of the 500, expected to ""make the big time"" in terms of American social climbing by becoming a reigning queen; in that she definitely misread the British people of the time--and when it came to the monarchy, everyone below the king was ""the British people!""  Morganatic marriages are not something that is well accepted even today, as questions of Kate Middleton's ""commoner"" status suggest.  The divorced status of Camilla Bowles brought her future as ""queen"" into question for a long time.One of the things I found most intriguing was the king's status under parliamentary government.  It would appear that whereas the kings of earlier times were themselves often guilty of abusing the ""people,"" their function in more recent times has been as a focus of power that moderates the abuses of the people's own elected government.  Elected parliament members might have short term personal agendas, but the hereditary monarch can and does take the long term point of view; England is more-or-less his ""estate,"" and he doesn't want to go ""out of business!""  I'm not sure if this impression is true or not, but it certainly seemed to be in the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27L4ZFQHCN0IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UESJH4#wasThisHelpful","R27L4ZFQHCN0IS","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reading this type of book since the 1970s, and there were still things that had confused me about some of the common topics.  I found this one made many of them much clearer.  I found the author's approach to his subject rather clever, because so few authors look at such topics from the point of view of limits.  The mode is usually to imagine the possibilities as though there were no limits.  Some of the topics upon which the author expounds have to do with the inherent limits of the human mind/brain to comprehend and some are bounded by what can be known or more than inferred.  In this frame it is almost a philosophy of what is knowable.While the book is probably a little oversimplified for anyone who has read on this topic for any length of time, it is a good place to start.  The similes are clear and are rarely taken to extremes.  It also reveals how physicists approach their subject and how, when and why breakthroughs occur.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTNJ9LH4I234U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199585245#wasThisHelpful","RTNJ9LH4I234U","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I felt that this book was written and published a little too soon, possibly so that its information could be put to use for financial reasons before a lot of it was publically up for grabs.  I might find this a little questionable if I didn't feel that the underlying reason for this was not self-promotion but a desire to ensure financial support for continued work on the project.  Since it sounds like a true treasure with a lot to tell us of the Cretaceous, I feel this is valid.A lot of the book is what I consider filler.  There is, for instance, a thorough though probably unnecessary discussion of mummies of all kinds which takes up a good share of the narrative.  While I can understand a need to discuss how this specimen is like and unlike other finds described as ""mummies,"" I don't know if the author really needed to get into a discussion of human mummification.  A shorter course would have been to simply discribe what the find was and what it had to tell us and by what means.I am amazed at the degree to which paleontology has advanced, both in information and in technology, since I myself worked on a degree in geology.  A lot has been learned, especially with the cooperative efforts between Chinese and Western researchers on the vast amount of material coming to light in Asia.  Just the increase in the data on the evolution of birds has been miraculous, as the book points out in passing.  More than anything, the author shows how much information can be gleaned from a rare find if it is carefully excavated and prepared.  When modern technology is also applied to the problem, even greater advances can be made.  I was particularly impressed with the introduction of ground probing techniques to the elucidation and comprehension of buried landforms contemporaneous with the fossil.  I was disappointed, to say the least, that the author had not been able to go into greater detail about what the CT scan had to say about the subject find.  The build up for it was tremendous with the illustrations from other finds; not to have actually had the data on this subject was a great let down.  As I said, however, I think this was in part due to the need to put something out for public consumption in order to finance the on-going research.This book like many written by field paleontologists, Gorgon: Paleontology, Obsession, and the Greatest Catastrophe in Earth's History, Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins, is heavily autobiographical.  That is something I usually don't care for when reading on paleontology and or paleontological finds, since it is information about the discovery I look for in this type of book.  Here, however, I felt that the occasional diversion was justified.  Written as it is for non-professional readers, the personal information given here provided a clear understanding of what motivates an individual to become a scientist and in particular a paleontologist.  Furthermore this book did so without that sense that the book was glory seeking or attempting to characterize the author as a ""romantic"" Indiana Jones sort.  It gives a clear idea of what such an individual must learn to become a paleontologist, what their working conditions are often like, what the trajectory of their career might be expected to be, and so forth.  Especially for young people thinking in terms of a future profession, this type of information is useful and important. It certainly made it clear that important fossil discoveries don't just happen and aren't just simple messing about.  To do it right is to glean every bit of information we can out of a discovery; to mess about is to destroy forever something that might have been precious.More than anything I felt that the book was intended to fire up the imagination of the average reader so that investigations of this sort can be supported more fully in the future.  Most of us tend to accept this type of discovery as we find it, a fascinating oddity.  What it is, though, is a very expensive process.  Not only must field researchers actively seek their specimen, they have to resurrect it from the ground, sometimes from solid rock, and without damaging it, or at least damaging it as little as possible.  It must then be conserved and ultimately housed for posterity.  None of this is without cost.  Books of this type help to bring these facts to the public awareness, and I'm grateful for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AA2OHEXISEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426203845#wasThisHelpful","R9AA2OHEXISEV","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy this series which carries the costume dramas, like Jane Austin works, into the realm of the average person.  After all not many of us would have been ""to the manor born,"" nor were our ancestors.  This collection is based on the novels of Flora Thompson, who wrote of her early life during the final decades of the 19th century.  Like the homely stories of Laura Ingalls Wilder who captured the same era and life in the rural America of the Midwest, those of Ms Thompson reveal the struggles of hard working farmers and small town shop keepers in England.Each episode provides a colorful vignette of country life at the time, the tale of which generally focuses on some aphorism about life drawn from the narrator's father, mother, neighbor or simply something commonly said by many in the town.  The episode is often multi-lineal, with several characters undergoing some misfortune or minor triumph and with all of these various strands pulled together into a complete whole by the end of the story.  Usually after all is said and done and no matter how far afield each little subplot seems to have wandered, when the narrator repeats the maxim at the end, one realizes just how very true it was and in how many ways it proved to be so.The delight of the entire thing is in the humanness of the characters and in the attention to detail; there are few references to the grander panorama of ""history"" as we are used to reading about it.  The most major event for these people is the coming of the railroad to a neighboring town and its likely effect on the local people and their economy.  The narrator's father is often the character that speaks for the rest of the world and the changes that are afoot beyond the borders of Lark Rise and Candleford.  While this may seem to present a very narrow portrait of the world, it is this perspective that most of us have, even today with mass communication and technology of a far higher order.  It is also this narrower view that is most real, since although history is written by ""experts"" about the high and mighty and what they did, it is experienced by individuals through the events of their lives.What surprises me most is that both Laura Ingalls and Laura Timmins live lives that are so very similar despite their separation in space, the differences in their governments, the differences in their countries' histories.  It makes it far more apparent that technology and the demands of the environment are strongly deciding factors in the type of life we live no matter where we might be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RM489T6HSGLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TY2STA#wasThisHelpful","R3RM489T6HSGLE","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a magnificent film from the point of view of cinematography.  Each episode was beautifully filmed.  Some scenes seemed a little too dark, but generally speaking the darkness helped create a sense of drama and tragedy.Some of the characters seemed almost numb; in places this greatly increased audience awareness of the stultifying nature of the lives of these people and their reality, while with some characters it seemed as though blank expressions were to be taken as ""acting,"" this was especially so of Julia and Charles.With the character of Sebastian, played by Ben Whishaw, however, the presence was more controlled than wooden.  He was the epitome of urbanity, his casual and offhand manner obviously a mask for deeper feelings.  With the removal of the mask, the deeper feelings, especially of despair, seemed almost as naked as his appearance in the buff by the fountain or in the bathroom.  This created an overall sense of someone so completely on the edge, a suicide seemed eminent.  Although it did not occur in the traditional form of bullet to the head or hanging from the rafters, it might be seen as a slow and intentional suicide by alcohol.  Certainly this had the greatest effect on his family, especially his mother, which is probably as he intended it, since it gave him some degree of control. As his mother explained to Charles Ryder, Charles drank to get drunk, Sebastian drank to destroy himself.  Though she misconstrued his reasons, Charles pointed them out: Sebastian drank to free himself of her.  This did not endear Charles to her.Emma Thompson's portrayal of Lady Marchmain was also expertly controlled.  She seemed a mass of conflicting motives; a mother desiring the love of her children, one who sought to keep them safe both in the here and the hereafter by controlling their every thought and action and thereby driving them to despair and withdrawal.  She was open-minded about Ryder's class, as many at the time might not have been, but she was unremitting on the issue of his atheism.  She was charming, attractive and generous but also arrogant, vindictive, and selfish.  One easily saw how she drew others in while exacting a steep price for having done so.  One never knew whether to see her as Machiavellian and sinister or hopelessly and helplessly caught up in the web of her class and religion.The character of Charles Ryder, played by Matthew Goode, seems hardly more than a backdrop to the angst of the other characters, though at times I wondered if he weren't intended to be the ""devil"" in disquise, tempting the faithful from their  miserable path to redemption.  It was his woodenness that most intrigued me, since he had less oppressive circumstances and therefore less reason to feel wooden.  His relationship with his father, played by Patrick Malahide, seemed a little distant but hardly damaging; his talent was recognized in time, his life was essentially his own.  Yet he allows himself to be pulled back into the dysfunctional lives of the Flyte family despite having been burned more than once by their self immolating behaviors.  Somehow a house no more comfortable than a museum, no matter how opulent, seems inadequate reason for his involvement with people who are definitely damaged goods, especially since any attempt he made to help them only made them worse.  As Sebastian told him on his first visit, if all he wanted was to see all the sights at Brideshead, he'd have been better off buying a ticket and taking a tour.  Nothing truer was said. One could almost see a good term paper in the interpretation of the meaning of the house in Brideshead Revisited!A very intriguing story, well filmed, and well acted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVCEGBGZFI9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ILFUBY#wasThisHelpful","RBVCEGBGZFI9X","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an impressive book.  I'm not certain if I understood it entirely; economics is not my forte, though I've had coursework in it for one of my degrees.  The book certainly raised my awareness--of my own ignorance if nothing else.  Even if the reader doesn't agree with everything the author espouses, he will definitely benefit from learning a new way of thinking about evidence.For one thing, the concepts of macroeconomics are not always as straight forward as they might seem and are therefore not always readily understandable to the average person.  This book makes me wonder if it can be, even for an economist!  Unlike science, economic pontifications are not often subject to testing, peer review, and retesting, yet we play games with world economies as though the results were assured.More than anything we are fed platitudes that seem to make sense--but that may not--by individuals that consensus argues are ""experts.""  We are not generally invited to consider who or what composes that ""consensus"" or what their agendas might be.  Nor, on the other hand, are we given a lot of data other than this consensus with respect to the knowledge, skills or abilities of the experts, or indeed, about their personal agendas either.Keynes is a case in point, since it appears that his dictates were subject to his personal opinions about the economic conditions of his time--late 19th century through mid-20th--and he could and frequently did change his position with great plasticity.  His ability to persuade the naive through flamboyant rhetoric or suppress the opposition through rapier wit and personal put-downs, made his arguments achieve a sort of economic religion for policy makers desperate to promote economic growth, belay economic downturns and ensure their own reelection.It should be noted, however, that since politicians are, like the rest of us, dependent upon these self-same experts for helping them determine policy, they are in the same boat as the rest of us; blaming any given administration for being bewitched by a charismatic expert and the application of his principles is pointless since it is as much our fault as theirs.  Throwing mud at the ""guilty party"" is likely to besmirch us all!Most importantly, these platitudes are those many of us would prefer to believe, since often it appeals to our own sense of entitlement and to our own sense of control.  Why wouldn't an average tax payer wish to see the wealthy person taxed more, or the wealthy want the average tax payers saddled with greater burden--there are more of us after all.  It is this lack of foresight and the natural suspicion between economic classes that ""experts"" use against us.  This is a little scary.  It is scary not only in the short term for the actual personal harm that mismanagement can cause the individual and society, but in the long term for the health of democratic society.This is especially the case where ""experts"" are given an almost hallowed status of all-knowing ""seers"" and given a free and unsupervised hand in manipulating world economy, as if they were without agendas of their own and somehow above the petty concerns of the rest of us.  (So like, how can this be?)  Without a degree of transparency and oversight, there is no reason that such individuals could not become a form world tyrant themselves, beyond the reach of elected governments, certainly those at the lower levels affecting the average person.I suspect that the ""black box"" approach to economics is probably the best one.  It's been in place since the first caveman exchanged a bearskin rug for a good hunk of flint.  With something so fraught with variables, many of them unpredictable and possibly unknowable, that ""invisible"" hand is probably the best thing we've got for ""managing"" our economy until we come up with quantum computers, if then.  I suspect, however, that the human need to tinker with just about everything will continue to drive our desire to ""fix"" economics.  The desire to avoid consequences on the individual or corporate level will almost insure it!While I'm not certain that I believe everything that the author, Hunter Lewis, says or suggests, I do find some of his methods of critique a good guide line for us all.  In assessing the works of Keynes and subjecting them to scrutiny, he uses specific methods of enquiry which he actually lists in chapter 20.  In his critique of Keynes he notes that the latter uses a variety of devices to obfuscate the facts or to make his own pronouncements seem weightier; he:1. Uses obscure language (""highfalutin"" rhetoric that we might not be able to follow, or in fact anyone could)2. Misuses technical language (which we might not understand in the first place to even realize it had been misused)3. Shifts his definitions (using the same word in different ways in different places)4. Misuses common terms (sort of a sleight of hands with words)5. Reverses cause and effect (says the results were the cause of what happened)6. Uses false determinism (suggests that something unpredictable is in fact a certainty)7. Shifts back and forth between mutually inconsistent categories (compares apples to oranges)8. Uses unsupported assertions (gives no supporting evidence that his statement is anything but opinion)9. Makes misstatements (either by error or by intent)10. Extrapolates from illustrations at macro or micro levels to ""prove"" something at the other level11. Misuses mathematical ""formulae"" to impress and confuse (X=Y+1, as it may be sometimes, but if Y is unmeasurable anyway, what do you actually know; not to mention, if X=apples and Y=oranges, what can the formula really mean?)These are concepts of critical thinking that are all too infrequently practiced by most of us.  They need to be taught and underscored dramatically in our educational system so that we can make better decisions.  It is ultimately we as voters and taxpayers who bring pressure to bear on our elected officials; it is also we who are ultimately responsible for the type of government and economy under which we all live.  It behooves us to inspect the credentials and statements of those who seek to ""advise"" us.  It is also important to be suspicious of anyone who tries to charm us by telling us what we want to hear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CI22RQV8V155/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604190175#wasThisHelpful","R1CI22RQV8V155","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this was a tremendous series.  I normally read books on this type of subject, but lately I've been knitting a sweater for a friend and find it difficult to stick to the project if my mind isn't as occupied as my hands are.  I found this listed and decided to see what the lecturer had to say.For those who have a wide range of interests this is a tremendous assemblage of information taken from a variety of disciplines, so it should have a wide appeal.  What made me realize that it was not just a ""gimmick"" was the macroscopic approach of the lecturer, Professor David Christian.  E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, himself would be proud of the ""consilliance"" with which the lecturer dealt with history.For most of those interested in history, the perspective is generally by period or geographic region, but Professor Christian takes a much broader look at global human history.  He looks at how the universe came into being--how everything had to be as it is if we were likely to appear at all--how our own solar system and our own immediate environment came into being, and also how we arose as living creatures.  He has no partisan view of human society or culture but takes a look at the development of the world as we know it as a gradual usurpation by human organisms of the energy of the earth.  This makes incredible sense to me, and brings me to wonder why no one has suggested it before.  It is this cooption of the energy of other organisms and of the stored energy in petroleum, coal, nuclear materials, sunshine, and geothermal sources that has boosted human domination of the planet over a remarkably short period of time.This overarching approach to human history makes greater sense of some of the cultural events that have taken place through our history.  The creation of settled lifestyles, the development of towns and then cities, the almost perennial state of war between cities and regions, the similar development in both the New and the Old Worlds all makes sense when veiwed in the terms of control of energy and other resources.  More importantly the author points to the fact that much of humanity's ability to grain this control is due to its ability to communicate with a high degree of precision and to an ever widening circle of individuals.  While this is not a new idea, the author is able to draw conclusions about the effects of extending the reach of such communication by showing the different developments of the New and Old World cultures and the changes that occurred when they began communicating between themselves.  Professor Christain makes frequent reference to Jarod Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, which also makes significant points on the isolated development of both areas and the effects of their contact.The professor makes note at various points that this overarching effect of humans on the world is not necessarily a ""good"" thing--certainly not for the other biota of the planet--even for the human species itself in the long run, but at least it makes considerable sense of what we see happening around us today.  He also puts before the student the fact that at no time in human history have we not had a detectable destructive effect on the environment.  I suspect that that could be said of any living thing and that this is simply a part of the evolutionary cycle of the planet itself.  If life elsewhere is as common as it is on earth and occurs as early as it seems to have done on this planet, then we may find that the reshaping of other planets and other ecosystems parallels our own; that we and the phenomena we create are simply part of the life history of any planet that can give rise to animals of our level of biological sophistication.  One author,The Sixth Extinction: Patterns of Life and the Future of Humankind, has even suggested that the rise of intelligent life may be the ""end-stage"" of a planet's biosphere and that from the perspective of the planet and the rest of the life on it, we are a cancerous growth"" of sorts.Interestingly the lecturer also gives his predictions of what life will be like within the next 100 years and even the next 1000 years.  He also discusses the most common theories of the end of the universe.A thoroughly intriguing series of lectures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMW8TSBU6WDJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598034103#wasThisHelpful","RMW8TSBU6WDJZ","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike most of my friends, I adore a good disaster movie and this one was a corker.The CGI effects are spectacular.  Better than any I've seen so far.  I've often wondered what would happen if and when the hot spot under Yellowstone National Park decided to go ballistic, and this movie gave me the opportunity of seeing it happen from the safety of my living room!  (Now someone just has to recreate the effect of the hot spot under the Bay of Naples--which includes the surroundings of the that city and Vesuvius--which is also an event waiting to happen!)One does, however, have to suspend disbelief with considerable force if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of geology, cosmology, ecology or physics.  I doubt, for instance, that with the speed of a nué ardant the size that the Yellowstone mega volcano would probably produce would give anyone, even those within hundreds of miles of its immediate range, a chance to get away from it even in an airplane.  I find it difficult also to believe that the crust would be able to move quite that far or that quickly, though the end of Hawaii was certainly within the realm of possibility.  Nor given wave physics can I see a 24,000 foot tsunami topping the Himalayas.  I'm also baffled by how a ship might make it down from the Himalayas to sea level, though I think we are meant to infer that the Himalayas actually sank to sea level.  Though I think they ""got it right"" with respect to the numbers of humans needed to viably repopulate the earth after the disaster, I suspect the number of animals and the types of animal they saved was probably more viable in a Biblical rather than a scientific account of replacement.  Still, all this aside, it was a whopper of a spectacle.I did have trouble with the touching scene involving the decision to rescue the ""ordinary"" folks who were being left behind out of a sense of ""humanity,"" esepcially since these same upright folks had already condemned the other 6 billion of us to oblivion by withholding information that might have allowed us to make provisions for our own survival--like they say, though, knowledge is power.  There are, however, poignant last goodbyes aplenty, many scenes when a truly decent sort dies while a ""bad"" sort lives, times when even a ""bad"" sort lives up to a higher code, and the heartfelt moment when a little dog is nearly left behind but manages to make it just in time. Anyone who has seen the Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Independence Day, the Day After Tomorrow and other similar films will recognize the format. Interestingly this type of film seems to come out in quantity during hard economic times.  I wonder what that says about our national psyche.My favorite character was the outrageous conspiracy-theorist/radio host played by Woody Harrelson.  Anyone who willingly watches as a nué ardant approaches him is supremely out of touch with reality!Whopping good fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GY7U59APZCMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OQCV2E#wasThisHelpful","R1GY7U59APZCMI","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In these days of high tension, fast paced lives, and 24-7 demands of family, friends, work and self, time for sleep seems to be the most often sacrificed.  Add to that the anxiety that arises when even the little sleep a person can get is at risk, and sleep deprivation becomes a major health problem to the individual and to national productivity.For myself, I've always been a night owl even as a kid, so when I chose a profession ""night nurse"" seemed like a good idea.  For some reason and contrary to Dr. Marks' book, I never had difficulty sleeping during the day, even without closing curtains.  I also tended to sleep around a schedule that included taking classes either during the day or in the evening as needed.  That meant that scheduled sleep time lasted only about three months at a time before my schedule changed again.  I won't say that these behaviors didn't have repercussions however, just as the author points out in her book. I have always been considerably overweight and dieting, while successful for a period of time, never yielded a permanent change.  I also have a tendency toward depression (though I suspect this is partly hereditary) and now I know why.  While I had no difficulty sleeping, I probably suffered side effects from my unusual schedule.""Master Your Sleep"" by Dr. Tracey I. Marks discusses normal sleep behavior, and points out the issues that arise from odd sleep patterns and broken or delayed sleep.  She also puts into plain language the stages of sleep--with some newer research findings which I had not heard before--so that the reader is able to understand why he or she is having problems.  Most important, she notes that not everyone needs the traditional eight hours while some may actually need more.The majority of the text provides several methods for reshaping the sleep behavior of the reader that may override the anxiety over inability to sleep and set the sufferer on the path to better rest.  Probably the most significant chapter is on children's sleep disorders, the repercussions of which impact the adults in the household sometimes severely.  In fact some of the information on the sleep needs of children might be crucial to the health and academic success of children.While some of the sleep techniques are intuitive (no caffeine before bedtime and bedrooms should be for sleep not work) and some have been around for a long time (meditation and muscle relaxation), some might seem counter to logic (avoiding sleep, and staying awake a little longer each day until one is sleeping at the right time.)  Probably the healthiest techniques are those that get to the root of the problem, i.e. all those issues that come to mind when one is most desirous of sleep.  Here the author suggests cognitive types of therapy that deal with the styles of thinking that make people anxious, tense and sleepless.An interesting and useful book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IXTVWLOCX1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935098462#wasThisHelpful","R20IXTVWLOCX1A","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Roadside Geology of Minnesota is virtually the same as the author's other book on the subject, Minnesota's Geology, by way of narrative content.  Some of the passages seem to be almost verbatim, especially where dealing with the specifics of the geologic strata and their ages, origins, and types, subjects which have not been much debated for many decades.  Where there is debate, the author states as much.While this is generally true, some new data have been added, mostly with respect to recent conditions of the visible sites; not all still exist due to mining removal of some of them or ground cover obscuring them.  There are also more frequent references to the historic and other significant points of interest throughout the state including personal and family reminiscences.  The use of the old Soudan Mine for physics research--cosmic particle and dark matter--is noted, for instance, while the Kensington or ""Viking"" Rune Stone, discovered in 1898 by a Swedish farmer and now on display in the city of Alexandria and long declared a ""fake,"" is noted now as being ""reinvestigated.""  Also of note is the more recent suggestion of a level of what may be impact debris from the Sudbury event of about 1.85 billion years ago and found in the area of the Gunflint, almost 500 miles away.While those who have read the author's earlier book will find most of the scientific data and narrative are the same, they will also discover that the photos here are better quality and more in number.  Most especially more of them are in color and the color quality is generally better.  This makes the characteristics of the formations clearer, which should make it easier for those who want to take the outlined tours to recognize them in situ.This book, like the other, has a thumbnail sketch of geology and of the geology of the state in particular to help give an understanding of the underlying processes involved in creating the state's geologic character.  It is, however, intended to be a roadside tour for personal or classroom edification and not a course in geology or earth history.  A more thorough study of geology through general texts will greatly enhance the enjoyment of the tour book.There is a fair amount of redundancy in description.  Information often already given in the introductory chapters or in one of the chapters on a specific region may be repeated in later chapters, which can be a little irritating.  One must remember, however, that the book is designed to be a tour book, and that unless one is intending to do the entire state in a few short days--rather difficult and thoroughly unlikely--the pertinent information at each type site is helpful, even if the reader has already ""heard"" it already.  In short, each mini-tour is a compact unit with all pertinent information included in it.Like Minnesota's Geology, the book is divided into sections based on general areas and rock regions of the state.  Most of the state exhibits ""recent"" geologic events in the form of glaciations and glacial formations, though the northeast has examples of very early volcanism, of island arc formation, of mountain building, traces of convergent events and of rifting.  This makes it a perfect area for class trips that want to hit the most ""points"" of the science of geology.  Those who expect to find dinosaur remains will discover that while the animals may have walked the Minnesota landscape of the time, their remains have been removed from the scene by glacial mechanics.  Whole periods of earth history have been removed leaving ""unconformities"" in the rock record.For those who live in the state, the formations in your area--even of your specific town--may be discussed in detail, which should make the book more personally significant.  It was for me.  I grew up in the southeastern part of the state and found the discription of some of the terrains informative.  I also studied geology and paleontology in college and had the experience of exploring many of the fossil bearing sites.  The Twin Cities where I currently reside is well described in the book, and I have recently spent time in the region of Lake Pepin, whose formation and history is discussed as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAL1RJCAVN7Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878425624#wasThisHelpful","RAL1RJCAVN7Y6","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the first Nanny McPhee film the best.  It seemed to focus on the people and their issues and on resolving them.  Magic was part of it, but the magic of family was the important part of it.  It made fun of adulthood and of unrestrained childhood without seeming to go beyond the pale.  Furthermore the romance was delightfully comic, making Colin Firth, a former Mr. Darcy, a somewhat helpless and comic widower.With Nanny McPhee Returns the story seemed way too melodramatic and relied too heavily on special effects.  That Nanny is a witch is obvious and acceptable as it was before, but here there was so much magic that the story seemed to get lost until the very end.  I felt the film worked too hard and employed almost every time worn concept:  ""eat your green vegetables"" to a grown man who'd been a ward of Nanny in the past.  Not to mention that green vegetables, let alone cheese, during World War II would have been a welcome treat.The antics seemed intended more to lengthen the film than to enhance the story.  Children chasing escaped piglets seemed quite manic and amusing enough, that the piglets should also do 1930s swimming routines and acrobatics was a little much; in short it felt patronizing.  It was as though a group of adults sitting around a conference table tried to decide what would ""entertain"" children without really considering that children are people and they do get the point of things.More than anything I felt that these devices distracted from the true story, that of children sent away for adult reasons (insensitive parents facing divorce and a war), children faced with destitution by virtue of adult greed and circumstances (shortage of field workers due to a war and a wicked--and quite funny--uncle), children faced with the possible loss of a parent due to war, and most important, children learning to appreciate others, their actions, and their world view.  That magic should bring the lessons home is acceptable, especially in a children's story, but total nonsense seems egregious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVXFYK57JR21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L20IJM#wasThisHelpful","RNVXFYK57JR21","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It was filmed during a low point in international politics, the so-called ""cold war"" period.  Since I was a young person during this era and remember the fear it engendered, seeing the film put life into perspective and was a positive, enlightening, and healthy experience.As an adult, I can appreciate the panic of the ""invaded"" villagers; I could almost have seen a similar behavior arising in the small Midwestern town I lived in as a child had something like it occurred.  The rapidity with which information was transmitted and distorted throughout the community by word of mouth was familiar to me.  In fact it reminds me of the time an upset busybody called my mother to report that my brother had ""spun the wheels"" of the family car at a stop sign outside her house.  My mother, who had just arrived home merely said, ""Oh no, that was me!""  On another occasion I ended up in a ditch during stormy weather, and my parents were almost instantly aware of it via the back fence hot-line and rescue was on the way before I even had a chance to chill.  (There's a good side and a bad side to the hot line of small towns.)The Romeo and Juliet of the film are more sensible than in Shakespeare's play.  With Juliet's Capulet and Romeo's Montegue at a stand off, they fall in love but agree to wait for better times.  That makes them far more sensible and adult than their respective ""families!""  Someone should make another movie showing what happened after the collapse of the USSR; did they actually get together?  After some 25 years of waiting, was the attraction still there?My favorite scene is that of the telephone operator and the playwrite (Carl Reiner), ""Wittaker Walt"" as the Russian squad leader (Alan Arkin) calls him, tied together with phone cord, attempting to escape the office to warn people of the potential for disaster.  The gentle poke at conventions respected even in a time of apparent disaster was funny, as was the horror of the two at each anticipated minor catastrophy, already well recognized by the audience.One of the best features of the DVD version is the interview with the director Norman Jewison, who discusses the political climate of the period and the effect of the film on both sides of the contretemps.  That the Russians actually saw the film and were impressed by it was something I had not even suspected when I first got the VHS version years ago.As the story points out, the Russians and the Americans were just people, and people with the same desires: personal safety and a chance to have and raise their families.  They may be caught up in the mutual insanity of world politics, but at heart they are all world villagers whose concern for the life of a small child, one who might well be their own, is still uppermost.  The director and author managed to portray the ignorance and fear that arise from a lack of contact and the manipulation of the political elite in both countries to keep that fear enflamed.  Agendas abound, and they are often those that benefit those in control more than they do the individual people of either country.  This allows countries as entities to do without question things we might never do as individuals.  We might do well to take note; it's still going on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9OZLUY0VUSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006FDAX#wasThisHelpful","RT9OZLUY0VUSK","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy this movie, though not as much as other Christmas stories.  I enjoy Clarence the angel the most, but I find the multiple disappointments of George Bailey tedious.  The whole thing smacks too much of teen angst--""they'll be sorry when I'm gone!""  Although people do have many disappointments in life, these are generally not crunched together in narrative form and thus tend to depress the person living through them---and in this case us---to a lesser extent.  The next good fortune manages to mitigate the last bad luck event.  The novel prospect of seeing the world without oneself is the most entertaining part of the film.  The question for me has always been, would it really be all that different?  I have the distinct feeling that it's all about feeling sorry for ourselves, then discovering we were actually the center of the universe after all!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HVJARBDRBFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0782002064#wasThisHelpful","R21HVJARBDRBFR","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this little book, but I found myself a little more confused than I usually get with popular physics books.  Most are focused on small particle physics and cosmology and concerned with the apparent permanent disunion of quantum and relativity physics.  The author, Frank Close, has chosen instead to direct the reader's attention to ""empty"" space.The book discusses the early Greek philosophers and their ""take"" on whether a void can or cannot exist and why.  Theirs is perforce a matter of logical deduction based on what they knew of nature and what they thought they knew of how it works.  Lacking even the simplest technology for experiment, they still made some very astute suggestions about the underlying principles of physics which stood the test of time until better technology turned up. The author then follows the remarkable scientific theories and experiments of the 17th and 18th century macro-physicists, who were able to apply new equipment to the questions of what exists and why.  Professor close then discusses the modern era and what research with high end, big-buck technology has told us about the void.By testing some of the theories of quantum physics and the character and lifespan of small particles--which has required larger and larger equipment and greater demands on energy affordable only to collectives of nations rather than to individuals working alone--modern scientists have begun to illuminate the world of the very small, which in turn gives information on the void.  This includes possible verification of the logically unsettling theory that something (particles and energy) can actually come from nothing (the void) so long as it is a very, very small loan and/or has a very, very short term.  Focusing thus on the void, Professor Close attempts to answer some of the questions about where the universe came from and whether there are other universes out there somewhere.The book is basically like many others on the subject, but it takes a different perspective on cosmology, forcing the reader to look at the topic with new eyes. Others have also looked at the void, though generally starting from the concepts of black holes, Hawking radiation, matter and antimatter, and what quantum theory suggests about the void.An interesting perspective on ""nothing.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6YTOQQL3VDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402775385#wasThisHelpful","R1F6YTOQQL3VDM","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were ""required"" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the dénouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2  hour film.The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them ""camping out"" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNU9A66S6A1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UV4XHY#wasThisHelpful","R2FNU9A66S6A1E","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me a while to decide what I wanted to write about this title.  In some ways I was very impressed, but in others I wasn't.  The book itself is interesting, as it discusses Origami in terms of geometry; something that I had understood from my reading on the art that it had been used to teach children in Japanese schools.  The notion of three dimensional forms, their edges, faces, and points, is explained and may help the student visualize geometric concepts more clearly.If you are an average practicioner already, the book's simpler designs may give you some concept of how modules are used to create larger products; some of the flower designs are lovely and not out of reach of those who've already done origami with some frequency.  Better and simpler books with delightful designs based on this technique are available, like those of Fuse, Fabulous Origami Boxes, Origami Rings & Wreaths: A Kaleidoscope of 28 Decorative Origami Creations and others Origami Jewelry: More Than 40 Exquisite Designs to Fold and Wear and might be a simpler place to start.For the more advanced practice origamist, this book may be very enlightening if you feel you have run out of challenges.  Certainly if you wish to design your own models, it would be helpful, especially those using multiple parts in one or more shapes.  Visualizing the part that such shapes take in the final product will definitely take a little practice as it isn't necessarily quite as straight forward as one might think.  Developing the skill to see a module in a different light might help one create other novel patterns using it.This is not, however, really a book that the beginner would be best to start his or her own practice of the art.  Most of the designs are ""fussy"" by virtue of the sheer number of modular parts required to complete them.  What is the strong suite for an advanced practitioner becomes the bane of the beginner:  visualizing how the parts interact when it isn't very clear cut.From the point of view of a pattern book, some of the designs are quite lovely, particlarly the flowers and the triangle pyramids, but many are messy looking and seem to have been designed simply to prove that one can carry anything to an extreme.  This is especially so with the last designs in the book which carry the geometric aspect of origami to higher and higher levels in something of a competitive context.  Increasing the number of plains and parts for geometric designs apparently assures one a place in the history of origami.  If this is your desire, the book is for you.  If you just want some nice designs or instruction in how to do origami, it probably isn't.  In general I preferred the author's other book, Marvelous Modular Origami, which also has polyhedra, but which seems to show a little more restraint.  Here too, however, the book is probably not for a beginner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1OVPWD0NNCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1568814453#wasThisHelpful","RM1OVPWD0NNCV","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've seen other versions of this film, this is the one I enjoy the most, probably because I enjoy the nostalgia of the classic black and white cinematography and the ""Hollywood Era"" stars. There are colorized versions of it, but because I grew up with the black and white version, I prefer the latter.A very young Natalie Wood stars as the little girl Susan who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, because her mother has decided she should grow up practical and realistic about the world.  She's so dear and so precocious you can relate to her instantly.  Her attempt to learn about the Imagi-nation by imitating a monkey is classic.Edmund Gwenn is the ultimate Khris Kringle--although I did enjoy Sebastian Cabot's version also.  He's charming and loveable in the role, and whether you believe he is who he says he is or not, you definitely like him.Maureen O'Hara is at her most beautiful in the post war fashions of the 40s and is the thoroughly modern woman of her era.  A divorced, working Mom with no illusions about the world and the people in it, she gives Santa a greater task than her daughter does, since it's not just Santa in which she has lost faith.  This film was made in 1947 only a few years after the end of World War II, and women had only just achieved a degree of ""can do"" status because of their war time participation, so the film has some pretty interesting things to say about society.  Generally speaking, divorce for any reason had been considered a bad thing and divorced women had often been socially ostracized, so this is a great departure from earlier social norms.  The fact, however, that she is being encouraged to ""believe"" in Santa and abandon her pragmatism and independance may well be part of the move to return women to the ""good old days"" where their only role was the household.  Certainly the 1950s would see a far less light handed attempt to force women back into the home and subservience and convince them that they were a little too stupid to actually deal with life outside of it--at least in film.  This was more due to a radical about face of the film industry under the very real political threats posed by conservative elements during the McCarthy era than it was to the realities of life during the period.  Like it or not, real life would never be that simplistic and certainly by the 1960s both society and the cinema saw all ""hell break loose"" from the top to the bottom of society.  For a little while at least, there was a little warmth and charm at Christmas.A wonderful Christmas classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2Y41W0778YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HT3PPG#wasThisHelpful","RJ2Y41W0778YU","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorites of the Austen stories are actually ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" either of which I will watch in film, because there is precious little they can do other than totally butcher the stories, that makes them anything but delightful to watch.  My enjoyment of a cinematic Mansfield Park, however, is greatly dependant on its rendition, and this one is my favorite, largely because it is the most sympathetic of them.I've seen at least one version that suggests that Sir Thomas Bertram was virtually a pedophile; that really didn't go over.  It's not that it couldn't have been so--given human nature, I would be more surprised if it hadn't happened on occasion--but it's just not my Jane Austen!  More like Dickens.  In this version, Sir Thomas is a well meaning if somewhat socially bigoted person.  In his world, money equates to quality, and little Fanny Price has little to recommend her.  That he gradually grows to appreciate her good sense and to actually treat her with the affection of a real parent makes him a wonderful character, because he above all of the others actually grows by his experiences.  In fact more than any of them, he is actually aware of the experiences in the first place!The most stellar of the characters, however, is that of Lady Bertram, played brilliantly by Angela Pleasance the daughter of the character actor Donald Pleasance.  Her languid indifference to her life captures more fully than anything else the total emptiness of her position at the top of the social ladder.  Her children are raised by others; her household is managed by others; her every decision is made for her by others.  One senses a beautiful, if perhaps mentally vacant, daughter of a modestly well off social climbing family who managed to carry off the most eligible bachelor of her generation as her prize for simply having existed; that says a lot about the society of the time and about its attitude towards the value of women.  Having had the heir and a spare as required, she retired to a sort of mental oblivion.  It is only when engaged by Fanny that she actually energizes and takes part in what goes on in her world.  Fanny bestows her full attention on Lady Bertram as though she were present and not transparent, unlike the attitude of the rest of the family.Here, too, the daughters Maria and Julia are much more sympathetic.  Maria decides to marry for money, but her alternative of marrying for love was so obviously a poor one given her selection, that one can't help but feel that her actual choice was the best one. She doesn't seem to have been an unpleasant person, simply an ill-fated one.  The outcome of Julia's marriage to Mr. Yeates was so little touched upon, that one can only hope for her happiness.  Who knows; perhaps even Maria will be happier sidelined by divorce.Aunt Norris is the official ""bad guy"" of the family.  She is so obsequious to her brother-in-low, Sir Thomas, and so disparing of the young Fanny that she is obnoxious in the extreme.  The former is understandable, since she is to some extent dependant on Sir Thomas's good will; however the latter is due to her need to feel ""better than"" her neice Fanny.  She lacks anything of the real humility of her neice, and assumes all of the responsiblity for what she perceives as putting the man in her ""debt""--ie. the advantageous marriage of his daughter Maria--and eschews any responsibility for her wrong decisions--ie. her support of the theatrical activities of the younger Bertrams.  To be honest, she is a survivor in a world that leaves little margin for error in social sensitivity, and to err is to be plunged into disaster.  Still, when she is packed off to live with Maria, one can't help but feel she got her just cumupance.The Crawford brother and sister pair are perhaps the least likeable, but then they're not supposed to be.  They are the personification of all that's objectionable about high society--or at least different from the rest of it.  They are foils for the practical good sense of Fanny, and that which throws the country cousins off the ""right path.""  They are the ""beautiful people"" of their time; spoiled, bored, ignorant of or indifferent to the realities of others' lives.A fine presentation of the story and my favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7YPEI74RZTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000244F8M#wasThisHelpful","R3D7YPEI74RZTM","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series has a breath taking cinematic character and a feeling for the quieter dramas of human life as it is more often lived, against the background of worldwide change and generation by generation.  Though few of us actually shape the ""big picture,"" our lives and those of the people around us definitely shape the track upon which these events occur.  Like the effects of drops of water on the contours of the earth, our attitudes, willingness to cooperate, even just what we choose to purchase or not, has an impact on what the world becomes.  It may take a while--though with mass communication how long it takes has significantly shortened--but our individual choices shape history in ways we will probably never know.There is an intensity brought to the everyday lives of these characters by some very superb acting; so much is this so that one has only to view one episode to have opinions about them, about their behaviors and about what they ""ought"" to do.  The restrained passion between Sir Timothy and the postmistress, Dorcas, are wonderful, with so much conveyed by looks and polite behavior that the story is virtually before the viewer without its having to be blatantly related.  We are so certain we understand the unspoken drama that finding out the details is actually a surprise.The stunningly beautiful Lady Adelaide is superb as the over bred and well born wife in love with her husband, of whom she suspects an at least emotional unfaithfulness with the postmistress but about which she feels incapable of dealing effectively.  Her efforts to understand and fit into the life of her husband, a rural aristocrat, remind one of the classic film Rebecca where there is a similar ""blundering around"" without guidence, though in this case the lady actually is a ""Lady.""  The difference between the expectations of urban and rural roles is dramatized very well in this single character.  Expecting a life of urban social obligations including the theater, balls, formal dinners, etc. in the competitive and cut-throat social milieu of London and for which she would be more than adequately prepared, she is instead thrust into the more primitive social obligations of dependant tenant farmers and day laborers and local tradesmen, with none of whose every day realities she is even remotely familiar.  Though we don't always approve of her respones to the situation, we can certainly sympathize with her situation.The sisters Pratt are the epitome of those with a tenuous hold on their place in society as ""gentlewomen"" without independent means who must make their own living as seamstresses.  Their secrets hold them hostage to the prejudices of society and shape their attitudes towards others.  They assume an arrogance toward people of lesser means, an obsequious manner toward those of greater and make every effort to ""get the goods"" on anyone of equal rank to have ammunition against them in case of need.  All of this makes them less than admirable individuals, yet their fear of falling into the lower ranks of society by virtue of their father's character is not without foundation.  Yet it is precisely their perpetuation of the prejudice and unfairness of their society that puts them in peril.  Many of their activities, however, make them more comedic figures than sinister ones, which gives them a certain grace despite themselves.  Their tendency not only to overdress but to do so identically, makes them seem a bit like a pair of court jesters!Just as with the Pratt sisters, Caroline, the multipara and expectant ""lost cause"" is delightful.  Her totally illogical approach to life and her optimism--if not totally realistic--are wonderful.  Her situation is virtually untenable, but she keeps going despite it.  If some of her schemes don't materialize, it is not without trying.  That she drinks is not surprising.  Certainly her alternative is dispair, depression, and probably suicide.  Her explanation for being in debtors court is brilliant and true, if not entirely honest, and leaves one thinking of ones own credit card debt and financial situation.  Her sense of being ""untouchable"" after winning her case, leading her to enlarge her indebtedness should remind us of ourselves.  Twister, the lazy husband of Queenie the beekeeper, is another comedic character.  One senses that his youthful self was probably far less pleasant, but that time and perhaps dementia have mellowed him out a lot.  Some of the most poignant scenes involve him and his wife.The rigidity of social class structure and the expectations made on the various strata of it are also made apparent through the expectations of the two villages.  The ""upper class"" town of Candleford attempts to defend its privileges and looks to the future with greater acceptance, while the working class town of Lark Rise attempts to demand its rights under the law and fights fiercely for respect of its simple dignity.  Having been on the short end of the stick for decades, if not centuries, it looks upon the approach of change with suspicion.  Yet beneath all of this rivalry, when the chips are down, each village comes to the aid of the other.A wonderful group of people to spend time with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQTUWEVF2SSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EWD0I6#wasThisHelpful","RMQTUWEVF2SSU","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book doesn't quite so much teach knitting as how knitting can affect ones life; connecting with the past, with family, with self, healing old wounds, beginning again, etc.  Some of the best and most quotable lines come from the introduction where the author compares the process of knitting to that of living life.  There are patterns, but they are not detailed; they are very general, so a beginner might find this book somewhat frustrating from the point of view of learning to knit.  Someone who already knows how to knit might find them less challenging.  More helpful is the author's discussion of how knitters feel about the product they make, what it means to them.

"I had not seen this film until I lived in Manhattan in the early 1990s.  This despite the fact that I was an avid fan of the cinema of the 1930s and 1940s.  Staring a delightful trio of character actors with long careers in film, Harry Carey, Aubrey Smith, and Charles Winninger, it may seem a mere vehical for these stars and probably was.  It also may seem somewhat light weight by modern standards, but it is still certainly a touching work, and far better than many ""made-for-TV"" holiday stories of more recent times.  I was taken by it immediately on first viewing.  It has since entered my 20 favorite holiday films collection, and I watch it every year.The story partakes a little of both the filmography and the style of the Topper films that preceded it by a couple of years.  The attraction of the film for me is the affection between two generations, that of the late 19th century just giving up their claim on the world and that of the early 20th century that was just inheriting it.  There is a great deal of nostalgia involved, that for the audience for which the film was made of course, but also inadvertently for later audiences for whom the attitudes and mores of the time are things of history now.A wonderful old film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23VBULN884GPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BSBBD0#wasThisHelpful","R23VBULN884GPG","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year as a personal tradition I watch about 20 movies I associate with the Christmas season.  This is one of my favorites.  Made in 1942, it was one from my parents' generation and familiar to me from TV reruns when I was a child, so it is very nostalgic for a time period and a season.  Holiday Inn is sort of the older version of White Christmas; it even features the holiday song.  It was made for a generation saying a spirited goodbye to the ""old world"" as it prepared to face a war that would change life forever.  Many of those who enjoyed the film in the theaters when it came out would never live to see its remake a decade later.The black and white film is a classic of the genre. While White Christmas depends heavily on color, contrast and saturation in its filmation, Holiday Inn creates its effects of elegance and emotion through great attention to texture, design and camera angle, creating a film that is even more sensually lush than the brightly colored later film.The musical features a reworking of some old songs, familiar to those alive at the time, and the introduction of new ones that have since become holiday favorites.  The comedy team features song man Crosby as it did later in White Christmas, but here his sneaky side-kick is the brilliant dance man, Fred Astaire.  As in the later movie, Crosby is about to lose the girl but manages to pull the coal out of the fire at the end by being the ""nice guy.""  The film is filled with songs that feature his very recognizable voice.  Almost everyone still recognizes his White Christmas when it is played during the holidays even today, and it is often featured as virtually iconic of the season in modern films.  Some of the dance routines by Astaire are considered classics now, like the ""firecracker"" tap dance and the very famous ""drunk"" dance.  While they probably seem tame by comparison to the more athletic and acrobatic choreography of the present, for the time they definitely pushed the creative envelope.  Anyone who appreciates ""Dancing with the Stars"" will definitely enjoy some of the dances that were at the root of the ""classic"" ballroom styles.The film again features the concept of an inn as a venue for the action, though it is now Crosby who is the owner, rather than the retired general as in White Christmas.  World War II, for the United States at least, had just begun, and there is a musical number regarding ""Freedom"" that emphasizes the military aspect of protecting it for the US and for others.  In this vein, the film White Christmas is a logical remake of Holiday Inn for a post-war audience.Christmas is not the main focus of the story, as it is in the other film, but the holidays in general and Christmas especially are brilliantly represented in set and song.  The patronizing racial attitudes of the period and certainly the ""blackface"" musical vignette will probably set a modern person's teeth on edge during the Lincoln's Birthday routine, but for the time it was probably considered very ""tolerant.""  It is certainly a positive measuring stick of our social progress over the past 70 years. My favorite of the routines is the rather slap stick minuet for Washington's Birthday.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6D8NDKM3DG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I0QL82#wasThisHelpful","R1I6D8NDKM3DG3","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first saw this film as a TV rerun as a kid, and enjoyed the post war ambiance, the costumes and the dance.  It has since become one of the 20 or so films I watch every year at Christmas time as a matter of personal tradition.The film is typical for the time, 1950s, with wonderful costumes, especially for women.  The music is Irving Berlin classic and enhances the winter concept and the Christmas holiday especially.  The colors are intense and designers and filmographers have obviously gone to considerable effort to create eye pleasing contrasts.Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby were wonderfully paired.  The combo of Hope and Crosby established Crosby as the straight man in a comedy duo, On the Road With Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Collection (Road to Singapore/Road to Zanzibar/Road to Morocco/Road to Utopia), and Danny Kaye had a brilliant career as a funny man, The Court Jester, Inspector General (1949).  Their pairing seems almost inevitable.  While I could see Kaye guilting out Crosby over a broken arm suffered while ""saving his life,"" I couldn't really see Hope in that role.  Their two styles of comedy were different.  Kaye's slightly sly comedy was perfect for the part.  Though I know Crosby was often the ""handsome"" man in many of his films, I've never really thought of him as such; but his staring opposite the very gifted singer Rosemary Clooney (George's aunt, I believe) seemed to be perfect.  Certainly their duets worked well, and his often bewildered or knowing expressions were a perfect foil for Clooney's irritation.For dances, Kaye and Vera Ellen were perfect choices.  They looked like they'd been dancing together for years, and there was no sense that either was trying to dominate the scene.  Though the routines are probably pretty meek and tame by ""Dancing with the Stars"" comparison, they are still classics for the 1950s.  I particularly enjoyed the choreography that featured Vera Ellen as its focus.  Her athletic talents and tiny figure were very well presented.The story itself is charming and so era appropriate.  The notion of a family gathering in front of the TV set to watch a variety show together is so 1950s and also much a part of my own childhood.  The war was still recent enough for people to remember it vividly and yet distant enough for them to have lost contact with those with whom they had served and from whom they thought they could never part.  The series M. A. S.H., M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection, captures some of the types of expriences that created these types of intense relationships.  There was a sepia tinted nostalgia among those who had served, that I recognized even from my father's own stories of his war time experiences.The movie manages to capture that era's sense that life would never be as intense or as purposeful and important as it had been during the war.  It wraps it up in pretty ribbon and surrounds it in snow, making it a perfect holiday film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAIN1ZBS5GDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YNIX#wasThisHelpful","R2EAIN1ZBS5GDG","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually saw this when it was first aired on TV, so when I realized I could get it on DVD, I had to have it to add to my Christmas collection of films for the holiday.  Every year I watch a set of some 20 films at Christmas time that has become a personal tradition.  Not all of them are specifically about the holiday, but many of them are set during Christmas or are about the underlying spirit of the holiday.  For me the Grinch is very much part of that.The DVD version appears--at least to me--much as it did when it first came out.  The cartoon setting is very minimalist in character, in keeping with the tradition of animation during the 60s as developed by Hannah Barbara, for cartoons like Yogi Bear and Huckelberry Hound, and in stark contrast to some of that featured earlier in the genera, like Mickey Mouse, the Old Farmer, and others.  The setting is less cluttered with detail, and features broad blocks of color that give an impression of content and emotive character and delight the eye.  There is not the slightest attempt at creating ""reality,"" which makes the magic of the story acceptable even to the most pragmatic.Boris Karloff does the narrative and is the speaking voice of the Grinch.  They couldn't have selected a better actor for the role.  My mother once told me that a record company that featured stories for children had asked the man to narrate some of them, but that they had so scared the children that they failed miserably.  She said she saw him once when we lived in California, and he seemed like a lovely, grandfatherly old gentleman who wouldn't scare a fly!  This combination of the scary voice and the lovely, old grandfather seems to come across brilliantly in his narration of the Grinch story.The music is simple and memorable.  Who can't remember at least a few lines of ""You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch?""  The poetry by Suess is wonderful, well rhymed and tempoed work with wildly improbable words and great pairs of lines that give punch to the meaning of the words.My favorite character is and always has been the little bewildered dog.  How cute.  That single much pruned horn tied to his head to make him look like a ""reindeer"" is just wonderful, especially when viewed frontally!  And his manful and surprisingly successful attempts to move the huge sleigh uphill in deep snow is also delightful.  I'd watch the film just for the little dog!Especially for young children, the rather unthreatening ""villain,"" his reclamation at the end, and the underlying theme that Christmas ""doesn't come in a bag"" makes the Grinch a wonderful choice for family holiday films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0FD8WVL680K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JUFPUE#wasThisHelpful","RP0FD8WVL680K","AXSH6O4OP5L4M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXSH6O4OP5L4M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book succeeds in spite of Jerome Corsi's bland, drier-than-dust reporting.  It succeeds because the actual facts of the Siege of Bastogne are interesting.  Outmanned, outgunned, and completely surrounded, Brig. General Anthony McAuliffe gives Hitler a famous one-word answer when asked to surrender:  ""Nuts!""  With that one gutsy word, history was made and The Battle of the Bulge was won.  World War II history doesn't get much better than this.

Marshall, who recorded the major players' accounts soon after the battle, this book would be a complete snore.  Corsi is clearly not a writer's writer.  He lacks the elegance and finesse of other historical writers, such as Erik Larson and David McCullough.  Despite all this, he gets the job done, barely.  The story itself really is worth the effort to read.  One can't help but be humbled and grateful for the many sacrifices made by the soldiers who served during the Siege.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3089K4UEAZV6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595555218#wasThisHelpful","R3089K4UEAZV6U","ALJV92MSX4D9W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALJV92MSX4D9W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed with these individually sized bottles.  I live at a very high elevation and my optometrist recommends his patients take up to two drops 4x a day.  I found myself going through 2 or 3 of these individual bottles daily.  The box definitely did not last more than a couple of weeks.  Also, it was hard to get all the drops out of the bottle.  I do like the actual drops themselves, though - they worked great at keeping my eyes moist at high altitude.

"Best sleep of my life with this mask!  100% real silk - will not irritate sensitive skin.  Adjustable headband for perfect fit.  I've tried other sleep masks and they all fall off my face at some point during the night, but this one didn't.  Incredibly comfortable; I can't even feel it on my face, and I'm very sensitive to pressure of any kind.  The mask comes with a double-teabag looking pouch filled with real lavender petals, which you slip into a pocket on the back of the mask, right on the forehead (above the nose, where the ""3rd eye"" might be).  It is very lightweight and does not change the feel of the mask in any way.  The petals release a very subtle fragrance.  My only complaint is that there are no instructions on where to obtain replacement lavender pouches once the scent fades (or the pouch rips), and I could not find replacement pouches on Amazon.  I suppose you could replace the original pouch with actual tea bags.  Traditional Medicinals makes a lavender chamomile tea that would probably work just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHN18QH4R0MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYUQEM8#wasThisHelpful","R1QHN18QH4R0MI","ALJV92MSX4D9W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALJV92MSX4D9W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maureen Caudill is a classically trained physicist and computer programmer-turned-psychic, a topic she discusses in her previous book, Suddenly Psychic.  With Impossible Realities, she's culled through all of the relevant clinical research related to what she calls ""black swan phenomena"" and presents the reader with the most tightly-controlled, well-respected scientific studies that support the existence of psychic phenomena.  These include psychokinesis, remote viewing, energy healing, telepathy, animal telepathy, precognition, survival after death, and reincarnation.  The idea is that even if everyone is told, and believes, that swans only come in white, it only takes the existence of a single black swan to disprove that mistaken belief.  This, then, is her premise: that it only takes a single well-designed, well-executed double-blind study in order to prove that psychic phenomena is at least possible and not to be discounted by the scientific community.  This is smart, considering the dearth of good studies out there.  Caudill is obviously very bright.  She writes well, with a sense of self-deprecating humor, and the subject matter is far from boring.  The scientific studies she highlights in the book are definitely intriguing.  I just wish there were more studies to further bolster her case.  But, that's her point: more studies are needed, and scientists shouldn't shy away from this stuff.  Is there enough evidence presented in this book to persuade an avowed non-believer to change course and bring all their scientific thinking and technology to bear on such a controversial subject?  I'd like to think so.  I'd like to think that science is catching up with the mainstream public's growing interest in this subject and that their fossilized theories yet contain room for further exploration, but I remain skeptical of the open-mindedness of the professional skeptics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUQQ3FOYBFTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1571746633#wasThisHelpful","RXUQQ3FOYBFTR","ALJV92MSX4D9W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALJV92MSX4D9W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I truly did not think that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.  I had heard great things about it, but I was initially biased against it because it's self-published.  Stupid, I know.  Still, I took a chance... and immediately had to buy all 3 in the series.  I couldn't put it down and read all 3 books in a week.  Killing Hope is so much darker and twisted than anything you'd normally think of as a thriller.  At the end of every chapter, I found myself saying, ""That is so F'd up!""  There isn't a whole lot I can say about the plot without ruining it for you, except that police detective Gabe Quinn chases a sadistic serial killer from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.  Everything else about it was a surprise twist.  I haven't read any interviews with the author, but, based on the structure of this novel, I'd have to guess that he wrote two or three prequels to Killing Hope, unpublished in the US, and then basically rewrote them before publishing this book.  I don't see how else he could have conceived of the extremely complex structure of this book.  Plus, there is a lot of backstory here - references to previously solved cases that led up to this one.  For example, when and how did Gabe Quinn get the nickname of Celebrity Cop?  He apparently solved a case and wrote a book about it while the killer was in prison.  This is referred to a lot as something that happened in the past, and yet that actual case is nowhere in the 3 Gabe Quinn novels published in the US.

"The premise was great:  one legendary financial trader bet another that he could ""raise traders like they raise turtles in Singapore.""  To this end, a small group of students was chosen to participate in the experiment to determine whether great traders are born or made.  Known as ""the Turtles,"" the students spent a month learning from the best all the tools and tricks of the trade.  The top-earning Turtle, 19-year-old Curtis Faith, made more than $30M in just over four years, but even he concludes that great traders are both born AND made, not either/or.  Faith's book, Way of the Turtle, aims to reveal how the Turtles made money, why some Turtles were more successful than others, and how you can apply the Turtle Way to your own trades.  Well, let's just say that Faith is a much better trader than an author.  He talks ""about"" how the turtles made money, but doesn't get into specifics.  As for why some Turtles did better than others, the answer seems to be to just follow the rules and don't overthink it.  The rules, however, are incredibly vague.  As for how to apply these teachings to your own trading, well, I did not find a single useable nugget of specific information here.  Honestly, except for the intriguing back-story of the bet and the triumph of Faith as the underdog in the class (he being the youngest and least experienced), I don't see why Van Tharp calls this ""one of the five best trading books ever written.""  For me, it was a cute little story, but I didn't learn anything.  You'd be better off reading Tharp's ""Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom"" or Stan Weinstein's ""Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWGGM4K5RPYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=007148664X#wasThisHelpful","R2CWGGM4K5RPYH","ALJV92MSX4D9W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALJV92MSX4D9W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this stuff because I saw a video on how much it foams up. The more suds, the better as it lifts and carries away dirt. Since it foams so much, you don't need to use much, about 2oz in a 5 gallon bucket for me. I also use it in my Gilmour Foamaster foam gun to presoak my car with foam. After rinsing that off, I sponge wash, then soak in foam once more with the foam gun then rinse. Great results, and the foam gun doesn't really use a lot of water so I don't feel bad about water waste. It smells like honeydew, obviously.

I've washed them on hot, with a little TSP and detergent and had good results. The included cleaner is great for prewashing/soaking.

"This is a very good laser measure, with some great features, but also a couple of minor shortcomings.The pros are:Small, lightweight.Very easy to use.Uses readily available AAA batteries.Comes with a holster.""Signal strength"" indicator (how well it can read the laser beam from a surface).Backlit screen with battery level indicator.Minor shortcomings are:Can only measure a minimum distance of 8"".No angle measurement (inclinometer).No 1/4x20 threaded mount.The shortcomings aren't much, and really the biggest one is the minimum distance it can measure. Also, the accuracy is +/- 1/8"", a little ""loose"" in terms of accuracy. Overall though, I think this is a good product especially for a DIY or casual user. It can measure in feet (fractions and decimal), inches, and meters. It will do area and volume as well, and store the last 10 measurements. I think the price is a *tad bit* on the high side, but then again the pros/cons balance it out.

This combo kit is great, and although I'd guess probably aimed more toward DIY types, would work equally well for professionals also.The compressor is compact, relatively lightweight, and has two ports which is a great convenience. Being oil-less, it is rather loud, however. I used to have a Hitachi 6gal pancake compressor, and it was definitely quieter. This one goes up to 150psi though, so that means it'll cycle less frequently. The included hose is light and flexible, and for most applications the 25ft length should work fine, though I use a 50ft polyurethane hose.The 18ga brad nailer works great. It had no trouble sinking the included brads into hard maple, and certainly no trouble with pine. It's a *bit* heavy for what it is, heavier than my Paslode. However, I think this one is built more stoutly.The 16ga finish nailer is great tool as well. I LOVE the tool free jam clearing ability. I found the depth adjustment needed a plier to move at first, but it was probably just over tightened at the factory. This had no trouble sinking the included nails all the way into hardwoods, and I found the arrows on the rubber pad helpful for placing nails.The stapler is the only tool I am not as fond of in the kit, though that's not to say I don't like it. I had a strange issue with it. Setting the compressor to 100psi (max pressure for this tool), after shooting a staple, then trying to shoot another it wouldn't go into the wood. The pressure on the regulated gauge showed 60psi. At this setting the tool failed to work properly. After raising the regulated pressure to about 130psi, it shot multiple staples fine. I didn't have any problems with the nailers when the compressor was set to 100psi. The stapler is great for upholstery, securing tar paper, and things like that. It uses T50 type staples, which are widely available in different lengths and metal types.The fit and finish of all items in this kit are very good, and from my experience typical of Bostich quality. The tools have a 7 year warranty, the compressor I am not sure of, but I'd say it has to be at least a year. Stapler made in Taiwan, brad and finish nailers made in China, and compressor made in USA. This kit is a really great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MB6OX6MNX0HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNM60C#wasThisHelpful","R1MB6OX6MNX0HR","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll be blunt and say right off the bat that these LED bulbs impressed me.Now, here is more. The light color, or 4000K temp. of the bulbs is, for me, absolutely perfect. Not yellow at all, and not blue at all. A nice, clean, crisp WHITE light. The size and look of the bulbs essentially mimics old incandescent bulbs. This isn't too important for me, but it's nice none the less. The output of light by these IS more than the 23W CFL they replaced. Not only was this perceived output, but verified by a lumen lux meter. I measured light output in three placed, all the same distance, and one of these put out more light than the CFL they replaced. Not a huge difference, but definitely more. The CFL was 3500K. The power draw for this bulb is about 10W measured with a Kill-A-Watt. They also don't get as hot as a CFL, as measured by a non contact IR thermometer.I installed a ""Y"" adapter in my light fixture so I could put two of these in. I like LOTS of light. Now my room looks like a bright sunny day. So, two of these bulbs consume about 20W, 3W less than the CFL, are 500K more in color temperature, don't get as hot, go on instantly, and don't give off UV. The real test will be longevity, and hope they last at least 5 years. At about 7.50 each as of this writing, they are a great value as well.I am very pleased with these bulbs, and hope they offer 100W equivalent versions soon. Highly recommend these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HO8UC5313RF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2MD2UW#wasThisHelpful","R3HO8UC5313RF7","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another cool toy in the Fisher-Price Imaginext line of DC comics super friends. It's got features to keep young boys (and girls) entertained, and goes well with the other toys in the series. There's a couple of LED lights that light up when the eyes open, and the snake slithers as the elevators rises and lowers. There are some swords and projectiles too. The toy doesn't have any sounds like the Joker's laff factory that's also a part of this series and that's too bad.

"Bless the inventor(s) of this type tool. These are extremely handy, versatile tools that every DIY person and contractor should have. Bosch doesn't disappoint with this one. Typical top notch fit and finish, and thoughtful engineering from Bosch. The quick release feature is NICE, and holds TIGHT. The variable speed is also nice, and a must. A long (13.6 foot) cord is always a plus. The motor is plenty powerful and I have not found the tool lacking. To be honest it IS a little heavy, so for prolonged overhead work it would get tiring, but otherwise I haven't had an issue. It can be a little noisy but I almost always use ear protection with power tools, so not a huge factor. This kit comes with a good mix of accessories, but most are sanding pads so bear that in mind. I use only Bosch accessories so I can't speak to fitment and compatibility with other brands. A nice accessory box as well as a carrying bag round out a great kit. I got the depth stop too, which is handy.

"My wife changes the case on her phone as much as she changes her shoes, so she thought these would be great. They are so-so. They're soft and provide protection, but in my opinion no where near that of a firmly fitted case like a Spigen. These fit rather loosely. There's ten of them to a package and it came with two plastic screen protectors. Decent product, but my wife is ""eh"" about them now and I wouldn't trust my phone to one personally.EDIT:I am copying and pasting a comment from the manufacturer for posterity:Hi Gauda!So sorry to hear your cases aren't fitting as snug as they should be!

"I really like this book. I have two other books on kitchen cabinets, and while both of those books provide good information (I have no regrets buying them), I like this one the best. The author does a very, very good job of explaining the building process and devotes a lot of time to the organization process. He tells you why it should be done, why it's important, and what can happen if you don't do it. The other books by Udo Schmidt and Randy Johnson don't really delve too much into this. What the other books lack is real information on European or frameless style cabinets. This book has far more information on that subject, which is of particular interest to me.Yes, this book is a bit dated in some aspects (like using biscuit joinery instead of pocket screws or Dominos) but the illustrations are well done. I wish the photographs were color, but this is a small thing and doesn't really impact the book. I really suggest this book for anyone wanting to build cabinets but honestly would say that it would be good to get the ones from the authors mentioned above as well (Building Kitchen Cabinets -Schmidt and How To Make Kitchen Cabinets -Johnson). One can never have too much information and each book is a valuable resource.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCGI9T1VEWHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565238036#wasThisHelpful","RGCGI9T1VEWHW","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BLU products did a great job with this phone. It's super thin and light (more so on both than an S5) with a sleek look. Setting it up is as easy as any Android phone. Just pop in your SIM card (don't lose the tiny key for the SIM door), activate with your carrier, and sign in with your Google account. The display is really, really nice. Crisp and bright. Sound was clear and without issues. I thought the camera took pictures of good quality too.Bear in mind, this is NOT an LTE phone, but it will work on 4G (and 3G and lower) network signals. Frankly, this isn't that big a deal as the difference between 4G and 4G-LTE isn't as significant as say, the difference between 3G and 4G. This phone is also a little slow due to only 1GB of RAM. Keep in mind though, that those are the compromises for a phone that costs only 200 bucks. It really isn't fair to compare this phone to flagship products from Apple or Samsung that cost 3 or 4 times as much. This phone holds its own for the most part even against those phones I'd say.Another thing I really liked about this phone was that it came with a TPU case and a screen protector (plastic) in the box. Of course, it included a charger and ear buds too.

"Got this for my mom, and she likes it a lot. She wanted a case that would protect her phone while it's in her purse, and this fits the bill perfectly. Clasp is magnetic and keeps the case firmly closed. The TPU wrap around case fits perfectly and the cut outs are spot on. About the only thing I can say is the molding isn't perfectly smooth around the top part near the screen, it feels a little ""rough"" but for twelve bucks (as of this writing) I can't knock off a star.

"I found this stuff to work pretty well. My car doesn't have too much leather, but after using it on the steering wheel and shift knob I was disgusted at the amount of filth that it took off. I used it on my leather couches also and it did a good job cleaning and conditioning them too. It's as easy as spraying some on the microfiber cloth, rubbing the leather, then buffing it off with a clean microfiber. I sprayed some directly on the leather in the more soiled areas. If your car is all leather you'll probably go through a third to half a bottle of this in one use, so it probably won't last that long. I actually liked the scent of it, smells somewhat like leather itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYC9RM0VJR2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00247DI3I#wasThisHelpful","R3FYC9RM0VJR2N","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice wax that gives a deep gloss. Very slick surface once buffed off. Also, buffing it off is not that difficult at all which is always a plus. The scent is pleasent as well. Most of these waxes I've used, carnauba based, and in this price range last me about 3-4 months in southern CA. I would have given it five stars but I really don't like the small container. It makes getting the wax on the applicator a pain. The Griot's Garage wax is in a large tin and there's no problem getting the wax on the applicator.

"I think wireless charging will be more and more common, I wouldn't be surprised if phones come with wireless chargers from the OEM within the next couple of years and cases become more common for them.This charger is great in that works and works well for what it does. It doesn't come with a plug, you supply that but it does come with a USB cable. The stand itself is sleek and nice looking. When the special included case is on the phone the magnet on it securely holds the phone. Charging takes as long but not longer than plugging in the phone, at least in my observation. As far as the technology and how well this works, that's all good. So why only four stars?The case is the issue here. The included case must be used so the phone can charge on the stand. The problem is that the case doesn't offer much protection for the phone, and what protection it does offer is not so great. There are a lot of notches and cut outs instead of more precise cuts and molding. Also, the sides of the phone are barely covered by the case. However, the greatest problem is that the bottom portion adds quite a lot of extra length to the phone. It makes the phone with the case really, just...bulky. It's impractical to change cases every time you want to wirelessly charge your phone, if you're going to do that then might as well plug it in. Also, for a day to day case this one is sorely lacking in protection.I gave this four stars essentially because of the case. everything else about this product is good but the case really needs some refinement and R&D. Once improved, or more aftermarket cases come out that are wireless charging capable I think this would be a great product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1KSITGJDB7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WK5I2#wasThisHelpful","RA1KSITGJDB7H","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great, low cost scale that looks really nice and would blend in with pretty much any decor. Set up is easy, pull the plastic tab from the battery compartment (I had to unscrew the cover, no bid deal) and put your foot on it and press with force until you see units. It's ready to go and weigh you. If the scale moves or is bumped, it needs to be initialized in the same way, press with some force and wait for units.As far as the calories and BMI calculations, I tried it but found the feature kind of pointless. I mean, there's a lot more to calorie intake than just maintaining your weight. There are  A LOT of variables. If you're an athlete you may need 4,000 calories a day or more. If you're a sedentary person who doesn't exercise you may need less than what the scale tells you. BMI isn't a foolproof indicator of healthy weight either necessarily.Setting up that feature isn't hard, and there's an instruction manual that explains it. Personally, I use the scale as just a scale and found it compared to my other scale within half a pound (or less since my other scale goes in half pound increments). I think for the thirty bucks this is a nice looking, accurate, and good scale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9UPUDXTUVLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK7FEYU#wasThisHelpful","R3D9UPUDXTUVLY","A1LOENXGC0WRI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LOENXGC0WRI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those things that's better to purchase locally because shipping can and will damage it. Mine arrived broken in half, and I didn't want to hassle with a return/exchange so I used some epoxy and glued it back together. It worked out fine for my small job, and the thing itself worked well. The price has nearly doubled since I bought it a week ago, and it's no longer such a good value.

"Long dark winter days.  Cabin fever.  Snowed in.  No activity.  Kids climbing the walls.  What to do...We're all heading into the basement where we have collected fun games over the years, like an air hockey table, Foosball, electronic darts, an electronic basketball hoop....and now our new addition, the light-up lawn darts game.  It is a blast in the basement (although we keep a little bit of lighting on).  This is so much fun, and really adds a unique game to break up our wintertime boredom.Here are a few tips that may help you.1)  We put a few streaks of glow-in-the-dark paint on the rings, to brighten them up a bit, and it worked wonderfully. We got this super bright green glow in the dark paint for about $10 here on Amazon and it worked great:  Ultra Green V10 Glow in the Dark Paint 1/2Oz2)  Don't give a second thought to replacing the batteries.  It's easy.  I buy all my replacement button batteries from Amazon.  In fact, these lawn darts take the LR41 batteries, which you can get from Amazon for about $13-14 for 50 of them:  50 Pack Maxell LR41 AG3 192 button cell battery ""NEW HOLOGRAM PACKAGE "" or if you prefer to buy 10 of them for about $6, you can get these:  Maxell Watch Battery Button Cell LR41 AG3 192 Pack of 10 Batteries.3) If you need replacement parts, which is honestly unlikely, as these things are sturdy as heck.  And if you need information on replacement parts, you can email:  replacementparts@franklinsports.com  or you can call 1-781-341-5178.Thanks for reading my review.

"Hospital days.  Long days keeping track of a million things in between a bunch of medical appointments for family members.  No pockets or worse, shallow pockets that a phone easily slides out of.  Hanging onto a phone but needing both hands so you set the phone down for a second that turns into ""where did I leave my phone?""Perfect solution?  Use this armband to hang onto your phone and keep it close the entire day.  Yes, it looks ridiculous as you wear it like a giant watch (pictures will be posted soon).  But who cares if it looks silly, as opposed to losing it or stressing out trying to keep track of your phone all day.  And actually, if you have a good sense of humor, like we do, it's a great conversation piece.It is comfortable, and unlike the athletes that did reviews, sweating isn't a problem when you keep your phone on your wrist like a giant watch.  It is SO PERFECT that I wish I'd thought of doing this a long time ago.  It fits wonderfully, is comfortable and not bothersome at all.  It is the perfect solution, and not just for long hospital days with the family.  It is great for those of us that have difficulty walking.  When you leave your phone in one room, and drag yourself to another room, then you realize you left your phone in the first room....well, it takes energy and increases your pain when you have to make an extra trip just to retrieve your phone.  Not to mention the whole ""where did I leave it?"" mini-game that you have to play in order to find it, which may or may not include calling your cell from a landline in order to locate it.I ended up getting these for my elderly mother, who keeps forgetting where she set her phone down, as well as a couple other family members that have similar problems keeping track of their phones.  We all have the Samsung Galaxy S5 phone, and it's a perfect fit.Thanks for reading my review.

"My mom collects angels, and my grandma (her mom) collected bells.  Since my grandma passed on, my mom has missed her terribly.  When I saw this beautiful Lenox figurine that is both an angel and a bell, I thought it would be the perfect gift for my mom, in honor of both of them.  I plan on giving it to her before the holidays, though, so she can enjoy it longer.  I get tears in my eyes every time I think of how touched she'll be with this lovely remembrance of her mother, my dear grandma.To make it an even more perfect gift, it's a Lenox.  The Lenox brand has always meant high quality, beautiful keepsakes.  Both my mom and my grandma have always loved Lenox keepsakes. One of the reasons we love the Lenox brand is that they have a way of making their keepsakes look delicate and fragile but in fact they are very solid and well-made, and they definitely stand the test of time.  Lenox included a red ribbon that is meant to go through the angel's halo to hang it on a tree.  If you don't have pets or kids that might disturb the tree, then it would probably be safe to hang, and would look beautiful.  We tend to be more cautious about these things, though, and would prefer to display it on a shelf or in a curio cabinet.  It's up to you, but it is a nice option that Lenox included the high-quality red ribbon, just in case you choose to hang it on your tree.I want to emphasize that this beautiful angel bell is sturdier than it looks, and Lenox makes long-lasting, high-quality keepsakes that will definitely stand the test of time.

"FINALLY, a headset that is super-comfortable and works great!  I have tried several different headsets, and I'll admit I tried the cheapo way first, at the recommendation of fellow gamers.  I bought a $12 headset, highly recommended, and the microphone was spotty and then just died.  Bought a second set, different brand, for $15, and they died 40 days into it  (Amazon and the third party sellers usually have a 30-day return, and my karma usually means that the item will die after 31+ days).After asking around some more, and reading reviews, we finally decided to give these Turtle Beach ones a try, and WOW!  We are thrilled with them.  The sound quality on our end is superb, and everyone says they hear us perfectly.  We love having a switch for the volume and a mute button, on a solid little rectangular panel along the cord.In addition, the different colors are a nice feature, especially since we now have three headsets in the house because we liked them so much!  Having the different colors means no fighting over which headset belongs to which kid.  That brings me to another point:  these are really solid and sturdy, and have held up wonderfully with kid-use and gaming.Highly highly highly recommend this Turtle Beach headset.  Goodness, talk about burying the lead.  I should have started with the fact that these are made by the well-known and reliable Turtle Beach brand.  Yes, I paid a bit more than I did for the $12 random ones that pooped out on us after a month, but it is well worth the extra money to know that you have a quality headset backed by Turtle Beach, a well-known company with high quality products.

"I hate writing negative reviews, but there is no way around it with this particular item.  I have knee troubles which make it hard to get up from a seated position, so I use a raised toilet seat.  In addition, my mother had hip surgery recently, and is with me a lot, so we both have experience with this seat.First off, the arm rests are ridiculously short.  Yes, they are there for you to grab when you are getting up, but they are also there to provide a more comfortable seated experience, AND to keep those with balance issues from tipping over.  I have no idea why the manufacturers would put the arm rests so low.  Even in using them to hang onto and lift yourself up, it is awkward having to reach down so low to use them to get up.  We had a super-comfortable raised toilet seat already on the toilet, but after several years, even with regular cleanings, it was just time for a new one.  This Drive Medical one looked very similar, so we ordered it and installed it.  Since this wasn't our first seat of this type, we can speak from experience that this is one of the most UNcomfortable seats ever.It's not just the super-low arm rests that make this seat uncomfortable, but the seat itself is not contoured as comfortably as it should be.  I'm going to get some pictures to add to this review when I can, but the back part of it is very narrow, and that makes it painful (yes, painful) to sit on.  The one we previously used was contoured so well in the right spots that it was still comfortable to sit on.  This Drive Medical seat, however, is not contoured enough, and it feels incredibly hard and painful to sit on.Here's the embarrassing part (what has my life become that what I'm about to tell you is even more embarrassing than describing what a disappointment our new raised toilet seat has been!).  I skipped the most important step of choosing my purchase and didn't read the reviews of this before I ordered it.  Can you believe that?  I review my purchases for Amazon because I try to share my buying experiences in the hopes it'll help someone else make more informed choices.  And in this case, I totally dropped the ball and didn't check out the reviews.  So it's my own fault that I'm stuck with a super-uncomfortable seat, until I can find one that I like better, or figure out how to get a duplicate of the one we just got rid of.  So color me embarrassed for making a bad purchasing decision by skipping the reviews, but I sure hope that THIS review will help someone to make a good decision and skip this particular seat.  I sure wish I had.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRORGHUQ22KZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VWJYVG#wasThisHelpful","RRORGHUQ22KZN","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This multi-cooker has changed my life.  As much as I love to cook, and I love to make a variety of delicious meals for my family and friends, it has become a big ordeal with lots of pots and pans and a lot of prep and clean-up.  I just don't have the time or energy for that anymore, and when I had the chance to get a Phillips Multi-Cooker, I jumped on it.  I am absolutely thrilled with it.  One thing that I absolutely MUST have when it comes to a kitchen item is that it has to be easy to clean, and 99% of the time, needs to be dishwasher-safe, or I just really don't want it.  The cooking pan inside it is removable and dishwasher-safe.You can read the technical details about this above in the description, but let me just tell you that there is not much you'd want to do to prepare a dish that this crafty little cooker can't do.  One drawback for some people might be the size.  It's not huge, but I've cooked quite a lot of food in it.The instruction booklet and the recipe booklet are both user-friendly, and I highly recommend searching online for more multi-cooker recipes.  From the included book, you HAVE to make the Chocolate Cake (YES, it makes cakes!!).  I've made everything from stews to chicken teriyaki to amazing rice dishes, and more.If you have gotten bored with what you usually cook, try the Phillips Multi-Cooker.If your have downsized kitchen space and need an appliance with a lot of bang for the buck, get the Phillips Multi-Cooker.If you have physical/medical limitations and you can't zip around the kitchen like you used to, try the Phillips Multi-Cooker.I could go on and on, but let me just say again that this has changed my life, and I'm thrilled with it.  I have experimented with it for awhile now, and waited to do my review when I had a substantial amount of experience with it.I highly recommend this incredible sous chef appliance, and I hope you enjoy it as much as we have.

"These worked just as well as the more-famous Depend brand, but were a more economical purchase.  According to my aunt and mother who both tested these for me, they did the job just as well as the bigger brands, and in some ways were actually more comfortable.  These were more cottony-feeling instead of plastic-y feeling and that made a huge difference in the comfort level.  They both mentioned that these Always brand underwear seemed cooler and smoother on the skin, which were both huge benefits.  Trying these actually converted both of them over from the Depend brand to Always, because of the comfort level.  Also, they held up better at the elastic around the legs and kept the rest of them dry.

"OK, we had a problem in our house that we didn't think there was a solution for, so we just accepted it.  This handy little device actually solves that problem, even though I'm embarrassed to admit that when I ordered it I actually thought it did something else entirely!  So here's the scoop.I love to listen to the audio of the TV shows being watched by the rest of the family, while I'm fixing dinner or taking care of other things in the house.  It's relaxing for me.  Sometimes music does that for me, but more frequently my mind needs other things to think about, and TV or movie dialogue does it.  By hooking this gadget to the TV or stereo speakers, then pairing it with my smartphone, I can carry my phone around the house with me while listening to whatever is on TV, or I can put some of my own shows on to listen to.  This really makes time move faster for me, and I love it.

"As far as shaving, this shaver gets 5 stars.  It's smooth, the smoothest shave ever.  But the inconvenience and lack of reliability for the cleaning system forces me to go with 4 stars, along with the bulkiness of the charging base.  It's like real estate:  location, location, location.  Whether it's in the bathroom, where counter space is limited, or in the suitcase, where it's also limited, this just doesn't work out to as much of a convenience as we expected.But that can still be worth dealing with if you like the smooth shave so much.  There's one big caveat with that, however.  If you have sensitive skin like he does, then this may not be the shaver for you.  When the razor pulls up the hair to cut it, you kind of have to push it a little harder onto the skin.  So  if you have sensitive skin, or any bumps, etc., on your face, then you'll have to deal with that as well.I definitely am not trying to talk you out of ordering it.  It's a great razor.  If space isn't a problem for you at home or on the road, then that's a non-issue.  If you don't have sensitive skin, then that's a non-issue, too.  Without those two issues, I would highly highly recommend getting it.  If you have to deal with either of those factors, then you'll have to make your own judgment.Sure hope this review helps someone decide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231AIMJ1A3YEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","R231AIMJ1A3YEF","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our whole family wears these as sleep shirts.  They are super comfortable and you can't beat the price.  They last forever, and it doesn't matter how many wash cycles we've put them through, they don't get thin or worn out.  They still look fine, and more importantly, they feel great.As far as size, of course these definitely shrink some when you wash them, between the hot water during washing and the heat of the dryer, but we all know that is common for cotton.  We like our sleep clothes loose and comfy, so we buy big enough sizes that even after shrinking some they are still bigger and feel great.We may be wearing Grandpa's undershirts, but we are sleeping like babies!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R219XQJIRGVLUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSRU2JS#wasThisHelpful","R219XQJIRGVLUX","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a lot of the toilet ""drops"" that you put in the tank, and I'm most satisfied with these Clorox ones.

Of course, I love the Clorox toilet bowl cleaner  Clorox Toilet Bowl Cleaner With Bleach Rain Clean Scent Bottle 24 Oz, 2-Pack  that you squirt in the bowl and clean with a brush.

"We have been Avery product users for years, and like many other people, know we can count on Avery to bring us high-quality products that last a long time.  These Avery Labels are no exception.  We had a laminating machine that just died on us recently, and we really didn't want to replace it because our need for laminated items wasn't that high.  At the same time, we weren't happy with the unprofessional look of printed labels with tape over them.  So what to do?  These Avery Self-Laminating labels are the perfect solution.

"I put this on my kitchen floor right away.  I had separately ordered one for my mother who was recovering from a broken hip, surgery, and lots of physical rehab.  So we tested ours out at the same time.  There are two cautions to note, first.  One thing that's really important to know is that if you ""shuffle"" when you walk, maybe because you can't lift your feet up with each step, then be careful of tripping when you go to step onto this pad.  It has really nice, gently-angled edges, so that it's not a big step up or step down, but for someone who shuffles, it can still trip you up.  The second caution is that the gently-angled edges are kind of slippery, so in bare feet or socks, you may slip on it easily.  With the traction of shoes, that would be no problem.  So with those two cautions out of the way, let's get on to the positives.My mother and I, as well as other family members, definitely felt that this mat does indeed take pressure off your feet and back when you have to be standing, and does as promised as far as lessening fatigue while standing.  You can't underestimate how much this helps those of us with any kind of foot, leg, or back pain.  It's not a magic carpet, so to speak, and it won't cure all that ails you, but it definitely can lessen the pressure and pain that you may be dealing with.  Those of us without ailments already, with healthy backs and legs, found it to be more comfortable and less tiring than the plain hard floor.  It feels like memory foam might be inside it, that's the closest way to describe it.So overall it is a great help to those in pain and those not in pain, easing foot, leg, and back fatigue.  Just be careful stepping on and off of it, as the edges are so smooth as to be slippery.  My son took care of that by putting a border of duct tape on the slippery part so we wouldn't slide off and fall.  OK, so that's a little redneck of us, but that's just how we roll sometimes...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RW4NH0WQ50HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PQXK68#wasThisHelpful","R1RW4NH0WQ50HT","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my earliest memories is my brother and I getting in trouble for racing our Hot Wheels cars on the top of my parents beautiful wooden stereo cabinet.  Not only was I lucky to be the little sister of a big Hot Wheels fan, but I was allowed to have my own little collection of Hot Wheels cars, separate from my brother's collection.So when I say that I love Hot Wheels, it goes way back to my own childhood, and continues to playing Hot Wheels with my son and seeing him enjoy his own collection.  Collections now though, include not just the cars but a dizzying array of choices in tracks, themed sets,and even video games (which are awesome by the way.)We have quite a few sets of the Hot Wheels Trick Tracks and it is a lot of fun to connect them together and make really long tracks that take up a whole room. One of the biggest advantages of playing just about anything Hot Wheels is the longevity of it.  The Hot Wheels name means you can continue to play with the vehicles, sets, tracks, etc., indefinitely.  Hot Wheels just doesn't make things that you're going to get bored with.Until they made this particular set. Don't get me wrong, it is a really fun track for a little while. First  you have to get over the fact that it needs 4 D batteries, and you set it up, which by the way is pretty easy.  It is a lot of fun seeing how fast the cars zip around the track, and we laughed in surprise at the collisions.NOTE:  It may sound overprotective, but we highly recommend safety glasses while your kids play with this. The cars are going at a surprising rate of speed, so often the collisions happen and the cars are flying off the tracks and into the air.  Since your children are sitting close to the set in order to keep adding cars to it, the chances of one of the cars hitting them in the face, especially the eyes, are pretty high.  In fact that happened at our house.  Once one of the cars flew off the track and cracked one of his friends in the cheek. Another time the car hit my son's eyebrow, dangerously close to hitting him right in the eye. After that we decided they should wear their safety glasses when they play with it.Beyond the safety issue, I hate to say it, but this Hot Wheels set just got boring. How many times can you watch the cars going around and crash?  It was really fun for several different days of gameplay, but after that it got relegated to what we call ""going on vacation"" in our house, which is  in the basement.  We repurposed the D batteries for one of his nerf machine guns and sent this track on vacation. we rotate the toys out in this way, but there wasn't ever any interest in bringing that one back up. I hate to give a Hot Wheels toy anything less than 5 stars, but between the safety issue and the boredom factor, I can't really go more than 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBMGH7FSVIWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2HBMGH7FSVIWL","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arthritis sufferers have known for a long time the benefits of tart cherries or tart cherry juice in easing some of the joint pain.  However it can be really challenging to get enough of the cherries or juice in you daily to keep consistent benefits coming your way.  The tart cherry capsules definitely solve that problem.  Of course the best benefit comes from the original source, so we try to get the real cherries or juice (even dried cherries work) as much and as often as possible. But in those times when we don't have cherries or juice around, these are a welcome substitute. There are several of us in the family with arthritic problems, and we all use these tart cherry supplements because we have found them to be extremely helpful.Nature's Bounty is a brand we have used for years and have found them to be high quality at a reasonable price, so this particular brand of the tart cherry capsules  are the perfect choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOKJ2Q65TWSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV5AJ00#wasThisHelpful","RYOKJ2Q65TWSY","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bladder control pads are good for inside your underwear if you have a light to moderate situation going on.  Just don't mistake them for the kind of pads (commonly referred to as booster pads) that can go inside adult diapers to handle higher volume.  That's not what these are meant for.  The difference is the backing of the pad. On these the backing is the kind that seals out liquid from going through, so that if you wear them inside your underwear,  it won't leak through your underwear.  A booster pad, however, does not have that plastic type backing. That allows the liquid to first be absorbed by the booster pad and then go through that to be absorbed by the diaper.I hope that explaining the difference will help you to select the right product. If what you need is something that goes inside your underwear to catch a light to moderate leak, then this is your solution at a really affordable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96K315KAT2F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNCQ3S#wasThisHelpful","R96K315KAT2F2","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE on 8/17/15:  I just had to update this to let you know that these glasses are every bit as sturdy and good as the ones you can buy for much more at, well, just about anywhere!  They feel great on, the arms open and close smoothly, the hinges are sturdy and these glasses are so comfortable that I forget I'm wearing them.  And this is from someone who has gone through many, many ""cheater"" glasses from stores that either end up breaking or I lose them.Again, I want to emphasize that for this price, you can put them in each room you use your glasses in and not have to worry about losing them.

I can't stand wearing a strap around my neck, and if I don't have a pocket, I'm always setting the glasses down in whatever room I'm in.  Then I have to go looking for them.  I hate shelling out $12-15 for a pair of glasses.  I found these cute little designer type glasses, and I love them!  They ended up being a much better bargain than any that I buy in the big box stores.  This way I can put them in separate rooms, which alleviates the need to keep track of them at all.  I can do this because they are super affordable, and can I say again that they are ADORABLE?!  I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality, which is great.  They have cute designs (you don't get to pick the colors, you just take your chances).  All you have to do is tell them the strength you need, and you're all set.  I have no idea how long they'll last, but I love the price, style, colors, and the fit.

"While I know that this is intended as a beard trimmer, I've been using it for some nice neat trim work when I cut the fella's hair.  Having the different length attachments really helps with getting the back, around the ears, and the ever-important sides, all neat and looking good.Since it is smaller than the hair trimmer I use for the bulk of the haircut, it is much easier to handle and actually does much more precision work.The only complaint is that it uses a battery, which on the plus side means no cord, but I really would rather have a rechargeable one instead.But overall, this is a great value, and works really well.

"We are happy with this attic fan, but boy, I sure didn't realize how much would be involved in installing it.  I kinda thought that following the instructions and going step by step would get us through it, but we ended up calling my dad, who is handy with these kinds of things and was an electrician at some point in his life.  If you don't have someone like that around to help, and you can't order one on Amazon (yet!), then I would definitely get some quotes on getting it installed, and here's why:  ELECTRICITY, which is absolutely dangerous in inexperienced hands, and a good second reason:  WATER, if you don't install shutters or a louvre or something to protect the fan from the rain.  Since electricity and water are obviously not good together, and it's important to hardwire this fan correctly, my advice is that it may not be the ideal home project to attempt on your own, and you're better off having someone qualified to install it.  All that being said, it's a really great fan and we noticed a difference pretty quickly.  We are using the temperature feature, but decided to pass on the humidity feature since we are in a very rainy area.  High humidity on a sunny day would be a great time to have the fan on, but since humidity includes rain, I don't want to have it run unnecessarily.  The metal is thicker than we expected, and very sturdy. We've noticed a difference already in how much less the air conditioning runs.  Other than being overwhelmed by the installation (to be fair, that's completely because of our own inexperience), we are very pleased with our choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6FWVTIB37KE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P91TWK4#wasThisHelpful","R1U6FWVTIB37KE","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll be honest.  Yuck.  These are tough for us to get down, because the taste is pretty bad.  But if you look at what's included in these gummies, you'll be amazed at how much nutrition they pack into them.  That makes it worth it, money-wise, and health-wise, to tough it out and get them down.  I guess it's because we are used to the Lil Critters line of gummy vitamins, which do include sugar and some of which are quite tasty.  But honestly, how can you get a vitamin that includes vitamins, minerals, fiber, omegas, and D3?  And while not cheap, it's certainly a lot of bang for your buck and very very well worth it because of the goodness you're getting.We came up with a compromise so we can get them down.  We start with the Lil Critters Immune C with Echinacea, and the Lil Critters Calcium, chew them halfway and then put the SmartyPants gummies in our mouths.

"I was shocked to find this tea tree product because I've used tea tree oil for years on painful joints, with great results.  I'm very convinced of the benefits of tea tree oil as far as pain relief, but I had no idea that it was also used as an air ""purifier.""  It makes sense because it is an anti-fungal and antibacterial, but I was really surprised and happy to see this product available.  I have used it for about a month now, and am very pleased with the results.  My son and I have breathing difficulties, and it is allergy season in the Midwest, so it's been the perfect time to try to make a difference in the indoor air.  I have to say that we have several air purifiers running throughout the house, so I can't give this jar of Safe T Air all the credit.  But....I put a jar of it in each bedroom, and once we got used to the strong smell (had to put it a bit away from the bed.  Even though we are used to tea tree oil's smell, this is very very strong when you first open it and can knock you over if you breathe it too close.)  Anyways, it seemed to make a difference, especially on rainy days, as far as any kind of stale, damp air inside.  I've ordered another one to use in the vehicles.  I'm going to divide it up into smaller jars for that, and I'd like to put a couple in the basement, especially by the sump pump.Overall I'm very pleased with the results.  It's not a miracle, but it did make a practical difference in the quality of our indoor air and our resulting ease of breathing, so we are sold on it.

"For the last couple years, I have been on a quest to find the right vacuum cleaner for our home. I thought I had found it with a cordless vacuum that I've had for about 6 months now. Unfortunately, when using the attachments, the hose was way too short. So in trying to use the attachments,  you end up pulling the vacuum cleaner over.That was my most recent experience, so I was very very excited to have the opportunity to test and review this Miele vacuum.First of all, I was really relieved that it was packaged well, but only because I didn't need a locksmith, a musclehead, and a couple of hours to get it out of the box. It was packed very securely, but I was still able to unbox it with reasonable time and effort.I would best describe this vacuum as having the old school features of the vacuums my mother used, but updated and upgraded with current technology.  I found it to be a great marriage of the two, and as consumers we definitely benefit.I know some people complained that it was heavy.  I am not very strong, but I had no trouble at all maneuvering it around.  In fact,  my mother and I both felt it moved very easily, almost like it was self-propelled.  We also loved how it swiveled itself in any direction with snakelike movements.  It automatically adjusted height based on the floor, which was another great feature.  The light is nice and bright, easily illuminating under beds and in shadowy corners.One of the problems I've run into with other vacuums is where to put the attachments.  I am thrilled that the Miele designed the back to hold all 3 attachments.  Having them onboard makes using the dusting brush, upholstery tool or crevice nozzle very easy and convenient.  This is where the solid design of the Miele comes in handy because I could easily use the attachments and the vacuum didn't budge. It didn't tip over or wobble or anything.Our family members have difficulty breathing, including one asthmatic. Miele calls it the AirClean sealed system, made up of 1) an AirClean Filter Bag and 2) a HEPA filter that catches 99.9+% of dirt, dust and allergens. That is amazing.  And when you physically see these two filters, you will be impressed with the high quality of the materials used and how well they keep the air clean while you're vacuuming.How cool is it that the suction adjusts to what's needed, depending on the floor?  And I love the little tech panel, too.After trying a cordless lightweight vacuum that flopped over too easily and didn't give me enough hose to use the attachments,  I am thrilled that the Miele has a super long cord.  I can plug it in and vacuum almost the whole house from one outlet. I like the convenience of just wrapping the cord around the 2 clips onthe base.This vacuum was exceptional,  and I'm happy to recommend it.  I hope this helped you to make a decision.

It's the perfect amount of sweetness and the texture is quite enjoyable.About the 3rd chew into it, the tart cherry/fruit punch filling hits your tongue and, if you're like me, scrunches up your face from the tartness.Memories of the same ""sweetness then tartness"" of original SweeTarts came back to me with a smile. It's been years since I had SweeTarts, and I quite enjoyed this rendition of them.They were also a hit with the kids.  By the way,  there are 4 ""ropes"" in each package,  and they are nice-sized, so splitting a package is definitely an option.  A little of these go a long way because of how it wakes up your taste buds.Definitely a hit in our house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLH2YQIJIQ1RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HMZ004#wasThisHelpful","RLH2YQIJIQ1RI","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is incredibly solid and well-made, unlike some of the flimsy , unstable trimmers I've thrown money away on over the years.  It seems silly to emphasize that the battery compartment closes snugly and stays closed, but I've found you can't always assume that will be the case.The trimmer did a great job gently around the inside of the nostrils, without pulling or scratching.But the real test for me was trimming above the eyebrows,  to leave a nice clean line.  It's super risky to use a trimmer here because one little slip and you're done for, but with steady hands and this high quality Philips Norelco trimmer,  my eyebrows looked fantastic. I didn't use the eyebrow attachment that you can use to keep them the same length because I don't have a problem there, but it's definitely a nice addition to the set, along with a cover for the tip of the trimmer.Lastly, it's an awesome feature that you can run water over the tip, but I prefer to use a little alcohol square on the end to disinfect it.  I keep those little packaged alcohol squares around, along with baby wipes, for keeping everything from tweezer tips to the handle of my makeup case clean.Thank you for reading my review.  I hope it helps someone decide. I've purchased dozens of trimmers over the years, for myself and for family members.  I have to say that this trimmer leads the pack, and I'm really pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJT0A2IFTQR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTA8O#wasThisHelpful","RTJT0A2IFTQR1","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tweezerman is a great line, and these pointy, precise tweezers are my favorite Tweezerman product.  You may think they are pricey, and yeah, you're right,  but how many cheap tweezers have you bought over the years that didn't work out?  You know, when you grab the hair with the tweezers, pull, and the tweezers just slide along the hair,  not pulling it out at all.  Frustrated,  you attempt it again, with the same results. It makes the whole tweezing experience frustrating and worse,  your eyebrows look terrible.I finally had enough of that about 10 years ago and bought a nice pair of Tweezerman tweezers exactly like these ones.I wouldn't have had to replace them except that I've lost a few when my girlfriends see them and like them so much that I end up giving them away and ordering new ones.You are worth it, so spend a little bit on some high quality Tweezerman tweezers like these. You'll love them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZ2Q8X78W3OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000782SQY#wasThisHelpful","RNZ2Q8X78W3OO","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I can change the priorities anytime I want from the app on my smartphone!!!  I absolutely love it.  I love the increased speed, too. (from my previous setup).It was super easy to set up.

"We are a family of gamers and I was really excited to get our first gaming keyboard.  Whew.  It was not difficult to set up, but it's definitely going to take awhile to get the hang of it and be able to use the extensive features it offers.  So far it is definitely speeding up our gaming, because of the keystrokes we can cut by building the steps into macros.  The lights help tremendously with my young son because we can highlight the keys he needs for his particular games.  (it's hard for him to keep track of the keys sometimes).It is definitely top of the line, great quality, with all the bells and whistles.  Our experience has been positive so far, with no problems.  I called Customer Service twice with questions, and they were patient and thorough in their assistance.

"This is our third year of getting the Just Dance game for the Wii, and we absolutely love it.  It's such an easy way to be active and have fun at the same time.  There is enough variety in the songs that anyone in the family can find a tune they like.If one of us just puts it on and cranks it up, it usually draws a couple other family members into the living room to dance!  And since we live in a cold weather state, we really need to be able to stay active to battle the ""winter weight"" that comes from being stuck inside and having less activity.  Ummm, OK, plus the holidays of extra eating and well, more ""grazing"" all winter long.Our family highly recommends this fun way to stay in shape.

"Since the moment I first found out I was pregnant years ago, I have been unable to think of Mother Mary without heart-wrenching tears.  Becoming a mother changes so many things, but having the heart of a mother and imagining the gut-wrenching pain that Mary not only endured, but endured with GRACE, is overwhelming.  The example that she set so long ago has moved so many of us to try harder, to be stronger, to live with grace and dignity, to love more purely, to have more faith...I pray to be the slightest bit as strong and good as she was.That being said, it was painful but inspiring to read Adam Hamilton's book, seeing Jesus' life through his mother's eyes.  Obviously it's not new information, and many have already contemplated Mary's perspective.  But starting from the crucifixion and then moving back to the beginning, with the author's insightful way of relating the story, emphasized how equally heart-breaking and faith-making Mary's journey was, and in this telling we are in the front row watching, feeling, and weeping.I loved this book, and I've already bought copies for my mother and a few friends.  It has inspired me to make my own journey count even more, and to work harder on who I am.  I'm pleased and honored to recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241EVZTHSWIPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426771843#wasThisHelpful","R241EVZTHSWIPQ","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like when a book makes me think.  I like when a book makes me think about things in a new or different way, or makes me want to learn more about something, or makes a difference in my life.  There are so many good outcomes to reading a book, especially one about such a powerful topic as ""Entangled in Darkness:  Seeking the Light.""  Since everyone has inner struggles, certainly a book like this from a best-selling author should give me some clear guidance.I am confused.While there are so many thought-provoking and heart-touching things in this book that I would still recommend it, I am confused.  The author's personal story is interesting and contains many messages, but I think she referred to her own story way too many times throughout this modest-sized book.  We get it, don't beat us over the head with it.I also get it that drawing from many different religions and practices can teach us a lot and help us even more, but again, I am confused.  Some of her comments, like her reactions to the afflictions of some of the people she met, kind of bothered me, because she seemed to shy away from, or be disturbed by, some of the people and their problems.  I guess I should applaud her honesty, but I felt bad for the people that she drew back from.I'm interested in many of the things she brought up, and I'm actually curious enough that I plan on reading her earlier books, ""Be Your Own Shaman: Heal Yourself and Others with 21st-Century Energy Medicine"" and ""Truth Heals:  What You Hide Can Hurt You.""  With a family that has a lot of medical problems to deal with, it is often frustrating to deal with more and more medical professionals and more and more prescriptions.  Although it is necessary to pursue the official medical path, I am intrigued by Deborah King's experiences and insights, and I really want to see what else she has to say that might lead us to the path of healing that we desperately want and need.I hope this has helped someone.  I definitely would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJL5QA0XOTWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401938949#wasThisHelpful","R3SJL5QA0XOTWH","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a chocoholic, and love trying different kinds of chocolate.  For starters, this is nice-looking gift bag, with the different color foil-wrapped truffles and the cute little chocolate-colored bow around the cellophane bag top.  Instead of making you guess what flavor you're about to eat, Seattle Chocolates idiot-proofs that part by printing the flavor on the foil of each piece, and the back label shows a picture of each flavor, with the name next to it.  There were a total of 51 pieces in the one pound package, with about 3-4 of each flavor listed on the back label. (see above product description for the individual flavors).  I think that making sure you know what flavor you're about to eat is a nice touch on the part of Seattle Chocolates.Flavor-wise, these are tasty, but they didn't knock our socks off.  Some of them have a cream center, like the strawberry, with the chocolate covering, and some have the flavor mixed in with the chocolate, like the mint ones.  Some are dark chocolate and some are milk chocolate.My taste runs more along the lines of Ghirardelli, so the Seattle Chocolates were good, but not ""eyes rolling back in the head while the world stops for a moment"" delicious.  I hate to say that, but I have to be honest in my reviews and that ""wow factor"" was just not there.That being said, I gave some to a cousin that just loves the waxy Hershey bars (ahem, I love an occasional Hershey bar myself, just saying there are different levels of quality when it comes to chocolate.)  Anyway, my cousin thought these Seattle Chocolates were a slice of heaven, and asked me to order more for her.  So I think it depends on your preference for chocolate as to if these are going to do it for you or not.  I hope this helps give you an idea of what to expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFVL7TSEHHLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DKUIWY#wasThisHelpful","R2OFVL7TSEHHLI","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are so unbelievably impressed and pleased with our new Diono car seat, which we use as a booster seat for our 10-year-old.  Even though his previous car seat was safe and comfortable, after 7 years use, we felt safer getting a new one.  After TONS of research, we had decided on a Diono, and it seemed like the perfect choice when we had the opportunity to evaluate this one.Yes, it's heavy, but we keep it in the same vehicle, so that's not a problem for us.  It was easy to install.  We like that it's stainless steel, heavy, solid, durable, and so safe.  In our research, we thoroughly read the safety information on the us.diono.com website, and felt more and more sure that this was our safest option for our child.Due to frequent, long car trips back and forth to a hospital, comfort is very important, and after some use, I can tell you that this car seat does not disappoint.  It is very comfortable for him, and the sides are not just a good safety feature for side impact crashes, but very comfortable for him to lean against on the long hospital trip days..Very pleased to recommend.

"I have been looking for these for years.  I still have a few of the ones I bought years and years ago, but haven't been able to find them.  I just figured they were a relic of the past, and then I stumbled across them on Amazon.  I keep one in the shower, so after conditioning I can put my hair up while the conditioner does its thing.  I keep a few with my other hair products, in case I want to clip it in place till the gel or whatever product of the moment kicks in.  I keep a couple around for working out, to get my hair out of the way.  I keep a couple by my bedside, in case it's a warm night and I want it up.  These are so incredibly handy.

And the cotton is comfortable.I actually ordered this by mistake.  My little boy really wanted it, and I ordered the X-Large . When it arrived, we realized it was Men's not Boy's.

"These brownies are delicious!  We usually make the Ghirardelli brownies, and they are heavenly, so I wasn't sure if these Immaculate Baking Brownies would be as good.  WOW.  They are sensational.The taste is a bit lighter chocolate, more of a cocoa type flavor, whereas Ghirardelli is more fudgy.  Both are equally delicious.  The advantages of having no high fructose corn syrup and healthier ingredients (including organic cocoa) sounded good till I saw that you have to use a whole stick of butter!  I thought that was kind of funny, but I think the idea isn't to make healthy brownies, but to just make them not-as-unhealthy as other brownies.We didn't even make icing because the taste was so flavorful.

It is much harder to hang on and persevere when you are being bombarded with one challenge after another, when people are bailing on you left and right, when medical problems hit you or your family, when financial troubles are overwhelming, and more and more and more....Often you find yourself remembering how great it felt being surrounded by family and friends, feeling cared about and never imagining that these people would vanish, one at a time, as your life became more difficult.This book by Priscilla Shirer was so incredibly comforting, reminding us at every time .  Even though my faith has always been strong, ""God is Able"" gave me so many concrete reminders as to why it's OK to keep giving our problems to God.  ""God is Able"" to handle them, and wants us to just let go and allow Him to take care of us.

"Absolutely love it!  We've been using it for a few weeks now, and can't believe how much of a difference this coffeemaker has made for us.For years we used the carafe kind, which scotches the coffee if you leave it on the warmer too long.  You know, it gets bitter the longer it's on there, and who wants it burned tasting?  Then we switched to K-cups, which got real expensive really fast, and inconvenient with more than a couple guests.This is probably our last switch in coffeemakers, because it is exactly what we need.  Of course it has lots of nice bells and whistles, such as the ability to program a preset on-time, so you can wake up to the wonderful smell of coffee brewing.  But the fact that it keeps it warm inside the coffeemaker, with an automatic 2 hour shutoff, is a key advantage for us, since we're just sippers, not gulpers.  Being able to make one cup at a time lets the whole family enjoy their morning cup of Joe at their leisure, without waiting too long and having it be scorched.It cleans up easily, and doesn't take up much room.

"We gave these Ziploc bags a couple weeks of use before doing this review.  For the most part they are much like all the other Ziploc bags, a solid product that does what it's intended to.  We tested them against the regular size Ziploc sandwich bags.  They look the same, other than the size, but when you feel them, you can tell that these XL ones are the tiniest bit thinner.  That shouldn't matter, you say to yourself, but it seemed to matter at the corners, where we had several of them tear.  Granted, we were stretching them apart, exactly the same as we did with the regular size Ziploc sandwich bags, which did not tear at all.  How often are you in a situation where you are pulling your sandwich bags apart?  Right, practically never, except for a couple lunchbox trades that got a little heated.  We tried pointy chips like Doritos in them, and they didn't puncture at all.So overall, if used just temporarily for food, no problem.  If you plan on using them long-term, say to store stuff in around the house or garage, or in the car, like many of us do, I'd be careful because they puncture easier.For us, using them for pizza slices, they are great.  For any size sandwiches, they are great, and we particularly liked being able to put each child's sandwich AND their snack in one bag, instead of using 2 bags for each child.  And we like to get the foot long subs and cut them into thirds, so these larger bags were the perfect size for that, too.Four stars, great product. If they didn't tear at the corners on our testing, I'd have gone with 5 stars, but I've never had a Ziploc tear in years and years of use, so I had to dock it one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMA7EIPUKJH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXCNS16#wasThisHelpful","R2BMA7EIPUKJH4","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been happy with other VTech products, so I was surprised that this one did not work out very well for us.  We could not get the signal to stay connected for longer than 10-15 minutes.  And that was at a range of 80-100 feet, not the 1000 ft range it's supposed to have.There are some great features, like encryption so your neighbors aren't picking up your conversations through their own monitors, and the sound is decent, I guess.  But none of that matters if the connection won't stabilize.  Frustrating experience because I really wanted to like it, but it became impossible.I'd rather put more money into something as important as monitoring my baby/children, because there's no room for error.  So I'll say great company, but a swing and a miss for this particular product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2HA1N4268N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEV5UI8#wasThisHelpful","R1C2HA1N4268N9","A1RTSVWEXMKAR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RTSVWEXMKAR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perfect for making a slip and slide! We have a nice hill, and I used approximately 30 loop garden stakes along the edges to secure it to the ground. We use a general lawn sprinkler sometimes, but most just a garden hose at the top. 10 feet is rather wide, so two people can race, but you need to use a sprinkler method so the water hits it all around better. A hose creates one nice stream for one person to slide down, and you go much faster with the extra water pooled down one stream. So far we mostly use it folded to aboud 5 feet wide, and it has held up great for a few weeks now, with almost daily use by my kids, their friends and even adults!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQODL8Y1D2KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOOF63S#wasThisHelpful","R3LQODL8Y1D2KV","A4UWNRY0WWECK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UWNRY0WWECK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We ordered 2 remotes for our family. We are exclusively a Wii family; no other gaming systems. We have a Wii and a Wii U. Both worked perfectly out of the box; synced easily to our system, and have been problem free. These remotes have ""Wii motion plus"" built in, which is nice; no need to find the plug for the bottom. We bought 'knock offs' from a big box store because they lit up & looked cool - returned them 2 days later. Insist on nothing more than Nintendo remotes. These work well, and we have had no problems with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXVUB9C85KKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OAEN2#wasThisHelpful","RBXVUB9C85KKP","A135AID7S9P7Q6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A135AID7S9P7Q6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not have a dog, I have 3 indoor/outdoor cats. I absolutely LOVE this brush! I love that it is 'jointed' and swivels when you use it; not  the typical straight flat brush. Because they go outdoors so often, they come in matted often from the morning dew and wet grass. I used to cut tough mats off of them but this brush takes care of it! The rough bristle side takes care  of the mats and the softer side tales care of all the excess hair. My cats love to be brushed and they enjoy this brush on their fur.HIGHLY recommend!

"What gave me an immediate sense of how the Bronx came burning down was Jerome Charyn's reference to a pack of wild dogs that roamed through Crotona Park in the aftermath of the greatest upheaval to ever hit the borough. There's even a rumor that they mauled to death a small child. Later, a prominent gang adopted that vicious canine emblem to grace its bags of heroin. And that in a nutshell sums up the disheartening tone of BITTER BRONX, it's fall into destruction and chaos that no one could stop. All that's left for Charyn to do is lament what once was of this ""brick wilderness.""And there's no telling symbol than the most recognizable fixture of the Bronx—Yankee Stadium. Or should I say, the NEW Yankee Stadium, the mecca by which all success is measured. In ""Major Leaguer,"" the leader of the Crotona Dogs invites superintendent Will Johnson to join him for a game in his box seats. The gangbanger remembers his Papi talking about watching Will play center field for the Yankees, and how proud he was of Will's glorious achievement as a native of the Bronx. But Will's not so proud. He only played one game as a Yankee, and he didn't even get a hit. The nostalgia factor rings false for Will. He doesn't believe himself to be worthy of any accolades, and he's not going to kowtow to the Crotona Dogs. He has too much pride for that.Charyn, a native of the Bronx himself, nails the vibe of the place. You can feel the monotonous movement of the subway in, ""I had to ride the local in and out of the Bronx. Each stop was a kind of purgatory. Freeman Street. Simpson Street. Intervale Avenue…"" You can feel the rot and ruin in, ""The Art Deco palaces along the Grand Concourse have been refurbished, but the blight will never really go away."" You can feel the eminent sense of danger in, ""Paradise Road had sharpshooters reigning from the roofs. The drug lords had put them there. But after a while the sharpshooters were bored to death and would pick off children and old men.""It's no wonder Charyn compares the broken landscape of the Bronx to bombed-out Belfast, and why he's reluctant to revisit his memories in print, no doubt because they clash so painfully with what he finds there today. It's heartbreaking to see one's home turned into something unrecognizable. It's sad that a fresh wind of change has never come to the Bronx, especially when New York is a city that's ever changing, dashing dreams, while raising others up.But one thing is certain. Despite its many flaws, the Bronx did one thing right. It gave birth to a literary talent like Jerome Charyn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMHKWT96B9VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBSZNV8#wasThisHelpful","R3CMHKWT96B9VL","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It’s the perfect size to use for small and large batches. I found the seams are really strong on this bag. The curved design of the bag prevents things from getting stuck in the corners.

"There's something inherently sexy about staging a romance in a remote location. The brooding loner on the moors who ignites with a little firecracker from the city. A girl who wanders onto his sprawling property caught in a ""fine driving rain that seeped into your bones."" The environment on Black Mountain is lonely, silent, scary. It's certainly not what she's used to, until she sets eyes on him. Then the barren landscape starts to look pretty darn appealing.Even though her new boss is drool-worthy, Riley has a hard time adjusting to life in the Welsh countryside. As the new outdoor activities assistant, she has to muck out stalls and lead nature hikes, staggering over the beacons. For a Londoner who's afraid of heights, her new mountain home gives her more than a case of vertigo, especially when the only form of entertainment is having the old men down at the pub spike her drinks.Jago loves the wilderness. It's where he thrives. He knows every aspect about the rugged terrain surrounding his homestead. He offers horseback riding excursions. He guides canoe trips. He takes groups up the mountain on foot. And none of that ever scares him, until a spiky-haired spitfire comes to live under his roof.But Riley adjusts, making friends with Jago's untamable stallion, Farley. She has a knack with animals, slipping into a groove as she finds her way in this strange environment. Jago tries to help her, but usually only after she's already gotten in trouble. He treats her bleeding, blistered feet after a torturous trail walk. He looks after her when she's thrown from a horse. He makes sure his cook, Emily, feeds her ravenous appetite. But he always pulls back, when it comes to giving her more of himself.Riley does everything she can to draw him out. She swims in his pool in her underwear. She drapes her bra across Farley's rump. She flirts with other men to make him jealous. But it's not until they spend some alone time together as a couple, that things start to heat up. They find out more about each other and what makes them tick. Nature brings them together, softening his edges and calming her nerves.But ultimately, working as a team is what does it. They face everything from snake bites to sheep dips and come out stronger on the other side. He gets her to love nature, and she gets him to love life. Like a sunny day ending in a moonlit night, they learn how to compliment each other while learning to bring out the best in one another. A true romance, indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUWIKJGUQH93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXEU2F8#wasThisHelpful","R3NUWIKJGUQH93","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of things going on in this mystery.Some definitively aid the plot while others turn out to be quite head-scratching. The plus side is that Sharon St. George offers up several quirky elements that really set her mystery novel apart.  For starters, her heroine, Aimee Machado, lives next to a field full of llamas. So even though she takes on the dangerous work of investigating a murder in her spare time, she has no need for an alarm system. Why? Because llamas let out a ferocious bleat whenever they sense a predator nearby.Another factor is the zany pack of suspects that fall under Aimee's radar. The biggest shocker is the cross dresser who's later revealed to be the wife of a prominent community figure. St. George even has Aimee go on a date with her, thinking she's a man, before learning her true gender. Yikes!Things get even more peculiar when Aimee's focus shifts to the dodgy couple, Mr. and Mrs. Underhill, who happen to be running a cryogenics non-profit organization called Everlasting Pets. This shady endeavor operates under the guise of one day being able to clone the family dog, cat, llama, whatever. These two turn out to be even more bizarre when they elude to the numerous three-way sex romps they used to have with the murder victim, even soliciting Aimee to take her place and become their new partner.But the novel isn't all about shock value.  There's plenty of substance to the plot, particularly concerning the class structure of working in a hospital environment. There is a definite food chain mentality in the pecking order, especially when Dr. Beardsley, a noted plastic surgeon becomes the prime suspect in the killing of his trophy wife, Bonnie. She was beautiful and manipulative with a voracious sexual appetite that he just couldn't satisfy, but Quinn, the hospital administrator doesn't want to hear any of that. Oh no, his loyalty is to the hospital, and solidifying its reputation, and ultimately its profit margin. While the security attendant, Orrie Mercer, the person with the grave responsibility of guarding the outside entrance, is harshly reprimanded by Quinn for failing to use the designated restroom.As the new hospital librarian, Aimee must weave her way through this complicated maze of conflicting interests. She's a college-educated professional, but she's only allotted two elderly women as volunteers and a space deemed of little value in order to set up shop. Her situation gets even more dicey when Quinn asks her to spy on Dr. Beardsley for him. Aimee quickly becomes disgruntled working under these conditions, feeling like this isn't what she signed up for.Her frustration over her job begins to filter into her day-to-day life when her brother, Harry, comes under scrutiny for committing the murder. He was one of the last people to see Bonnie alive, and due to some bad blood he has with one of the cops on the small town police force, the circumstantial evidence against him begins to mount. Aimee refuses to let her brother go to jail for a crime he didn't commit, but Quinn makes it clear to her that he won't get involved in the way the investigation is heading, whether Aimee's brother is innocent or not. What's good for Dr. Beardsley is good for him and therefore good for the hospital.Aimee, at her wit's end, starts taking a lot of unnecessary risks in order to get the spotlight off her brother, and the consequences are dire. Her tires are slashed. Her apartment is vandalized. Her body is physically assaulted. Yet Aimee's a tough cookie with a heart of gold, and she won't give up no matter who tries to stop her. She's loyal, passionate and unwavering in her support of her brother, and as she starts to piece all of the clues together, she finds out more about the people she's working with than she ever bargained for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9JGTJ85HR54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQMUVWU#wasThisHelpful","RS9JGTJ85HR54","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Melanie and JD have new obstacles to overcome---sexy exes to contend to, developing careers and family drama. Both are their own individuals, yet Melanie and JD complete each other as a couple. While the first book focused more on introducing these two characters, this second book is more about character development and the various complexities of a budding relationship. This is a great follow up to the first novel. I can't wait to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W86CLQLSOEIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKIPAGI#wasThisHelpful","R2W86CLQLSOEIH","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melanie and JD are both two flawed characters who happen to find chemistry with each other, as well as companionship. The two develop a romance that is stemmed from realistic circumstances, not from overly dramatic and unrealistic overtures. Sometimes two flawed individuals can find love with each other, such as the case with these two. Coming Home is a great new contemporary romance novel that will warm your heart as both Melanie and JD struggle with their personal circumstances. I was drawn to the Manhattan setting and the way Melanie and JD's romance unfolded. I can't wait to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEDI8FVUTT8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMOMK6K#wasThisHelpful","R3OEDI8FVUTT8I","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first book in the Obsession series is off to a great start. JR King introduces two distinctive characters, Alexander Turner and Elena Anderson, who share a rather unique obsession for each other. I like how the author writes in the first person from both their perspectives. The transitions between the two characters are flawless. Alexander Turner is obviously powerful, ruthless and a complete bad boy. Elena is an innocent flower whose virginity is stolen from her at the age of sixteen. As the story progresses, Alexander's intensity and obsession with Elena grows. Women throw themselves at him, yet Alexander isn't interested in a sure thing; it's far too boring for him. The game of winning over and having Elena on his terms is what drives Alexander. The author does a great job of creating a passionate chemistry between Alexander and Elena. The love scenes were certainly erotic. I was surprised by the ending of this first book, but I'm so ready to read the next.  I can't wait to see what else JR King has up their sleeve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R211PJUD3K9VPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNLA82O#wasThisHelpful","R211PJUD3K9VPW","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Blind King"" introduces Prince Efren, the first born son of King Nilan. Efren was born blind, and because of this disability King Nilan declared that his second son, Gannon would be heir to his throne. King Nilan is embarrassed by Efren and wants nothing to do with his son so he decides to marry him off to Ryshel, the daughter of a Duke. Despite the arranged marriage, Efren and Ryshel do fall in love. In order to keep the peace between Ra’jhou and their neighboring enemy Na’zora, King Nilan marries off his only daughter, Aubriana, to the son of King Tyrol, Prince Ivor. But King Tyrol has other plans and soon war between the two kingdoms is inevitable.I love how the author, Lana Axe has created a well-written fantasy novel complete with detestable characters, interesting warfare, elves, dwarfs, sorcery, mages and more. I felt compassion for Aubriana's misery and Efren's struggle to rule in a kingdom where his blindness is ridiculed. Yet Efren's intelligence and foresight prevails and he quickly asks the elves for help.As a big fantasy buff, I really enjoyed ""The Blind King.""

"The idea of ""ethnic cleansing"" is a very chilling topic, especially when incorporated in this novel. The premise of ""Genetic Bullets"" by JC Ryan is very original. The idea that the government has somehow formulated a genetically induced weapon to kill off a particular race is quite scary. I was happy that this novel lived up to my expectations. JC Ryan infuses several themes into his story, but everything meshes really well, especially since the book is so well-written. I enjoyed the progression and depth of the characters. I was completely engaged in the story, especially with the subplots and the different twists. This is a great follow up to JC Ryan's other two books in this series.

"Developing social skills may not necessarily be easy for some people, but this book is a great resource for helping the introvert get out of their shell. As a former introvert myself, I realize that it takes time and practice to develop the right social skills to thrive in today's reality. I don't consider myself a full extrovert---in fact I'm somewhere in between an introvert and an extrovert---but I still found some useful information from Gabriel Angelo's book. The author nailed it on the head when he said that by nature humans are social creatures---we thrive on the social interactions we experience.""Social Skills"" takes on a modern day twist on how to develop social skills for any situation. I particularly liked the chapter on using social skills in the workplace---I found it relevant to my particular situation. I thought the chapter about developing social skills in children to teenagers was smart to include for all the parents who have socially awkward kids.Overall I thought this book was useful and a good resource for anyone wanting to brush up on their social skills or develop their skills better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAJAG9CNWGN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLNOX5A#wasThisHelpful","R2NAJAG9CNWGN7","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've bought property before so I know how stressful the whole process can be.

"I was completely drawn to L.C. Moore's story and fascinating characters. The book is set in different time periods, but it becomes obvious that the characters are all connected in some capacity. I was intrigued by Dan and Odette's love story---how a personal tragedy drove Dan to enlist as a soldier in World War II where he ultimately finds his soul mate, a beautiful French freedom fighter/soldier named Odette, who nurses him back to health after he is injured.There are a lot of elements to this book, which includes the idea of soul mates and the feeling of Deja vu. I love how the author manages to flawlessly transition between the characters and time periods. The themes of love and war are strongly infused into the story. ""All I Longed For Long Ago Was You"" is a well-written, beautifully crafted account of a love that stands the test of time, that true love will always be reunited.

"I was completely hooked the moment I began reading ""Aegis Rising"". The premise of the story peaked my curiosity, but as I delved further into the book, I really began to identify with the five main characters. When Aari, Mariah, Kody, Tegan and Jag survive the plane crash, they are discovered by tribesmen who call themselves the Elders---they believe the five were sent there to fulfill an ancient prophecy. The five teenagers are then faced with a new challenge---they must battle an evil corporation intent on destroying the world as they know it.I love a good science fiction and adventure novel, and this was certainly it. This novel was well-written and included a lot of vivid imagery. I really enjoyed watching the author's imagination unfold as the story progressed.

"I really enjoyed the message behind Fitch and Sam's story, which is unveiled by their diary entries. They grow up together, but they lead completely different lives despite their friendship. The diary entries are written weekly, and at the end of each week the author provides a lesson. While Fitch is always the negative one, Sam is always positive---she sees the glass half full rather than half empty. She takes care of her mind and body, and she lives a proactive life. Fitch on the other hand is completely opposite. As a result, things keep happening TO Fitch while things happen FOR Sam. The ultimate lesson behind this book is that in order to succeed, you must learn from your failures. Life is a succession of failures, but it is what you learn from them that will determine whether you succeed or not. One thing the author mentioned that really struck home for me was when he said, ""Individuals who fail often, often reach far greater career and life successes than people who never fail. Failure helps you learn, grow, and understand!"" Eric McNeal writes a smartly written self-help book that is both enjoyable and thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book---I really love the lessons the author teaches despite the negative connotations towards failure. Who knew that failure is sometimes a good thing?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GU2FEF473QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD1BIK2#wasThisHelpful","R17GU2FEF473QK","A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y38CZ3M4A9HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Perception Transformation"" is a great self-help book that will help you transform your way of thinking. I've always been a very positive person--- I try to see the glass half full rather than half empty. What I like about this book is that it can help negative individuals change their way of thinking. It can also help positive thinkers enhance their perceptive abilities. If we perceive things in a certain way, whether good or bad, the outcome is what we expect it to be. If you perceive everything in a negative light, the outcome will be negative. I've read dozens of books on positive thinking, the law of attraction, etc, but this book is great because it provides some real life examples. It's also a quick read, but you'll find some very valuable information.

But the story only gets better from there, and plenty of action and adventure awaits the reader. I like Lisalla's character because of the fact that she wants to be perceived as a strong female, not a helpless damsel in distress.

"I received this kit to do an unbiased review and its well worth the $23.98 at the time of writing this review.It is identical to the iFixit 54bit driver kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KOTNVA?keywords=ifixit%2054%20bit%20driver%20kit&qid=1447429583&ref_=sr_1_2&sr=8-2)With this kit it saves you $11 vs paying the $35 for the iFixit version.The only big difference between this and the iFixit kit is that the iFixit bit holder has clear markings of which bit is which.In my opinion its not worth the extra $11 to have clear markings of which bit is which since the reason most of us purchase a electronic bit set is to work on small electronics (iPhones, tablets, laptops).The quality of this set and the iFixit is exactly the same, with either set you can easily strip a bit/screw if you use the incorrect bit (ie, bit is too small or too large).The PROs:-Price! Save $11 buying this set vs buying a rebranded ifixit version-This set includes the special Y bit for Macbooks (when replacing certain components & battery replacement).-Sturdy case! (ive purchased other versions at computer stores where the case is really cheap and prone to hairline cracks and chips when dropped)-Magnetic!The CONs:-The bit holder(not the case) is flimsy made out of cheap plastic and not labeled for easy viewing such as the ifixit version, however this should not deter you from purchasing this kit since you're already used to looking for tiny micro screws on your electronic device, looking for the correct bit and reading the marking on the side of the bit should come natural to you.Overall you're better off purchasing this kit than randomly deciding to pick up a micro bit set at your local MicroCenter/Frys computer repair store, those versions are rarely magnetic and their cases scream one time use only.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBG1J11QCEB53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016Q3D4AC#wasThisHelpful","RBG1J11QCEB53","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Received this cable to do a full review and have been using it daily for the past 3 months for my iPhone 6 which I leave plugged into a wall at my home office.The first three months this cable has worked flawlessly to charge my iPhone 6 and my external battery(using micro usb). However after three solid months now whenever I plug in my phone it'll charge for a few minutes then an error will pop up on my phone that this device is not supported with my phone and charging stops.This is common for any lightning cable that did not come directly from the Apple factory. Ive reviewed many other cables and after a few weeks and months it'll just stop charging.On some days it'll fully charge my phone without any disconnect issues and on most it'll initially charge but to come back to my phone after an hour only to see that it has lost connection and didnt charge my phone is a disappointment.I would recommend this product for anyone who needs a spare charger. I personally keep a Apple branded cable at my office desk (since im there most of the day) and ill keep this cable at my home office. Throughout the house/cars I also use Apple branded cables.The other cables I have reviewed are either stored in drawers or in my glovebox for friends who forgot their charger/cable.Pros:-Price and dual functionality of the cable-Cable quality is really impressive flat cable design, has not warped or frayed in the past three monthsCons:-After 3 months the cable will have random disconnects when I only try to charge my iPhone","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325NUC1OGL87A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0GJADC#wasThisHelpful","R325NUC1OGL87A","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer I have received this mouse from Atlantic Castle to do a review.I was given this phone to do an honest review and to be honest I don't own an iPhone 6 (I currently use an iPhone 6+) however my older sister does own one and I had her use this case instead to do a review.My sister's previous case had a similar wallet design such as this one, however after a few months her case could no longer hold credit cards & ID in securely. Apparently once this part is stretched out it stays stretched out. This case since its new held one NYS drivers license and her bank card with a secure confident grip that if she were to hold her phone upside down (for when she gets in and out of the car or carrying bags of groceries etc) she doesn't have to think twice on if her ID and CC had fallen out.She did like the leather on this case vs her older case (older case had a more vinyl feel). The tan portion of the interior does feel like a faux suede, which is always welcomed.For the price of a decent phone case this one does the job perfectly. Shes not Kim Kardashian and realistically no one spends large sums of money on a designer case off Fifth Ave, so don't expect the leather to be from the same cow that they use for Kobe beef.There is a space behind the card holder to fit a few bills (id say roughly 5-10 bills comfortably).This phone does have the option for portrait viewing of videos/movies.She does drop the phone from time to time with carrying my nephew and baby bag from park to park and it has handled itself very well on these concrete jungles of NYC.The ONLY draw back was it did not come with a wrist strap or a hole where a wrist strap can be attached.The bonuses are that this case did come with a glass/acrylic type of screen protector to protect it even further for when my 2 year old nephew does decide to randomly chuck it across the park while the front flap is opened. This only adds onto the protection of jello fingerprints and having your Apple LCD crack from impact/smudges.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have the whole wallet/case option. If I had an iPhone 6 I would highly consider going this route & ditching my wallet. Just grab it and you're ready to go!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAQWYV85PUE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTH4008#wasThisHelpful","R1GAQWYV85PUE9","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer I have received this mouse from Kingtop to do a review.For the price of a basic wired mouse this mouse offers multiple DPI settings on the fly.It has a total of 6 buttons (one for DPI setting).Light construction (a little under 4 ounces, not including the wiring)The build quality is that of any generic mouse however this mouse has sections of a matte texture body which allows for better grip and non-slip for when your palm gets sweaty after a few rounds of competitive game play.Right out of the box it works, select the DPI and you can play your favorite FPS game (CSGO, BF4, CoD)I would not use this mouse to play strategy games due to the size of the mouse it is hard to pick up and track it across the mouse pad to get your cursor to the other end of the map (ie. LoL, Starcraft).I have added photos to my daily mouse which is a Razer Orochi (MSPR $69.99) which is bluetooth & wired. Mostly due to its small form factor and since I use my 15"" rMBP in BootCamp running Windows 8.1 Professional.There are 5 different DPI settings once you press the center ""DPI"" button, once you hit the ""DPI"" button you will see a color flashing which will represent which DPI setting you have selected.RED - 1000GREEN - 1600BLUE - 2400PINK - 3200YELLOW - 5500The LEDs on the mouse will change colors randomly when on and you can opt to turn off all LEDs if you hold down the ""DPI"" button.Pros:Light clicks (for FPS this is live or die when you rush a building)Wired (all competitive players will agree a wired mouse means a consistent signal)Buttery Smooth (I used this with a hard faced mouse pad and this thing glides) Photo included.Cons:Large (I'm 5'10"" and I cannot palm this mouse comfortably, and reaching the 5th button is impossible). Photo included.No Software (cannot Macro the spare 3 buttons to assign to programs/functions or to select a specific DPI)Overall:I would recommend this to someone who isnt a daily gamer that has slightly larger hands than mine.If you're an avid gamer you would be better off investing in a more feature oriented mouse.I did not comment on the design of the mouse because that is really your opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127CF5JO88IXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHM91K4#wasThisHelpful","R127CF5JO88IXF","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:05 MinsI bought this with additional other Hot Wheels Track sets in hopes to making a huge long track to reach one end of the room to my nephews room in the back. (keep in mind my nephew is 2 but he loves sending cars down loops and ramps)The quality is very durable, just like any other Hot Wheels track sets where you can bend and flex the pieces.-LOUD BoosterThis one came with a dual zone car booster (which adds thrust/speed of your traveling Hot Wheels car even faster). The booster is REALLY loud that it intimidates me and once I fed a hot wheels car into it my little nephew was hooked! All he wanted to do is feed the booster, however he feeds it an inch away from the booster which gives me more fear that one day he'll get his small fingers stuck in between the rollers and the gap.I can easily stop the rolling booster with my finger which will stop the rotation of the rolling bumpers on both sides, but I am an adult my nephew is not and his fingers are smaller than my pinky finger. I just removed the booster and will re-introduce it to him when hes much older and aware of how these boosters work.Each loop has a rubber band booster which resets every time a car passes through it, you dont have to reset it to allow a car to roll though the loop, however this rubber band booster just gives the hot wheels car additional momentum by hitting a flap which will slap the back of your hot wheels thrusting it into the loop. With enough momentum you can easily send a car around the loop without the rubber band booster. If you trigger this flap with your finger it will hurt (I have removed the rubber hand to prevent it hitting my nephews fingers)- Again my nephew is 2 and once he is 4 years old I will introduce the booster and rubber band slings -If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZ836RB49LY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ8MVMI#wasThisHelpful","RWZ836RB49LY2","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not sure what it will be like in the summer days.My walls are painted white and the contrast with black curtains do make me feel like I just put up a huge black panel on my windows.

I have a few of these and I always need one nearby.As for more indepth troubleshooting they have USB/Bluetooth/Wifi dongles which plug into your OBDII port and allow you to view graphs charts dyno etc. My personal preference I use USB to always ensure a proper connection.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26VY497LB7F7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LHVOVK#wasThisHelpful","R26VY497LB7F7E","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my nephew who has been fascinated with all Thomas toys and ive seen him play with the ones he currently has at home, however I was not aware that there are two versions of Thomas the train toys (wooden rail and diecast). Unfortunately my nephew had mostly diecast models and the wheels on the diecast are too narrow to fit onto the wooden rails.However the set itself was great and mainly the buildings is all that he plays with since he doesnt have any wooden trains besides the cheap ones that came with this set which hes not too fond of.He basically learned that the blocks were representations of houses and he builds them up then drives cars through them to watch them fall.

"I purchased this for my nephew and he loves it! It is Rear wheel drive so zipping this around your house is very quick and thus leads to having it get stuck under sofas and dinning room chairs.After about playing with it for 20minutes the signal wasnt as strong as it was out of the box, and taking it apart I noticed that there was a loose aluminum plate with a wire soldered onto it(antenna). I pulled it around and just taped it to the hood of the car and the signal was very quick and responsive when driving after that.Overall the price vs quality was worth the purchase, the remote and underbody of the car had a very cheap recycled plastic feel to it. However the main shell of the Ferrari was well built to stand against driving into a wall.Also after having my nephew drive this for an hour the siren did get a bit annoying.The front headlamps do light up whenever you press forward or reverse!Mine came in Black & White if you look at the attached photo.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376MYD01T9AK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACB9D1E#wasThisHelpful","R376MYD01T9AK0","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Firstly I must admit I waited until the battery price dropped to $150 on Amazon which is the cheapest ive found anywhere online (including autozone/advanceauto etc with coupons/rebates/gift card rewards etc).I made my purchase and it arrived in a well padded box and the battery was unharmed.The manufacture date had a sticker of 9/14 (I purchased this on 12/14), out of curiosity I tested the battery which was in good condition but it had a 50-75% charge. I attached a smart 3.5A charger overnight and by morning it was at 100%I used it to revive a dead battery to allow me to reconnect it to my smart charger with ease, which I then reconnected the Optima to my smart charger to get it back to 100% which took about 5-10minutes on a 3.5A smart charger.Not only did I get this battery at an amazing price I broke my UPS drivers back, he was not a happy camper having to carry it up 3 flights of stairs to my APT.Battery weighs 37lbs and 2oz, the duralast battery weighed 37lbs 8oz so I shaved about a good 6oz for more performance!But more realistically I picked the Yellow Top over the Red because I have multiple electronics in my car (TVs, sound, DVR, radar, etc) My engine bay however has a red and black theme. I may have to do a battery relocation into my trunk to hide the YELLOW and Gray (that alone would shave 37lbs off the front of my Maxima)If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XFHNVURTMAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MSDKMA#wasThisHelpful","R25XFHNVURTMAN","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been using Autozone batteries due to the convenience of being able to go to any Autozone and have them test and replace(if its still under warranty) without having to ship a battery etc.However with more research Ive realized that the Autozone branded batteries are probably one of the worst quality batteries you can buy.I must of had Autozone replace a battery under warranty once every year (I dont have a parasitic draw or a faulty alternator).Eventually I havent driven one car for almost 3 months and I believed that a simple jump would bring my battery back to life which it did however Ive noticed I would need a jump every week if I left it undriven.I tried to connect a SMART charger but the voltage was too low to even start at 6V, I then connected a good battery to my dead battery for an hour then had enough of a charge that my SMART charger would fully charge then trickle charge the battery.After about two days of charging I finally re-connected the Battery Load Tester and sure enough it was back to GOOD condition with 12.6V, did a LOAD TEST and it passed and the gauge went back to its original GOOD condition!As for the charger I purchased it off Amazon for a little over $25, the quality is okay and the cables are a bit stiff but with a heat gun to soften the rubber then re-adjust the orientation of the cables helped fix that issue right away.The clamps are copper but very very thin, the switch for the load test doesn't stay in the ON position to prevent end users from accidentally leaving a load test on thus creating a fire or melting something.The gauge is easy to read and since this is an analog gauge I would try my best not to drop it in fear of throwing off the gauge and thus giving me bad readings.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL0XOT9F8N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AMBOI0#wasThisHelpful","R2BL0XOT9F8N9","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When winter comes I usually dont drive as much as I do during the summer, so most of my cars are sitting majority of the winter.This bottle of HEET will treat my 20 gallon gas tank (16 gallons + 4 gallon reserve) to remove any water that may have accumulated over the year.The steps I take is I would drive until the empty gas tank light comes on, then I pull into a gas station pour an entire bottle of HEET into my tank then fill up my tank with gas. I pour HEET in first so when I pump gas into my tank it helps mix the HEET around the entire tank.The main reason water builds up in our gas tanks is the same as if you leave a half of bottle of water outside, condensation will build up in the empty space inside your tank and eventually will drip down into your gas.Best practice is to always have at least a half a tank of gas and fill up whenever you can.Also do NOT pump gas at the station when you see a gas truck tanker at the station, since in theory the gas tanker is there to deliver gas which will get pumped into the station which will cause all the old gas to mix in with the newly delivered gas.This will cause all the old sediments and dirt and water thats on the bottom of their station to mix into your gas pump.Yes there are filters in each gas pump however why still risk having unknown sediments from that gas station mix into your car.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S60DZZTCQECH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016GXNC4#wasThisHelpful","R2S60DZZTCQECH","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great simple tool thats easy to use and read.I use this mainly to test batteries NEW and USED, it tells me in advance on if I have any potential batteries that may need replacing.A great example would be my TV remote controller, it would work great on some days and horribly on others. I used the Amprobe BAT-200 to test both batteries on my 3 year old remote and sure enough one was in BAD condition while the other was in GOOD condition. I replaced the both batteries in the remote and kept the battery that was in GOOD condition in a separate box to use with other devices (ie. flashlights & other devices that I dont use on a daily basis).Once I have collected enough used batteries that are in GOOD condition I can then use this device again to closely match up the batteries since most electronics require more than one battery. Having a matched set of batteries in a device will always outlast a set of mismatched batteries.The build quality on the plastic does feel like cheap plastic however for the price you paid thats expected.The gauge is also great simple and easy to read but I would not want to drop it in fear of having the meter thrown off balance and thus giving me incorrect readings.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW1102FYVI2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G7SBY4#wasThisHelpful","REW1102FYVI2G","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I give these to my fish along with their meals.I like how this one has a opening spout where I can just slide the lid open a little bit and have a controlled sprinkle of worms.I might pour out half of the worms in double bagged ziplocks and keep it in the freezer since there is no way ill be able to finish a .42ounce bottle within 3-6months for 3 small fish.I might play around with it keeping some in a freezer then feeding it and keeping it out on my table in room temperature to see what my fishes prefer.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3FEGJV53GDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00025K1GQ#wasThisHelpful","R1R3FEGJV53GDA","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first actual aquarium filter I have purchased, I have no previous experience in building/maintaining an aquarium (freshwater).I have personally owned the small fish bowls here and there which houses a single betta for months, where I would change its water weekly without any chemicals/additives.My gf recently bought me a goldfish/betta/two algae bottomfeeders and I needed a tank (3gallon) so they can co-exist with enough space. However with 4 fishes means more poop and more uneaten food that will float around my 3gallon(12x12x12in) tank. This filter is the perfect size and flow for me.Ive noticed the build up of garbage around the main entry point of the filter which I can easily remove and wash and re-attach.I havent owned it long enough where I have to clean/change the inner filter yet.It does vibrate loudly every now and then and noticed it was the loose cover on top of the filter housing which was causing it to vibrate/rattle (sounded like the pump was going bad after a week of use but it wasent).You can adjust the flow rate of this filter and I normally keep it on low to medium since thats more than enough current going through a 12inch cube of water + fish.I use this with the Tetra 29095 Cube Aquarium Kit 3 Gallon which I had purchased for $20(on sale on Amazon). I use a sheet of paper towel to keep the filter spaced and mounted evenly to prevent vibration on the tank & filter.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWGX96XYHAS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VEWCMO#wasThisHelpful","R2DWGX96XYHAS7","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never actually purchased an actual fish tank of this size before, usually smaller cup sized tanks for goldfish/betta that would last months.However I saw it on sale from its original price down to roughly $20 shipped VIA PRIME.I figured Id purchase this for a Goldfish/Betta/2 Algae bottom feeders so they can co exist together with enough swimming space, and if raising fresh water fish isnt as enjoyable as others have expressed I only lost a $20 investment vs spending over a $100 on a larger tank.The quality is pretty much any $40-50 tank you would expect to purchase (clear acrylic cube and plastic black base). I dont use the included filter I bought the AZOO Mignon Filter 60 which seems to do a better job of filtering uneaten food/poop. I also dont use the LEDs since my office is clearly lit. The quality of the included filter and led light do feel cheap and fragile.The only downside was the lid is a bit warped(two corners dont touch) however with a heatgun and a few seconds of heat I can easily form it back so the lid sits on the top flush.Keep an eye out for price drops on this aquarium, great for younger kids who want to adventure out and start their own freshwater aquarium without hitting the wallet.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259I8NWBDHDVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CA7W7E#wasThisHelpful","R259I8NWBDHDVL","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its essentially $1 per sheet, and under normal conditions you would use 1 sheet every month. However if you use your shredder daily it is probably recommended to use two or more per month, but at this rate you're probably better off getting the oil in a bottle.Each sheet is sealed which has enough oil to lubricate your shredder. Which will help prolong the life of your shredderThe reason is so that the motor running the blades arent stressed with friction from paper bits that are still attached to the blades. Oil allows it to lubricate the blades and allow a smooth operation of blades when moving freely(without any paper being shredded).The only benefit is that anyone can use this and not have to worry about getting oil everywhere.I would recommend shredding a few documents first to line the bottom of the catch bin so the oil pieces dont get stuck to your bin.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22D6G42Z2TEDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KAX0S0#wasThisHelpful","R22D6G42Z2TEDW","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Price is a bit steep considering its a padded bag that retains its shape (due to the padding).However this bag does hold my MetroVac & DataVac(for dusting computers and inflating pool toys).There is a lot of space and pockets for all my attachments and accessories. You could also pick up the DollyCart for your MetroVac and an extension hose cord. Its build quality does almost justify the $50 price tag, however its still just a BAG.But since this bag is padded I can easily throw it into my trunk and it'll be the LAST thing I have to worry about when traveling. I dont have to worry about scratching or denting my vacuums when its being transported from one location to another.I also lend my vacuum to relatives and friends from time to time when they tell me they're detailing their car and it only assures me that when I lend them my vacuum everything will be exactly how I gave it to them.

"I purchased this on Amazon for $17.00 VIA Prime.Ironically this was cheaper than the Kids Toy version (which doesn't actually vacuum, just makes a whirring noise),Ive had an older house vacuum with a hose/dolly which was on its way out. I live with my 93year old grandfather which he doesnt use. Not that I make him clean the house but he does get restless from time to time and he loves using this because its so light.I might buy another to just give to my 18mo nephew so he can at least do some actual vacuuming when hes playing house at my sisters house.The build quality does feel like a toy however it does pick up fur/hair/paper bits/crumbs etc surprisingly well.

However due to its price and since this sits mainly on a desk to weigh packages I ship once a week it has been serving me well for well over two years.I would recommend this to anyone who ships packages every now and then VIA UPS/USPS to print their own labels, having an accurate weight on your packages only ensures you pay what you have to when you ship packages.Ive also tried to weigh a 5lb bag of white flour in a clear ziplock bag and its very accurate.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28LTWWUFFSRCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FSWB9K#wasThisHelpful","R28LTWWUFFSRCN","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great $40 electric toothbrush, I believe this is the older model however when compared to newer models the only noticeable difference is the size of the handle/battery (this one will last a month on a single charge and I brush twice daily).I still prefer this to the other $80 sonicare models because of the price mainly. I ordered this for my sister since I have the same exact one which I purchased at BedBathBeyond for a similar price.The heads are replaceable at an average cost of $10per head.My initial week of using electric toothbrushes did need some getting used to since your entire mouth is vibrating rapidly, but after that week I got used to it pretty quickly. Does come with base charger and travel pouch.However I still use the traditional toothbrush when I travel just to save weight in my bag and its noticeable when you switch between electric and hand toothbrushes, I subconsciously feel that my teeth are not as clean when I use the traditional toothbrush after using the Sonicare for the past 6months.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QF5Q81JXS2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081MQ47C#wasThisHelpful","R27QF5Q81JXS2G","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in NYC and my cars interiors/engine bay/trunk nooks get a lot of dirt.I used this to clean the very hard to reach crevices and cracks. Its super powerful and loud. It manages to lift the carpet off the floor of my car which could only mean its actually picking up all of the dirt.However if you do get this specific model you should also invest in a bag as well as a dolly because the straps provided require me to hold it like a purse when im cleaning the interior of the car so it doesnt swing around and hit the paint.If my review was helpful in any way please click the ""YES"" button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIZLKUVGGTA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002SDN7W#wasThisHelpful","R1UIZLKUVGGTA0","A1A9HOW7IW7PJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9HOW7IW7PJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lonely Planet's ""Discover New York City"" is another fantastic entry in the Lonely Planet travel guides.Like most Lonely Planet guides, this is a weighty book with high quality pages and half page photos on every other page with descriptive text so you know what to expect at your destination.  The guide is built to last so it will be something you can use for an extended period of time.The guide opens with a highlight of the key attractions of New York City, then breaks down into more detail sorted by location.Attractions are included such as a wealth of things to do and places to eat, but there are other excellent addon bonuses, too.  At the end of the book there is a ""Survival Guide"" which includes things such as places to find guaranteed electricity, public wifi, and information for travelers with disabilities.  There is even a small section for LGBT-friendly venues, to illustrate the amount of detail this guide has for virtually anyone.The guide concludes with a foldout map of New York City that includes a full street index and transportation info (including subway map) to ensure you are never lost in the big city.Highly recommended, a fantastic guide that is both portable and durable for anyone considering a trip to the big apple!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STIWFSPUTOT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742208975#wasThisHelpful","R2STIWFSPUTOT3","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before going into the details of this brewer, let me ask you a question:Do you own a iPhone or know anyone who owns an iPhone?  Is that person having a horrible experience due to Apple's closed ecosystem? Most likely not. Keurig, with Keurig 2.0, is attempting to similarly close the ecosystem on its coffeemakers much like Apple did on the iPhone.  Keurig wants control of and to get a cut of every K-Cup sold, just like Apple has control of and gets a cut of every App sold.I will explain first below what this all means to me, but please read the rest of the review also to get the details on this awesome machine that I purchased direct from Keurig.What this means is you can only use cups that are licensed by Keurig.  Meaning, imitation/unlicensed/bootleg K-Cups will not work with this machine.  I do not see the issue with this, though makers of these bootleg cups have started a lawsuit and are even taking out ads on YouTube to give Keurig 2.0 a black eye.  There are plenty of K-Cup brewers from other brands that will brew imitation/unlicensed K-Cups and they are much cheaper than this machine.  But the quality of those brewers and the quality of the imitation/unlicensed K-Cups may vary dramatically from Keurig's machines and licensed K Cups.  Heck, a non-Keurig licensed K-Cup could have toxins in it and there is nothing Keurig could do about it as they have no control over unlicensed K-Cups.  It also means you can't use your own coffee grounds - but why are you buying an expensive Keurig just to use your own grounds?? Doesn't it make more sense to buy a much cheaper traditional coffeemaker if that is what you want to do?  I call reviews implying these changes requiring licensed K-Cups in the Keurig are a nightmare scenario ""unfair"" as many ""reviews"" I have seen are just complaints about the new closed ecosystem rather than a review of the actual product beyond that complaint.  Further it appears many have not even contacted Keurig as they are replacing legit older K-Cups that do not work on this machine with newer ones that do work for free for the customer - all you need to do is call.Bottom line, Keurig wants to close its ecosystem to only use cups licensed by Keurig just like Apple and not support ""bootlegs.""  If you do not like it, there are a wealth of other options than this machine.  But I still recommend this machine wholeheartedly as it is Keurig's best effort to date, and Keurig will help you get new cups that work if you have a stockpile of licensed older ones that do not.I do understand some are passionate about the new closed ecosystem, and would like to hear and discuss with you your thoughts in the comments section of this review. Thanks!Some more details about the machine beyond the ecosystem:First, the compatibility with *licensed* Keurig pods is outstanding - it supports K-Cups (cheapest), Vue Cups (better flavor) and Carafe Cups (full pot of coffee).  K-Cups can be brewed from 4oz-10oz.  Vue & Carafe Cups can be brewed anywhere from 4oz up to the maximum carafe size depending on which number you select on the touchscreen prior to brewing (for instance 1=Carafe, 4=normal cup, 5=froth), though you really need a carafe cup if you want coffee that is not watered down at 22oz+ sizes.  Technically though if you use a Vue Cup you could brew a 32oz pot of coffee, though it would taste like water without a Carafe Cup - K-Cups on the other hand are restricted to 10oz max.  If you want more than 10oz, buy Vue Packs or Carafe Cups depending how much more you want to make; you can probably get away with 14oz on a Vue pack and still have a decent cup of coffee.The touchscreen is nice and the best of any Keurig to date, much more advanced than the Vue touchscreen due to having more customization options and better view angles.  The device is slightly taller and slimmer than a Keurig Vue but much lighter.  Still, it brews the best cup of coffee I have tasted from a Keurig, and it is also the best looking machine.The drip tray just pulls out and the carafe goes in, there is no button release.  This works well unless you plan to move the unit itself a lot, in which case you may find it falling out when you move the unit.  But if your coffeemaker stays stationary like most, this design is a lot easier to release the drip tray compared to previous Keurig coffee makers; this is a necessity as you need to remove the drip tray to use the carafe. which you will likely do frequently.The carafe the unit comes with is plastic and does not keep coffee warm for more than 10 minutes.  For a bit over $20, you can buy a steel thermal one from Keurig that keeps coffee hot for 40+ minutes, a worthy investment.The device has a customizable reservoir light which you can adjust to best accent your kitchen.  Time is displayed on the LCD screen and you can customize the color of that as well.  You can even set it up to brew you a cup or carafe of coffee at a set time, such as when you wake up in the morning.I have experienced zero issues.  No breakages, no spills, no problems.  It just works, and tastes great.Overall, this coffeemaker is the best Keurig has released.  It is a shame that is overshadowed by the fact that Keurig closed the ecosystem much like Apple did.  Machines like this cost a lot of money to research, develop, and market - and Keurig can sell it to you for a lower price if they know they will recoup some money on the pods.  But if you buy bootleg pods, Keurig gets no money from them and eventually this will likely result in having to pay a lot more for a quality Keurig machine or Keurig simply exiting the market.  Either option is not great, and frankly if you do not want to use Keurig K-Cups/Vue Packs/Carafes, I do not know why you are buying a Keurig in the first place.***NOTE: Some K-Cups and Vue Packs made prior to June of this year will not work on this machine.  HOWEVER, if you call Keurig's help line they will give you a one-time use coupon to redeem for an equal number of free replacement packs of your choice on their webstore.  Meaning if you have 50 packs that don't work, they will give you a coupon for 50 free packs - at least that is what they did for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1580HCGQWNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYWL6E8#wasThisHelpful","R2L1580HCGQWNX","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The United Solutions LN0309 is a taller than usual laundry tote with a movable strap that can be placed nearly anywhere on the basket due to its novel keyhole design.  This will allow easier and less awkward carrying of laundry loads.However, the basket's plastic seems exceedingly thin, moreso than I am comfortable with.  It is very thin and flexes with little effort; this combined with the tall sides and a lack of stabilizing lip on the top makes me wonder if this basket will hold up over time.  Perhaps the thin plastic is stronger than most plastics, but for now I am not confident this won't crack.  The thin plastic also digs into the hands when carrying via the handles instead of the strap.In short, great idea and neat design with the strap - but a more sturdy basket would have been preferred.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRB7Y64YUL8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL9HK9Y#wasThisHelpful","R3RRB7Y64YUL8Q","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable does exactly as advertised - it is a 25ft USB 3.0 cable that maintains highest speeds with no disconnect/instability issues.In fact, when you pair this cable with the ""Kinect for Windows"" adapter and an XBOX ONE Kinect 2.0 unit, you can get a total of a 34ft run from the Kinect 2.0 to the XBOX ONE - 9ft from the Kinect 2.0 into the Kinect for Windows adapter ($49.99 from Microsoft), then another 25ft from the Kinect for Windows adapter into the XBOX ONE.

In fact, I would say this is a competitor to the Surface Pro 3 and Yoga 3 Pro - but Dell offers a similar experience for much less money.Dell made some outstanding design choices with the Dell Insprion 13 7000 Series.  First off, is the luxurious feel - the material it is made of feels almost velvety in texture and appears to be some plastic/rubber hybrid.  If you have ever held a Lumia 1020, the texture of this Dell is very similar to that.  The design is very attractive as well with tapered edges that give the laptop a premium look - again resembling the Lumia 1020 ironically.The screen is a touchscreen that works quite well and has 180 degree hinges similar to the Lenovo Yoga.  This allows the screen to be positioned in many ways or completely folded over to be used as a tablet.  The tablet cannot be detached and it is too heavy to hold in one hand, but it works well for lap or table usage.  Picture quality is outstanding and has some of the brightest and crispest images I've seen on a 2-in-1.The keyboard is backlit and both it and the touchpad is very responsive.  Dell really nailed it with the design.  The only suggestion I might make is that Dell adopt a charging design similar to the Surface 3 Pro as it does not put as much pressure on the charging port as a traditional plug.Performance is excellent, and seems even faster than the Surface 3 Pro although I will be doing more tests later to confirm this.  Everything is very responsive and I will be updating this review with benchmarks and more impressions over time.This PC is also a ""Microsoft Signature"" edition, meaning it does not have the unnecessary bloatware that often accompanies new PCs.  I was very excited about this as it means less to uninstall and better performance out of the box.Connectivity is outstanding with 3 full size USB 3.0 ports, 1 full size HDMI port and 1 full size SD reader (fantastic for photographers).  This bests the Surface Pro 3 by far.The Dell comes with a capacitive pen that fits neatly within the chassis; while this is not as accurate as a digitizer such as that found on the Surface Pro, for less demanding tasks it will likely do the job.  However for more demanding tasks like taking notes on OneNote, you need a digitizer such as Surface Pro's pen as the Dell's capacitive pen will not do.Speaker quality is about average laptop quality, but better than what is usually found on a tablet.Overall, I am extremely pleased with Dell's new 2-in-1.  I believe Dell has hit the right price point and focused on the most important things to include.  In addition, they have done a spectacular job with the fit and finish, ensuring your PC looks good in addition to running good.Highly, highly recommended for those shopping for a 2-in-1.  The decision of the Dell Inspiron 7000 series vs. the Surface Pro 3 should boil down to whether you want a device that is primarily a laptop that can function as a tablet (Dell Inspiron 7000) or a device that is primarily a tablet that can function as a laptop (Surface Pro 3).

"This set comes packaged with the following:* Two paddles (natural wood finish with two-toned black/blue rubber coating on each paddle)* Retractable net* Three ping pong balls* Bag to hold paddles and ping pong ballsThis is a fine set.  What truly makes this set stand out is the well-engineered retractable net - it is extremely easy to setup on virtually any table size so long as the table is no thicker than 1.75"" and no wider than 6'.  The net pulls out and retracts very smoothly/quickly and uses spring-loaded pushbutton rubber-coated clamps to hold the net to the table - thus you can set your game up without needing to use awkward screw clamps that might damage your table's finish.  I tested and found the clamps to be stable even on a table as thin as 0.75""!  So, in summary, you can set this up on almost any table in less than 10 seconds, making it extremely versatile.  The only improvement I might recommend is a lacquer on the wood handle to make the paddles a bit more comfortable to hold, but they also would be more slippery if a coating such as that was added so I am not sure that is the best idea anyway.Overall, this is a wonderful value for the price and would make a nice holiday gift if you have a friend or relative who likes Ping-Pong.  I also think it would be a great set for parties due to its ease of setup and durability.

"The Diono Rainer Convertible Plus Booster with Adjustable Head Support arrived in a weighty cardboard box.  From the weight alone, I knew right away that this was going to be a quality product - and my intuition was spot-on.Opening the package, you are greeted with a well-packed booster seat that is basically fully-assembled (just a few minor elements to secure based on how you plan to use the seat).  Instructions are included that detail setup with both numbered steps and pictures, divided into sections based on how you plan to position the seat (varies depending on age of child).In terms of the cushioning quality, I only wish they made a car seat this comfortable when I was a child!  The material of the cloth feels soft yet durable with beautiful stitching to boot, and the cushioning feels like the memory foam you find on high-end mattresses.  I cannot express how premium the cloth and cushioning feels, and it looks very stylish as well (almost like a Ferrari seat.)  Surrounding the cushioning is thick metal and plastic to ensure maximum safety for the occupant.  Buckles and straps are of similarly high quality. The unit is literally built like a tank, yet includes features demonstrating the manufacturers attention to detail.Setup is quick and easy, with initial setup being an intuitive unfolding process and securing the seat to your car generally being a 4-step process (6-steps for some configurations).  Instructions are clear, detailed, and illustrated.Best of all, this is one device that will last you for some time.  It will work for both infants and young children, and every age in between.Overall, this appears to be one fantastic deal for the price.  While it does cost a bit more than other car seats, it is no doubt worth it given the premium build and materials.  As you will likely be using this seat for many years, does it really make sense to spend less for a seat that will wear out much quicker, be less comfortable for your child and be more difficult to setup?  I don't think that makes much sense, so if this seat is anywhere near your pricerange I would recommend pulling the trigger - I believe both you and your child will be extremely satisfied with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCLYWIC4T77L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS2QIK#wasThisHelpful","RQCLYWIC4T77L","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Best Place to be Today is colorful, informative, and overall fantastic book detailing events around the globe at the best times of the year to do them.  While it is impractical that one could actually use this book to plan event attendance on a daily or even weekly basis due to the events contained spanning the globe, it makes for a fantastic read and may give you some ideas for potential vacation destinations.  Or, simply to read about something interesting going on today you might not have known about thousands of miles away!As mentioned earlier, one of the books strengths is that it is very colorful, with half-to-full-page color photos contained throughout the book.  But, it also contains all the vital details of the event pictured as well as some interesting facts about it - so it is much more than just a book of interesting pictures.  Due to this, it makes a great coffee-table book.In summary, this is not so much an event planning book, as the events are spread too far in distance due to their global nature.

I do not find this to be an issue as the spatula never cleans everything up anyway, and hitting the surface with a paper towel does a much better job.One feature you might miss from more expensive Foreman grills is the lack of removable/washable trays in this device.  You cannot remove the tray and clean in the sink, instead you must clean the tray while it is inside the device.  On the plus side, this version has a lift built into the feet and does not require additional attachments to raise the rear legs like the original Foreman grill.Overall, this works well if you are in the market for a Foreman grill.  Removable trays would have been a nice touch to assist with cleanup, but I do not feel losing them is a dealbreaker.  Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BES5A8K7TDVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP3ZPVK#wasThisHelpful","R2BES5A8K7TDVG","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Canon VIXIA mini X enters the micro-camcorder space with a thunderous boom, as it offers fantastic user interface and flexibility that other devices of this form factor usually lack.The screen is a touch screen that can flip up, and even includes an accelerometer to ensure that the orientation is correct depending on its position.  This means you can use the screen as pictured aiming upwards, or you can flip it facing the back of the camera, or you can flip it facing the front of the camera.  It also works in all angles in between!  On top of this, the camera has an adjustable foot on the bottom to allow you to alter the angle of the camera.  Canon has obliterated the competition in user interface here and has set a new standard for other manufacturers to meet, I cannot reiterate how much better the interface is on this device than other devices in this class.In terms of microphones, it has two front-facing mics which should work great for most content.  The audio section completely blows away what you might hear in a GoPro.  I have used one Sony micro camcorder which has a slightly better audio section, but both are very satisfying.  A tripod mount is also included for optimal placement.The video quality is also fantastic, though the choice of lens may not work for all content.  Instead of choosing a rectilinear lens, this device uses a fisheye lens.  What this means is that straight lines may be curved near the edges of the frame.  While this works for applications such as sports, for other applications such as music videos or family videos the fisheye lens may be distracting.  The device also has an automatic lens cover when turning the device on/off which helps protect the lens when not in use.  Charging is completed with a proprietary cable, and while it is proprietary as a result it charges much faster than devices that use MicroUSB.So, in conclusion, the Canon VIXIA mini X is fantastic as long as the fisheye lens will not be a distraction for the type of content you plan to create.  For some types of content like sports, the fisheye lens is often actually preferred.  If this works for you, do not hestitate to pick up this device and remember to buy an SD card as the device does not include one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRIQANLFEZRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLDFUM2#wasThisHelpful","RMRIQANLFEZRN","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those starting out with photography often make the mistake of investing a large sum of money in ""high quality"" lenses and camera bodies, but fail to invest even modest amounts of money into the accessories that will allow them to get their most out of their equipment.The Datacolor Spydercube SC200 is an accessory that is definitely worth having if you wish to take your photography to the next level, as it is the ultimate white balance/grey card tool.  It is unique as not many manufacturers are making what is essentially a 3D white balance tool.  Simply, all you need to do is take a picture with this device in the scene prior to taking the photo you intend to take, and then use software in post to correct white/color balance following this.Using the Datacolor SC200 one can obtain an incredibly accurate whitebalance as the 3D nature of the cube gives your photo processing software more information than a flat grey card would - as it will essentially allow you to consider angle of light source. In addition, it will help prevent crushing blacks and blowing out whites given the multiple shades of color on the cube.The SpyderCube SC200 includes a tripod mount and also a loop to hang the device, giving you a number of options in placing the SC200.  The only other product I know of like this does not offer such flexible mounting options.The only downside to this product is that it may not be practical for all photo applications.  Every time you change the position of the camera or light source, you would need to take another photo with this in the scene.  So if you are frequently changing the location of the camera/scene, using this may be impractical.  However, for studio shoots or times when you will leave the camera in one spot for most of the shoot, this is an invaluable device to have in your arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEDAGMD1EYB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D4AHT0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEDAGMD1EYB7","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cash N Guns is like a game of cops and robbers, except everyone plays the robber in this game.In short, every game consists of 8 turns total.  Each turn goes like this:-Showing the players the available loot for the turn-Secretly selecting with a card whether you are going to load your gun with a bullet or a blank.  Each player gets 3 bullets and 5 blanks.-Selecting a target to shoot at with the included foam gun-Allowing targets to ""lay down"" (similar to folding in cards), if for instance you have 3 guns pointed your way-Flipping over the card which shows if you have a blank or a bullet in your gun-Players who get shot cannot collect loot for the turn and get a wound token, 3 wound tokens and you lose the game-Remaining players collect the loot (read the game rules for more info on this, as it is more involved)-Turn ends and next turn begins, repeats until 8 turns are complete-Player with the most loot who is still in the game at the end of 8 turns winsOverall, this is a tense and fun game, but you must make sure you have the right audience.  Some notes on this:-Some players in my game felt the minimum recommended age on the box of 10 years old was too low for this sort of game.  Some felt that 10 years old was too young to be pointing foam guns at friends and family members even if it was make-believe.  Perhaps 16-18 years old would be a better minimum recommended age.-Some players who are against guns in general may have an issue with this game obviously, since you are pointing foam guns at each other and shooting each other throughout the game.  So ensure players know beforehand what the game is going to be like.I have to give kudos to the company who made this as it is a risky move given the nature of the content.  However, for a group of college friends this game might be at the top of their list due to the fun and tense nature of the game.Highly recommended, but please make sure you have the right audience who can both handle this game and will not have an issue with the guns aspect of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4XDZAEIIE94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU10OUU#wasThisHelpful","R1H4XDZAEIIE94","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***CUSTOMER NOTE: The below review was written with consideration of the PC/Mac setup application which is not included in the box and is currently in beta testing.  Chad Thompson (Sr Director of Marketing and Product Mgmt) informed me that he was willing to assist users seeking the PC/Mac app by giving them access to the beta version.  His email address (which he was okay with me posting) is cthompson@logitech.com - please send him an email if you wish to have access to the beta version of the PC/Mac application.The Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home is the latest and most powerful universal remote released by Logitech's Harmony team.  With this remote, Harmony aspired to create not only a device that can control your electronics, but also home automation ""smart"" devices.  In some ways, Logitech was largely successful in achieving these goals; in other ways, Logitech still has a ways to go.In my opinion, the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home is ergonomically the best remote Logitech has released to date.  Some have commented that moving the transport play/pause/etc buttons to the top of the remote has made them more difficult to access, but I felt if holding the remote as intended it actually makes more sense this way.  While having the transport buttons at the bottom was best prior to the introduction of touch remotes, placing the buttons as close to the touchscreen as possible will yield easiest access.  Logitech has shaped the back of the Harmony Ultimate Home to make it easier for users to access all functions of the remote, and the balance is excellent.  Additionally, the remote's touchscreen allows for gestures (i.e. swipes) in addition to taps meaning that you can now control volume and other functions without having to take your thumb off the touchscreen if you wish.The specifications are also impressive.  The Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home allows for control of up to 15 devices including smart devices (thermostats, lights, etc) in addition to the electronics it traditionally allows for control of.  The remote operates on RF frequency meaning it will allow you to operate electronics that may be behind you or off to the side in a cabinet while still pointing the remote forwards.  The hub emits IR signals to your devices and if the hub is unable to reach your devices two IR blasters are included to supplement the hub.Thus, Logitech/Harmony largely succeeded in the features and specifications department.  However, the implementation of this device is where some may run into trouble.Upon release, the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home required iOS/Android in order to setup and use even the most basic of functions with the product, making it the first ever Logitech/Harmony product to exclude PC/Mac/Web setup.  In addition, WiFi access is also required for the hub to operate properly.  Since release, Logitech/Harmony has listened to user feedback and is working to make the remote more compatible to allow setup for users who do not own iOS/Android devices or simply wish to use PC/Mac.  Currently, a PC/Mac setup application is in beta which allows users to set up the Harmony in the traditional fashion.However, even with the beta PC/Mac application currently the Home Automation features are not available unless you own an iOS/Android device.  The only Home Automation devices that will work are the Nest Thermostat and Philips Hue lights.  Logitech/Harmony has communicated to me that they are working on moving the user interfaces in the future for all of the Home Automation devices to the remote to allow one to control everything from the remote instead of requiring you to switch to your smartphone; note that this feature is not yet available even in beta though, so it will likely be a significant wait before those without iOS/Android are able to use the product to the full extent.Yet, even after everything is moved to the remote sometime in the future, Logitech/Harmony to date has expressed no plans to develop for Windows Tablets or Windows Phones.  While some Windows tablets like the Surface Pro will be able to use the setup application, they will not be able to use the actual device interfaces like iOS/Android tablets.  Additionally, some Windows ARM tablets like the standard Surface will be completely incompatible with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home as the only available Windows setup program requires an x86 processor.  Windows on phones also will be completely incompatible with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home.  This is somewhat troubling as several other competing home automation products support all three major mobile ecosystems instead of just the two largest as Logitech/Harmony has decided upon. Note that at the bottom of this review I have included a list allows you to see what you can expect the remote to do based on the devices you own.In summary, the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home is a fantastic piece of hardware with software that is a work in progress.  Out of the box the device currently will not function at all without an iOS/Android device, however a PC/Mac beta application is available from Logitech/Harmony. Yet, even after said PC/Mac beta application is released, the user will still be unable to use all of the features of the remote without having an iOS/Android device.  In the future, Logitech/Harmony states this will change as they move functions to the remote, however this still fails to address support for the third major mobile ecosystem (Microsoft).I rate this product as 4 out of 5 stars due to the great hardware and potential of the device.  Hopefully, the promised features and applications that are unavailable to PC/Mac users out of the box will be publically released sooner rather than later.  And, if Logitech wishes to get that 5th star, I would recommend they develop applications for Tablets and Phones that run Windows.  As long as you are aware with the product's requirements and limitations prior to purchasing and are okay with them - and you are technologically saavy - this device will make a fine addition to your gadget collection!***DETAILED HARMONY ULTIMATE HOME FEATURES/REQUIREMENTS USING LATEST SOFTWARE SORTED BY USER DEVICERemote-only control with Windows x86/Mac PC setup-CAN control up to 15 Standard Devices via remote-CAN control Nest Thermostat and Phillips Hue Lights via remote-CANNOT control other home automation devices currently, but a future patch will allow for this per Harmony.iOS Smartphone/Tablet (i.e. iPhone/iPad)-CAN setup and control up to 15 Standard Devices-CAN setup and control Nest Thermostat and Phillips Hue Lights via remote-CAN setup and control other home automation devicesAndroid Smartphone/Tablet (i.e. Samsung Galaxy)-CAN setup and control up to 15 Standard Devices-CAN setup and control Nest Thermostat and Phillips Hue Lights-CAN setup and control other home automation devicesWindows on x86 Tablet (i.e. Surface Pro) [keyboard and mouse required]-CAN setup up to 15 Standard Devices, but CANNOT control them-CAN setup Nest Thermostat and Phillips Hue Lights, but CANNOT control them-CANNOT setup other home automation devices currently, but a future patch will allow for this per Harmony.Windows on ARM Tablet (i.e. Surface)-Incompatible with product in all aspects due to Logitech/Harmony not developing an app for this class of device.Windows on Phone (i.e. Lumia)-Incompatible with product in all aspects due to Logitech/Harmony not developing an app for this class of device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLV2TVRVSOH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3RFCBE#wasThisHelpful","R2RLV2TVRVSOH0","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a pro photographer, one thing that becomes clear very quickly is that costs can add up quickly.  Accessories such as camera bags, flashes, light modifiers, memory cars, batteries, ND filters and CPL filters can all be quite expensive!When I first handled the Case Logic DSH-103 Luminosity Large Pro DSLR Holster, the first thing I thought of was one of my go-to camera bags - the Think Tank Digital Holster 40 V2.0 - and that is a good thing, as the Think Tank is a high quality bag which is a similar style of holster carrying case.  The holster-type designs are compact and make more sense for daily use than carrying around one of the larger ""gadget bags"" or camera backpacks.  Like the specific Think Tank case mentioned, with the bottom fully expanded the Case Logic DSH-103 can hold a ""pro"" DSLR (i.e. full frame DSLR with integrated or user-attached battery grip) along with up to a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens with hood in shooting position or a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens with hood in reversed position.  A thicker lens like the Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6L should also fit fine in this bag.Case logic takes a similar overall approach with a top handle and shoulder strap.  There are several outer compartments - front, side and rear - giving this case more storage space than the Think Tank Digital Holster 40.  The Case Logic DSH-103 also includes a rain cover like the Think Tank case, and inner compartments to hold smaller items such as batteries and memory cards.  In addition, a velcro divider is included in case you want to use a smaller lens than the ones mentioned or to simply reduce movement in the bag.  When held, the Case Logic case also feels a bit better balanced than the Think Tank case.One large difference between the Think Tank Digital Holster 40 v2.0 and the Case-Logic DSH-103 is price; at the time of this review, the Think Tank product is $25 more expensive!  The extra cost does seem to prove worthy in some areas; the Think Tank product has smoother zippers and the case feels more rigid & sturdy, and the think tank product also can attach to Think Tank's belt systems in addition to being a standalone product.It is clear Case Logic has a winning product here.  They have created an experience that is very similar to one that costs much more money.  Now, while Think Tank does offer some quality improvements for that extra money, one must ask themselves if it is worth $25 for smoother zippers and more sturdy build.  In some cases it definitely might be, but if you are not a fulltime professional shooter I believe the Case Logic DSH-103 will do the job just fine for a lot less money.  After all, all those costly accessory prices add up to the cost you could be spending on a new lens!  Highly recommended for photographers looking for a great design without breaking the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQ0681GSWSGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYS10G#wasThisHelpful","R2NQ0681GSWSGJ","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OXO again has come through with a very well built product.  The grip on the handle feels very good in the hand, and overall it is of solid construction.  The Silicone on the spatula portion is thick and appears designed to hold up in the long run.  This is a great product even if you already have a wooden or plastic spatula, as the silicon is a bit more flexible which might work better in some applications.

"My beard grows at a rapid pace, and as a result I usually have to use a straight razor to take care of it.  That is, until I tried the Philips Norelco 9700 shaver.  While I have owned Norelco shavers in the past with tilting blades, this is the first one I have tried that works in getting the hard to reach spots under my neck - this is likely because the blades tilt two ways instead of one.  In fact, this razor cuts so closely and so effortlessly (no hair pulling, no razor burn) that I am now going to switch back to electric shaving after years of buying expensive straight razor refills.  In fact, I would say under my neck this actually does a better job that a straight razor, and I use expensive brand name straight razors.  The Norelco works well both on dry skin and wet skin, again different from electric razors of the past.The 9700 also comes with a cleaning system/charging station that is very convenient despite it being a bit bulky. This system allows you to place your razor in the holder after a shave and it will ensure it is cleaned to keep the blades in best condition.  While I would not say this is necessary, it is a nice feature to have; whether or not you would use it would be if you have the space on your bathroom counter for it - the cleaning station is about as thick as a 2-liter bottle of soda and a little more than half as tall.  You can also easily clean the shaver with water since it is waterproof, but the cleaning solution works a bit better; the solution lasts for 3 months and refills are about $5.50 a cartridge - but again note this is OPTIONAL, you can just use water to clean this waterproof razor if you'd like to.The display for battery is very useful as it gives you exact feedback on how much battery life is left.  Though, if you use the cleaning station it will keep the razor charged up for you so no worries about having a dead shaver.  There are also buttons on the shaver to set the shave speed in three settings - low, medium, fast.  Using medium I found the shaver gives an excellent shave without being too aggressive.The razor also comes with a detachable beard trimmer - pulling off the main heads and attaching the beard trimmer is very easy.  However, I think a future model could improve upon the design by including an area on the cleaning station that holds the beard trimmer.  As is, since it is a loose part it may get lost easily - so I put it in the included shaver case to ensure it does not get lost.In summary, the Norelco 9700 has finally caught up with and in my opinion surpassed straight razors in terms of closeness of shave, and it does so while offering a more comfortable shaving experience.  While this razor does include a ~$22 year maintenance cost in changing the optional cleaning fluid, this is not required and you can just use water if to clean the razor - moreso $22/year is a lot less than you would be spending on straight razor blades.Well done Norelco, with the combination of close shave, comfortable grip, and overall fantastic shaving experience you have converted me back to electric shavers with this product!UPDATE: It has been a month using the product, and it is still performing as good as it did out of the box.  This is likely due to the cleaning system which reduces the oil buildup on the blades.  I generally use it when my face is dry to get the closest shave and this razor has remained my daily driver!UPDATE #2: I am still using the product regularly after some months.  However, I am alternating usage with a traditional razor depending on whether my face is wet or not.  If my face is dry, the Norelco is used as it does the best job; if my face is wet, I use a traditional razor as the Norelco does not shave as closely when my face is wet.  Still the best electric razor I've ever owned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336TB1Z24ZXNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1E5FU8#wasThisHelpful","R336TB1Z24ZXNT","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always in search of authentic and great novels for students to read.  Sparkers by Eleanor Glewwe certainly did not disappoint.  Glewwe did a wonderful job of creating a story that takes the reader on a mythical journey to another world.  I was engrossed from Sparkers from day one due to this and also the fact that it touches on some of the social issues people are facing today.  Sparkers has complex yet relatable characters that would appeal to readers of all ages.  If you have a young adult reader you were thinking of buying this for, it will certainly keep them engaged and enthralled to the very end of the book - it may also get them to think about how some of the issues the characters are facing in the book might apply to our society today.

"In Catch Phrase Decades, two teams (2 players per team minimum) are pitted against one another to see who is best able to communicate with their team member in order to have them guess the word being described.  If your team member can guess the word you are trying to describe, you pass the unit to the other team and they have to start with a new word; this goes back and forth until the buzzer sounds on the unit, at which point the team who is not holding the unit gets a point, or two points if they can guess the word the losing team could not.  You are not allowed to say part of the word being guessed, a word that rhymes with the word being guessed, or the first letter of the word being guessed.In other words, it is a variation of The $20,000 Pyramid that alternates between teams.  This particular version of Catch Phrase is divided into decade categories from the 70s-10s.  I found the words to be unique and appropriate for each decade category, although there are a lot of names that range from political figures to TV shows - so it is more challenging than the original Catch Phrase.In terms of the unit, build quality is very good with strong plastics that look like it will hold up over time.  Buttons on the unit work well, and it requires 3 AAA batteries (not included) to power.  I really don't have any complaints with the functionality of the unit, other that if you make a mistake adding team scores you need to clear the scores and start over (holding both team score buttons) instead of just having plus/minus point buttons.Overall, a fun game to play with friends and family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XBI90SKFGHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFWSMO6#wasThisHelpful","R21XBI90SKFGHY","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you look on Amazon, you will find two versions of Twister.  Hasbro (who owns Twister) apparently decided that Twister needed a makeover, and released a new version with modern box art and a circular spinner; however, they licensed the classic box art and spinner design to the company Winning Moves, who manufactures this version of Twister with the classic art.  The Mat is also slightly different in its lettering style and placement.I have not tried the other ""remixed"" version of Twister so I cannot speak to how the two compare in terms of build and quality, but this version is everything I remember Twister being.  Personally, I like the this classic design better than the new design which just seems a bit generic.Bottom line, if you want the classic Twister box and spinner artwork, get this version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6BF2F71JW0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVTH2MC#wasThisHelpful","RA6BF2F71JW0B","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fantastic product to ensure your lenses are autofocusing product and apply AFMA if they are not.Yes, you can get a somewhat similar result by printing your own chart off the internet and using that as a reference, but the Datacolor SpyderLensCal is much superior as it offers a high quality plastic that will not bend like cardboard and is extremely easy to setup.In addition, this product offers both the ruler and directly next to it a high contrast target; this can help if the autofocus center point of your camera is not sensitive to horizontal lines, as is the case with many cameras (even some high end ones).With this, I was able to confirm my f/1.2 lenses were autofocusing properly, and I found testing with this product easy and repeatable.  It has a tripod mount as well.Overall, a great buy and the durable plastic is much nice than the flimsy cardboard competing systems in the same pricerange offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WGZOYBFB6GM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041L3JS4#wasThisHelpful","R1WGZOYBFB6GM6","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not acceptable QC for such an expensive lens.Also, it would have been nice to add IS to this lens for video use again given the cost.  However, for photos IS in this focal length is much less crucial than say in a 70-200.If you want the best of the best 24-70, though, this is the one to get.

"While there are Canon wide lenses that offer superior corner performance such as the TS-E lenses, this lens is nice as it offers a flexible focal length range of 16-35mm.  This allows you to capture everything in the ultrawide-wide focal length.  Thus you are not risk at missing a more close-up opportunity when trying to get in an ultrawide shot.Sharpness wise, it is a compromise most definitely, but it is worth this compromise for the extremely useful zoom range of this lens.Recommended, unless you need edge-to-edge sharpness - where I'd recommend a TS-E lens instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32O17XLX52VAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NP46K2#wasThisHelpful","R32O17XLX52VAX","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lens is a massive, eye-opening improvement from the original EF 24mm F/2.8.  Sharpness is dramatically improved, flare reduced, improved color, and IS added.  At this focal length, IS is less useful for general shooting, but still can be used for certain types of specialty shots and video.Also, while it is not as sharp as the EF 24-70 f/2.8L II in the corners at f/2.8, it is MUCH smaller and lighter than that lens.  And, at f/4 and above (where you'd most likely use it) it basically matches the performance of the EF 24 f/2.8L II and EF 24 f/1.4L.  In fact, in some ways it exceeds them in terms of being much less prone to flare than either of the more expensive L lenses.Thus, I am quite impressed with this lens.  It is not the best quality 24mm that exists, but it certainly is the best under $1000 and it offers a level of portability that higher priced 24mm lenses do not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBQF83VKPICA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076BNKOY#wasThisHelpful","R1HBQF83VKPICA","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cyberlink PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is the top of its class, currently competing against offerings such as Nero Video, Corel VideoStudio, and Adobe Premiere Elements.  Unlike those other offerings, Cyberlink here was able to offer both a wide featureset and a high level of polish.  Nero and Corel both have a good (though not as comprehensive) featureset, but are not quite as intuitive to use, while Adobe Premiere Elements seems a bit light in the feature department.  Cyberlink's offering appears to better balance features, polish, and stability.While it is at the top of its class, I did not give PowerDirector 12 five stars as it is missing numerous filters that would be of use to professional videographers.  Thus, this software is not a low cost substiture for professionals - but it does get the job done for enthusiasts, amateurs, and semi-pros.  Professionals would still want to go with something like Adobe Premiere Pro CC.

"TAPPLE is simple yet loads of fun.  It is similar to Scattergories, except without the need for pencils, paper, etc.  And, this game requires you to think more on your feet.Very simply, one must think of all the words that fit into a given category, and players go turn by turn naming a word eliminating a potential letter each time.  You have only 10 seconds to answer, so sometimes something really obvious might escape your mind due to the pressure.  The game makes a tick-tock sound for the 10 seconds which can rattle some players!The great part about this game is that it is fast paced and does not require any setup.  Just pull out the cards and go.  The bad part I would say is very easy for someone to make up an answer/cheat and you don't really have time to call them on it due to the 10 second timer.  Of course, you can always deal with cheaters as you wish! ;)Anyway, highly recommended for fun times without all the setup/cleanup hassle of many board games.

"UPDATE: Dell still has not yet fixed the Windows 8.1 driver bug as of 3/8/14.  The problem is quite obvious, sensor indicators show that the accelerometer only recognizes one X/Y axis in Windows 8.1, while both X/Y axis work with the Windows 8 drivers.  So, unless there is a firmware driver update or new release for the accelerometer, this laptop's rotational capabilities will continue to be hindered in Windows 8.1.NOTE BEFORE READING: This review will be updated potentially with a 5-star review if DELL is able to rectify the significant problem this tablet has with the new Windows 8.1 update; I am currently working with Dell support towards a solution. However, at this point in time, I cannot give it more than 3 stars due to the severe nature of the bug.***DELL has created quite an innovative product here, with a screen that can flip - allowing you to convert the laptop to a tablet or work on the backside of the screen. So if you were sitting behind a desk and had a coworker on the other side of the desk, you could theoretically just flip your screen and show the coworker your work with ease. This allows for positions similar to the Lenovo Yoga, except Dell's design has more engineering grace than Lenovo's - when in tablet mode, the Lenovo has its keys on your lap while the Dell simply has the bottom of the machine.  Also, to use the screen backwards, the Lenovo requires an awkward balancing act while the Dell just flips.  So all of this is good, EXCEPT that this machine has a massive bug with Windows 8.1 which has a 7+ page thread on Dell's support forum right now as it affects all users.  Unfortunately, this bug is with the innovative screen; with Windows 8.1 when the screen is flipped, 80% of the time one of two things happens - either it will flip the wrong way (into portrait mode instead of secondary landscape), or it will not flip at all becoming nonresponsive.  This is with all of the latest updates and even a hotfix Dell made available, none of which resolve this issue.  This puts a huge dent into the score as one might imagine, since the screen flipping is one of the primary draws of this device - if you are not going to use it, you might as well get a regular laptop.  I will update this review on this aspect if Dell remedies the problem, which will likely require new drivers or firmware for the accelerometer.That rather unfortunate issue aside, lets talk about some of the other aspects of this laptop.  The weight is good for a laptop, but feels MUCH heavier than the typical 10.6"" tablet - of course this is a 12.5"" laptop with a full Intel Core i5 processor and a real SSD, thus more weight is to be expected.  Overall, for a laptop the weight and size is good enough, as one would likely not be using this device as a portable tablet - it is more designed to be used as a primary PC workhorse.  The build is solid, even the flipping screen looks like it could withstand some abuse.  Screen quality is beautiful.The processor is one of the more power-efficient Intel Haswell processors, though not the most power efficient Y variation.  Still, battery life is great at 8 hours, approaching tablet offerings despite the dramatically horsepower improvement the Dell XPS 12 offers.  It comes with Intel HD4000 graphics, and overall this laptop is FAST!RAM is at 4GB, which is a bit on the skimpy side for the amount this costs.  I would have liked to see 8GB as standard given this tablet's cost and the fact that the RAM is not upgradable; another option could be making the RAM socketed so it is user upgradable, as more demanding applications such as video editing will be bogged down by 4GB.  However, most typical work software like Office and Photoshop will do just fine with 4GB.Storage is a bit rough on this laptop as well, but doable.  The SSD is an mSATA 128GB drive, with no SD slot in the laptop.  So, if you did need to increase your space you would have to open the lid and replace the SSD, which is not an easy effort for a novice. So again, make sure 128GB will be enough for you, if not get the 256GB model.  Or, you could upgrade the drive if you are an expert, but this may void the warranty.  128GB might be fine for a tablet, but this is likely going to be someone's primary machine given the weight and size, thus I think it is a bit on the small size for this market.One other note on lack of SD slot - I am a photographer thus I use SD cards all the time.  But, the SD standard is constantly changing, so it is very possible an SD reader this year will fail to read the fastest cards released 2 years from now.  So, though this lacks SD slot, in my opinion this is not a huge deal since it likely would be rendered outdated in time, requiring an external reader anyway.  The two USB 3.0 ports ensure your card reader has speedy transfer rates, I used a Lexar Pro SD/CF reader with this model.Keyboard is simply fantastic, I love using it.  The trackpad is good, and I had no issues using it at all.So the final question, should you buy it?  If Dell can fix the screen rotation drivers for Windows 8.1 and you are looking for a powerful laptop with flexible screen display options, the answer is a resounding YES!  This laptop just feels great all around.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a tablet to handhold, this device will be too heavy for you - I'd recommend instead the Dell Venue 11 Pro, which is available with a similar CPU and is a lot lighter but with smaller screen.In the end, though, until those screen rotation drivers are fixed it is difficult to recommend this laptop to anyone. It is frustrating when you spend a large sum of money on something and the main selling point fails to work anywhere near as well as advertised, and this is evident in the Dell support forums right now.  If Dell can fix this one problem, I would easily give this 5/5 stars.  Will keep everyone posted and update the review if/when there is a fix!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SR9EXVS0NJN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3ZNQXU#wasThisHelpful","R3SR9EXVS0NJN8","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot describe how wonderful the picture quality is for this camera.  Photos come out spectacular even with extreme low light circumstances, and the center point works great for focusing in low light; using a 70-200 f/2.8 paired with this camera I am able to take pictures in near total darkness and still get ability to autofocus w/ output images nearly free of noise.  It has a large enough buffer to take bursts of RAW+JPG without slowing down like cheaper cameras, and build quality is fantastic.  This camera feels great in the hand!In terms of weaknesses, the autofocus system on this camera is dated with 11 autofocus points only 1 of which is cross-type.  This means it has far less cross-type sensors than a Canon Rebel T5i which costs less than half the price.  That being said, the autofocus does work fine for weddings, regular people shots, and landscapes.  In a scenario with sports or one that requires constant tracking, you will likely be disappointed, though.  So if you want a sports camera, this is not it!  For other general events it is great.Another weakness is the lack of joystick or touchscreen.  This is an issue as previewing pictures is a bit of a chore using the directional arrows to zoom around images.  If the camera had a touchscreen or joystick, moving the zoomed area around would be much easier.  The lack of joystick also makes changing the autofocus point more of a hassle, though you probably want to be using center point only most of the time.Finally, contributing to the loss of a star was the EOS Remote Utility. The PC version was a bit of a hassle to install (you need to turn off your firewall to link it up) and there is no app for Lumia Windows Phone & Surface 2 which is disappointing.In summary, the output of this camera is incredible as is the build quality.  But a dated autofocus system and clunky interface means it is no replacement for the 5DIII.  Still, for the money it is an excellent deal, so I would give it 4/5 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JSB15VN2LSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B0MZ8U#wasThisHelpful","R8JSB15VN2LSR","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hobbyists,  enthusiasts, and hikers might want to consider the 70-200 f/4L IS or 70-300 f/4-5.6L IS instead.

"While one may be tempted to buy a third party battery due to the high price of a Canon battery, spending money on a real Canon battery is a VERY wise investment.Third party batteries may not hold as much of a charge, may require more frequent replacement, and can even cause fires and equipment damage.

"This flash is a winner.  I actually have three of them!  By using the radio transmission feature of this flash, one can link multiple 600EX-RTs together without needing any optical path between them.

"This is a fantastic keyboard for Windows 8.1, especially when paired with a traditional mouse such as the Logitech Touch Mouse T400.  Using the trackpad on this device for gestures/scrolling/pinch to zoom and then a traditional mouse for work that requires more precision, you will have a wonderful Windows 8 experience.  While most keyboards are too large for this type of setup, by eliminating the numpad, a trackpad was able to be fit.  Thus, you can get the gesture control of a trackpad and buy an additional mouse for pointer precision.

"While this device may not aerate as well as a more expensive battery powered aerator, it does a fine job at passive wine aeration.  I did a blind taste test and was easily able to identify the wine that was aerated with this device.  In addition to aerating wine, it also acts as a pouring device which has less chance to spill than just pouring wine regularly.  Finally, the device functionally works quite well, inserts/removes easily yet snugly, and is easy to clean - just run under hot water.If you are in the market for an aerator and want to try something a bit different, give this a shot - it does the job and makes pouring easier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Y9SX5HBMXYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZA2150#wasThisHelpful","R22Y9SX5HBMXYI","A1UL2JH7XOUGM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UL2JH7XOUGM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Mead organizer is for the most part high quality and very functional.  There was some stray ends in the stitching, but nothing that effected the product.  One can use this for various functions, such as having a pouch for each individual student or perhaps different subjects.  Overall I really liked this product, but I deducted one star because it failed to include labels that would properly fit the pouches.  Thus, one must cut out their own labels - which is not a huge deal, but it would look more professional if it came with pre-cut labels that fit the product like the other Mead product I reviewed did.

"I have never been the kind of person who people would describe as a ""motivated self-starter."" I'm more the type of person who puts off doing exercise or who would rather let someone else at work lead a project. But, I realized that my lack of motivation was leading me down a path of mediocrity. I needed a ""jolt"" and Shawn Doyle's Jumpstart Your Motivation gave me 10 of them. After reading this book and applying the principles outlined, I have been able to lead a much happier and more successful life. I have taken on more duties at my job (an advertising firm) and I have been promoted once and am up for another promotion in the near future. I exercise more and am generally brighter and cheerier. Waking up is no longer a chore for me.In my search for motivation, I also found a book by the name of 21 Things You Should Give Up To Be Happy. Most people don't like to give things up, but if you read this book, you'll understand why letting some things go is a valuable component of a healthy, happy lifestyle. No, this book isn't about giving up your TV. Its advice is much more practical. One of the chapters in the book is entitled ""Give Up Complaining."" It's easy to get into a spiral of whining and moaning and groaning, but complaining will get you nowhere. Making an actionable change to your situation is the best way to avoid complaints of any kind. For instance, if there was a 1-ton boulder headed straight toward you, you wouldn't just complain it away. You would move and let it pass by. Sometimes, finding that motivation to get out of the way isn't easy, though.That's why having both of these books is an important step to finding motivation and finding happiness. I know that I am a considerably happier person because I've found these books. Don't be like me and sit around and wait for life to happen to you. There are plenty of things you can do to jumpstart your personal and professional lives, and the answer may be in these books. I know the answers were there for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361NSNIOIFUKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SZ48TQ#wasThisHelpful","R361NSNIOIFUKT","A3T66KHK2VAJ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T66KHK2VAJ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Favorite Quotes:“There was a visceral connection between them, forged in betrayal and hate, and – despicable though it was – it belonged only to them.  There was a heat to hate, and intimacy to it that made her heart race, a passion to it that attracted her like a doe to a salt lick.”“I can’t think about anything but you.  I dream about you.  I have imaginary conversations with you.  I go to YouTube and replay that press conference kiss over and over again to torture myself because I can’t get enough of seeing you in my arms, melting into me.”“She didn’t realize it took only a few perfect words for a heart to grow wings and soar, but hers did… In three short sentences he’d given her the greatest compliment of her life, and she took a moment to bask in his words and feel them from the top of her head to the tips of her toes… before reality set in.”“She’d been raised in a place of want.  Of just enough and no more.  She’d never known what it felt like to wildly fantasize about something you really wanted and then to actually receive it.  But if this was it, it felt like being launched up into the night sky and floating, soaring, free-falling back to earth, all the while knowing you’d land somewhere soft.”“I knew I loved you because I was willing to get hurt… And I knew because the minutes I spent with you made all the other minutes feel empty.”My Review:Katy Regnery is my Go-To author when I am in need a pick me up or something sweet.  She has never failed to give me that highly desired HEA.  Her writing is so smooth and has such a nice flow that it is essentially effortless to read.  Not that her stories are all sunshine and rainbows for the characters, but the observations are always insightful and the endings are always satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZW56UBSR6DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147D771A#wasThisHelpful","R3SZW56UBSR6DR","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“He had a pirate smile, the kind that you’d mortgage your house for; just to be able to afford the gold teeth in his mouth.”“I waved my arms like helicopter propellers.  My hips began to do the hula hoop… The crowd was now staring at me as I dominated the dance floor.  His eyes went from cautious to shocked as I abandoned the helicopter hula for the running man and a pathetic attempt at the Roger Rabbit.”“‘If you think about things more than you should, sometimes what you have is ruined because you over-think the things that can’t possibly be real.  This’ – he touched my heart and then his ‘-is real.  Let’s not ruin it by thinking.  Let’s just be.’”“The kiss was slow, warm, and tasted better than any food I had ever put in my mouth.”My Review:I am struggling to gather my opinion on this book, I loved it and a few times I laughed aloud and had to stop reading to wipe my eyes.  I reveled in Ms. Welch’s humor and word play.  The plot was enjoyable though admittedly outside of my typical fare, as I seldom read religious or paranormal material and this story had elements of both, but oddly those elements were not what bothered me.  While I adored the first 75% of the book, I grew increasingly restless and frustrated with the main character and her dithering and angst, and just wanted to give her a slap to the back of the head.  But the ending… the ending left me totally conflicted.  While it was somewhat of a happy ending, it wasn’t the one I was hoping for.  However, I must humbly bow down in reverence to Ms. Welch – she held my attention and has mad skills.  More than anything else, I have an overwhelming desire to take a trip to New Orleans and ride a streetcar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNM916ROHSLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQG0BW2#wasThisHelpful","R1HNM916ROHSLO","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“I’m a guy, we’re much better at assessing women’s bodies than women are.”“You’ll have to turn away now while I inhale the rest in a most unladylike way.”“She didn’t want to fall asleep in front of Trey, only to end up with her mouth hanging open and snoring sounds coming out.  Or worse, drool.  That would be horrifying.”“Sometimes I wish I could freeze time in a perfect moment and stay there.”“So, I’ll know to wait until right after sex to ask you for anything I really want.”“Pulling the covers over her head, she lay very still, wishing for death.  Or a time machine.  Or death.  That would be god right now.”My Review:I adored this sweet and tender love story until they became stubborn, tragic, and angsty and just broke my heart… but then I adored it again and all was right with the world.  I enjoyed this couple as until they got all dug in with their opposing positions - they were fun, smart, clever, and open with each other, but then they lost sight of themselves.  I was engaged by their sweet and steamy relationship and humorous banter.  I delighted in most of their story, but with him being a bit of an adrenalin junkie that gets caught up in the thrill of the moment, and her being distrustful and resistant to change, I wasn’t sure they were going to have a HEA.  My heart was wrenched!  Ms. Summer’s tortured them considerably before a bull horned in and made things clear.  But I have truly relished this entire series, Ms. Summers has skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9FIPOYC3Y4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WUDLEE#wasThisHelpful","R2V9FIPOYC3Y4A","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“You’re mine Harlow.  Your heart, your body, you… all mine.  And that drives me crazy some days.”I never judge another woman’s choice in a man because I’m not the one walking in their shoes.”“I experienced a mixture of horror and satisfaction, and it felt wrong to be kind of satisfied at his pain, but after being threatened by two men in the last two days, I was all for them hurting.”“I’ll marry you and be your wife, but a piece of paper doesn’t make any difference to the fact I’m already yours.”“FYI, I’m marrying the Coleminator.  I’ll be sure to send you an invitation so you can drool.”“I knew I should have called in sick.  Listening to your sexcapades with those Storm men may just kill me today.”My Review:I love a dual POV and Command gives us both sides.  Scott Cole is a bossy, moody, and cranky President of a biker club, but he is a soft sweet pussy cat for his precious Harlow James.  He cannot speak without swearing and generally talks in a growl, but he protects every hair on her head.  They have great passion and sizzling chemistry, as well as geography, history, and any other subject you want.  The sensual scenes are sizzling but the suspense and intrigue are center stage in this volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJSDUSL5ENJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S4KBDU#wasThisHelpful","R3DJSDUSL5ENJN","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided with Marrying Mr. English by Katy Regnery as part of this anthologyFavorite Quotes:“It occurred to Tom that he should stop staring at her, but he couldn’t. It was the first time she’d smiled at him, and his heart thundered from the way it made him feel to see her face light up. She was young and bright and ridiculously beautiful, and he’d been captivated from the first moment he’d laid eyes on her.”“Her eyes had watered as he confessed that he wanted to help her. She wasn’t the type of girl who’d had much help in life – no lucky breaks, no windfalls, no happy twists of fate. Not until Tom English had walked into her life… And suddenly she heard herself whisper, “You’re something between a dream and a miracle… E-Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote that,”“And she was his wife. The words circled in his mind as he watched her: This goddess-angel is my wife. In the eyes of the law, she belongs to me, and I belong to her.”My Review:I have said it before and I can almost guarantee I will state it many more times - I adore Katy Regnery. The hardest task I face in reviewing her superbly written work is deciding on which favorite quotes to include, as I always have several pages of them earmarked. Her books typically contain the magic formula with all the ingredients that I highly desire… a HEA - check, sweet and steamy love story – check, interesting and likable characters – check, wit and humor – check, clever dialogue and banter – check, a well written story and interesting plot line – check and check. And she makes it seem oh so easy.

"Favorite Quotes:“Ryan smiled and turned her hand over in his placing the red toy in her palm.  ‘It’s a compass.  Keep it with you always.  In those moments when you feel lost, alone, or confused, pulled it out and let yourself remember.  Let this compass lead you back home.  Let it lead you back to me.  Forever and always, okay?’”“Are you kidding me?  For a man, age equals distinguished.  A woman – well, you’re just decrepit.”“Love’s not supposed to hurt.  It’s supposed to free you, to lift you higher.  To make you fly… You said you’re afraid of falling.  I’m not going to let you fall.  I’m going to make you soar.”“Ryan was the other half of her soul… He was the piece of her heart that was never hers to give.”My Review:The prize from a box of Cracker Jacks of a red toy compass on her moving day becomes the touchstone piece in this delightful and heartfelt second chance love story.  A teen-aged girl must move away far away from her life-long best friend/neighbor/untold first love, following the discovery of her father’s infidelity and parents’ divorce.  She is crushed by her father’s betrayal and develops a distrust of men as well as insecurities about relationships and her ability to have one.  Years later, a new job places her in a new city where she becomes reacquainted with her father and old friend, and she is forced to reevaluate and rethink her conclusions and face her own misconceptions shaped during her youth.  The plot was interesting and unusual as the teen-aged male is the scrawny geek friend while the girl is a popular cheerleader – which is typically not the norm in romance books.  The story was amusing and entertaining, and the writing was well paced and insightful with sparkles of humor and occasional steam.  The characters were smart, well developed, and likable.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and remained engaged and interested from beginning to end.  This was my first read from this Ms. McDonald and I so greatly enjoyed her style that I have added her entire library to my ever expanding TBR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9D52CMETPT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692562710#wasThisHelpful","R2K9D52CMETPT6","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Heavy themes are addressed and the suspense is rather taut, yet the humor is always there - cleverly laced into the story, and it works so well.

"Favorite Quotes:“Ironic, that the pleasure of life can trick us into affection, and then need.  Sun, food, sex, everything we enjoy we can enjoy too much.”“I’m a closet singer.  I’m pretty much unmatched in the shower.”“The sky is rouged with pinks and scarlet shades.  It’s as if this moment in time was staged for maximum effect. As if we’re in a painting…”“I see the same smile of his face as I have on mine.  It’s as if we discovered the Fountain of Youth, the buried treasure of Sierra Madre and the location of Shangri La.”“I’ve come to believe people are placed in our lives for a reason.  Each a teacher or a student.  You either have something to learn from them, or they from you.  Many times I find it’s both.”“No matter how old we are, women love to talk about their boyfriends.  It’s hysterical really.  If you didn’t know we were in our thirties, you’d swear we were sixteen.”“He just looks in my eyes.  I let the moment be still.  Something tells me to let this moment be about more than words.

"Favorite Quotes:“And by no stretch of the imagination could what just happened be called sex.  Sex doesn’t make skyrockets go off in your brain, doesn’t make every single nerve ending in your body come alive.  I have never – ever – felt anything close to that before.”“I would say – in my inexpert opinion, mind you – that what just happened was really, really incredible, toe-curling, mind-numbing, earth-shattering, out of this @ing world, hot, hard, dirty sex.  But… since I’m far from an expert on the matter – and not very experienced – I’d say we need to have several repeat performances before I could say for sure.”“Gordon was something of a cross between a stuffed shirt and a pompous ass,”“He kissed her as though he was starved for the taste and feel and smell of her – because he was.”“Meeting you for the first time… was like getting hit square in the chest with a thunderbolt.”My Review:Sensational was my first Janet Nissenson experience, and soon after beginning, the quality and skill of her craft was readily apparent.  The characters were unique, powerful, and well defined, and I adore a feisty and ballsy heroine.  The story was extensively and richly detailed, and incredibly sensual.  I enjoyed most of the characters and their humor, and clever wit.  The two main characters shared an intense and passionate chemistry that was mishandled by poor judgment – or was it?  Maybe Ben’s fears were not groundless and he had a point, but he didn’t go about making it well.  I grew a bit frustrated with the middle of the story when it seemed to stall and retread back on itself into a rather angsty loop – which admittedly is not my favorite trope - but the first and ending quarters were stellar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVZXUVQDRMKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153ZMBR6#wasThisHelpful","ROVZXUVQDRMKF","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Besides, you’re not a secretary, Shel, you’re a badass office Pricktator.”“I clench the fork in my hand like a @# shank.  Visions of stabbing him like a prison inmate who stole my pie enter my head.”“A monthly punctuation survival kit… The word period just isn’t enough to describe the horrific things that happen to a woman’s body during that time.  It’s all too clear that a man coined that term.  Sure, it ends your good time for a few days a month, so it can’t be a comma or anything like that… I like to view our monthly curse as more of an exclamation point.  Because the first sentences out of a woman’s mouth when she gets hers ends in one.”“I faked it.  Clenching and moaning at all the right times, I stroked his ego like he was going off to war while secretly shaking my head in disbelief at the absolute waste of snake.”“I decide to shower since I look like a circus clown who drove a convertible through a car wash.  I can’t help laughing at myself when I look in the mirror.  My makeup has streaked down my face so badly that I wouldn’t be shocked if my nipples weren’t rocking my eyeliner and lip gloss.”“I know exactly what this is.  It’s a bitchervention.”“I realize now why there were pieces of Mitch’s puzzle that were missing.  It’s because it is where I fit, where the parts of us belong in his life that we will put together as a couple.”My Review:Solitude had me either barking, snorting, or whimpering as I read.  Ms. Mason uses her craft to elicit every type of emotion.  While poor Mitch is a miserable husk of his former self through much of the story, the dialog, snark, and clever banter created a near permanent smirk on my face.  I adored Shelby, she is a feisty spitfire and full of spunk and clever wit.  She challenged and sparred with Mitch who had all but shut down in his downward spiral of grief.  Their story and path was not an easy one as they are both stubborn and passionate people who basically cannot speak without profanity and invectives, even with their endearments.  The writing was absorbing and well-paced, the story was entertaining, heartbreaking, and humorous – does that sound contradicting?  Well, it was, and it worked, and I loved it and wanted more.  Cat Mason has a new fan-girl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R77OMKVMBPQOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MFTTD6#wasThisHelpful","R77OMKVMBPQOU","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Favorite Quotes:“Queeg has a simple classification system when it comes to the men I date.  They’re all idiots.  I like to think it has something to do with them not being good enough for me, but I suspect it has more to do with them being stupid enough to date me.”“One is a little larger than the other, but overall the Winstons look alike – tan fur, short legs, stubby bodies, bat like ears.  They snort and trot around like little pigs, and already there has been significant fartage… JJ informed me, when he dropped them off, that they were French bulldogs, which has led me to reassess my opinion of the French.  They may know a lot about making wine and fries, but they don’t know jacques-merde about making dogs.”“Although my mother had a long track record as a serial dater-of-losers, I really think she tried to avoid the dangerous ones.  She wasn’t always successful.  She shielded me from as much of the actual violence as she could, but it was harder to hide the results.  You win some, you lose some, she’d say as she iced a twisted wrist, or blotted blood from a split lip.  Love was a game for my mother.  Sometimes it was a contact sport.”“Queeg always said that normal people are just people you don’t know very well, and as far as I can tell, he was right on the money with that one.”My Review:I knew I was in for a ride when the first paragraph already had me smirking and barking a laugh.  And then it was on!  I am astounded to learn this highly amusing and stunningly well-written story was penned by a first time author.  The narrative is well-paced, the story is artfully crafted, and the writing is simply stellar!  But I seriously didn’t know if I was going to be able to care for the main character of Mattie, as she is immature, irresponsible, and selfishly cruel.  She is also 30 years old, broke, homeless, unemployed, and knocked-up by her latest loser ex… yikes.  Not a likely heroine.  I found her to be grossly undependable, and just an awful and lackluster human being as well as a major disappointment to those few who tried to help or be nice to her.  She took advantage of others and generally made herself scarce or took the easy way out when others wanted to rely on her.To her credit, Mattie had survived an awful childhood as a bastard child of an alcoholic mother.  She is clever and witty, and does have keen observational skills and considerable insight into herself.  She makes painfully honest, and humorously snarky self-revelations and observations about her failings; she knows when she is being an ass, but doesn’t do anything to stop herself.  Yet she also has a knack for carrying and wearing her personal pain and harbors considerable guilt and anguish.  She loved/hated her mother, she loves/hates herself.  She loves her ex-step-father (whom she has nicknamed Queeg) but never tells him and continually takes advantage of him.While reading the often cringe-worthy recollections of her life with her mother and her current concerns and behaviors, I frequently laughed aloud to the point of cackling.  Her irreverent and cheeky accounting of her life as well as her acerbic observations of others is highly entertaining and totally engrossing.  The conversation she had with a swearing seven-year old mortician’s daughter had me howling, and still brings up a smirk and a chuckle even now.  And just as quickly, she has squeezed my cold heart to the point of blurred vision and a tight chest,  during her brutally painful reflections of her less than stellar behaviors toward her alcoholic mother and  her kind and long-suffering step-father in their times of need.  Nearing the conclusion, as Mattie had uncovered and solved a puzzling mystery about her mother and family, and having achieved some inner peace – she turned a significant corner.  The emotional impact of this brought me to my knees and was deeply felt.  I found myself so moved that I had to stop and fight back actual sobs to continue reading.  Regardless of whether she is a new author or a seasoned pro – Ms. DeCarlo is a talented wordsmith and has mad skills.  I hope to see much more from her in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJYX4N1K544T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062390546#wasThisHelpful","R2KJYX4N1K544T","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“Here, staring me straight in the face, was proof that evolution could go in reverse.  If only Uncle Tate had been shooting blanks, because the face on the Locked and Loaded welcoming banner flapping around in the wind was a beer or two short of a six-pack.”“Well, that just dilled my pickle.  I slung my fist on my hips and was ready to throw down.”“And by wine and dine, I mean you could pick up a couple microwave burritos, a bag of hot Cheetos, and a forty-ounce malt liquor and have yourself a cheap and romantic dinner for two.”“Everyone knew my mother was meaner than a Black Friday shopper at Walmart.”“When I saw my father’s face, he looked happier than a North Korean with electricity,”“If it had tires or testicles, it’s gonna give you trouble.”“I watched in horror as my mother’s face peeked around the doorway.  She had a tendency to overdo it with the makeup.  I’d seen morticians who could wield a foundation brush more delicately… She gave me a smile that would’ve made the devil himself take pause.”My Review:I feel it is safe to say that I am enchanted with Jodi Linton’s fiery and feisty Deputy Laney Briggs and her hunky Texas Ranger boyfriend.  This installment finds Laney waist deep in the type of trouble only she can find, which is compounded by the troublesome addition of her mother and idiot cousin.  I love reading the interactions or snippets with or about her unusual family and particularly her mother, the colorful descriptions have me howling.  What also has me howling are the hot and passionate love scenes, my kindle was sizzling.  Pretty Shameless has upped the ante on the intrigue and suspense as well as the sensuality of the continuing plot line that began in Book 1, and has only gotten bigger and better with each subsequent volume.  I am totally engaged and spellbound by the witty writing, intriguing story-line, and unforgettable quirky characters.  I cannot wait to start the next book and fear I may go into mourning when I have to say good-bye to my favorite smart-mouthed, Dr Pepper slurping, law enforcement officer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MT51QA3PM4NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6DRWSW#wasThisHelpful","R1MT51QA3PM4NG","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:Counterfeit Girlfriend:“God must’ve been in a really good mood when Mark had been conceived.  Grossly unfair, but such was life.”Holiday Obsession:“There is more to life than just reality and facts.  We have our hopes and dreams.”“Mark had toiled for days to master a bit of French cooking to impress Hilary.  For his efforts he’d received several burns on his hands and forearms – plus a few nasty cuts – and had ended up making something that, according to Andre’, was fit only to feed pigs one was especially displeased with.”“Maybe leaving after sex was par for the course in his social circle.  For all she knew, his parents had separate bedrooms and Salazar impregnated Ceinlys by courier.”“Yo mama so nasty, she pours salt water down her pants to keep her crabs fresh.”Secret Wife:“Justin was her kryptonite, and unlike Superman she was too stupid to stay away from him.”My Review:Oh the fantasy of having a rich, sweet, handsome, sensual, generous, supportive, and multi-talented man fall blindly in love with me.  Nadia Lee has an innate talent for making that almost believable.  Her stories generally involve interesting and strong, yet deeply flawed heroines; passionate sensual scenes; and filthy rich people with simply horrid families.  She can be always counted on for a HEA, but she certainly doesn’t make it easy on the couple involved - she makes them work for it.  Ms. Lee’s books are consistently well-written, quick and easy to read, are interconnected yet can be read as stand-alone, and never fail to entertain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVKM3U1SE7KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NNOXEE#wasThisHelpful","RUVKM3U1SE7KX","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“His face was like an open book that nobody would want to read.”“Some days I wonder how you manage to breathe without having to think about it.”“It’s no secret that you chew through men like a pack of Juicy Fruit.”“I grew up in a house where the kitchen was run by a chain smoker whose taste buds were so shot that she could eat a raw jalapeno like it was a Mentos.”“Not only had she almost gotten me killed, but she’d soured our high school football coach’s name – that alone was sacrilegious.”My Review:Whatcha Gonna Do With a Cowboy is a quick and fun read that maintains and continues the humor and plot line from the first book, while it also kicks up the relationship and tosses in more adventure and another intriguing and screwy case to solve.  In addition to the atomically hot and sensual love scenes, this installment adds more risk and police action for the feisty and frustrated Deputy Laney.  Despite realizing she is largely untrained and poorly prepared for her job, she assists a sexy US Marshal in solving a troublesome case within her jurisdiction.  For a tiny little town in west Texas, Pistol Rock certainly appears to be a hot-bed of crime.  As well as the murders, assaults, drive-by shooting and drug running from the first book; we can now add kidnapping, embezzlement, fraud, shootouts, a biker gang, prostitution, and more drug running.  Add in the fun of finding a drunk cross-dressing coach on the football field and what more could you ask for?  Ms. Linton’s writing is easy to follow, cleverly humorous, and highly addicting as well as entertaining.  And I am pleased to announce a new word find of, “thong bomb.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5WY0MF0Z1G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6609JI#wasThisHelpful","R1I5WY0MF0Z1G6","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“Mable Dilby was the little old church lady who owned the café.  She had the mouth of a sailor and made pie crust good enough to make the bishop kick in a stained-glass window.”“I figure everyone has a family member they’d like to disown, and my cousin Wyatt Bennett was mine.  The branches didn’t flourish on his side of the family tree.”“Wyatt had gotten the brilliant idea of plastering his smiling image, rifle in hand, on bulletin board-size flags.  He said it was a good welcoming, made the people feel at home.  Something I doubted, since he was missing two front teeth and had a mullet.”“…she screamed and gave the steering wheel a beating that would’ve knocked the tattoo off Mike Tyson’s face.”“I’d been to Shotgun Weddings Inc. once before, and the memory of peel-and-stick eyelashes and glitzy dresses still haunted my dreams.”“My mother’s green eyes narrowed.  It was frightening the damage that look could still do even now that I was a twenty-six-year-old sheriff’s deputy who carried a gun.”My Review:Luck has rained down on me as I have unwittingly stumbled into a cache of pure treasure.  I have discovered a new favorite author and am currently plowing my way through all her delightful books.  Needless to say, I am happier than a fat kid in a chocolate factory without adult supervision.  Jodi Linton can certainly turn a phrase, she has mad skills.  I smirked and barked my way through her first highly entertaining and snarky tale.  I was completely engaged and unable to put my kindle down from page 1, and am absolutely gleeful in knowing I have all five of these bright shiny gems to binge on, I may not sleep all weekend.  I adore her quirky and smart-mouthed characters as even the ancillary players are given a humorous description, eccentric personality, and unusual skill.  Among my favorites are the stained and constantly eating deputy Elroy, the yellow thong wearing male prostitute Jacey Riggings, and the county coroner who also runs Hefty Bags, the family crime-scene clean-up business, just to name a few.  Ms. Linton’s writing can deftly depict a painful event while maintaining a humorous tone with that crafty sarcastic edge.  I am in awe of her talent and anxious to feast on the remainder of her buffet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98EU1IKJI2ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQOFSCW#wasThisHelpful","R98EU1IKJI2ZE","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Favorite Quotes:“Without a doubt she’s everything that I desire; there’s little doubt that she knows it too.”“She could tease the best of them, but she rarely pleased, not because she didn’t want to, they seldom earned the right.”“I found everything about her simply enchanting!  She oozed charisma, agreed with almost everything I said and appeared genuinely interested in what I had to say, too.”“As I stealthily edged toward her, I felt a sudden pang of reservation. What if I was reading this all wrong?  The evening was barely underway.  Get it wrong now and we were in for one hell of an awkward time together.”“I’d only ever experienced a one-night stand once in my life and the feeling of discomfort the following morning on that occasion was very different to that I felt now.  I recalled wishing I’d been a member of the crew of the Starship Enterprise; sitting on the toilet after waking with a hangover from hell, all I could think was ‘Beam me up, Scotty!’”My Review:This collection of short stories is sexy and provocative, although definitely masculine.  While erotic and well written, most of the short stories are of one-night stands and casual hook-ups, some couples never bothered to exchange names.  Written by a man, from a man’s perspective, the fantasy situations are most likely more appealing to men. The writing was highly descriptive, spicy, and entertaining with clever word play.  But I was not transported.  I did not lose myself while reading, which was somewhat vexing.  In pondering this, I decided the reason being that it was just sex.  Maybe it is just me - and I certainly don’t mean this in a judgmental way - but I found the lack of an emotional connection between the characters to be somewhat disconcerting, with the exception of the last story – which was by far my favorite.  I guess I am just too much of a romantic at heart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX15O9AIOYZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVUPJVO#wasThisHelpful","R2UX15O9AIOYZM","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don’t have time nor do I want to pussy-foot around my words.”“We have some major voodoo chemistry.  Voodoo chemistry is rare and it can’t be faked.”“I feel as if I’m a cat high on catnip, munching on a canary as I bat a mouse between my paws.”“I waste no time; my sundress and panties fly off me as if I’m the Guinness World Record holder for fastest stripper.”“You are mine, angel.  You always have been; you just didn’t know it.”My Review:Score!  I am in love with all the characters in the Layer’s series and don’t want it to come to an end, but of all the smartly written books in this series, I loved this installment the most.  I tend to avoid series as I am prone to forgetting too many salient details between volumes, but that was not a problem for me here as Ms. Alexander’s writing is exquisite and more than memorable.  Her plot lines are lively, fun, entertaining, deliciously steamy, yet also insightful and moving.  I tend to devour her books as I cannot seem to put them down or read them fast enough, although I also want to savor the sparkling dialogs infused with clever humor and witty banter.  She has mad skills and I want to read every word she ever puts on a page.  Sigh, I wonder if she could be bribed into continuing this series into infinity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OI9USVDZ7C8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GACFG#wasThisHelpful","R1OI9USVDZ7C8G","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Rating:4.5Favorite Quotes:Lost In Us“I never believed Jess when she said that sometimes it’s worth being a bitch just because.  Now I do.  But I disagree with the last part.  It’s not just because.  Some people simply deserve it.”“I wish there was a way I could let him know how alive he makes me feel.  How he turns the blood in my veins to liquid fire.  How it burns so bright I am afraid it will turn me to ashes any second now.”Found In Us“There’s only one conclusion for you to reach: we might be onto something beautiful.”“I want you to be my everything, Jessica,”“I’ve never wanted to give a man everything before.  Until now.  I want to give him my heart, my soul, along with all of the things I never knew were mine to give away.  I want the same from him too.  I want it all.”“There’s no weapon more effective than words.  They lash deep wounds that can cripple in a second and heal excruciatingly slow, sometimes not at all.  Because words can’t be unheard.  Or forgotten.”Caught In Us“Beatrix and Anthony Cohen used to love each other passionately… Somewhere along the years, their love burned to bitter ashes.”“A word of advice.  Start working on your personality, you have a lot of catching up to do.  Your ass and boobs aren’t as good as you think.”“I’m walking trouble.  You should stay away from me.  It’s catchy.”“It’d be a shame to graduate high school with the good girl stamp on our foreheads.  Every girl worth her salt must break some rules.  The best rules are broken with bad boys.”“The way to a man’s heart is through his nose.  First take his breath away, then steal his heart.”“That was a swoon worthy love declaration… If you haven’t told all of this to Dani, I will chase you with a gun.”“You’d better prepare yourself to be surrounded by so much estrogen, you might grow boobs.”My Review:Layla Hagen has been a recent discovery for me – smacks head – I know!  I found her work to be smokin’ hot, smartly written, moving, and entertaining.  I am now a convert to her cult and hope to make my way through her entire listing.  Ms. Hagen’s writing is emotional and compelling.  While I am not a fan of angst, the way she writes - I didn’t mind it so much.  I binge read the first two books at once and lapped them up like a dehydrated camel, all 546 pages, and like a thirsty camel, I wished for more.Caught In Us was a fun read and far less angsty than the first two books.  While there were still periods of conflict and heartbreak, the overall feel was a sweet love story that began in high school and renews itself during college.  All three books could be read as a stand-alone, which I totally appreciate, although I also enjoyed additional glimpses of the characters from previous books in the subsequent installments.  Layla Hagen’s writing is always entertaining, engaging, thoughtful, and delightfully steamy.  And who doesn’t enjoy a good girl/bad boy story?  Each book was sensual, addictive, and beguiling.  I seem to have a hard time putting my kindle down when reading her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R89VHWN4M836I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LIE4SK#wasThisHelpful","R89VHWN4M836I","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“She’d overreacted, because whenever Merk came near, she practically ovulated in hopes of having him stay with her.”“He’s like the black sheep of a very bad family.”“Merk stayed with her, comforted her, and healed her.  He’d done more for her than she’d done for herself.  He kept her moving forward, even dragging her along at times.”“He was a wildcard.  Unpredictable, unreadable, unemotional.  She lowered her gaze, knowing she was being unfair.  Merk had emotions, an excess of feelings, and every single one was aimed at her.”“He wanted to take everything away from you, because he knew hurting you would kill me.  Desi… you’re the only good thing I’ve got.  I won’t let him destroy you.”My Review:This is my first time reading this author and while starting the series near the end may have put me at a disadvantage, the book was marketed as a stand-alone and I was able to piece it together without too much confusion, but I am sure it would have been easier to follow had I read the previous installments.  Many of my initial thoughts about the plot were incorrect.  Looking at the cover and title, I assumed the character was going into prison rather than coming out.  Then I assumed he was after revenge and retribution for being turned in – nope – shucks - 0 for 2!  I was captivated by this moody, taut, steamy, and suspenseful storyline.  Ms. Kayn is highly skilled in maintaining tension, misdirection, intrigue, and emotive writing.We have two damaged and broken people who were thrown together years before by deplorable events, separated and each thinking of the other for 12 years, then find themselves in the same orbit again with the same horrible circumstances bending back to find them.  Given their histories and personalities, I didn’t expect to care about the characters as much as I did, yet I fell into their story soon after beginning, and held on by my fingernails all the way through to the satisfying conclusion.  Although, I do find myself in need of a spa day after holding all that tension.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WC6NYHUWOEGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QHUNAE#wasThisHelpful","R2WC6NYHUWOEGG","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“She was now on the lookout for husband number four.  She and Carnival Cruise Lines had an ongoing love affair.  She cruised once a month searching for Mister Right.  Finn was certain the cruise line gave her a deep discount, if for no other reason than Gert charmed it out of them.”“She thought it was love two years ago, until he abandoned her on their wedding day.  Time and meaningful therapy twice a week for several months showed her the difference between true love and infatuation.  The dartboard on her bedroom wall with his photo stuck to it and the hundreds off darts thrown at his well-fed face helped too.”“They hadn’t spoken in two years, three months and seven days, but who was counting?  She had enjoyed every silent minute.”“She smelled like freshly baked bread.  He never knew if it was her perfume or her natural scent.  He’d gained ten pounds while they were dating because he was always hungry when he was around her.”“It was the unlikely trinity of chef instructors who gave her the heebie-jeebies.  They could turn a student to a dithering idiot with a frosty look or a casual put-down.  There were three, as different from each other as Larry, Moe and Curly, but not nearly as funny.”“One of her fellow classmates fainted while another one ran from the room screaming, screeching like a bad actor in a horror movie, never to return.”My Review:Uneasy in New Orleans was a light and fun read.  The story was humorous, easy to follow, unpredictable, intriguing, and busy.  Each character mentioned was unique, quirky, interesting, and likable.  The leading character of Finn is exceedingly unlucky, yet continues in attempting to move forward in her stalled life by secretly attending culinary school while working two part-time jobs.  She is more than a bit of a Calamity Jane or maybe she is actually cursed.  The story is set in New Orleans, and incorporates accusations of voodoo, curses, fetish dolls, spells, witches, and occasional visitations by a benign ghost, although I really wouldn’t consider this story to fit into the paranormal genre.  While performing one of her jobs, Finn has inadvertently stumbled into a mess that she attempts to untangle with help from her friends.  Although, all the while, she continues to unwittingly cause further complications that are so beyond her control.  I enjoyed Ms. Carson’s use of humor, misdirection, fluid descriptions, amusing back stories, and the clever banter and teasing between the characters.  I found the writing entertaining and wily, and wished for it to continue just a bit further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZTELN7XEEWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128D6FBO#wasThisHelpful","R1SZTELN7XEEWO","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:Deuce:“It’s a good thing you’ve got a big personality, because that’s the only thing that could make up for that tiny penis you’re sporting.”“There is something every woman should know about a Harley, when you’re straddling the seat, pressed, even slightly, against the gas tank, and there’s a gorgeous guy behind you, all of a sudden every bounce, every vibration, every bump in the damn road becomes erotic.”“I barely know this man and I’d sell my soul to the devil to have his hands on me daily.”Flight:“I don’t know what to do with this kind of attention.  I’m socially awkward, at best.  I do really well in business settings, but when it comes to matters of the heart, the words, ‘epic failure’ come to mind.”“I wanted to wait for him, continue talking to him, when I realize, I don’t even know his name and he never asked mine.  I’m such a daft cow.  Bloody hell.  Here I am thinking there’s some beautiful connection to this stranger I met by happenstance on a plane when in actuality, he was just being nice effectively making the time fly by.”“Needing that connection, just holding my hand, was more intimate to me that what we had just done.”“He watches my eyes intently for what seems an eternity, searching them, for what I’m not sure but when he finds what he’s looking for, the corners of his mouth turn up in a delicious smile.”“Everything about him produces an almost out-of-body experience I never want to recover from.”Caged:“I don’t want to do time for strangling her, but if we are stuck in here together long enough, it might come to that to save my sanity.”“The anger had dissipated and I can acknowledge when her mouth is shut just what a striking woman she is.”“It’s easier to be a bitch and have people leave you alone than to allow anyone to get close enough to see the cracks.”Traffic:“Men flock to me, but sadly, it always seems to be the wrong men.”“I just want to exist in the moment.  For once in my life, I just want to experience the here and now, even if I regret it in the morning.  I may be reading too much into this, but there’s only one way to find out.”“Damn, if there is an imperfection on this man, I can’t find it.  It’s unfair really.”“I feel at ease with him, able to laugh and enjoy life, a feeling I’ve not known since I was a child and definitely never with a man.”My Review:Strangers is a grouping of 4 steamy short stories by Stephie Walls, a new to me author that I would like to see more from.  Each story involves chance meetings by couples who either are strangers or don’t know each other well.  Their meetings are under less than stellar circumstances and lead to unexpected encounters and assignations that are not the usual behavior of those involved (as they all considered themselves “good girls”) and aren’t expected to be anything more than a one-off.  Each vignette is quite erotic and of course, the best sex ever had by either person, which thankfully, leads to much more than the one night adventure they started off expecting.  Each tale is quick, entertaining, titillating and naughty, and results in my highly desired HEA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R55HYTYMW943/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HW3ACQ#wasThisHelpful","R3R55HYTYMW943","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“Sabine belonged to the Wednesday Blues Club.  Some members still wore their black-and-blues; some only carried the memories of being beaten.”“Time had a new meaning – before and after.  When she’d looked at a calendar that morning, it didn’t seem possible it was only two weeks since the accident.  It seemed like forever.”“She couldn’t possibly be bringing good news, right?  Hospitals were citadels of horror, with nurses bearing the early warnings.  Compassionate canaries in the health mine – that’s what they were.”“When she was twelve, Emma had asked to go to Hebrew School, just like her classmate, Gillian, who was preparing for her bat mitzvah.  Emma had imagined it being like an Israeli Girl Scout.  The Diary of Anne Frank had haunted her; after reading it, she’d gone online and read all the horrifying possibilities of being Jewish.  Going to Hebrew School seemed a way to prevent being sent to a concentration camp and having to run around naked in front of laughing soldiers.”“Words popped into her mind without grounding.  Her brain seemed like a half-filled trunk.  Where once it was packed with rows of facts and thoughts, now things rolled around, came out of nowhere.”“Maddy tried to do more when he wasn’t home, but her mother hovered every time she turned around.  It was like having your shadow sewn to your shirt.”“Zelda’s beautiful clothes hung off her dime thin body like woven money.”“Waves of rage made everything inside her tumble, knocking her heart into her guts.  How could such hatred stay inside a body?  She waited to erupt in boiling pus-filled hives of anger.”“Maybe I don’t know how.  To give up on someone I love.  But if I need to, I can learn.”My Review:I was engrossed in this smartly written family drama from beginning to end.  It is not a thrill ride or an action adventure, nor is it romantic, steamy, or salacious.  It is deftly written with cringe-worthy real-life disappointments, and I found it to be fascinatingly insightful and relevant.  To have the skill and capacity to write such specific details so clearly and in such an entertaining and crafty manner, Ms. Meyers is obviously a keen observer to have digested and understood the feelings, thoughts, patterns and particular tendencies of these unusual people of varying ages and stages of their relationships.  I am in awe and transfixed, she has mad skills! I could not stop reading and resented any interruption that involved having to put down my beloved kindle and attend to my real-life – specifically those pesky things known as employment and sleep.The Illica family is common, yet each family member was unique and greatly intrigued me.  While well-educated, successful, and professional, neither parent in this home was fully functional on their own – either before or after the accident.  They are both selfish, immature, deeply flawed, and prone to blaming and setting each other off.  Although they both seemed to have some niggling self-awareness and concerns, they quickly diverted themselves from these troublesome and unwelcome thoughts of personal responsibility whenever they arose.  The lawyer father’s typical manner appeared to be moody, agitated, hostile, or on-edge, and he is prone to ranting and throwing things when provoked.  The social worker mother knows all the right things to do, but doesn’t do them; she dithers and lives in a state of partial denial and addled self-medicated numbness.  She is disorganized - although she makes lists, she doesn’t follow them. She is concerned and apparently performs well on the job, but lacks follow through at home and allows important details to fall through the cracks.  Her various and extensive drug stashes indicates she is a functioning junkie.  In my opinion, the most mature person in the home is the nine-year old middle child.  The eldest being a surly teenager, who is unfortunately thrust into domestic slave mode after the accident, and the youngest, being the only son and male grandchild, is an over indulged brat.Things are not going well and trouble is already brewing when a horrible accident occurs that results in a head injury, and the need for a long and involved recuperation for mom. She noted to the doctor that being a social worker - at one time she was the one writing the charts rather than being in one.  This devastating trauma was far-reaching in many aspects with deep impact on every family member; and was actually be the best thing to happen to this family – I know that is an awful thing to say - but sometimes it takes an extreme event to finally obtain a stubborn person’s attention.  The accident also rallied the extended family and circle of friends to wake up and discuss other issues and secrets coming to light, that really weren’t secrets after all.Though writing about disturbing and unpleasant memories and emotional events, Ms. Meyers sneaks in humorous asides and ancillary observations that lessens the horror and typically adds to the story in an entertaining yet thoughtful manner.  My favorite scene involves the three young children attempting to seek out religion by attending temple.  Their talk with the rabbi was humorous, spot on, and touching.Although deeply damaged and questionable about their marriage, both adults are better people at the end of the book.  While some readers may not see the author’s conclusion to the story as a happy ending, it appears to be the best possible outcome and left me satisfied and hopeful for their future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZI93XJ51BKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451673051#wasThisHelpful","R2YZI93XJ51BKE","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“It’s been a long damned grudge.  Congratulations on hatred well played, but let’s just put it behind us and move on.”“How do people just know this stuff?  Like, is there a class where you can go and learn how to size people up?  Do they pull certain kids aside during school and teach them these things while the rest of us sit in history learning about Abraham Lincoln?”“You’ve ruined me, Mason Pierce.  The way you make my heart race and my blood pound through my veins, God, I know that I’ll never feel like that again, and I’m scared.  Scared of it all.”“You’d think I was the devil in the flesh preying upon sweet, innocent children standing here with them in all my evil glory.  If I threw fuel on the fire, they’d be trying to lessen the likelihood of me ever reproducing, and I definitely need those parts in working order for later.”“I agree not to snatch any bacon with one hand behind my back, fingers crossed.  Southern girls should never make promises about bacon.”“That type of story is one told around three am under the cover of darkness and a bottle of wine.  It is not for the light of day.”My Review:I adore this author and these characters!  I want to be twenty-years-old again and hanging out with this fresh and sassy group all summer.  I want Mary Lou to do my hair and give me a mani-pedi while Mason makes me s’mores.  And while I despise beer and country music, I would possibly go with them to their wretched honky-tonk… but just with them.  I had so many “Favorite Quotes” marked for this review… I had a hard time narrowing it down to 6!I have eagerly awaited each installment of this entertaining, feisty, and totally addicting tale and was happily reading along, having lost myself in the excellent story-telling… until the unthinkable happened.  NO!  Take it back!  Gasping and sputtering, I wanted to throw my precious kindle… but I love it far too much.  S.J. Sawyer is an evil temptress!  She lured me in and baited me with sweet and clever stories of young love… she had my cold heart actually beating a contented rhythm.  I was all humming and cozy, sipping my favorite libation, and then BOOM.  Gah!I am devastated, gutted, crushed… while also totally addicted to this story, fully invested in obtaining a HEA for the characters, and completely addled in how to get them there.  I am wanting to stomp my little foot and tantrum like a bratty two-year-old until this wicked wordsmith gives up the rest of the tale.  Exhale!  Calming.  Breaths.Other than a despicable cliffhanger ending, this otherwise delightful story was rich with a full gamut of feelings and heady emotional insights, all very surprising from one so young.  I want more of this sweet and tender second chance love story.  I also want more of their entertaining memories, steamy love scenes, and interesting inner musings from a dual POV narrative that plucked at my spindly heart-strings.  Exhale.  Calming.  Breaths.Hmm, setting my wine glass down, I vowed to take action – I clicked my bracelets together, leapt into Wonder Woman mode, and instantly messaged this extremely talented and clever young author - letting loose several of the nastiest invectives I know.  I doubt I was the only reader threatening her scalp that day… but um, a bit red-faced and embarrassed now.  Eh, sorry if I broke your phone and umm, hope to hear from you soon Ms. Sawyer…","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4JN5QI4UG7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140JEGLA#wasThisHelpful","R1O4JN5QI4UG7Y","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“‘I won’t allow any white, unrefined sugar in my house,’ Katie continued.  ‘My children won’t touch it, which is wonderful because it absolutely dulls the hair, ruins the complexions, not to mention what it does to the shape of your body.’  She broke off, and seemed to be studying my face and hair.  Evidently, my appearance was evidence of the evils of sugar.”“It wasn’t a face-to-face breakup.  While I was at work getting the ax, he emptied his one dresser drawer and left a note on the back of a Chinese takeout menu.”“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention my mother while you’re touching me there.”My Review:I don’t often read cozy mysteries and for the life of me I don’t know why - I found Chalk Lines and Lipstick to be a light and easy read and nice change of pace from my usual fare.  Maren Colepepper is a bit of a contradiction, but then again, most of us are.  She is snoopy, witty, and ambitious, yet she is also somewhat nave, easily distracted, resistant to warnings and directives, and allows an old high school “mean girl” to continue to bully her.  I liked and cared for Maren, although I also found her a bit frustrating.  I felt for her, she was humiliated and ashamed after a quick series of personal losses and forced to return to her hometown with her head down and broke, but there were also times when I wanted to give her a smack to the back of the head with my trusty kindle.  The writing was humorous, easy to follow, and written from Maren’s personal POV.  The plot was interesting, relevant, and realistic, although the story seemed to circle and kept me guessing with mixed messages as to whether her talented lipped neighbor was going to be a white hat good guy, or bad black hatter.  The humor and writing are tame enough for my elderly mother’s book club, yet also entertained and held my attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JIWDQ5OE95BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PIQTJO#wasThisHelpful","R3JIWDQ5OE95BX","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“I’ve never met a woman who can stir my anger one moment and my passion the next.  All I know is that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since the day you walked into my gym.”“He looked at her as if she were a circus oddity.  Okay, sharing time was over.  Embarrassment was an excellent mood killer.”“‘Clam-jamming me.  It’s the female version of cock-blocking,’ she snipped.  ‘It’s a real thing.  You can Google it.’”My Review:I had never read a book with a MMA story line before, and as I am all about new challenges, I wanted to give it a try… but I was also concerned as I don’t relish violence or fighting.  Thankfully, I picked a good one to start with, as Passing His Guard was more about the various relationships of the fighter rather than the actual fighting.  The storyline was intriguing and interesting, and I enjoyed the dual POV between the two main characters of Aiden and Ryann, although I found the push-pull, back and forth, angsty see-saw between them more than a bit tedious and well into whiplash territory with the on again/off again, but I know many people enjoy that more than I do.  The plot was action packed with secrets, lies, mixed signals, MMA fighting, an underground fight club, robberies, abductions, assaults, roofies, gambling additions, cage bangers, an arranged marriage, shootings, mobsters, corrupt police and politicians, and oh my – deliciously steamy sensuality.  I like learning new words and phrases to add to my vocabulary and I found one in this story to glom onto, “clam-jamming,” I have gleefully added this one to my naughty list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35AFWE7BILQKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXY7HCI#wasThisHelpful","R35AFWE7BILQKS","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“I had to concentrate hard to keep my eyes on the road.  This man and that body could singlehandedly cause traffic to halt.”“There’s only so much sexy a woman can handle, Griff, and I’m almost at my limit, because let me tell you, just standing next to you is hard work sometimes, so you can only imagine how hard it is to have flirting from your sexy mouth thrown in to the mix.”“Hate is a double-edged sword, baby.  Sometimes it’s all you’ve go and all you’re capable of feeling.  Sometimes it gets you through when nothing else can.”“If this was heaven, I’d be a good girl for the rest of my life.”“The past is part of us, part of our story, but it doesn’t have to be who we are today, and it doesn’t mean our story won’t get better.”My Review:I have a new BBF and his name is Griff, swoon.  I am enamored with this sexy and passionate couple in Nina Levine’s latest in the Storm MC series.  I love her quirky characters and Sophia is now my all-time favorite sassy gal.  I love how she banters with Griff and rambles out her concerns and thoughts in a manner that just strips that distant and distrustful alpha male bare.  She disarms him with her honesty and vulnerability, and plants her flag in his heart without game playing or feminine wiles, and his hardened walls collapse.  I loved that their story is not the constant push and pull of conflict with or against their relationship; but in supporting, building up, nurturing, accepting, and adoring each other.  I always enjoy Ms. Levine’s use of a dual POV narrative, and she expertly builds the story as she weaves us through their memories, fears, dreams, and present concerns in an insightful, and skillful manner.  I would never tire of this pair and hope to see more of them in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHYKK81H9X3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPCLT0S#wasThisHelpful","R1EHYKK81H9X3F","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love you, you stubborn, ignorant man.  And whatever you decide to do, I know you’ll be damn good at it.”“Sinclair Chatham, you’re like the ink on my skin, deep, indelible, indescribable.  Forever.  I can’t look at you without wanting you.  Can’t think about you without wanting to be with you.”My Review:Coletrane is one of the most erotic romance books I recall reading.  I am talking atomic mushroom cloud haaawwt.  Oh my!  It required a steady flow of cool drinks to replenish body fluids and maintain proper hydration.  It brought a satisfying and fun conclusion to the Bad Boys of Retribution series, although I am in mourning to see this steamy, action packed series of quirky characters come to an end.  Ms. Warren’s writing never fails to entertain with her odd and unusual alpha characters, smart and feisty females, humorous interchanges, and passionate and sensual love stories.  Her writing is smooth, involving, touching, naughty, full of invectives, and sizzling hot.  I am curious and eager to see what and who she has planned for her next project.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VF5LF72IITKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ADPC26#wasThisHelpful","R2VF5LF72IITKT","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Favorite Quotes:“Before cocktails, the three of them had shot off their steam at the Lipstick & Lead Rifle Range.  Some people did Yoga or smoked pot to relax, but the Manhattanites preferred to shoot guns.”“Thor had lied.  Sugaring hurt as if a colony of fire ants were attacking a wounded grasshopper.”“If you’re paving the road for traffic, does your spa service signify happy trails ahead?”It’s been too long since happiness decorated your gorgeous face.”“He felt as if he’d sucked on a habanero pepper marinated in Tabasco.”“He closed his eyes for a second, allowing himself to experience something new – love.”My Review:I have been on an Avery Aster binge recently, and I must say, it has been quite enjoyable, although it has caused an uptick in my wine bill and laundry.  Holy hawtness.  I am rather inexperienced at M/M romances, but love is love; and comes in all shapes, colors, sizes, and flavors as far as I am concerned.  But there is so much more going on in this story than an M/M romance, the story was intriguing, active, heart-felt, and full of secrets, as well as personal and family issues for all the Manhattanites to deal with and work through.  As always, Ms. Aster’s writing was engaging, absorbing, sensual, and insightful.  I adore her clever and snarky humor that not only bites, but brings an emotional impact along with it.

"Favorite Quotes:“Nowadays, she fostered being humble, hardworking and honest – she called them her three Hs.  Those were her assets, and she’d put them to good use.”“Lost for years, she realized at that moment she’d become found.”“Taddy’s sexual capabilities turned the odometer well over one hundred thousand miles, whereas Lex’s were, well, maybe over three miles.”My Review:Avery Aster was a big tease during most of this sensual book, as while it was sexy and the characters often came close - they don’t have much actual sex, which was kinda odd when you think about it.  There is her smart trademark humor with clever banter and teasing between the friends, although the underlying current in this book remained melancholy, and I just couldn’t shake that feeling of impending doom… and I was right.  Shucks, I didn’t want to be.  The narrative alternated between dual POVs, and expertly weaves us through their thoughts, which are often at odds with, and far more entertaining than, the words coming from their mouths.  Ms. Aster is one of those writers that keeps me on my toes while reading, with the occasional cringe-worthy and Easter egg moments sprinkled throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VO9HOJNTS95M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQGL3N2#wasThisHelpful","R3VO9HOJNTS95M","A1E1IGWRW974JG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E1IGWRW974JG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rating: A ... Heat: SizzlingGianna Rossi is protégé to a powerful and successful restaurateur. For the last year she has been learning the ropes, putting in her hours. Gianna's pretty much married to her career... Or avoiding men and dating because her heart hasn't mended. Even though she's a confident, bold, smart, and goal-oriented heroine who's not afraid to play with the big boys, there's one boy who broke her heart and she hasn't moved on yet.Because when Jackson Rutledge breaks things, he does a thorough job. Jackson and Gia spent five weeks together full of passionate sex and tender words and sweet promises. Until he just didn't show up one day. Jackson is a sensual, erotic mystery. He's obviously damaged by his family but there's so much still unknown. What we do know? Jackson is a beast in bed and when he's f-ing, he makes you think words like raw and primal and rutting. Seriously. Raw. Primal. Rutting. He'll make your panties drop the moment he walks on the page with that confident swagger of his. *sigh*Because, let's face it--Sylvia Day knows how to write a hero, am I right? First Alistair Caulfield (Seven Years to Sin) then Gideon Cross (Bared to You) and now... hello Jackson Rutledge! If I want to read a book with a sexy hero, who's chock full of carnality and sensuality, that will leave me utterly breathless and totally turned on--there is no one hotter than Alistair, Gideon, and Jackson.Ahem.I also appreciated the loving family dynamic of the Rossi clan. Gianna has a great family and great brothers. They're a very tight-knit bunch, as opposed to Jackson's family which comes across cold, calculating and all-business. Someone needs to show Jackson what love is... and I think the perfect person for the job is Gia.Afterburn will utterly seduce you. Be prepared to be completely emerged into the cutthroat world of restaurants and restaurateurs. They say you should never mix business and pleasure, but I think Gianna and Jackson prove that sometimes it's very, very okay to do so. There is a bit of a cliffhanger and, yeah, waiting three months for the next installment is a major downer but what can you do? It's worth the wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PG3G1TE1L05L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR1X7XI#wasThisHelpful","R2PG3G1TE1L05L","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a darkness that hangs over this installment but there is light too. I am so happy with how things turned out. Things between Cela and her dad, between her and Foster... Cela grew a spine and found her voice and she's not afraid to use either one. And, when Foster was at his lowest, he learned to trust and let love in. Realized Cela wasn't going to run away. Not Until You Love is a satisfying and meaningful conclusion to this serial.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WMT09GBLU70N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1FG9D0#wasThisHelpful","R2WMT09GBLU70N","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: A ... Heat: SizzlingIn Beauty Becomes You, the third - and final - installment in the Beauty serial, things between Erin and Blake have cooled off a bit. There's a lot of distance between them while they try to get through the home stretch. It's not easy for them to be apart but the time and space does do them a lot of good because there is a lot of character growth. Erin and Blake have come a long ways since the beginning, while still remaining true to their characters. And when they are finally reunited, well, it is beautiful.I was beyond happy to see Blake finally loose his desperation for Erin, replacing it with cool calm and acceptance. Accepting that she's his and nothing will take her away from him. Not his scars, his tendency to withdraw, or his struggle with PTSD. It was heartwarming to see love transform this supposed beast.Our dear, sweet Erin also grows in this last installment. Becomes more sure of her place with Blake--at his side, as an equal. A partner. She's not the help, she's not a poor student, she's simply Erin. Seeing her grow into herself as a woman was awesome to witness.The Beauty series, as a whole, is sexy and tender. Skye weaves emotion and eroticism together in such a fantastic way. Beauty Becomes You is no exception. I'm going to miss these two - especially Blake's raw way of making love *wink* - but at least there are always rereads. Can't wait to see what Skye has in store for us next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L1L14K97DG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBGXFR4#wasThisHelpful","R7L1L14K97DG8","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: B+ ... Heat: SizzlingWell, it was wonderful to visit Submission Island again. What is Submission Island? It's a lovely tropical retreat for those a little (or a lot) kinky. The fact that this time it was with Kyle? The Master with a sadistic side? That just made it even more fun than my first trip. There was something intense and alluring about the former Australian Special Air Service member from the moment he appeared and I wanted his story--badly. On Location didn't disappoint at all.Teresa lands on the island not for pleasure but for work. A location scout for Hollywood, she's there to take photos and write notes. See if Submission Island would work for the Odyssey movie she's scouting for. Which is all well and good until she meets Kyle. Even though its obvious he doesn't want her or her coworker there, Teresa's still drawn to him. And, for a woman perpetually drawn to the bad boys, Teresa thinks she might just have found the baddest bad boy of all.Except nothing about Kyle is boyish. He's all man and he is all demands and commands. He wants what he wants and isn't afraid to take it. He likes to give pain as much as pleasure. After retiring from the SAS, Kyle has become a bit of recluse. He never leaves the island, so his sexual conquests are always the submissive women who come for a kinky vacation. And, even though he's attracted to Teresa, he's not sure she can handle him and all his wicked desires.Teresa and Kyle have fun proving each other wrong... and right. I enjoyed watching them unravel each other sexually and emotionally. Kyle liberates Teresa's inhibitions while she loosens the vise around his heart. She helps him fight the demons left over from war while Kyle enlightens her to the freedom in submission. I liked the balance of super kinky fun and meaningful emotions. And by super kinky fun, I mean it. Kyle and Teresa try it all--riding crops, cat o' nine tails, canes, ropes, and more. Kyle knows how to wield them all expertly too. *wink*On Location is a perfect destination romance for those who love a little kink. I'm beyond captivated by the setting and the characters and the way that Miz Yssel explores BDSM. She never takes away from the intensity but it all comes across... fun. Since Miz Yssel granted my last wish and made Kyle's book next, I think this time I'm wishing for Roger. Bring on the kinky shrink!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FICLX4618BZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAV3RKA#wasThisHelpful","R3FICLX4618BZL","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: B ... Heat: HotI absolutely adored Monica Murphy's first two books, One Week Girlfriend and Second Chance Boyfriend (Drew Callahan, I adore you!), so when I heard that Miz Murphy was giving bad boy billionaires a go, I thought, `Sign me up, please!'And Archer Bancroft does not disappoint. A man that comes from money, Archer has made his own way by becoming a hotel and resort magnate in his own right. He has it all--money, success, and lots of lady loves. Archer absolutely refuses to settle down. But he has always had a thing for his best friend's younger sister. Not that he'd do anything about it.Ivy Emerson, who all the boys think of as 'just Ivy', is an interior designer with a bad case of Humpty Dumpty syndrome. She likes the broken guys, the ones that just beg to be fixed. Archer is so far past broken that she knows she can't fix him. Unfortunately, that's never stopped her from noticing how handsome he is and how women flock to his side. A side she wouldn't mind snuggling up against.When Archer and his buddies put a million dollars on the line--to be given to the last single man standing--all bets are off. For a man so adamant that relationships aren't for him, Archer spends his days making couples happy. His adults-only resorts are romantic escapes designed to bring couples together. When Archer decides to open a new resort, he has just the interior designer in mind... And he plans on keeping her close while she works for him. Very close.Crave is a fast paced story with an equally fast developing romance that is full of heat and friction. Once these two give in, there is no stopping them. Archer and Ivy dive head first between the sheets and then let the emotions quietly work their way in. Feelings that sneak up on them both. I wish there had been more emphasis on Archer and Ivy's back story--who they are as characters, what makes them tick alone and as a couple... but, seriously, the chemistry between them will still knock your socks off. And I love a hero who thinks he's so tough and unreachable when really, deep down, he's a closet snuggler with a serious soft side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R395LOTIBH389L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKZGOHM#wasThisHelpful","R395LOTIBH389L","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: B ... Heat: SizzlingAsh McIntyre is the last man standing. First there was Gabe and then there was Jace--each man fell in love and they fell hard. And even though Ash believes in love, thanks to his friends, he can't see it happening to him. Love simply isn't something Ash sees in his future.Then he notices this vibrant blonde, lost in her own world, drawing away in the park. He also can't help but notice what she's wearing--a necklace that looks a lot like a collar to Ash. That jewelry around her neck instantly captivates him and he has to introduce himself. See if she does have a Master in her life. When he goes to approach her, she starts to pack up, trying to flee, but her supplies and drawing scatter. When he goes to help her pick up her things, what Ash finds is a drawing of himself.From that first chance meeting, Ash is consumed. Overcome. Near obsessive in his need to know the beautiful and talented Josie. So he does what any rich man might do--hire someone to follow her. The more he discovers, the more he wants. Ash won't stop till he has her right where he wants her. In his bed.Josie may not be a stranger to BDSM and D/s but Ash is more intense than any man she's ever known. And while he may be dark and broody and mysterious, something about him makes her feel innately safe. For an orphan with no family to speak of, safe is good. She's also immediately fascinated by the way he sees her and her artwork. Like, finally, someone truly gets her.Ash and Josie fall deep and they fall quick. They fall madly. But they also put it all out on the line, no secrets kept between them (well, Ash is keeping one or two). I liked how Ash disclosed nearly everything upfront--his history with Jace, with Bethany, with all the women they've gone through. It was refreshing to have a hero empty out most of the skeletons in his closet.Ash and Josie, when they come together, set the sheets on fire. I've never read a hero that is such a butt man, but Ash definitely is. The man is near obsessed with Josie's rear... among other things but, mostly, her rear. And when said rear is threatened, well, I pity the fool (or fools) who try to mess with her.In Burn, Maya Banks really brings the romance and the sensuality, along with a heavy dose of drama. While there was drama in the first two books, Miz Banks takes it to a whole new level in Burn. There is danger and intrigue mixed with the hot and heavy romance and it makes for an enthralling combination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA7AQ9TURRR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425267083#wasThisHelpful","R2HA7AQ9TURRR6","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: A- ... Heat: SizzlingFrom the moment Eric Sticks first got his perv on in Backstage Pass, a hot little scene with Brian and Myrna, I was all about the Sinners drummer (although, there is an even hotter scene with Eric, Aggie, and Jace in Hot Ticket). More than a little bit odd, and always saying the craziest things, I could tell there was so much hidden underneath all that. A loneliness. A vulnerability. And, well, his unusual charm combined with his pervy tendencies made me fall for him completely. The woman who gets Eric, deserves him, should be a special kind of woman.And, at first, I did not think that woman should be Rebekah. In the beginning, she was all, ""Ooh, Trey, I want Trey. Trey is soo sexy,"" and it brought out my inner witch. Don't get me wrong, Trey is sex on a stick, but she had Eric Sticks right in front of her. Doing the most charming darn things. Saying the most outrageously sweet and sexual things. (I have adored Eric from the first book... I mentioned that, right? *wink*) Thankfully, Rebekah clues in fast (though not quite as fast as I'd have preferred). Once I got to know her, her past and her struggles, she really became one cool chick. Sassy but shy, Reb has a tender heart and is exactly what Eric needs.What Eric needs... well, Eric needs love and affection and some TLC. Reb gives him that and a whole lot more. These two get up to some very salacious and naughty stuff. They take the phrase `sexual healing' and reinvent it. Every fantasy either one has, they explore it--from naughty nurses to misbehaving French maids. And while they're doing it, they sooth a lot of old hurts that both of them have.But in between the fantasies, reality keeps intruding. The most annoying intrusion being Reb's mother. Fanatical and almost rabidly judgmental, the woman was a serious downer every time she showed up. The way she talked down to Eric, the devious things she did, combined with the way Reb and her family just let her... Well, it put my hackles up. As did Rebekah's interactions with her ex. Both had me seeing red. Poor Eric. Rebekah does finally find her spine and speak up but, dang, the family drama was almost a mood killer.In Wicked Beat, Eric Sticks becomes so much more than the playful voyeur we've seen in the previous books. I loved seeing him become a sexy and mischievous lover, instead of just the guy watching from the sidelines. Reb brought out a softer, more vulnerable side to him that made me love him even more. There is a world of hurt buried inside Eric Sticks and I loved seeing it disappear, page by page. Plus there's the fact that this book is, no holds barred, sinfully hot. Wicked Beat is perverted in all the right ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LZBNXF1NMLO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGALRKK#wasThisHelpful","R1LZBNXF1NMLO7","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: C ... Heat: SizzlingFormer barrel racing champion Tanna Barker is looking for a fresh start. After a bad accident on her horse, Tanna is afraid to get back on the saddle. Tanna's afraid of a lot of things really--horses, men, relationships, her former life in Texas. So she's packed up and is temporarily moving to Wyoming to work at the Split Rock, a resort that's owned by one of her friend's husband. And what does Miss Tanna do her first night in town? She hooks up with a random (and totally sexy) stranger she meets at a bar. Once her wild night of fun is over, Tanna does what she usually does--splits--expecting to never see her handsome hookup again.A few days later, however, there he is. August Fletcher, an overworked veterinarian who also happens to be one sweet talker. Even though he many not have a lot of suave moves, he gets you with his honesty and directness. He says what he means and then acts on it accordingly. But falling for Fletch, who never has a day off and might be the hardest working man in Wyoming, isn't something Tanna wants to do. Too bad Fletch is resilient and stubborn. Even more so than our super stubborn heroine.These two have, oddly enough given their initial hookup, a very slow build. Tanna takes a lot of convincing. Nearly one third of the book goes by and she wouldn't even agree to a date. I never really understood the hold up on her part and it really bogged things down. Once she finally relents and Fletch gets a long and much need sabbatical from his practice, well, that's when things heat up. And up and up.James is known for writing a certain kind of rough and gruff and dominant hero and Fletch is no exception. He's quite the beast in bed. And since he has to handle large stock seven days a week, he's also really well built. Plus there's the fact that he a true gentleman on top of all that? Heck yeah I'd want to lick him from his neck to his... you know... too.Which is why I just did not get Tanna at all. There are a lot of things I liked about her, don't get me wrong--she's sassy and smart and she's got quite the mouth on her--but I simply did not like her. She pussyfooted around forever. She refused to show almost any real emotions without sarcasm. There were other small things that annoyed me but, as a whole, Tanna and I simply didn't gel. Which is unusual, as I have loved every other heroine Miz James has written, but it happens.Turn and Burn starts out white hot and, though it slows down for a period, only manages to get even hotter. August Fletcher is the heart of this book for me, with his straightforward methods of seduction. For a man who doesn't have a lot of free time, he knows how to make the most of his nights off. I wish I had grown to love Tanna too but it just didn't happen. Still, if you're in the mood for sexy cowboys who get down and dirty on the job and off--no one beats a Lorelei James hero!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NEXQ5T11ZY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451413962#wasThisHelpful","R30NEXQ5T11ZY9","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: A ... Heat: HotMaise O'Malley has spent her life--all eighteen years of it--simply going through the motions, never really living. No friends, no boyfriends, and, unfortunately, no real parents either. Before the start of her senior year, Maise decides to make some changes. Try to actually experience things, make connections. Live. Her first attempt? Overcoming her lifelong fear of roller coasters. Call it fate, call it kismet, call it whatever you want, but Evan Wilke is also at the local carnival that night for the same reason. The two of them take a free-fall together that night--one that doesn't end once the rollercoaster is over.Screaming and holding hands on the ride quickly leads to moaning and rubbing bodies in Evan's car. Used to random hook-ups, what was supposed to be a hot session with a sexy older guy feels like so much more to Maise. Intense, passionate. Completely unlike any previous hook-up. Evan looks her in the eye, makes sure she gets there too, and, when it's over, he wants more from her. But more is a lot more than Maise can handle... So, she flees. And quickly regrets it. But fate has other plans and Maise soon comes face to face with Evan on her first day back at school.And from there, well, Maise and I both became hot for teacher. The chemistry between these two is off the charts. Throw in some forbidden student-teacher romance and it becomes down right nuclear. But even though both Maise and Evan both get off on that dynamic, revel in it and the secrecy, that's not all they are to each other. They're kindred. Two lost and lonely souls. Broken and weary hearts. They find that something in each other that manages to reach deep and heal old wounds.""You read things in romance novels like he made me melt, knowing this is physically impossible. Girls are not pats of butter. Yet my body was doing a damned fine imitation of I Can't Believe It's Not Girl, dissolving against the side of the house."" - MaiseGod, I related to Maise. My mom might not have been a drug addict but... growing up too fast? Never having gotten to be a kid? Basically raising yourself? Being a not-quite-adult with adult feelings? Yeah, I related to her. A lot. Combine that with her sassy attitude, honesty, all of her vulnerabilities and strengths and, well, you get my kind of heroine. And, while still a teenager riddled with hormones, Maise is incredibly mature. I loved her and immediately wished we could be BFFs.And then there is Evan. Oh, sweet lord, Evan is... amazing. One of those hero's you immediately want to jump into bed with. (Can't really blame Maise for doing exactly that then, can we?) Evan checks off all of my sexy hero boxes. Sensitive, passionate lover? Heck yes. Thoughtful and compassionate friend? Yes! Swoon. A little bit damaged and in need of TLC? So much so my heart melted. Knows what he's doing during the horizontal mambo? Oh, oh, oh yes! Plus there is the whole sexy older man thing... that's damn near irresistible.""I'm in love with this man, I thought. I'm in love with my teacher. I'm in love with Evan Wilke. It felt so crazily good to think it, accept it at last. But my mouth wouldn't say it. I could only put my lips to his skin, heat to heat, and imagine that somehow it was communicated through our blood."" - MaiseIn Unteachable, forbidden lust turns into unlikely true love. It was a beautifully painful and real romance full of clandestine meetings, illicit touches, and stolen kisses. I was hooked from the very first chapter. Miz Raeder has a wonderful way with the written word, making it both poetic and visual. She created two characters I was immediately drawn to and had me hanging on every word. And then there is the way that she writes the sex scenes--filling them with so much tension and passion and emotion. You can feel every touch, every breath. It will knock your darn socks off! You do not want to miss this salacious and evocative romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTX9B56VMR37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6VENSE#wasThisHelpful","R1CTX9B56VMR37","A34PYXX30DCKU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34PYXX30DCKU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When we last left them, Foster went uber-dominant and, though coming from a loving place, wanted to basically LoJack Cela. Used to being smothered by her dad, there was no way that shit was going to fly. So, Cela flew--away from Dallas and Foster.After a lot of time apart and experiencing the not-so-wonderful joys of working for her dad, Cela's missing Foster. All of him. Still not understanding her submissive needs, she can't help but fantasize nightly about what Foster would do to her. And she might even be imagining naughtier, rougher scenarios than they'd experienced together--craving things Foster didn't have a chance to show her. For Foster's part, he's been doing a lot of self-loving too. Plus sleepless nights spent consumed by Cela. When he realizes just what she means to him, off he goes to see her. See if she's happy or if she misses him like he misses her.This installment may be my favorite, as both characters had a good amount of growth. Hopefully the time apart made them reevaluate things and truly figure out exactly what they want. No more wishy-washiness. I don't think my heart or nerves can take more backpedaling--especially from Cela. I can cut her some slack, as she's a 23 year old former virgin and Foster is.... well, a whole lot of man... but, dang girl. Make up your mind. (And, really, it's Foster!

"Seems focused on shock value not science.Like the first book there are some interesting ideas that can cause you step back and examen new ways of looking at things. Unlike the first book this one is much much less throw, and gives very little attention to ideas or data that do not support his concussions. Some of the theories are not based on any data at all, but instead uses assumptions that no evidence is provided to support. It gives the feel that the focus on this book was coming up with wild shocking conclusions to get attention and sell books rather than trying to get to accurate answers.As an example of the use of un-supported assumptions the ""It is more dangers to walk drunk than drive drunk"" conclusion is based on the assumption that people walk and drive the same number of miles drunk. Which seems unlikely. People are only likely to opt for walking if it is a short distance. If there is a long way to travel they are probably driving, getting a ride, or calling a cab.An example of poorly supported ideas. One of the arguments used against global warming is that both cars and cows produce green house gases. While true it ignores that cars produce much larger volumes of green house gases, making them much more damaging.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NV8W53ZVK4MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060889578#wasThisHelpful","R3NV8W53ZVK4MJ","A2B26I3DGUSMB0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B26I3DGUSMB0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite the high price point this product is badly designed and poorly made.Problems:  1.  It does NOT effectively increase the humidity in the air.  2.  It is extremely loud.  3.  If you tap it and it tilts, even a small amount water will spill out of it.  4.  The opening to add water is on the bottom of the tank which gaurenties it will eventually start leaking.  5.  When you pull out the tank to re-fill it it drips a lot.Details  1.  It does NOT effectively increase the humidity in the air.  After running on it's maximum setting for three days it's own humidity sensor showed no increase in humidity.  2.  Makes a lot of fan noise, so if you are a lite sleeper you can not use it in bedrooms.  3.  It holds water in an open tray.  If you bump the unit and it tilts even a small amount water will spill out of it.  If it stays tilted or falls over the entire tank will pour out of it.  4.  The opening to add water is on the bottom of the tank.  There is a cap with a rubber seal to prevent leaking, but it is only a matter of time before the seal starts to wear out.  When that happens it will start to slowly leak.  The opening should be on the top to prevent this from ever being an issue.  5.

"Like most of the reviews I was originally very happy with Roomba, and give it a very positive 5 star review, but the robot broke after less than a year.  I learned not only is it very cheaply built, but its bad design leaves it vulnerable to the dust it is supposed to be designed to pick up.It turns out its parts are very vulnerable to dust which is a major issue for a vacuum cleaner.  None of the gears, barings, or moving components are sealed so dust gets into them and they start to grind until they fail.  Even the gears and bearings that drive the bushes are unsealed leaving them vulnerable to the dust and dirt they are designed to pick up.Eventually the brushes on the bottom stopped working.  The tech support person confirmed that it was still under warranty, and that the problem was a documented know fault with the design.  They how ever refused to replace it.  The only thing they would offer was to send me new parts that I would have to replace my self.  I explained I am not a tech of any kind and did not feel I was qualified to replace small gears that need to be precisely installed.  They said sending me the parts was all they would do for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWCJPM75EXRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UUBCNO#wasThisHelpful","R3PWCJPM75EXRC","A2B26I3DGUSMB0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B26I3DGUSMB0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not expecting much from this product.  I have a very small yard, and just needed to do light weekly trimming.  So this seemed like a good option for me.  The convenience of cordless electric vs. gas.  With the trade off of less power and limited time.  Given that my needs where not very demanding I did not think it would matter.  I was wrong.  My low expectations still turned out to be too high.The product is:  1.  Under powered  2.  The batteries drain quickly  3.  Batteries need half a day to charge  4.  The batteries start to lose their charge as soon as they are un-plugged.1.  Under poweredEven the 18 volt model is lacking in power.  Just cutting grass can not be done in a single pass unless you move very slowly.  It will eventually get the job done, but it takes a log longer than with other products.2.  Batteries drain quicklyMy yard is very small.  It takes about 15 min to mow.  Even fully charge BOTH batteries will only last about 30min.  This is in part due to the second battery never being more than 1/2 charged.(See #4)  30min is just barely enough for my small yard given how slowly you have to go.  (See #1)  So I am always rushing to get done before both batteries go dead.3.  Batteries need half a day to chargeThe batteries realistically have to be plugged in over night to charge completely. After 3hr of charging they will only last about 5 - 10min.  Fully charged they only last about 20 min.  My other cordless power tools, not Black & Decker, only need around 2hr to charge, and last 1hr. - 6hr.4.  Batteries start to lose their charge as soon as they are un-plugged.I was originally impressed that they included two batteries.  I quickly realized that you really only have one and a half batteries at best.  You can only charge one battery at a time.  As soon as you un-plug the batteries they start to lose their charge.  So while you are charging one the other is always draining.  After a full day of being un-plugged the batteries will lose about half of their charge.  So even if you plan ahead and switch the charging batteries the night before the best you can expect are one and a half batteries.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQZ49ZOBO5CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001Q2EMU#wasThisHelpful","R1EQZ49ZOBO5CS","A2B26I3DGUSMB0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B26I3DGUSMB0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am an artsy type, but also lazy. I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.Overall, it's got some good stuff. But don't think you're buying into some great thing. They think they're selling you a bare-bones system, some of which can be addressed with upgrades and some maybe not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CGE73FSUYEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","R8CGE73FSUYEQ","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you set the volume to 4 or 5, the hiss is about as loud as the music.It takes a couple seconds for the power to come on, which is annoying because it is not immediately clear if you pressed the button fully.While scanning, each step makes a bit of a click sound which is kind of annoying.The pocket clip is a thin piece of plastic.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXRPLRBJGALO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2DSYNI#wasThisHelpful","RTXRPLRBJGALO","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pro:Cheap alternative to the no-longer-made black Casio databank (they still make a nearly-identical chrome or gold).Con:Poor quality LCD. Some of the older Casio models had a dark brownish background for the display, but this is different. The LCD itself has a very narrow viewable angle. All of the segments of the LCD turn dark at an angle which is still visible on a real Casio.All right-side buttons are flush with the watch body, the same way the setting button is. This makes many basic features very difficult to use because you really need a finger nail to press them.The segments of the numeric digits have more space between them than a real Casio, making the numbers slightly odd to look at.When setting the time, the seconds don't skip to 00 when pressing the adjustment button. They increase 1 second with each button press. This was very confusing at first, since my intuitive behavior is to press a button and wait a second to see what happened. It took me a while to figure out that it was actually working.The display has a slow refresh response when switching modes or data pages. Not enough to interfere with use, but just enough to notice it seems kind of slow.Overall, it's pretty loaded with features for a cheap generic watch. It's interesting to see a knockoff product made with a full set of features like this. The top row (for day and name display) is a true pixeled/matrix display (many knockoff watches simulate it with dotted segments which are actually figure-8 displays). If you really don't want to spend more, I guess it's an option. It does everything it claims to do. But you'll probably be a lot happier with the real thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1DCKM4ES8JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BL4G3C#wasThisHelpful","R3H1DCKM4ES8JR","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to be overweight, but I slimmed down about a year ago. I am now quite normal, but I still prefer to wear pants sightly larger than my exact measurements. I was offered this in a size slightly larger than a tailor would prescribe, which should have been perfect.However, despite the overall size being what I expected, everything else is cramped. If I bend over a bit, I can feel the inseam riding up my rear. The pockets are all at least half an inch shorter than would normally feel like the minimum size. I can't imagine what it would feel like for someone larger than me who would supposedly be a proper fit.The material feels nice. The elastic sides of the waist band are normally a nice feature on pants, but only useful if one can wear a perfectly-fit size and enjoy added comfort of elasticity around the waist. As these pants are, the shape is only just barely acceptable at a size which makes a stretchable waist unnecessary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19N1H69HHDDE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVL68M2#wasThisHelpful","R19N1H69HHDDE0","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The outside of the package says no programming required, which seemed like an odd claim. The inside of the package tells you how to program it, or tries to.It says to press either the power or the setup (S) button, (and hold it down for up to NINE MINUTES until the TV powers off). That's kind of weird, and turns out not to be true because both buttons do not do the same thing. Holding the power button causes the light to blink for a few seconds and then go off. Holding the S button does nothing for several seconds, and then makes the light come on for as long as you hold it.  Here's an oddity I discovered: if you hold the S, then also press Power, then release both, the light comes on solid forever until you press S.I was not able to get a new LG TV to respond by any method. This same TV is compatible with a 1980s Casio TV remote watch which only has 40 different codes.The flashlight function is not very good. A dim red light with a slightly darker center.

"Now that the new batch of Star Wars Micro Machines is coming out, I am reminded of the sad fact that the Star Wars models were generally not among the better-made Micro Machines. This set in particular, having 3 of the more desired ships, is a perfect example. The Star Destroyer, the ultimate in sharp lines among sci-fi vehicles, is bent. Every single unit I have seen is bent, and doesn't straighten well with the hair dryer trick. It's like the upper and lower halves are not the same size.  The Millennium Falcon's tips don't line up and the details are blobby.

"This is not the same as other penlights, so I'll start with the emitter setup.It's a 5mm LED set in a reflector.  Some 5mm LEDs are set into a reflector (like a regular LED or bulb would be), but most are not.  It's also not the tightly-focused kind of 5MM LED, such as the Nichia LED used in the basic Energizer penlight. This one is a dome-shape which emits light mostly equal in all directions, similar to the LEDs used in Bayco flood flashlights.  Since the LED is somewhat large, and the reflector relatively small in comparison, it produces a wider reflected beam. It's even wider than the 4Sevens Preon, so wide that the reflected light, which would normally form the ""spot"" beam, is as large as the direct flood area.So what we have is a flood beam (about 45 degrees wide total). But it's much more efficient than the flashlights with magnifier lenses, a system which leaves almost zero peripheral light and lets most of the side-emitted light die inside the flashlight body.  The resulting beam is mostly smooth over an area almost as wide as the stereo vision area of your field of view, with soft edges and diminishing light trailing off at the far edges. The color is less blue-tinted than flashlights such as the Coast G20 with a lens.If you're one of the many whose main goal for a flashlight is a super-narrow spotlight, this is not for you. But if you want illumination of an area, not just a narrow spot, this is useful for checking breaker boards or the inside of computer cases with enough light at close range without a blinding narrow spot beam in the middle. It's also good for wandering around in the dark, covering just the right area to see ahead a bit while simultaneously seeing where you are stepping. I'm glad that such a thing is available.The body is also of fairly good quality. The button is too tight in my opinion, but it's about the same as the Streamlight Stylus Pro. It screws together smoothly with well-machines threads and a properly-fit O-ring keeps it watertight (some flashlights have a super-thin ring which barely works).A warning, this flashlight is not black like the stock photo. It's a medium-gray with a very slight bluish-green tint, similar to a lot of other aluminum products which are not-really-black. A lot of new Dorcy products are also this odd color, I'm not sure why.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NKZG5JFXKS8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5R53O#wasThisHelpful","R3NKZG5JFXKS8X","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They are using their Chinese patterns, which are obvious if you are familiar with the actual German Bokers, but sticking a German shield on them. They're a little more chunky in overall design than the true German models. Notice that the blades don't say Germany or Solingen, only the shield which is assembled after the Chinese parts (of unknown assembly progress) are sent to Germany.This is the 4th model of similar marking I have gotten my hands on, and so far every one of them has had one issue or another. If Boker is assembling any of the parts in Germany, they aren't doing a very careful job. Sometimes handle slabs don't fit. Small bumps or notches in the tangs make opening/closing inconsistent.Also lacking is the steel quality. It's not quite as hard as Bokers basic stainless German steel (not even compared to 440c, even the nameless mystery German stainless is better than the Chinese stuff). But also annoying is either an inconsistent formula or sloppy heat treating (both of which can cause similar symptoms) makes the edge wear down in a chunky way as it is used. Steels with good grain structure wear down leaving a finer edge, while inferior steel, like this stuff, leaves a more random edge which does not continue to cut through stuff well (e.g., chunks of the target material are more likely to clog on the edge and rip rather than cut cleanly, such as when cutting tape or envelopes). Even at equal hardness and wear-resistance, a steel with a better grain structure is going to remain useable longer.I've seen equal or better quality from Frost's Steel Warrior line. Collectors sometimes praise this quality level from Frost because their knives are literally 1/2 or 1/3 the price of these Red-Shield Bokers.  Don't put too much in the ""Germany"" shield on this mostly-Chinese knife. Boker is only putting as much German effort into a Chinese-quality knife as they need to in order to justify adding a ""Germany"" shield. Give that due consideration before buying a Boker not clearly labeled ""Solingen"" on the blade.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7YV3788JXHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPDKMJC#wasThisHelpful","RP7YV3788JXHU","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was suspicious when I first saw it, but then a quick mechanism test revealed the brilliance of the design. Very elegant and effective, it rocks forward and the door swings closed and latches.It won't work as well on soft carpet, so leave it on a flat floor or a sheet of paper.The main drawback is it is very small. It's definitely for mice only (definitely NOT a true rat, which is larger than the trap). It's only about 1.25 inch wide, but more important is that the forward half is only about 3.5 inches after the pivot point.

"It's not like the stock photo. The color is listed as brown, but the actual knife they are now shipping is more like a weak orange/yellow color.The fit of the parts is definitely not like the picture. The bone scales are not flat on the inside. The curl back away from the liner and bolsters at the ends and stick out.This probably varies, but on mine the large blade does not hold in place well. When opened, it does stay in place but is very easy to move up and down about 1.8 of an inch before it feels like it hits a strong spring resistance. The inner surface around the tang is crude and lumpy, so one of the lumps in just the wrong spot much be sticking out just enough to ruin the mechanics of it.This is one of Boker's German-assembled buckets of Chinese-made parts, and it's not even on the upper end of Chinese parts.

"I literally would not use pencils regularly if not for this lead. I have a collection of pens, and ended up with an old Cross pencil a while back. I decided to load it up just for the heck of it, but I'm the obsessive type and I quickly ran into a whole world of different lead types. I settled on this stuff (in 0.9mm 2B).This is definitely worth buying. It's both smoother and darker than the normal cheap lead in pencils. It's almost as smooth as a ballpoint. Something more like a super-fine crayon rather than a scratchy pencil. And, despite reading warnings about soft/dark lead being weak, it seems to be fairly durable with no particular problems with breaking while being used.I tried some store brand leads just to be thorough, and they definitely don't hold up.

"My favorite part of this thing is how both the in and out holes are self-closing.  The spout has a little flap which opens and closes on its own to pour water out, and the filling hole on the top has a spring-mounted window so you just fill it from the faucet and it pushes in as you fill, and springs shut when you're done.Other than that, all of these things are fairly similar.  The drawback to this one is that the capacity is a little low, but I like the narrow profile because it's easier to fit in between other junk in the fridge. But the contradiction here is that it's good for squeezing into a loaded fridge, but not good for serving multiple people.

"I always wanted one of these, but they were kind of expensive way back when I was a kid browsing through a knife catalog. For whatever reason, I recently decided I would finally get one.Unfortunately, Hen & Rooster has gone downhill. Not just compared to the original Bertram manufacturing (the ""Bertram cutlery"" which now appears on them is just a lie, as there is no Bertram Cutlery any more; Frost owns the H&R name and has the knives manufactured in the mystery factories), but even compared to the Hen & Rooster knives from the earlier Frost ownership. Some are still OK, but this is not one of them. The modern Hen&Rooster manufacturing strategy is to do a quick sloppy job grinding out the blades, then over-buff the whole thing to blur the edges and hide the sloppy work. The result is a blobby appearance.Despite the excessive buffing, the internal surfaces are pretty rough. It does not feel smooth when opening. And not only is the rear of the tang not smooth, it has that little flat area you can feel just before it snaps open (a pretty common flaw in cheap knives).The H&R logo on the tang isn't stamped in, it looks like it is either printed or an extremely pale and shallow etch. That's lame enough, but the ""german stainless"" on the back is stamped in deeply and the inconsistency looks silly.The shield on mine is not level with the handle. It's sunken in extra deep on one side and sticks out a tad on the other.And then there's one last thing... it had some chunks of buffing compound all over, so I washed it off in PLAIN WATER and this thing keeps dripping red dye. So be careful about carrying this in your pocket if it's raining.The whole thing has the appearance, in all ways, of a crummy imported knife with an extra shine job on the outside.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293GK538O08Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MP1AMWI#wasThisHelpful","R293GK538O08Q7","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT: I always leave my mistakes visible for the sake of honesty. I was wrong. The new version of this knife isn't even assembled in Germany with Chinese parts. The new box does just straight up say MADE IN CHINA. The sticker seal also now labels it as a Boker Plus (always made in China or Taiwan).Old review...Boker has a line of classic-style folders made entirely (?) in Germany, and a bunch of similar knives assembled in Germany of Chinese parts.The Chinese versions have slight differences in the shapes, some relevant and some not. One thing you will notice if you see a current version of this knife is that the Chinese Boker stockman with ""round"" ends on the handle actually have a slightly cornered shape (as if they started square and didn't finish rounding them) while the German version is more rounded. The current production does not look like the stock photo here. The Chinese models also have slightly thicker and sloppier blade bevels. The Chinese models are still OK knives, but they are a definitely lower-end.  Another thing to note is that the location stamped on the knife is either absent or less specific (eg, removing Solingen, or removing both Solingen and Germany).Boker pulled a bit of a sleazeball move by switching the brown bone Cinch stockman from the good version to the cheaper version. SO the super-deep discount you now see isn't really a huge discount, it's reflecting what is probably a lower manufacturing cost.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62L3Q5FO08K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMLG7HQ#wasThisHelpful","R62L3Q5FO08K0","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bolsters are ugly. They don't have as much of a nice curved surface as you might expect from the stock photos. They are more flat, and actually get slightly thicker at the ends. The edges at the ends of the bolsters have a slightly chunky small bevel.The blades wiggle left-right a little.  Not a whole lot, but it's there.The blades are OK, but the tang and bevel do not have a well-defined shape. It looks like a blade which was not manufactured precisely and was over-buffed to cover it up.The scales are made of good stag.By the way, nowhere on the knife or box does it say where the knife is made. The box says ""German"" under the Buck Creek name (odd grammar, most German brands say ""Germany"" as their location). The blade tang says ""German Stainless Hand Made"" which is the sort of thing often stamped on Chinese or Pakistani knives made from cheap steel they imported from a German steel mill.  Just to be clear, the manufacturer absolutely does not clearly state anywhere that this knife meets a local standard for being made in Germany.My best guess is that this knife was made by having parts stamped out in China or Pakistan using German steel, then having someone in Germany do the final assembly (at something less than their absolute best effort). That way they wouldn't have to say where the parts were made, but couldn't specifically say it was made in Germany while still getting away with mentioning the HQ country. And that result appears to be what we have here.  It may be an efficient way of making a medium-quality knife, but consider whether or not the price of these reflects that quality level, and whether or not you want to buy a product which makes efforts to hype what might be a half-true origin (if anyone at Buck Creek/Frost thinks this is not accurate, they are free to provide a clear statement about their manufacturing processing, which they seem to prefer not to do).","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLXPJ557R106/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTXGPMI#wasThisHelpful","RQLXPJ557R106","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATEI'm upping this from 2 to 3.5 stars because apparently all of these cases are pretty bad. However, this one is slightly easier to trim and manually finish up to fit better. Basically, either sand the hard plastic part (smoother on this brand, so sanding makes a nice finished product vs. those with lumpy textures) or put a rubber sticker on the center rear, then assemble with one side aligned and cut down the extra rubber sticking out on the other side. Sounds ghetto, but all of them require some mod and this one is easier.Optionally, you can make the power button easier to press by cutting a slit along both long sides of the button area with a razor, extending past the ends while leaving the end sides attached. The volume buttons already work OK on this case, and the cutting process is better on this case because there is a more defined button protrusion.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe hard shell does not fit correctly over the rubber part. It's very close, but whichever side you snap over first will fit perfectly and the other side will be just barely short of reaching around into the correct position.The whole thing is slippery as heck. Both the rubber and plastic portions are exactly the worst kind of super-fine texture to give no grip at all (a shiny finish would actually grip better than the soft matted finish). The rubber portion is very hard rubber, so it doesn't have the grippy benefit you would normally get even with smooth rubber.  Regardless, unlike the otterbox for my old p[hone, the hard shell doesn't just grab on to certain locations, it's pretty much a full wrap around both sides. So you are gripping the slippery plastic when you hold it, not the rubber.The buttons work OK, which is the only thing this case gets right.The corners of the cutout around the charging port are sharp. This could easily have been designed with a rounded or beveled edge if they bothered to think about it, but they didn't.It was shipped inside a hard plastic retail-ish case to protect it during shipping, and yet the back of the case was scratched up as if it were used.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHTIQHTH5G96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIM2P76#wasThisHelpful","R1QHTIQHTH5G96","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice and shiny. The handle looks smooth, though it needed a little soap to remove buffing compound from the scales. Once cleaned, it looks great.The Philips screwdriver is absurdly small, about half the size of the Philips on a Victorinox, but the point isn't any sharper so it's not like a precision driver. There is a cutout in the handle to make room for the screwdriver, but it doesn't close down into that cutout. It hovers above the handle over that cutout and looks like the wrong parts were used.The main blade has a very weak spring.

"I'm a fool. I forgot that I bought a similar Clauss knife years ago and returned it because it was lame. I ran into this, apparently on sale for an extremely low price, and added it to my cart without thinking much.At full price, it's as much as a Victorinox gardener, and almost identical in size and shape, but just not made as well. The last one I had didn't snap open well. This one doesn't want to close well.  The edge is almost good, but a little thicker and steeper than the Victorinox and not consistently sharp (one area blunt, one flaking metal, one OK). It's a little too blunt and sloppy for cutting flowers. The blade feels rough when opening.  The blade also has a slight left/right wiggle when open.  It looks OK at first glance, with the parts all fitting together well, but the finer points are all a bit sub-par.The main design difference is the Clauss' having a main bevel on both sides (but the final edge bevel is one-sided), while the Victorinox is completely flat on the back side. This is ideal for cutting stems, as the one-sided blade profile pulls the cut stump away from the stem of the flower, and there is no crushing against the stem end you want to pot.  The Clauss would probably still be OK if not for the blunt edge angle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSBZD40VGAX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I4JSPG#wasThisHelpful","R3BSBZD40VGAX7","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use can openers, so it's disappointing that the one on this is not useable (it's the really old style, which requires a good sharp internal edge and a very pointy tip). On the other hand, it's cool that they made this with the super-retro style can opener, given that it is hard to put a functional one on a knife this size anyway.The bottle opener would be slightly awkward to use, with its short size requiring a few pry-ups along the edge rather than a single motion, but it would still work.  But of course this is kind of a novelty item, so I'm not subtracting anything for low useability.The blade is actually sharpened well, and is both fairly well-sharpened and done at a low enough angle that it will be easy to touch up.Rough Rider did not add an awl to this knife, which is a good thing.  A common scout knife pattern has a poorly-shaped awl which requires a nasty bent blade and the whole thing still doesn't fit.  For a full-size knife, I prefer many of the German scout-style knives which skip it.  This knife has a nice straight main blade which doesn't jam up against an awl or unnecessary second blade and get scratched up.The overall quality is very good. The blades snap well but the springs are not too stiff to use, a problem many cheap knives have.  The bone and bolsters are polished well on the sides (the edges are left brushed). The shield is fit nicely into the bone.

"First, the blunder: you can't turn off the vibration for the navigation keys. I find keypress vibrations to be extremely annoying, and it is just silly that a phone manufacturer would not offer this feature. I googled, and Microsoft says the OS supports an option to disable nav key vibration but the manufacturer has to choose to enable it or something like that. The option is not in the menu where MS says it should be, and the only mention of vibration in the settings only affects keypresses on the screen (the nav keys here are actually not part of the display).The only saving grace with the vibration is that it is weaker than average (hardly a good selling point), so the constant vibration from the home button is not as audible as most phones would be.The navigation keys also do not light up. A lot of phones skip this, and you can get used to their positions (only 3 of them), but it just seems ridiculous that Blu thought that it was so necessary for these same keys to vibrate (an entirely functionless behavior) that they have made it mandatory, but don't care if you can see them.The screen quality is pretty good. Unlike some of Blu's early products, the resolution is high enough that it doesn't assault your eyes with chunkiness. The color and brightness are also roughly in line with most modern phones as well. The viewing angle is not extremely wide, but is good enough that you don't get an unsettling holographic effect.Processing power is definitely where this phone has some issues. This is a complex aspect of a computing device, so I won't pretend to diagnose the exact problem. It can run Angry Birds mostly OK for a long time (with an occasional freeze fixed by locking and unlocking the screen). Another problem, more notable, is that it doesn't scroll smoothly. Whether it be web browsers, file manager, Twitter, or even the phone's own menu system, it moves at a rougher motion than any other phones I have (including an older Nokia Windows phone). Oddly, if you ""toss"" the page and let it scroll under its own simulated inertia, it goes smoothly. But tap-and-drag makes it jump in continuous chunks as if maybe the touch display doesn't have a good sensor resolution. I guess? Whatever the cause, it's good enough to use but not reliably smooth.The body of the phone has a very nice matted finish and the whole thing feels as solid as a phone should.Sound quality is somewhat weak (as is the vibration). Useable, but not a good choice if you want to use your loudspeaker a lot of talk outdoors. Note that, in my opinion, hardly any phones are very good here, so this only makes it average.The camera quality isn't like a high-end Nokia, but is actually a little better than I expected. It's squarely medium among speed and quality.Overall it's an ""OK"" Windows phone, plus the added feature of having a larger display than you normally get in this range. But that might only be true if you absolutely need the Windows OS. This runs about the same price as my 1st generation Moto G Android which doesn't have the scrolling issues, no fascist key vibration, and somewhat better sound.

"I don't normally buy stuff like this, so keep in mind that I have little to compare it to.I sometimes get dry skin, in part because I never wear gloves in cold weather and also because I clean tools with harsh cleaners (soaps, WD40, etc) without gloves. I don't bother with hand lotion because all of the stuff people have previously offered to me seems like it just makes your hands goopy, but otherwise doesn't help much.This year I was doing especially bad. My knuckles were so dry that my skin literally cracked in a few places, which causes painful little nearly-invisible wounds resembling paper cuts which hurt when I flex my fingers because all of the motion is concentrated on the ripped-open flesh. Yuck!  I was desperate and randomly grabbed this stuff at the 7-Eleven (the only thing they had) without researching as I normally would.I can't believe how well this works. After something like an hour or less (I didn't push things too quick, so I'm not sure exactly when it got better), my skin is back to being flexible, and the lotion has dried or absorbed or whatever and I am simultaneously not dry or cracking, AND not dripping with goo.  I have a little bit of a rubbery grippy feel on my skin, but it's not rubbing off on clothing or anything. And it remains that way for several hours (24 might be overstated, but twice a day seems to do the trick).The active ingredient listed is dimethicone, which Wikipedia says is a polymer with both liquid and elastic properties.

"In the stock photo, the can opener is clearly a sharp tool which is intended to work. The one I got is not, it's one of the bluntest can openers I have seen on a knife.As is common in poorly-designed scout/camper knives, the large blade and the awl rub against each other. The awl is tapered as it should be, as if to avoid pushing against the blade too much, but not enough. The blade does not snap closed all the way by itself because it is wedging against the awl.If you open the awl, leaving the blade closed of course, the blade moves over blocking the awl's return path. The tip of the blade is very close to the edge of the awl's tang, and depending on exactly how you hold the knife, the tang of the awl can jam against the tip of the blade when closing.This is definitely not a good alternative to a Victorinox.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9D0L4AC70DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCYB066#wasThisHelpful","R2F9D0L4AC70DE","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thanks to the combination of Lamy's needlessly silly ballpoint mechanism (in which they moved half of the mechanism to the front of the pen) and Monteverde's sub-par manufacturing, these refills are not good at remaining extended in the 2000 model. The CP1 seems to mostly work OK.Lamy's ballpoint cartridges are held in the forward position by 3 little house-shaped bumps on the plastic piece at the front, which has to go forward and sit atop 3 flat tabs in the nose of the pen. Nothing keeps the cartridge from rotation in either direction and slipping back into the retracted position, and unfortunately Monteverde's little retaining bumps are not as sharp and squared off as a real Lamy refill.  About every 3rd or 4th time I click the button forward to use the pen, the cartridge will hold in place for a fraction of a second and then slip off and spring back into the pen.I have two Lamy 2000 ballpoints (one fresh and new, one older production), and the same thing happens in both.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6RC18OK6TH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUL4ZAO#wasThisHelpful","R1C6RC18OK6TH3","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a nice functional pen, using a Parker-type refill.I wasn't sure how I would like the rubber bumps, as some pens go overboard with grip texture. They are not like that, they only stick out just enough to add a slight grip and are a non-aggressive dome shape.  The clip isn't too bad either, being more of an internal spring-mounted type (the visible portion does not bend, it hinges on some internal mount) though a slightly mushy one.The only problem is that it does look a little cheap, especially for the price. The ""silver"" surface is just that cheap frosty gray stuff you see all over.  The part between the barrel and the button is unfinished, just unfinished gray plastic with an extreme mold line on one side. If you have an eye for this sort of thing, the plastic is also that nearly-translucent stuff where it isn't covered by the frosty coat. Then there's the mold line where the triangular barrel meets the cone-shaped front end. It's a little sharp and is clearly a molding intersection with imperfect alignment (not just where the shape changes).None of that is absolutely horrible, and this might very well be your favorite pen for long note-taking sessions, but for the price it really ought to be a little better all around. It only looks slightly above the sort of pen you can refill but typically don't, but for about 5 times the price.  Consider that this is in the range of a Parker IM with a brass (if somewhat thin brass) body with a lacquer coating.A final bit of info, this is a non-clicking button.  It moves up and down with no feelable or audible click. I have actually come to prefer this since getting several Caran d'Ache 849's which are also fairly silent, but some people like the feel of a good solid click.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLD15KBGIBLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WGVGG4#wasThisHelpful","R3VLD15KBGIBLH","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then it has a smooth clear coating over that.The pocket clip and button don't make any sense. They are a matted/bead-blasted finish as you find on a lot of very cheap products (not the simple smooth finish on other versions of this pen).  I hate the cheap look I expect on junk, and regardless of one's like or dislike of matte gray it doesn't make any sense to have an extreme antiqued finish on the body, but then have a button and clip which are done in the style of a new modern low-cost item.

"Read this whole thing to understand just how shady this is.Many pen manufacturers have their own shape for ballpoint refills.  This is annoying, but can usually be overcome because the main difference is usually just the length.  I have a lot of pens with alternative refills installed, if I want a different color or ink type than is available from the pen manufacturer.There's no way to do that with a Lamy ballpoint. They have done the most absurdly unnecessary thing you MIGHT be able to imagine. Most people wouldn't come up with something this nutty.Imagine a Parker refill. It has alternating high and low surfaces on the back of the cartridge, and some teeth built into the pen's button which alternatively line up with the high or low positions as you click it in and out (note that many pens which user Parker refills, even many of Parker's own pens, don't actually rely on this any more, but rather have a complete retraction mechanism in the pen).Lamy still uses a similar concept for their clicker ballpoint, but they have the entire system at the FRONT of the pen.  If you look at a picture of a Lamy refill, that black piece near the front isn't just a block for the spring to rest against. It has 3 angled teeth sticking out, which fit into a mechanism built into the nose of the pen. The teeth on the refill go past the teeth inside the nose of the pen and rest against the front of those.There is basically no way to fit any alternative refills into this pen, and it's because Lamy went out of their way to make their pens ridiculously complex for no conceivable reason other than to make you buy their stuff. You can get a Monteverde refill made for it, but Monteverde makes a lot of junk.  There's zero hope of fitting a Parker gel or Uniball ballpoint into this thing.It's one thing if, for example, Sheaffer has their own cartridge shape because they don't want to change from the one they invented 60+ years ago. Or Waterman, which had the brilliant idea of making their ballpoint refills compatible with their rollerball pens if you want to switch (try it, almost any Waterman rollerball can take a Waterman ballpoint cartridge).  But Lamy is doing this for no reason I can imagine other than to require you to buy OEM refills.  And oh boy did they go out of their way, what with this odd reach-around system up at the front.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAJ3JKIB9171/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G0G5RG#wasThisHelpful","RAAJ3JKIB9171","A2BB4DGBRVGKWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BB4DGBRVGKWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't say enough about the quality and design of this slow cooker!  It is a heavy-duty, quality piece of kitchenware.  It consists of a base made of metal with two handle/latches on the side.  Into this base fits the crock---unusual that it is rectangular, but that makes it perfect for slow cooking casseroles.  Being more shallow than other round, deep slow cookers, it seems that food should cook a little quicker on high, and I found that to be the case.  The crock is even oven-safe!  The lid to the unit is exceptional, as it has a silicone seal around it's edge that allows it to make a complete, leak free seal for the crock.  (I've had so much trouble in the past with slow cookers having ill-fitted lids.)  The lid then attaches to the metal base with nice quality plastic and metal locks...this is for transport only, and not to be used during cooking.  When not in use, the locks on the lids fold into little ""nooks"" and out of the way.  This unit has a dial with 3 settings--low, high, and keep warm---and of course ""off.""I often give cookware away to friends and family when I find something better, but not this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXL76D64QSBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H70KMTA#wasThisHelpful","RGXL76D64QSBR","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little thing is pretty amazing when you see how quickly it unfolds and refolds.  I had a 7 year old try it out and she mastered it right away.  Right out of the box, the easel legs will unfold in moments and then you slide the two support pieces to the desired height for what you want to display.  You then just spread the legs out to the back and then bring one to the front to make a tripod.  After working with the legs a little bit, you see where a good balance point is where all 3 legs will be securely on the floor and the easel won't tip over.  In taking it down, the key is to utilize the elasticity of the bands in the legs and firmly pull the leg sections apart when refolding...they will then collapse quickly into a small, portable bundle.  Pretty genius, really.  Now, this is not designed to hold a large, heavy item, but will easily support several poster boards, a small framed print/painting, or other lightweight object.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QA8BRN5V01KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IAT6#wasThisHelpful","R1QA8BRN5V01KC","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already had these on both my front doors when I got these new ones, so it was just a matter of replacement--they had gotten a little bit worn and dirty over the years.  I had previously used all kinds of towel and fabric contraptions to seal off the draft under my doors, but every time I would have to move whatever I constructed.  So these little things are brilliiant!  You end up with a foam roller on the inside and on the outside of the bottom of the door..the entire length of the door...and they are held in place by the velvety material that encloses them and then passes under the door.  When you open the door, the whole thing just slides along with the door, and back when it shuts.

"Well, I don't think you can go wrong with Arrow products, and this stapler is an example of their good quality products.  This is not an industrial-type stapler, as there are a number of plastic parts, but it is certainly a sturdy little thing.  There is a nice cushiony handle at the top where the heel of your hand & thumb  grip when using, as well as cushioning for where your other fingers rest,  It is very easy to load, by simply pushing up a tab and sliding out the top of the staple chamber.  I noticed that it is well-balanced in order to put the weight of the stapler closer to the front where you are going to be applying all the force.  With this stapler, you must make certain that the area where the staple will be ejected is placed completely flush with the surface where the staple will come out, an apply a great deal of force, as the staple will not go all the way in otherwise.  I would suspect that more industrial staplers would be heavier and help steady the stapler to get good contact.This is a stapler that I think is excellent for around-the-house projects and repairs, and will last for years with occasional use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCJ9L93870KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BORWWPO#wasThisHelpful","RGCJ9L93870KQ","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Vornado Small Room Tower Heater is aptly named, and is a good choice for very small rooms.  Unlike other small heaters I own, it does not fan/blow heat directly out the front, but rather circulates it out.  You can get very, very close to it, even when on the ""high"" setting, and not be uncomfortable.  This feature is good and bad, in that it is a nice heater to put very close to you when you're sitting watching TV to warm your feet, but is not really effective in spreading heat quickly out into a room that you want to heat.  My small dog likes to lie inches away from this heater, so it is perfect for older pets who need extra warmth, and it's not dangerous for them to do so.  There are two settings...high and low...and a red light indicator to let you know it is on.  One great feature is the very sensitive ""tip-over"" safety feature:  if you pick up the heater (which you can do easily to move it, because it does not get hot on the outside), it immediately cycles into a sort of standby mode, and a warning light comes on..  When you place it back down, it resumes it's heating...much better than if it completely cut off every time you adjusted it's position.  There is an overheat function that has not kicked in since I have had the heater and I have used it for hours and hours at a time.  There is also a timer feature, which I would never use because I stay in the room with the heater and cut it off when I get ready to leave the room for an extended amount of time.  Another good feature is the 5-year warranty.This is a good heater for quick heat in a very small area, but I disagree with the write-up about the product that states that the heater has a ""wide circulating area.""  The heater is only 12 inches tall, and the heat comes straight out from the wavy-lined vents on the front of it, and it only radiates maybe one foot or so directly in front of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1578YTOJI9HUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQC4WRU#wasThisHelpful","R1578YTOJI9HUS","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a c-pap user at night for sleep apnea, I began to have congestion as well as a dry nose now that I'm using heat in my home....wasn't such an issue in the summer.  Instead of using the humidifier feature on the c-pap, I wanted to try a humidifier for the whole bedroom.  I have been using the Vornado for a few days now, and it's made a big difference for me.  I feel that it is a good quality humidifier that will last for years, with good maintenance.  It was quite easy to set up, with good instructions in the booklet.  I have well water, so I will be cleaning the filters periodically in a solution of vinegar and water, as recommended, so that I don't have to buy filters frequently.  It will be a chore keeping up with when the filters need to be cleaned/changed, but time will tell if the good, humid air is worth the trouble.I do have a couple of things I don't like about this unit.  First, there is no light to signal that the water in the tank is low.  You can see through the tank, but it is at the back of the unit so that I have to turn it to see the tank clearly.  A light on the front would make things much easier.  Secondly,  is the noise of the unit.  It operates pretty quietly on low, but the water gurgling into the base from time to time can be pretty loud.  If on ""high"", the fan is noisy enough that I can't sleep, and if on ""auto,"" the changing from low to high is even worse.  On ""low"" it is actually quite restful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39IR5O9CLN1JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00826ORV2#wasThisHelpful","R39IR5O9CLN1JQ","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have used several different types of sleepers for the newborn in the family, but this is definitely her favorite.  She likes the hammock/snuggle position that she is in when in the sleeper, especially when it is inclined.  The fabric is soft and plush, and she seems to feel all ""snuggled up"" when placed in it.  It rocks slowly and steadily when pushed, and doesn't have jerky movements.  The height of this sleeper is a plus, in that when placed beside a bed, the baby is at eye level.  It is portable, and folds up easily and compactly, fitting up against a wall in a very small space.  The baby is too young to pay attention to the ""clackers"" but these are a nice feature for when she gets a little older.This is a very convenient and well-designed sleeper that we anticipate using until she outgrows it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NIAZ1ZLB5EUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2KW3II#wasThisHelpful","R3NIAZ1ZLB5EUK","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a person who loves nice pillows, and I love this one!  It is soft, although somewhat lumpy, and keeps its volume no matter how much I plump it and re-arrange it.  The pillow is not so hard that you strain your neck trying to sleep on it, but is not so soft that your head sinks almost down to the bed...it's just right.  I have lots of pain in my neck and the right pillow is essential for me to sleep well.  I also like that there are 2 sections to this pillow...one large and one smaller...that are separated by a small strip of fabric, and the 2 parts can be adjusted many different ways.  (The picture shows the strip of fabric as being thick and stuffed, but it is actually just material that separates the two distinct pillows.)  One nice thing is that I didn't notice a chemical odor when opening the plastic zippered pouch the pillow comes in, like you do with some pillows and bed linens.  The label states that the cover can be removed and laundered, but I have not tried to do this yet.  The zipper is covered and not visible at all, which means that it is not going to scratch your face or arms.

I have to say that we were unable to get a clear night to test out the ultimate power of the scope, but we were able to see very far into the landscape/distance with much more power than binoculars.  The stand helps keep the scope steady during use, but it is not tall enough to be placed on the ground, even for a child...must be placed up on a table for ease of use.  Workbook is really nice and provides supplemental education for a child about what she is viewing in space.

"This is a pretty simple grill/griddle combination with nonstick surface, but I'm not sure how sturdy and long-lasting it will be over the long term.  The base is made of plastic that is more flimsy than other griddles like this that I have owned, which concerns me.  The grill/griddle plate seems pretty sturdy, but being a person who has seen many nonstick surfaces, I don't feel that this one will wear very long unless much care is taken to keep from scratching it with metal cooking utensils.  I always use a good amount of oil on nonstick anyway so that would help maintain the surface on this unit.The cord needs more length and could use another foot before it would be deemed too long for safety purposes.  I don't mind the temp control having settings instead of graduated temperatures, as you know you need it medium high for pancakes and then medium for most other cooking.Another feature that is missing is a drip pan/tray.  Yes, there are holes on both sides for excess oil/drippings to flow into, but then the hot juices fall down directly into the plastic base..?  This is messy to say the least and I'm not sure about hot stuff on that plastic.Needs a sturdier base, a drip pan, a longer cord, and then I might recommend, but now I feel that other griddles would be a better purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGCJ5JAPWP1NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7MTBWS#wasThisHelpful","RGCJ5JAPWP1NI","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is just no way that one can read this book, and not feel a sense of worth, of hope, and of love.  The author tells her story from childhood to present as it relates to what she did or didn't receive from others...family, friends, acquaintances...and emphasizes, through her rather rambling (but warm and heartfelt) style, how God can fill in the gaps and heal us if we allow Him to do so now that we are adults.I felt that, even though parts of her story were, of course, different from my own, and that some of her basic religious tenants are different from my own, that we had much common ground--a basic belief that God is there for us 24/7, we're human and make mistakes, and obesity can create much emotional suffering.  I also loved that she discussed that Jesus did not hold women in contempt like those of his day, but yet esteemed them...reminded me of when my Sunday School teacher years ago said that Jesus was the 1st ""women's libber.""In all troubles, she stresses that if we recognize that God is our heavenly Father and desperately wants us to thrive and blossom, that the peace and serenity this provides is something we can get nowhere else.

She uses the camcorder, the camera, and the calculator in chief, and then uses the Kindle and computer for everything else such as movies (Netflix and others), educational computer programs such as Starfall (free) and ABC Mouse, books, and other apps and games that we can access for her for 99 cents or for free.  Problem is that all the available programs and downloads for the Leap Pad start at $10 and go up from there, which makes other devices preferable.

"We (myself and my contractor brother) tested this product, and found it to be a pretty good device for powering up cell phones, computers, and such, but not so great with power tools, even though it is advertised to be able to handle them.  After noticing that the power obviously waned when using a Dremel tool, this device was hooked up to a voltage meter.  Even though it is stated that it gives 120 volts, it was shown to actually be giving the Dremel 112 volts...important because it increases the wear and tear on the motor.At 500 watts, this should have been able to handle a grinder, but it overcharged and shut down, presenting other problems.  There is no reset instructions in the materials that came with the device, and no reset button....just have to wait til such time that it will cut back on.  There is also no ""ready"" button which would be helpful to indicate when the inverter has ""warmed up,"" in addition to the ""on"" button.  Also, it would make sense to have an ""on/off"" button.Other problems that were noted:1.  Instructions not clear in many places, and out of sequence, causing someone to have to read everything in total before using safely...which many people don't really want to do.  A quick start guide would be nice, and a clearer troubleshooting guide.2.  Cables seem short and could be longer.Positive:  no problem at all with a cell phone, a computer, and a Kindle.  Very handy to have when away from home.  This is obviously a well-made, sturdy piece of equipment.To summarize, it appears that this device with this voltage (500 watts) is not the best for motors ""that spin"" but is fine for passive devices such as cells, Kindles, ipods, etc.  An inverter to use power tools in a remote location is a needed item, and this disappointed in that respect, although it should have been able to handle the work...a higher voltage inverter would be advised for power tools.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0IBJZKG1951/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATXERNO#wasThisHelpful","RD0IBJZKG1951","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece and I are always on the lookout for a better vacuum.  We were both happy to test this one out, in both our homes, and such pleasant results!  Both of us have animals and deal with pet hair on a daily basis, so this vacuum is a shining star in that regard.Directions to set up the vac out of the box were easy to follow and no difficult assembly was required.  Packaging was nice and appropriate for the size vacuum.  This vac is small and lightweight, and easy to maneuver around.  The Ball Technology is a little cumbersome when wanting the vacuum to go in a straight line because it pulls to the side a bit, but that's tolerable when you figure in how well it turns when wanting to get in corners and under tables.  My niece especially liked that she had already vacuumed the day before with her older vaccum and after using this Bissell, she still collected ""a TON"" of additional dirt and fur.Extension hose for attachment is a little shorter than other vacuums I've had in the past, so that is one slight negative. Maybe newer models will correct this problem, hopefully.Push button technology for the dirt cup is very simple and does not make a mess - no banging the canister on trash cans causing dirt and hair to fall everywhere.Fur removal attachment works wonderfully.  There is a button to turn the brush on and off, versus it automatically cutting on and off when the vacuum is in the upright position -- not sure what the point of this is?Power cord is long enough to vacuum several rooms without having to continuously move the cord from outlet to outlet.This vac has an impressive 5 year warranty, so I consider it a really excellent vacuum for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20TW6WKY7BFIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUG0A7E#wasThisHelpful","R20TW6WKY7BFIK","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As you cannot see the interior hose beneath the crinkly-material outside, I have no idea what it's made of, but, just solely from the feel and weight of the hose, it's most likely a flimsy plastic.  I would not want to expose this hose to lots of temperature extremes, as I think it would weaken & crack, so I will be bringing it inside when the weather turns very cold.The pros are that there don't seem to be any leaks when I hook it up to the outside spigot.  It does shrink back up, and empty itself, quickly after the water is turned off.  It is light and easy to handle for someone who can't deal with a heavy hose.It might be OK for occasional use during the summer months for watering flowers or outside potted plants, but not much more.  I strongly dislike buying products that are not sturdy and long-lasting, and I believe this is one that fits in that category, despite the innovation of this type hose.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51T17FZ9YYI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE23LDC#wasThisHelpful","R51T17FZ9YYI5","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 1st surveillance camera, and I'm not too much of a techie, so my review is based on that. I used Firefox, and I had a little trouble setting up the camera at DLink.com related to Java, but then after a few tries, it was all set up.  It was simple to plug it into my router (didn't want to set up wirelessly), and I set it in the room on a table where I wanted it (no wall mount right now).  Once I got into the settings online, that was easy to configure.  The position of the camera ""eye"" is controlled by arrows that let you change angles and allows you to pan almost 360 degrees.  There is sound and motion detection, and you can set it to send you an email upon any detections.  Motion detection is set up by placing a box on the picture where you want to check for motion.I believe I was expecting a more sophisticated camera, as the picture is just ""OK"" and the online controls sound noisy and awkward.  When pressing the button to pan, it will pan a few degrees and stop, instead of smoothly moving.  You have to keep tapping the mouse to get it to continue moving....I don't like that feature.All in all, it seems to be a good basic camera that I will be using to watch my pets when I am away from home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEHJI89IKJ33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL8F98W#wasThisHelpful","R3HEHJI89IKJ33","A2BXMHV2B0QRCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BXMHV2B0QRCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeff Chu, first of all, is an excellent writer.  This book reads so very smoothly, that I found myself going through page after page without noticing the ground I'd covered.  This book exposes some ugly truths about Christianity that I suspected was there, and now I think he has ""proven"" is there.  It's not that Christians are ugly, but it's that we have done human things to God and Christ, and, as Jeff says, turned them into who we want them to be.  It's also very sad to me that he met so much resistance from PASTORS who seemed so reluctant to face the truth that there are LGBT people, probably in their own churches, who don't feel they are as loved and cherished as others.I'm so very glad to have read this book, and I will recommend to everyone who will read it.

"Haven't tested the speeds, but so far am loving it. It seems to work great, it's USB 3.0 which is important these days both for data transfer rates and for charging devices. I love the ability to turn the individual ports on and off. I picked up a little velcro tape to hold this onto the back edge of my desk and it is working great.It's a little wider than my hand with fingers closed, the cable is fairly short, so unless you are planning on having it hang off the back of your computer, or sit directly on top of your computer you will want to pick up an extra USB 3.0 cable so you can run it somewhere on your desk. AmazonBasics has a nice 6ft USB 3.0 A-Male to A-Female cable which worked great for my purposes. I would also suggest picking up some velcro tape like I did to help hold it in place so it doesn't constantly shift when you plug and unplug devices.I would definitely recommend this hub. It was immediately recognized, it works great, I have two permanent items (wireless mouse adapater, and bluetooth adapater), and one charging cable which I can easily turn on and off as needed, and that still leaves me a free port, plus it freed up all of the top USB slots on my PC. If you are looking for a small USB 3.0 hub and think this one might work for you, then stop looking and buy it.Improvements:In my opinion it would be better to have the cable on the other side of the box. Simply because most people place their PC's on the right side of their desk, so if placed on the desktop the cable has to loop back over the hub. Not a major issue, just something that would have been nice.Update:I've removed two stars from the review due to performance issues. I like the USB hub, but have found that there appears to be a problem with a steady data flow going through devices hooked up through the HUB. I had both a wireless mouse and a bluetooth adapter for my headset plugged into this hub. I found that when the headset was connected via the hub I had problems with static and sound cutting out randomly. I also found that when using my wireless mouse through this hub the mouse would sometimes stutter or not register commands as they were given. Obviously this makes it unusable for those devices, though it still seems to work fine for charging my USB devices or for using devices where performance/stability is less critical.I have since plugged both my mouse and bluetooth adapter directly into my computers USB ports again and now everything is working smoothly. So the problem does appear to be with the HUB. I will still continue to use it for a charging hub for any USB devices, but I won't attempt to hook up any more sound or input devices through the hub. Hopefully my results are just a fluke. My only major complaint with this device are the performance issues, so if you don't have performance issues like I did then it would be a nice little hub. Ports and buttons seem to be reasonable quality and function flawlessly. All devices were easily detected and technically functional through the hub. I intend to do some further testing to rule out the USB cable I have the hub plugged into, but currently the problem appears to be with the HUB.Update:I contacted Amazon about this issue. Even though they were unable to send me a replacement since this is through a third party, they did refund me the cost. So while I cannot recommend this USB hub based on my experiences with its performance, I still would absolutely recommend doing business through Amazon (just perhaps on a different USB Hub).If the manufacturer could work out whatever the problem is with the HUB's performance then this could be a good hub. But based on the one I received it just isn't viable for me where you can only use limited devices in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q28IIFH4T6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JX1ZS5O#wasThisHelpful","R2Q28IIFH4T6P","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small enough to not be a bother, and working great. The drivers were auto detected on my Win7 computer, but I did install the disk software anyways.Once the drivers are installed that is all you need to do for this to function. There is no software or anything like that for pairing. When you get a device to pair (I assume it will be a headset of some sort) simply open your PC control panel, click on ""Add a device"", and turn on your bluetooth device. This is basically how the pairing is done, once the device is on it should show up in your list of devices to add.I used this with a set of bluetooth ""Life n Soul MT103"" bluetooth earphones and they synced right up and are working perfectly fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6E4O6RH3XBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BC1U4O#wasThisHelpful","R1G6E4O6RH3XBW","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boar Brushes:- Tend to have firmer bristles, which makes it easier to work the soap into a coarse beard- I would suggest using this if you have thick or coarse hair, or if you tend to let your beard grow out. The tougher bristles make it easier to work the lather down into the beard beyond the long/coarse hair.Badger Brushes:- Tend to have softer bristles which can feel nice, but is not as good at working the lather behind longer/tougher hair.- I would suggest using this if you shave daily (never grow your beard out), have incredibly soft/thin hair, or if you are a woman shaving your legs. The softer bristles feel nice, but it really struggles to get lather down into the hair if you let it grow out. If you are a woman and let your leg hair get long then you would want to consider the boar brush as well, but generally leg hair is spread out enough that it's not as much an issue as it is for beards.Pro's:- Nice stiff boar bristles make it great for working the soap into a lather and getting it into a beard.- Very cheap priceCon's:- Funky wet wild animal smell, hopefully this goes away at some point as this is a deal breaker if it lasts long term. (-1 star)- Bristles seem a bit too long making the brush pretty huge. I would actually like to see this as a shorter brush. (-1 star)Overall:-----------I generally like the brush, but it would be better if it was a tad shorter and the smell is pretty bad. Hopefully the smell will go away at some point because if you had to shave every morning with a brush that smelled like that you simply wouldn't do it. And for those that say the hair is from an animal, so are all the other brushes I have used and this is the only one to smell so bad. So clearly there is some sort of treatment to get rid of the smell which Omega simply doesn't appear to use. Nothing wrong with that given the cheap price, but this is only viable if the smell eventually goes away. If the smell doesn't go away it's worth spending the money on a better quality brush.Personally I would not recommend this brush at this point. I will wait until the smell goes away (if ever) before I would recommend this brush, but that is really my only major complaint. A few hairs worked loose while using it, but that is pretty normal for most new brushes. But the brush is so large it feels kinda like using a large paint brush on my face.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQC9WNGWNSGWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BWNR9A#wasThisHelpful","RQC9WNGWNSGWR","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this popcorn popper. I wanted a kettle popper but didn't want the big hassle of keeping it clean. Instead I went with an air popper, which works great but just isn't the same.This gives you a kettle style popper, but with a small easy surface to keep clean and the top doubles as the bowl. Add a about a tablespoon of oil, 1/3 cup of popcorn, 1/2 teaspoon flavorcol salt and it tastes just like movie theater popcorn.Obviously there's a little cleanup, but it's not difficult like a real kettle popcorn popper would be. This uses the same principles for cooking the popcorn which makes it turn out spectacular but doesn't have a massive footprint (or cart), can easily be put away, and is easily cleaned up. I do think there are several areas that could be improved on the popper, but overall this is a great product that I would absolutely recommend. This is hands down my favorite popcorn popper.Improvements I would suggest:- Instead of using a wire to stir the kernels you could use something a little stronger and shaped as a wedge (trapezoid, wedge on both sides) so that it would lift and stir the kernels instead of allowing them to go under or get caught between the base and the wire (which causes tons of noise).- Make the top metal a solid surface that covers everything below it. Currently there is a little lip around the outside that potentially allows salt, oil, etc... to fall underneath the top surface and into the mechanics in the base.I would happily pay slightly more for a model that addresses the above issues, but even with these issues this is still hands down the best popper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HS13FUVG3O5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL8SM92#wasThisHelpful","R2HS13FUVG3O5K","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great vacuum sealer. Significantly improved over the much older versions I grew up using. I remembered growing up using my Mothers vacuum sealer which seems like it took forever to vacuum and seal an item, and even then it seemed to struggle to get all the air out. This is not the case anymore, there is plenty of power in this vacuum sealer to quickly (about 10 seconds) remove all the air from your bags/containers. It does this quickly and effectively creating a very tight vacuum.Pros--------- Quick (10seconds)- Powerful, easily removing all air and pulling the bag tight against your product- Automatic, simply place the edge in the sealer section and it will automatically lock it in place, vacuum the bag, and seal it.- Nice section to hold the rolls up top.- Also seals the bags from the top roll holder as well- Extra attachments for sealing containers and ziplock bags.Cons--------- Doesn't fit the larger 50ft rolls- Doesn't fit the 11.5 inch wide bags (but will still seal them)- Lots of wasted bag because the sealer sits so far backOverall-----------I love this vacuum sealer, it is faster and far more powerful than any others I have used making this hands down the best vacuum sealer I have ever used. I would definitely recommend this product. It is expensive, but I did not include the price under the cons list because while expensive I feel the features and quality provided by this product make it well worth the cost, so this is not a negative, but simply expected for a product of this caliber.I would really love to see the manufacturer provide enough space for the 50ft rolls that everyone prefers using. It would also be nice to see a sealer that doesn't require quite so much wasted bag in order to fit it all the way back to the sealer section. But overall this is a really great product.Notes:------It should be noted that while this will seal the 11.5 bags they will not fit into the top holder. So you must get 11 inch bags or smaller.There doesn't seem to be any reason it couldn't have fit the 11.5 bags other than a simple lack in design, the sealer is wide enough to seal the bags, but the roller just isn't wide enough to hold them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GB5UAMWS2GYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0UMUEA#wasThisHelpful","R3GB5UAMWS2GYP","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much smaller than I was expecting. They are decent enough magnets when you are right on top of them, but even a very small amount of distance and there is little to no pull from them.Between the size and the very small magnetic field these won't work for my purposes and I have ordered some large magnets. The give the dimensions, so they can't be entirely blamed for my expectations of a larger size, but the images are pretty misleading. These are exceptionally tiny magnets and have no real use unless you are placing them almost directly onto the metal surface (like holding a piece of paper on the fridge). Anything that requires much more distance than a single sheet of paper and these magnets probably would no longer be viable.So if you're looking for something to use to hang paper on your fridge these magnets will probably be great for that. If you have any other purpose in mind for these, then these will probably not be viable for your project.-1 star for some misleading images contributing to my surprise at their small size.The product its self seems to be good quality and functions normally. The size was clearly marked, and they did appear to try to provide a variety of pictures showing accurate sizes. I suggest measuring out and marking the true size of the magnets on a sheet of paper so you can truly understand the size of these before you order them. I ordered 200 magnets and they all will literally fit in my hand with ease. Even though I dinged them for some of the images appearing misleading, I do understand why they zoomed in to show the magnets and frankly I'm not certain if there is really a better approach than what they have done, but the zoomed in images do make the magnets appear larger than they really are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7GC585852C6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UMK666#wasThisHelpful","R7GC585852C6Y","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mixer isn't quite as good as I was expecting for a ""Professional"" model. This is clearly not really a professional model but a simple consumer model, which makes me wonder what their lower models are like. I will say the mixer is absolutely beautiful however, and it does generally seem to get the job done, though there are several areas I am not happy with.Pro's:-------- Beautiful- Stainless bowl- Good attachment varietyCon's:--------- Cost- Speed control- Bowl Height adjustment was already maxed- Hand crank is backwards for lowering and raising the bowl- Knob in the back gets pushed into a screwed in piece of metal instead of being properly milled into the base.- Engine sounded like it was struggling a little more than I would like to mix my cookie dough, though it did complete the task without issue.Conclusion:Overall I would say it's a decent mixer, and it's hard to beat for appearance. But for the Price I really expected near perfection. Having a cheap strip of metal tacked onto the back for the back knob on the bowl just really drives me nuts. It makes the bowl very difficult to get in and out, while a properly milled hole in the stand like seen in real professional mixers is so much more user friendly.The mixer got the job done, but it just didn't have many of the items that a real professional mixer would. I would classify this more as a high end consumer product as opposed to a real professional mixer.If I were to buy a mixer over again I think I would have gone with the Bosch instead which seems to have a lot of advantages over the KitchenAid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I1ATWIFTI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002Y5X9W#wasThisHelpful","R37I1ATWIFTI9","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Heavy Duty, no frills booster pack (this is exactly what you want).Pro's:- Longer than average cables- Arrived fully charged- Utility lighter- Status lights- Heavy Duty Quality (from the clips, to the cables, to the plastic packaging, it all feels like good quality)- Protected Jumpers to prevent accidental sparkingCon's:- CostNow don't get me wrong, this booster pack is worth every penny from what I've seen so far. But it would be nice if it were a tad less expensive. Even just breaking it down to $99 so it's under the $100 mark would feel a bit better.This booster is exactly what you want if you are looking for a booster pack for your car. It has very good power, is portable, and holds a charge well as can be seen by the fact that it arrives at your house fully charged. Some might mention the lack of frills like lights, compressors, etc.. as a negative, but this is really a positive thing. When you add all sorts of gadgets and electronics you get a constant steady drain on the battery. Even though this drain may be minimal, over a period of days/weeks it can easily drain a battery. And a dead booster pack is worthless.If you need to power a gadget or two, the booster pack does offer a Utility Lighter (this is the same thing as a cigarette lighter in a car, but allows more power to flow through). This is a nice addition as it does allow flexibility without the addition of any electronics, so no additional power drain is added to the battery.It always drives me nuts when I see a booster pack that uses LED lights to constantly display the status of the battery. Yes LED lights are very efficient, but if you always leave them on, they are still a drain on the battery. This uses several lower power LED lights, but the circuit is not completed until you push and hold a button. This means that there should be no additional drain on the battery due to these lights unless you have an abnormal habit of checking the battery status on a daily basis :).My first experience with a booster pack was with a Walmart special. I paid maybe $20-$30 for it. It came totally dead requiring me to charge it before being able to use it. Even brand new it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a week, and basically it was a total waste of money. I used once or twice when I first purchased the booster pack, then put it into the trunk of my car. A week or so later when I ran across someone needing a jump start I thought it would be a great opportunity to pull out my booster pack and save the day. Needless to say the battery was already dead, and the driver had to make other arrangements for a jump start.This new Booster Pac arrived, fully charged, quickly and easily started my car without any hassles despite the battery being totally dead. And while I can't confirm the longevity of the charge just yet, there are many others here reporting that it will easily hold the charge for a year or more. while it would have been nice to be able to pick up a booster pack for less than the $120 cost of this one. I would much rather spend the $120 and have a booster pack that will work when I need it, than to spend another $30 on a cheap booster pack that can't hold a charge for more than a week.It should also be noted that this booster pack has slightly longer cables than my previous one. For most people this probably won't really make a difference as the booster pack sits on the engine either way. But for those that have hard to reach batteries this could be important.**Update**It's now a week or two later. I think my car battery is dead as I have had to jump it every time I needed to go somewhere. I have used the booster pack now many times, the car starts up like a champ every time, the booster pack has no problem holding a charge, and is still showing Full power despite the obviously more than normal use I have been putting it through. So far I have to say this booster pack has been a great investment, and the high reviews for this item are right on the money. I still need to pick up a new car battery, but the booster pack has been working flawlessly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NNJ6835IO9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JFHNQA#wasThisHelpful","R35NNJ6835IO9F","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing I noticed when this arrived was that it was heavier than I expected. I had already been warned it was heavy, but it was heavier than I had first imagined lol. Not necessarily a bad thing, just something worth noting.Quality was clearly not a major concern with the design. There are many little things you will notice on the gun that could have simply been done so much better. When working the gun can be really fun to shoot, but the trigger randomly stops working, and sometimes a bb doesn't get loaded so you fire a blank.Pro's--------- Powerful- Fast rate of fire- Fairly accurate- Removable Stock- Clips (functionality)- Sight designCon's---------- Trigger randomly stops working- BB's aren't loaded reliably, sometimes resulting in a blank fire.- Battery is difficult to work with- Battery not easily replaceable (ie it's a custom battery pack).- Recharging difficult to work with (have to pull out battery to recharge it).- Fire selector is garbage, though technically functional.- Rails aren't at all stable, so mounting a sight on them would just be silly.- Sights are low and not adjustable so I cannot fix it.Some of the key points I would fix as the manufacturer...- Trigger reliability, I assume this is probably due to some loose wiring inside that randomly jiggles loose. That being the case this is simply a quality control issue that should not be occurring if the manufacturer is doing their job.- Load reliability, the feeding of bb's is not at all consistent, and when I pull the clip out it tends to drop 2-3 bb's every time. Which means the loading system is far from ideal and could use some significant improvements.- Instead of having the battery loosely sitting under the rails they should have put a battery holder in place where you could simply use standard AA rechargeable batteries.- For recharging there should be a port on the outside of the gun, so it does not require disassembling parts of the gun to recharge the battery.- The top of the gun should be solid and firm so mounted sights on the rails actually have some value.- Instead of having to remove the entire top portion of the gun, rechargeable AA's should be able to simply slide in and out from the rear of the gun with a simple latch closing it back into place.- Fire selector just feels very cheapOverall the gun was fairly reasonable for the price, I just wish I had the option to purchase a better quality gun (even at a higher price), but they just don't seem to make them for airsoft guns. For the most part the gun worked, it just wasn't reliable, but since this is purely for fun that isn't necessarily a deal breaker. I should have dropped them below 3 stars, but frankly it was so much fun shooting it I just didn't have the heart to drop it below the 3 star mark. There are a lot of things done poorly with this gun, but there are also a few things done right.Some of the things I thought were done well on the gun...- Sight picture going through the rails, to the front sight was great. Though it would be nice to simply have the adjustable portion of the sight removed as it is useless. It would also be nice to see them make the front sight adjustable so I could adjust the aim of the gun.- Magazines were one of the better parts of the gun IMO. They were relatively easy to load, hold lots of BB's, and simply spinning the gear on the bottom to load the spring instead of a more manual approach was brilliant.- Magazine release is well done. It feels solid while clipped in but is still very easy to remove.- Making it battery operated. No messing around with CO2 cartridges is a nice feature for a fully automatic airsoft gun. It's a little loud as it cranks out the shots, but well worth that trade off so you don't have to mess with air, or manually cock/pump the gun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I41FV3LB9LR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V90OD4#wasThisHelpful","R1I41FV3LB9LR1","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall I think this movie had potential, but it just didn't live up to it.Storyline:I found the overall storyline intriguing. I would have started with a better hook at the beginning (like show her being captured the first time). So the intro was slow and lackluster, the story was good, but there needed to be a lot more character development. I never really felt attached to any of the characters because there simply wasn't enough information about any of them.Casting/Characters:The acting was sub-par across the board. Part of that may have been the script, but the actors themselves seemed to leave a lot to desire as well. All of the characters were shallow, and had little to no character development making it nearly impossible to build any sort of attachment to the characters. Their deaths meant nothing, because the characters meant nothing. This was probably the single weakest point in the movie, had the acting been very good I think you could have pulled the movie off, but as it stands I wouldn't recommend anyone watch the movie.Special Effects:Clearly this was a low budget film. The special effects were again sub-par, though with good acting this probably could have been overlooked if there was some reason to become involved in the character development. Special effects were passable, but just barely. I never really felt like anything related to special effects was real, but it wasn't so bad that it pulled me out of the story (not that I ever really got deep into the story either though).In short, everything needed to be done better. The story line could have been made to work, and you could have gotten away with the barely adequate special effects, but the poor acting just killed it in it's tracks. Oh and those doors. The single worst part of the set were those doors. They were so light and so horrible you could clearly tell it was a set and in no way real, it broke what little immersion might have otherwise been possible.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DN326RCH9S28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYY6TR6#wasThisHelpful","R3DN326RCH9S28","AOJYHMZ5S8B5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOJYHMZ5S8B5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently purchased the Breville Immersion blender in the hopes that I could replace my normal blender with something more easily hidden. I rarely use my blender and usually for fairly light tasks.When the Breville arrived, it seemed like I had received a used unit (water stains seen on the device). I have no way to confirm this, but that is my suspicion. I put it together and got ready to make some ""German Pancakes"" with this stick blender.The first thing I noticed was that the two pieces do not fit together well. I would snap it in place, then a little pulling on the two halves and it would separate even without clicking on the side release buttons.The next thing I noticed was that while running the motor sounds strained. It technically ran, and it mixed my batter without too much hassle, but based on what I have seen I do not really expect this to be the high quality product I thought I was ordering. Even with minimal use I don't really expect this to last more than a year or so, it just sounds like it's already on the edge of dying.- 1 star removed for two pieces not locking together correctly- 1 star removed as motor sounds like it's already dyingIt's large, unwieldy, not very high quality, and expensive.

"Tides of Time: 2 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 20 MinutesI’d have to say that “Tides of Time” is a much lighter version of “Fairy Tale”.  The latter is accessible to more players (2-5) and offers more in terms of content (more cards, etc.).  With that said, it’s also a bit more confusing to play at times, especially when utilizing the expert rules.  It could just be me, but I occassionally look at those cards and get sensory overload.  I didn’t have that problem in “Tides of Time” as the set collecting rules are pretty straight forward…”for each X you gain 3 VPs” or “If you have more X than your opponent you gain 7 VPs”.Unlike “Fairy Tale”, all cards in front of you are placed back into your hand after scoring in the first or second round…though you can keep one out as a “Relic of the Past” for a future round.  Players also discard one for the rest of the game.  These two little differences offer some strategic opportunities for both players, allowing them to possibly reuse cards they’ve played in a prior round or get rid of something their opponent might find favorable.All things considered, “Tides of Time” offers a lighter drafting game but still provides players with a good bit of choices to make.  The cards are larger than what I expected and the artwork is well done.  Further, the price ($12 on Amazon as of 10/22/15) is on par with other games on the market.  For that, it gets my recommendation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXDH4TS10AAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01029SR1M#wasThisHelpful","R1OXDH4TS10AAD","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dohdles!: 3-6 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 40 MinutesAt first glance the game seemed more complicated than it actually is, what with how busy the board looks when it's all set up.  Someone looking at this game online might think to themselves, ""Charades with play-doh, sounds easy enough"" and then do a double-take when they open the box and see all of the components.  Speaking of which, I found it odd that the guess funnel couldn't come pre-assembled seeing as how there's a space for it in the box.  Perhaps the developers/publishers save money this way during manufacturing.  While a neat idea, I found the guess funnel to be unnecessary.  Whoever yells ""Dohdles first can simply guess first...throwing cubes into a funnel is just extra flair that we didn't need.Anywho, the game isn't all that difficult to play.  I found myself at ends when sculpting my creations...I didn't want to make it too easy on my opponents as they'd climb the scoring track without much effort, but I also wanted to make it easy enough for them to get after 2-3 clues so that I could rake in on some bonus points.  You see, the owner of the Dohdle will sometimes get points when someone else guesses their creation successfully, but only around the midpoint of the clue tracker.  In other words, if someone only needs one clue to guess your creation, you're getting zilch.  Likewise, if someone needs seven clues to guess what it is, you're also getting nothing.  The trick is to aim for a creation that could be guessed in about three clues, netting you a maximum of three bonus points.  Finding this sweet spot can be one of the most challenging things about the game, especially if your artistic talent is as bad as mine.Luckily, players will have more flexibility toward the end of the clue tracker when it comes to what questions they're able to ask.  In the beginning, you're limited to asking yes/no questions and asking for one of the first five letters.  Toward the mid/end-point, players can opt for either-or.  While players are encouraged to use the suggested words/ideas on the reverse side of their solution sheet, they're free to come up with anything that suits their level of artistic talent.  If you're a master sculptor, for example, then crafting a ""baseball"" might not be in your best interest if you're trying to get your clue tracker to around the midpoint.  Then again, you could go for something simple and purposely leave out details to keep them guessing for a few more turns.  The more refined your artistic talent, the better you'll be at this game.""Dohdles!"" makes for an excellent party game assuming that your group is both imaginative and creative.  If you own games like ""Concept"" and enjoy playing them, then this one should be right up your alley as well.  Being artsy craftsy is definitely recommended, though you can play without this skill so as long as you keep things light and casual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYFIV9CCKYLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0JDVA8#wasThisHelpful","RLYFIV9CCKYLA","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ubongo: 1-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 25 MinutesNote: There are two recent editions of this game with slightly different scoring mechanics, so pay attention to the one you’re looking to buy.  The 2015 English Edition does not have a pawn & gem board (gems are instead randomly drawn from a bag and can be collected on the round tracker), while the German 10th Anniversary Edition does.  For the record, I received a press copy of the 2015 English edition.---If you ever played “Tetris”, then you know how satisfying it can be to slide that line piece into a column and clear four lines.  I myself grew up with the Game Boy version and always longed to hear that coveted 8-bit sound of making a Tetris.  Ubongo is similar in that regard in that you’ll give yourself a mental high-five every time you complete a board, especially on the four piece side.  The game gets a thumbs-up for being educational and promoting problem solving through spatial awareness.The scoring system is simply much too random for my tastes.  Since each player who succeeded in any given round gets to draw from the bag, it’s possible for the faster player to end up with amber while others get ruby or sapphire.  Sure, the fastest player does get a sapphire via the round tracker, but they can still get screwed via the random draw.  I find it ironic that while the puzzles are abstract, your chance of winning is somewhat determined via the luck of the draw.While I haven’t played the German version, I did read its manual and found that I liked its scoring system better…that is, the player can move a pawn along the gem board and actually choose which gems to take.  The slower players can’t move their pawn as far, limiting their choice of gem columns.  I may have to MacGyver a gem board of my own and adapt the scoring system from the German version.  Why the English version doesn’t include the gem board is beyond me and in my opinion, the game suffers for it.As it stands, the game succeeds at what it does despite my problem with the scoring system.  I do appreciate the addition of a four piece side to the puzzle boards, giving parents a way to handicap themselves when playing with smaller children.  The components are flashy, colorful, and top notch.  The cloth bag is way too big, but I’ll get over that.  This game is a definite recommend to casual gamer families who aren’t concerned with losing an abstract game due to chance…I know, it sounds weird using both the words “abstract” and “chance” in the same sentence.  Regardless, its high production values and the ease of which play flows gives it the push it needs to warrant your attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJFLD4V2R0KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0JDVN0#wasThisHelpful","RIJFLD4V2R0KW","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agent Hunter: 2 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesFor a microgame priced at $6-10 (on Amazon as of 10/20/15), this one is pretty fun.  I like games that encourage a little deductive reasoning without being overly complex, and “Agent Hunter” has that. The gameplay is relatively simple, but there’s a lot of memorization required in the sense that you need to keep track of what agents you’ve shown your opponent, which ones you’ve switched out, and likewise, what they’ve been doing.The card art isn’t bad, though the card stock could have been better. A few of the cards in my game have small white marks on the back, which will no doubt force me to buy card sleeves that are clear on one side and colored on the other.  For a game that is all about deducing what card values are, the developers/publishers should really have paid more attention to quality control.

"Red7: 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 5 Minutes“Red7” is like “Fluxx” in the sense that it can be involved, convoluted, and messy at times.  Luckily, it plays much faster reducing the amount of time needed to keep track of everything. Games can be slightly longer if you opt to play using the advanced rules, which allows players to draw cards under certain conditions.  There’s also an optional rule that makes use of the icons listed on the odd-numbered cards, forcing players to take the listed action when these cards are played.  It’s a small adjustment to the basic rules but succeeds in adding even more chaos to an already crazy game.  All of the suit colors have different symbols and the name of the color is even written on the card, so colorblind folks need not worry.  It is possible to play with five or six players, but you may want to mess around with the rules a bit in order to find the best balance.

"Lost Legacy: The Starship – 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 10 MinutesOut of all the micro-deduction games I’ve played as of late (“Coup”, “Cypher”, “Agent Hunter”, etc.), this is the one that resembles “Love Letter” the most.  I suppose that stands to reason, seeing as how “Lost Legacy” is the official spin-off to “Love Letter”.  Anywho, I did like the addition of the investigation phase, giving players one last chance to put all the information they’ve gathered that round to try and figure out who has the Lost Legacy card.  Of course, YOU could be holding it and win when your turn comes around to investigate.One things that still don’t like is the fact that there is player elimination.  Granted, games generally don’t take that long.  However, some folks aren’t keen to sitting on their thumbs for a couple of minutes waiting for everyone else to finish.  That’s what I liked about “Cypher”…no player elimination.  While I do still really enjoy bringing out “Love Letter: Batman”, there are times when I just want that extra oomph…hence where “Lost Legacy: The Starship” comes in.

"Clumsy Thief: 2-6 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesMy, this game can sure get messy.  This game is incredibly fast-paced, meaning that you're encouraged to play cards as quickly as possible in order to steal stacks.  The faster you grab said stacks and place them in front of you, the faster you can get back to playing cards.  As such, it's possible for the cards to go flying out of order and out of their stacks should someone not be careful in their haste to complete their intended action.  This might be okay for some, but my OCD tendencies cause my eye and shoulder to involuntarily twitch every time it happens.On the plus side, this game does indeed promote a bit of quick thinking which will keep the mind sharp.  It'll also help younger kids who are just starting to learn simple arithmetic.  The game's mechanics make learning math a bit limiting though, as the card you play will always be equal to the value of the card underneath the top card.  For example, if there's a $30 on top and a $70 underneath it, then you'd need a $70 to bring the stack to $100 in order to steal it.  To steal that stack again in the future, one would need a $30.  Then a $70.  Then $30.  You get the idea.I haven't experimented to know if it'll work, but perhaps players could be allowed to play up to two cards to bring stacks to $100.  With up to three values involved instead of two (one from the top card and two from a player's hand), players will be able to use their imagination a bit more.  It'll also potentially change the value of the top card to something other than the same two numbers you've seen in that stack up to that point.  The only downside I can see is that players will go out more quickly this way.  One way to get around this is to cut out the ability to add more stacks as you play and only use the ones at the beginning of the game.  Players could also increase their hand limit to ten cards.  It'll take some testing, obviously, to see of these ideas would actually work.All in all, ""Clumsy Thief"" does what it's designed to do pretty well...that is, provide a fast-paced family-friendly gaming experience.  With a little tweaking or the addition of some variant rules for more experienced gamers, the game could be made even better.  If you've got younger kids and you enjoying buying games with educational value, then give this one a look.  The $14.99 price tag listed on Amazon and the official website (as of 10/25/15) is on par with similar games on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5M8N1K4V2RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBCDXCA#wasThisHelpful","R1X5M8N1K4V2RR","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1,200 trips to the sperm bank and 175 clinical research trials later, I was able to afford this television.  Normally I wouldn't splurge on such a beast, but the delivery was free.  I know a good deal when I see one.  I WAS going to put my son through college, but watching documentaries on Netflix is basically the same thing.  Anyway, I hooked up my GPX Wall Mountable $40 sound system that I got at Walmart (who would pay thousands of dollars for a sound system?) and we were good to go.  There was also an option to have my television professionally mounted for $188, but it already HAS a frame!  How hard is it to balance the thing on a nail in the wall?

"Fairy Tale: 2-5 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 20 MinutesMake no mistake, this game can be quite challenging to play despite how easily the game flows.  I know it seems hard to believe…after all, you’re really just drafting cards, choosing three, and playing them in front of you.  It’s the cards themselves that really made my head spin…particularly their synergy and how they mesh with other cards.  I took forever during the drafting process because I got so caught up in the probabilities and what other players might take once I passed the hand off.  It can really be hard sometimes to make a choice between three really good cards, knowing you’d never be able to play all of them.  As such, I want to point out that it’s OK if you don’t get this game right away.  It’ll take some time to learn how all of the cards work together…this game is deceptively simple that way.I’m personally not ashamed to say that I had a hard time with this one.  The amount of information on the cards caused sensory overload, especially when trying to calculate points based on multiple possible scenarios.  Some cards don’t have a point value…rather, their value is determined by other cards with which they’re paired.  In the first few games, I gave up trying to pay attention to what my opponent was doing and just concentrated on getting the most out of my own cards.  I still do that on occasion depending on my mood, knowing full well that my opponent could mess up my plans if I don’t pay attention to the cards we’re passing back and forth.  For example, a card he/she plays might flip one of mine face down, making it worth nothing at the end of the game if I don’t flip it back in time.A casual game this is not.  It looks casual, but there’s so much more going on behind the scenes (especially with the expert rules) that I couldn’t recommend it to casual gamers.  Yes, you could just play cards without thinking about it, but good luck beating an opponent who is paying attention.  Gamers who enjoy a light to moderate strategic scene may enjoy this one, especially if they play a lot of set collecting games already.  Folks who don’t may want to start with “Sushi Go!“, which is much simpler and fun to play.  From a review standpoint, I found very little wrong with this title and feel that the $15-$20 is more than fair for the amount of replayability offered here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C1Y2YZLVMHLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUH7E4#wasThisHelpful","R3C1Y2YZLVMHLP","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my two cats had diabeties and with the help of this food, he is now in remission.  He went from walking on his hocks (sort of like knees on humans) to walking on his back paws again.  He's able to climb steps and jump onto tables again.  He's also no longer taking insulin and his readings are very good.  This is a big step up from 20 CCs of insulin and weekly IV drips to cleanse his system.  For those of you who may have a cat with diabeties, try these tips:1. Get them on a pure wet food diet...no dry food.  The dry food my vet prescribed is actually less healthy than canned food...and pretty darned expensive.  I got the impression they were encouraged to push these products despite the heathier alternatives.2. You'll want food high in protein and low in carbs.  The Fancy Feast CLASSIC does the job well...make sure it says ""CLASSIC"".  Other Fancy Feast brands have gravy and the like that aren't as healthy.3. I was buying the Wellness Grain Free brand for a while, but it's extremely expensive.  Check that out if money isn't an issue.  Essentially, you're looking for things without soy, grain, and other things cats don't digest well...again, they're carnivores.4. Try the Reli-on meter and strips, they are much less expensive.  You can find them at WalMart.

"Sky Tango: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 20-30 Minutes“Sky Tango” isn’t a bad little game.  It’s certainly easy enough to play, though hardcore strategists might find this a bit lacking.  It reminds me a smidge of “Lost Cities” (the card game), but with the ability to affect other player’s rows and actually clear out rows you’ve created.  The artwork is pretty good and play is relatively quick, which works great when you’re using it as a filler in between longer play sessions.  The rules don’t take long to learn, though there are a few stipulations that could have been summarized/emphasized at the end of the rulebook for easy reference.  Some of the manual was a bit scatter-brained too…that is, it could have been organized better.  For example, the box says it supports 2-4 players, yet there’s a “4 Players” section that seems to force them into teams of two.  Can they play solo or not?  The manual doesn’t specify.It can be a little “in-your-face” as you are encouraged to mess up your opponent’s rows by creating a huge gap between two numbers (placing an 18 after a 3, for example).  This will force them to eclipse one of the two and try to undo the damage by playing another card on top of it, or they could opt to force a total eclipse and discard everything for a fresh start.  Since you’re penalized at the end of the game for how many cards you have out in rows and in your hand, creating long rows is a risky business.  They might allow you to clear cards a bit more easily with the help of eclipse cards, but if you’re stuck with them when the game ends…ouch.“Sky Tango” is a pretty fun and light casual game.  Fans of such games should take a look at this one, though it’s not as engaging as others you might find on the market.  The manual could most certainly stand to be improved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJWA5DRWEUCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ2FMSE#wasThisHelpful","R1KJWA5DRWEUCU","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"City Tycoon: 2-5 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 75 MinutesOnce I got a handle on the rules, I was able to fully gauge it’s learning curve.  It’s more complicated than “We Built This City“, but less complex than “Sunrise City” and “Suburbia“. This puts it into a position that I can appreciate, especially when I want something simple but not overly so.  Whereas “We Built This City” simplified scoring with a rock-paper-scissors mechanic based on their relative positions on the grid, “City Tycoon” challenges you to pay attention to each tile’s cost, resource requirement, and benefit.  It’s not just important to tile placement, but also when participating in the drafting process.  Don’t let the seventy-five minute play time fool you…”City Tycoon” isn’t really that difficult to play.  A lot of that time is simply reserved for thinking and planning.Now onto the negatives.  My game arrived in a bit of disarray…the box insert was torn/ripped and some of the pieces were already punched out.  Part of me got the feeling that someone re-wrapped a used copy in plastic and sold it new…either that, or this was a manufacturing issue.  On top of that, there were no baggies to hold all of the tiles and little pieces that came with the game.  I had to resort to using extra baggies I acquired from my “Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game”.  For a game with as many small tokens as it has, it should have come with baggies.  A useful box insert might have been nice too.The packaging (or lack thereof) was really my only complaint with “City Tycoon”.  The rules were laid out well, the game has a lot of replayability, the artwork is good, and the strategy elements will keep you engaged from start to finish.  Having to supply your tiles with power/water/goods in order to earn something is a nice touch and I like that some tiles give you an option between two different benefits.  It pays to be careful on your tile placement too, as paying to move resources through other players’ tiles will only serve to hurt you in the end.  The game also gives you choices in the plants you put down…one side being a renewable energy/water source while the other burns out after one round.  Lastly, I like how the game gives you more options with tiles you don’t want, like chucking them for a quick buck or the ability to build a power/water plant instead.This game is worth the $40 I paid, though part of that is because I really enjoy playing games of the city-building genre.  I suppose that makes me a bit biased, but I have yet to see a human being who is not capable of being so despite their best intentions.  After all, our personal experiences and opinions are what makes all press reviews unique…otherwise, you’d just be reading the same thing over and over again.  Who wants that?  Anyway, if you can find a copy of this game (I recommend Amazon, link below) and you enjoy city builders, grab this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1329B2FBOQN6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QRB75Y#wasThisHelpful","R1329B2FBOQN6T","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trambahn: 2 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 30-40 Minutes“Trambahn” has a lot of kick for a two-player game and is indeed “Lost Cities” (the card game) on steroids.  Don’t get me wrong…I’m a HUGE fan of “Lost Cities”.  It’s just so easy to jump into and play, not to mention that the artwork is fantastic and colorful.  “Trambahn” takes everything a step further and adds more depth, specifically in the form of decisions that players need to make with the cards in their hand.  After all, cards have a total of three uses…money, passengers, or stations.  Players can only use a card for one of those three things, forcing the player to make some pretty difficult choices.For example, let’s say that you have three high valued blues, two low valued reds, and one high value yellow in your hand.  Right off the bat, you have to decide which one or two will be assigned as passengers, increasing the demand for that color and bringing it closer to four cards to score.  Before you even begin to think about what cards you want to lay out in front of you, you’ll need to pay attention to what colors your opponent is going after.  If your opponent had a column full of red cards and you had none, for example, you may want to consider using those reds as money or starting your own column as using them as passengers would only benefit your opponent.  Giving up a high valued blue or yellow might work, but again, it all depends on what columns both you and your opponent have.“Trambahn” is pretty easy to pick up and play, despite it being more complex than the aforementioned “Lost Cities”.  In short, I think it’s a fantastic game and incredibly easy to recommend to gamers who want something moderately casual yet engaging.  It’s still a “thinking” game and probably wouldn’t be for players who want to shut their brain off for a while (I’d recommend “Lost Cities” for that).  The game retails on Amazon for about $20-$25, which is fair for the content and resulting replayability that you’re getting here.  While I consider this a must-buy, I recognize that not everyone has the same taste in games that I do.

"Risk: Star Wars Edition – 2 Players or 2 Teams, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30-45 MinutesFirstly, let’s get the complaints out of the way.  This game has zero resemblance to “Risk” and I don’t know why they bothered slapping that word into the title.  This is not the “Risk” I grew up with.  The smaller snubfighters are plastic and have stands, yet the capital ships and Millennium Falcon are flat pieces of cardboard.  The X-Wings have the same attack power as TIE Fighters, which is something I can nerd out about because I’ve played PC games like “X-Wing” and “TIE Fighter” growing up and know their capabilities in and out.  X-Wings should be stronger, plain and simple (they have shields, TIE Fighters do not, etc.).  I do appreciate that the board resembles a TIE Advanced X1, however the cockpit is WAY too big.  Lastly, the rulebook isn’t as thorough as it could be, considering the rather lengthy “rules clarification” threads I’m seeing on BoardGameGeek.Once you get past the little details (that one would only notice if they’re a hardcore fan) and remember that this is, at its heart, an “Ameri-trash” game, you’ll begin to chalk up the inconsistencies to game designers not being as hardcore a fan as you.  Heck, you may even begin to accept it.  Also, I’m sure they were on a limited budget.  After all, we can’t expect Fantasy Flight X-Wing Miniatures quality here, seeing as how the game retails for around thirty bucks.  The gameplay is really where it’s at and while the Rebels and Imperials not 100% balanced in my opinion (the Rebels seem to win more often), it is good and quick fun.The game does a pretty good job in capturing the suspense behind The Battle of Endor.  The cards players get on a regular basis have multiple actions on them, though only one of said actions can be used.  This leads to some pretty hard choices as there seems to be never enough time to completely dominate all three of the different parts of the board: 1) Luke vs Vader, 2) Death Star Space Battle, and the 3) Ground Assault on Endor.  The Rebels are tasked with taking out the shield generator on the surface and then destroying the Death Star while the Imperials are tasked with holding out long enough to wipe out the Rebel forces.  No matter which side you choose, you’re in for a rough and suspenseful ride.Do I recommend “Risk: Star Wars Edition”?  In short, yes.  If you’re a Star Wars or Eurogame fan, my advice is to turn your nitpicking tendencies off and just enjoy it for the imperfect Star Wars themed game it is.  It could use some rebalancing (that X-Wing bit is REALLY bothering me), but it’s fairly enjoyable as-is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEX7IDHXGPT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJG59K#wasThisHelpful","RJEX7IDHXGPT1","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rise to Power: 2-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time = 30+ Minutes“Rise to Power” tasks players with achieving a simple goal (getting eight districts on their grid), but getting there really requires a bit of thought and strategy because of the number of different actions one can take on their turn.  The act of drawing PRISM cards is a no-brainer, but doing things like challenging a district or using an exchange ability offers a fair amount of risk.  When doing the former, the active player attempts to build a contract from their opponent’s grid (stealing it away from them).  However, if their opponent has the cards required to complete the contract, they can quickly do so.  Thus, it’s possible to goad your opponent into challenging you so that you can fulfill a contract on their turn, thereby allowing you to spend action points on something else when your turn rolls around. Using a contract’s exchange ability is also risky as while it gives you an ability to use right now, it’ll become a powered district for someone else to grab on their turn.Upgrading contracts and the requirement of laying upgrades down in descending order keeps things interesting too.  Ideally, one would want to lay down and fulfill high-valued contracts first to give them more upgrade options in the future…though fate/luck may have other ideas.  Each upgrade to a district increases its level by one and in turn, provides bonus influence at the end of the game (a level 2 district earns 1 bonus influence, a level 3 district earns 2 bonus influence, and etc.).  The act of powering contracts itself can be tricky, as players earn a bonus AP point for spending the exact amount of PRISM required to complete it (like in “Alhambra”).  You can spend more of course, but no change is given.  Powering contracts/flipping them over to their district side will in turn grant the player permanent bonuses (draw power, PRISM limit, grid limit) which can be tracked via the player mat.Of course, I didn’t even touch on the optional expansions (government contracts, CEOs, PRISM pylons, and advanced agendas).  Advanced agendas work like regular agendas for example in that they provide players with goals to shoot for.  However, the former are worth three influence instead of five and have a powerful single-use ability.  CEOs allow players to spend an action point to use their active trait…sort of like a unique special ability that can only be used once.  After that, the CEO’s passive trait can be used for the rest of the game. PRISM pylons allow players to spend one action point to store 1 PRISM card there permanently (max 3).  Each card reduces the value of PRISM costs by one, though players don’t need to use the PRISM pylon if they don’t want to.  No bonus AP is awarded when using a PRISM to power a contract, for example, so if you have exact change already then it’s best not to use the PRISM pylon.  Then there’s the government sector expansion, which works similarly to other contracts but with some important exceptions.“Rise to Power” isn’t a bad game at all and I love how it can be played in about thirty minutes (if you know what you’re doing).  It’s hard for me to play city-builders like “Suburbia” without going over an hour or possibly even two, mainly because I take a while to factor in all of the tiles and their special effects.  “Rise to Power” eases off on the stimuli being thrown at you in that regard, which is good if you’re in the mood to play a city-builder but don’t have a lot of time to get a game in.  Despite its simplicity compared to games like “Suburbia”, it’ll still make you think a bit.  I couldn’t recommend it to casual gamers for that very reason, but anyone into light to moderate strategy games would do well to pick it up (especially at the $20-$25 price tag on Amazon as of 9/21/15).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKFTQBPGMKR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=064692690X#wasThisHelpful","R2YKFTQBPGMKR6","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Antidote: 2-7 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time = 20-30 MinutesI’m a sucker for logic games such as these to where you’re trying to deduce what the hidden card is, like in “Clue”.  With that said, I do recommend that players keep a separate sheet of paper handy so that they can see what “X” cards they’ve already seen (unless said players have a photographic memory, of course).  Alternatively, you can use the crude tracker I created, which is both in COLOR and B&W.  Just print, cut, and pass them out…checking off the box next to the compound you’ve seen (just don’t let the other player see).  For folks reading this review on sites like Amazon where links aren’t allowed, head on over to my website and find this review via the “Board Games” tab on the very top.I have to admit that this game takes some getting used to.  My initial reaction was to hoard as many “X” cards as I could to deprive my opponents of information as to what the actual antidote could be.  The less “X” cards they see, after all, the more they’ll have to rely on everyone’s face-up discards.  After a while I realized that other players may adopt the same strategy, making the idea of trading and using syringes all the more viable and important.  Players can either help each other achieve their goal (or at least, get closer to it) or screw each other in the hopes that they make the best educated guess in the end.  I suppose strategies and attitudes will vary in this regard, depending on the group.Of course, you can further complicate things by discarding a high-valued card of the color which players collectively suspect is the actual antidote.  This can make the group second-guess themselves if they still have a choice to make.  For this reason, it’s best to play this game over three rounds…otherwise, players may be inclined to be more aggressive in their high-valued discards for bluffing purposes.  After all, who cares if you win the game with only one point IF you’re the only one left standing?  Counting cards and keeping track of who’s seen what gets harder to do the more players you add, so tread carefully when throwing away a high-valued card you could use at the game’s end.All in all, “Antidote” is pretty fun. The expansions it includes will add more of a punch to the base game, but I recommend excluding them until you get a feel for the flow of play.  The price of $15-$20 on Amazon (as of 9/16/15) is fair for the content the game offers, which allows me to give it a recommend to folks who enjoy playing light to moderately challenging card games.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PASO3KAFIVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SRK02I0#wasThisHelpful","R1PASO3KAFIVL","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retro Loonacy: 2-5 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 5-10 MinutesMuch like this review, this game is incredibly quick as there's not a whole lot to it.  Admittedly, part of me is conflicted about the number of discard piles used per player.  At first, I was confused by the decision to add fewer discard piles for every player you added to the game...my mind was convinced it was a typo in the rulebook and that it should be the other way around.  The more I thought about it though, the more I realized that two players may have a hard time discarding cards with only one discard pile, whereas five players would have more cards in play and thus, better odds of one player playing something.  Luckily, players are free to experiment to see what works best for them in terms of fine tuning a player : discard pile ratio.The MSRP per the official website is $15.00, making it a fairly cheap filler game should you be looking for one.  The card stock could admittedly be better/thicker as they tend to bend easily. Unlike some other filler games I've played, ""Retro Loonacy"" requires quick thinking and some insane reflexes.  As such, some folks who prefer a more laid-back and less stressful experience may not take to this game all that well.  If your game nights tend to get loud, frantic, and rambunctious, then your family / gaming group should seriously consider picking up ""Retro Loonacy"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD5A5F660V22M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CFFGHG#wasThisHelpful","RD5A5F660V22M","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sutakku: 1+ Players, Ages 14+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesThe dice themselves are fairly large, which is a plus for people like me who have trouble seeing across moderate to far distances.  While the numbers on said dice are represented by Japanese symbols, it won’t take long to get accustomed to what they mean (there’s also a guide on the stacking board should you forget).  The stacking board itself really isn’t necessary as you can stack the dice anywhere you please, though it does add to the theme rather nicely.  The cloth bag is a convenient means to make the game portable, though the whole package is more than small enough to fit inside a suitcase or what have you.  As a quick aside, I loved how there was a copy of the score-sheet on the back of the manual should you need to make more copies.As a bonus (and not listed in the manual), the game came with a bonus deck of cards that can be used to make your opponents’ lives a little bit tougher.  For example, the “Mountain’s Wrath” card challenges whoever it’s played on to have three sequential numbers in their tower that turn or they bust.  On the plus side, these challenges often reward bonus points if the roller overcomes the odds.  These cards are purely optional, but can spice things up a bit if you tire of the base game.  Even with the challenges enabled, I don’t agree with the 14+ age requirement on the box…it should be around 8+, in my opinion.I’ve seen the game advertised as something based around Japanese Folklore…specifically, “Sutakku was originally developed to teach the common man the foibles of wishing for more than he had.” While it is a valid lesson/moral, the same could be said for any push-your-luck game out on the market.  That’s exactly what you’re getting here…a push-your-luck dice-rolling game.  To that end, anyone who has played and enjoyed “Yahtzee” or “Farkle” may very well enjoy this one too.  The price of $12-15 on Amazon (as of 7/21/15) is fair considering how large the dice are, the number of dice you’re getting, and the top-notch quality work that went into constructing said dice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JA0OFGI1TVZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D7616W#wasThisHelpful","R2JA0OFGI1TVZY","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Biblios: 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Playtime = 30 Minutes“Biblios” reminded me a bit of “For Sale” (albeit a more complex version) in the sense that the game is broken up over two phases.  Phase one has players acquiring cards while phase two puts said cards to use to acquire other cards.  The mechanics between the two games are obviously somewhat different, but the overall idea is the same.  Players who have played bidding games like “For Sale” should be able to wrap their heads around “Biblios” without too much of a problem.  Those new to the concept may want to reserve an extra half hour of playtime, just until they get used to the flow of play.Speaking of “flow of play”, players who are great at counting cards and calculating statistical probabilities will have a leg up in this game.  Cards in each of the five categories have certain point values and if you’re good at observing what’s been played so far, you can get a feel of what your odds are in winning a particular category.  If you see low cards of a particular color being scattered around the table during the first phase, for example, you might be able to win the category with just a few high cards of that color.  Granted, some cards are removed from the game at random during setup so it would be impossible to know how much of a color is truly in the deck…still, a good memory helps.If you’re not good at counting cards or have a terrible memory like myself, then you can get a feel for what colors players are going after via the church cards, which add or subtract pips on the dice in the scriptorium.  If you know can’t win in a particular category, you may want to reduce that die’s value so that whoever does win it, won’t get as many victory points.  There’s also some strategy in the cards you chose for both yourself and others during the gift phase.  Gathering plenty of gold is great for the auction phase, though might leave you dry on category cards if the bids are generally high.I’ve slammed French Game Publisher Iello in the past for releasing games that featured subpar components (“Steam Park” is a prime example), though in this case, it’s hard to mess up a deck of cards, a tracker, and dice.  Thankfully they didn’t, making the game an easy recommend.  It’s packed full of strategy and has a pretty quick play time to boot, making it an ideal way to get your fix for the night without having to allocate too much time out of your day.  The price is my only real complaint…at $18-$20, the game could have stood to be a few bucks cheaper based on the number of components involved.

"Dragonwood: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 20 MinutesI’ve played a few games that incorporate cards and “dungeon crawling”, but not many.  The closest comparison I can make is “We Slay Monsters“, a video game currently featured on Steam’s Early Access program.  There are some obvious differences, but the general idea is the same…play cards to hurt stuff.  I think “Dragonwood” is a bit easier to get into, as the suits in the aforementioned video game have different effects on the creatures.  Here, you’re simply aiming to get a straight, flush, or pair.  What I do like is that each creature or enchantment has different defense values against these three types of attack.  This will change the way you approach the five cards out in the landscape or at least, force you to go after the ones that are weak in the form of attack apparent in your hand.  The enchantments are also a double-edged sword in that while you’re not earning VP for acquiring them, you may get a game-changer that will see you through the rest of the game.The game is fairly customizable, what with the ability to remove more cards from the Dragonwood deck during game setup to shorten play time.  Of course, you can opt not to remove any at all, play until both dragons are defeated, or remove fewer cards in order to increase play time.  The manual also lists a Dragon Spell variant that forces the player to get a straight flush in order to roll against the dragon.  Speaking of cards, the art on them is well done and the card stock fairly thicker than most.  The instructions were an easy read and it won’t take long for newcomers to get a handle on what’s going on.  In short, we had fun with this one and at the $15 price point (via the official website, link below), it’s easy to recommend.  Gamewright stepped outside their comfort zone a little with this one as they’re generally known for cooperative and/or educational games, but I’m glad they did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150OSA8O6S5BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB7OV7K#wasThisHelpful","R150OSA8O6S5BL","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2-4 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesThis game appeals to me for a number of reasons.  If we put aside the fact that you can build your own space station from the ground up (which is awesome), there’s a certain synergy in the way these cards interact with one another.  For example, some cards award points based on how many cards are around it when it is built, meaning you’ll have to put some thought into where you’re placing everything.  Unlike “Alhambra“, there’s no way to move a card once you’ve placed it.  The objectives (should you decide to include them) add to the fun as they may encourage players to work toward a specific goal…though you can ignore them if you wish.  These cards are not only color-coded but may have either an immediate or delayed effect, making you sometimes wish that you could pick two or three cards out of your current hand instead of one.Unless you’re playing in aggressive mode (which uses its own deck), player interaction is limited to what cards you’re passing off to the next player.  While this seems limited or maybe even boring, it’s almost essential if you’re going to have a shot at winning the game.  If one of your opponents is building their station around a particular color or room type to get extra VPs, you may decide to claim the card yourself to prevent them from having it.  Or, you can take what you’re really after and hope the other players in between you and them take notice what you saw and act on it.  The two player Kim variant (my preferred choice over the rulebook’s two-player variant) further enhances this by allowing players to discard a card of their choice, freeing them up to play something they’d want for themselves.  Vinnie and I opted to mix up Kim’s variant a bit by playing a card first, drawing, discarding, resolving, and then passing as opposed to drawing a card at the beginning of the turn.  The rulebook’s two player variant is just too messy logistically and is quite honestly a pain in the exhaust port.I liked this game for the same reason I liked “Alhambra” and “Suburbia“…I had almost total control over my creations.  The latter of those two tends to get a little chaotic toward the end as a lot of the effects build and chain over time…keeping track of your city’s effects can be downright cumbersome.  “Among the Stars” doesn’t suffer that problem despite the fact that the cards each have their own abilities.  Either the effect happens during placement or is delayed till the game’s end…nice and simple.  “Among the Stars” offers a lot of replayability, what with the races, objectives, modes/variants, and the fact that you’re always starting your station from scratch.  While there’s a slight learning curve, I found very little to complain about.  I highly recommend playing without the objectives and races at first, as the immediate and delayed card effects will give you enough to think about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188J881024LS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD4LN36#wasThisHelpful","R188J881024LS0","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Game of 49: 2-5 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesI’ve come to realize that “The Game of 49″ is deceptively simple.  While the goal itself can be defined in a single sentence, there’s a risk/reward system in play that’ll make players think twice about how much they’re bidding at any particular time.  Sure, it may sound like a great idea to bid high and place as many tokens as you can early on…but what if those payoff cards come up later rather than sooner?  You may find yourself out of money to bid on the spaces that could have won you the game.  “Acquire” challenged players in this way as well…that is, mismanagement of your money in the early onset could leave you trailing behind everyone else.  Luckily (for casual players mostly), “The Game of 49″ is a bit more forgiving and random than “Acquire”.Speaking of random, players are admittedly at the mercy of the number deck.  With that said, players will have a chance to strategize a bit when those wild cards come up.  Having more than one number to choose from really heightens the tension, especially since you know that money will pay out right after someone wins the card and places a chip.  This might encourage players to be a bit more generous with their money during the auction phase than usual.  There’s also the whole calculating odds bit in that if you’re good at counting cards, you can get a good feel of what has yet to draw and what your chances are of getting another payoff in the short-term.There’s very little not to like about “The Game of 49″.  The manual and its concepts are easy to understand, making it an ideal game to play on family game night.  My only complaint was with the quality of the components and the listed retail cost of $25 (plus shipping and handling).  Games like “Sequence” that sell for about $15-$20 feature thick poker chips of fairly good quality…”The Game of 49″ offers transparent colored counting chips that are small and light.  For $25 I expected a bit more from the components…either that, or the asking price should be $5-$10 lower.  It’s important to note that everyone has different feelings on what something should ACTUALLY cost, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. There’s also the fact that some developers/publishers are able to mass produce games at lower prices, but as a consumer writing reviews for consumers, I have to think in terms of a consumer regardless of what goes on behind the scenes.All in all though, I believe you’ll find “The Game of 49″ to be a solid choice when confronted with the question of: “What game should I introduce to the family tonight?”","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IZL1TYW1TMTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS6GFEU#wasThisHelpful","R1IZL1TYW1TMTC","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hogger Logger: 2-6 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 15-30 Minutes“Hogger Logger” struck me as a “beat the odds” the kind of game, though the action cards and the fact that anybody can play cards on the guesser’s turn keeps things fresh and interesting.  The latter mechanic goes a long way to ensure that everybody playing is engaged, even when it isn’t their turn.  This is a welcome change compared to other games like “Alhambra” that feature a lot of downtime in between player turns.  On the downside, if someone has to take a quick bathroom break, everyone will need to wait.The cards themselves were of good quality and the art was both flashy and good.  I had no problems reading the numbers on the cards (I have poor eyesight) nor did I find the rules to be confusing in any way.  There’s a lot of things going on at once from an “if-then” standpoint…that is, if someone plays this card when “X” is showing, then this happens.  As a result, some of the chaining the results from multiple cards being played that have special effects might confuse new players…though the chaining isn’t nearly as complicated compared to some other games I’ve played.  On the plus side, missing a free card draw won’t break the game…you probably won’t even notice until you examine the rulebook again at a later date.There’s “High-Low”, and then there’s “Hogger Logger”…at least, that’s what I initially thought after taking the game through its paces.  The latter is like a steroid-induced version of the former, though it remains to be simple enough for players of most ages.  I personally recommend this one, especially if your family or gaming group enjoys activities or games that require all involved to interact and be relatively social.  I’ll say this much, you’ll need to pay attention from start to finish to keep up with the cards being played!  To top it off, the price on the official website is $14.99, which is fair for what’s being offered here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DX63UK2MEPIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VB3U3MU#wasThisHelpful","R1DX63UK2MEPIZ","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five Tribes: 2-4 Players, Ages 13+, Average Play Time = 40-80 Minutes“Five Tribes” is one of those games that grabs your attention from across the room, what with the colors all but exploding from the set of tiles acting as the main board.  With that said, just looking at it when it’s fully set up to play can look pretty intimidating to the uninitiated.  On top of five different colored meeples performing different functions, you have resource cards, bid order & turn order tracks, coins, djinns that have special abilities…it’s enough to pack enough of a punch to make casual players reach for that bottle of Excedrin Migraine.  Do I mean that in a negative way?  Well, yes and no.There are casual players out there who want games that they can grasp within minutes…you know, the ones with two-page rulebooks.  Then there are semi-casual/semi-hardcore players who want a bit more depth, but not to the scope that it would require three or more hours to learn and play.  To me, “Five Tribes” falls into the semi-casual/semi-hardcore category and experienced players who know what “worker placement” and “set collecting” means on and off the table should be able to learn this game fairly quickly.  I’d hesitate however to bring this out for ten-time Bingo champion grandma…it might be a bit too much if she’s not used to anything more complex.What attracted “Five Tribes” to me was the fact that it gives you options…a whole boatload of options.  Every turn, you’ll be trying to figure out which route or routes you’ll want to take to grab victory points.  Perhaps you’ll want some Djinns and use their powers to give you an edge every now and then (along with victory points), or perhaps you’re going to the resource/set collecting route and will thus need those green meeples on a regular basis.  Or…perhaps no one is collecting yellow meeples, giving you an easy +10 points for each opponent you have more yellow meeples than should you scoop some up.  Perhaps board control and placing trees/palaces are more your thing…there’s really almost no way a player COULDN’T earn VP in some shape, way, or form.Some might be offended about the use of “slaves” in a game like this, though slavery in the Ottoman Empire back in the 1600’s was indeed a real thing.  I personally don’t mind it, but it may still offend some people.  If you are such an individual, mentally replace the word “slave” with “wild”, as it performs a multitude of different functions in this game.  They can increase the amount of points you’d earn from blue meeples when calculating the amount of coins you’d earn, for example, or allow players to give assassins extra range than they’d normally have.  They can also take the place of a resource when trading in cards…again, think of them as “wilds” if it makes you feel better.“Five Tribes” is a unique blend of a plethora of genres, giving it a long-lasting appeal factor. Bidding, worker placement (a la “Mancala”), set collecting, action taking, money management…it’s a lot to take in from the get go.  Once I got used to what the different Djinns did and how all of the possible spaces/actions operate, “Five Tribes” became a joy to play.  It’s fairly expensive ($50-$55 as of 5/11/15), so I’d really only recommend it to semi-casual groups and above (which still encompasses a LOT of people).  To top everything off, the quality on everything is top-notch.  Like “Ticket to Ride”, I honestly foresee “Five Tribes” going places (pardon the pun).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQCKLCSF03CZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6JDRE0#wasThisHelpful","R3EQCKLCSF03CZ","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Concept: 4-12 Players*, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 40 Minutes*Editor’s Note: The game can be played with two or three players if you modify the rules.So here’s the thing…I found “Concept” to be a great idea (pardon the pun), though I did not like the default rules that were outlined in the manual.  For example, the default rules mention nothing about extra points being awarded to players or teams who choose harder words or phrases.  To be fair, the manual does list an aside by the developers that recommend that you play without points and/or try a variant that awards points based on word/phrase difficulty…though it leaves the rest up to you.  This can be either a boon or curse, depending on how creative you and your gaming group are.Personally, I liked the variant that “Table Top” recently featured on their YouTube channel…that is, players can cooperatively play against the game to reach a certain point limit.  One player would take turns trying to convey to the others what the concept is…though you could pair off into teams IF you had enough players. Speaking of which, I mentioned above that the minimum player count of four could be adjusted if you introduced some variants.  If you opt to not play for points, then one or two other people could simply take turns trying to convey words (or use the aforementioned co-op variant).  I didn’t like the point system, as it tended to favor players who are familiar with what the different icons mean.As far as the components go, I think everything was on or above par.  I like the inclusion of cheat sheets to help players quickly see what the icons mean should they get lost.  I also like the idea of sub-concepts with each having their own set of pawns/cubes, though it may take some practice to really use them to their full potential.  “Concept” is a love it or hate it kinda game, what with so many “Charades” variants on the market. If you can’t draw (like me), then you’ll come to appreciate being given the tools you’ll receive to convey words or phrases creatively.  Those who prefer to stand up and act out things may find this game to be a bit on the boring side.  Honestly, it depends on the individual…luckily as mentioned above, “Concept” can be adjusted to cater to a variety of play-styles if you’re willing to break the rules and be creative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KT8AGSGGLQSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDB6J0S#wasThisHelpful","R1KT8AGSGGLQSC","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Go Nuts!: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+. Average Play Time = 15 Minutes“Go Nuts!” reminds me of “Zombie Dice”, but a much faster and more family friendly of it.  Instead of shotgun blasts, you have cars and instead of brains, you have acorns…I think you get the idea.  “Go Nuts!” is admittedly different in a few areas, namely the speed round and the fact that you can reuse the acorns you’re rolling.  In “Zombie Dice”, you had to put the brains aside and hope for more on different dice from the cup.  I did miss the color/risk mechanic as featured in “Zombie Dice”…that is, it was easier to roll shotgun blasts on a red die than on a green die.  Here, all dice are equal.The game is a bit different when played with four players instead of two. This especially becomes visible during the speed round where each opponent must roll a dog to stop the active player from accumulating points.  It’s much easier to roll one dog (when playing with two people) as opposed to three dogs (when playing with four people) to stop the active player.  The active player could potentially roll themselves way ahead of the others if one of the three players can’t roll the dog they need.  You can of course adjust the rules so that only two dogs are needed in a four player game…it’s not in the rules, but I don’t see why you couldn’t try this variant yourself.As production values go, the case is fairly portable and comes complete with a flap/lid.  A magnet sitting under the surface of the lid keeps it shut when you’re trucking it around.  I’d still recommend a rubber band while traveling with it though as the lid can come undone with enough force.  The score pad is as basic as they come…though you won’t have to worry about ordering more when they run out as a simple grid on a piece of paper will do.  In terms of fun factor, this game is a bit more interactive than “Zombie Dice” as players now have something to do when it’s not their turn (sort of).  If you have youngsters in the family and you’re not keen on introducing them to zombies and shotgun blasts, then this game will fit the bill nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCIF9P5WA3SAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016WD9QS#wasThisHelpful","RCIF9P5WA3SAM","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coup: 2-6 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesOne might scoff at the fact that there’s only fifteen cards in the entire game, making the content feel rather light.  On the other hand, one could come to appreciate how the game mechanics tie everything together to give it its bang for the buck.  I was admittedly skeptical at first…”$12 for fifteen cards and some plastic coins?  What gives?” Once I actually looked at the rules however and saw just how many actions you could take per turn, I began to see the possibilities both in terms of strategy and bluffing.I have a feeling that this game won’t appeal to people who don’t play a lot of Poker, or any card game for that matter that encourages people to bluff when their back is against the wall. “Coup” works better when you have a lot of people playing, but it can and does function as a two player game just fine.  My suggestion is that if you do end up playing with four or more players, that you secretly remove a card from the deck so as to prevent people from counting cards as they figure out who has who.What appeals to me most is the quick play time, what with the recent changes that have come about in my household.  “Coup” allows me to flex my brain without committing myself to an hour or two to some heavy abstract strategy game.  It also tests my memory a bit, especially when my opponents use three different character actions in one round without exchanging cards…which was the lie?  Do they know that I caught them?  What actions have I taken again and didn’t someone use the Duke recently to block foreign aid?  You see where this is going.  Anywho, I found “Coup” to be great as a filler or something to bring out at parties.  My recommendation is to give it a spin!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMG3L303EH20D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDI4HX4#wasThisHelpful","RMG3L303EH20D","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sheriff of Nottingham: 3-5 Players, Ages 14+, Average Play Time = 60 MinutesFirst and foremost, I think the game is suitable for younger kids (ages 10+) despite what it says on the box.  The sixty minute average playtime isn’t due to the game being complicated (quite the contrary), it just simply takes a while for everyone to be the sheriff a set number of times.  Younger kids may have an issue with bluffing though…let’s face it, some of us adults haven’t even mastered the perfect poker face.  Parents who know their kids well will clearly be at an advantage, though the nice thing about this game is that smuggling contraband is totally optional…meaning you don’t have to lie if you don’t want to.I personally enjoy the game because of the role-playing that can potentially occur if you really take the time to get into it.  The “TableTop” video I linked in the opening paragraph is a prime example and employing that kind of attitude makes the game a lot more fun to play. It can also help you to determine if someone is lying…the more you can get them to talk via interrogation and dialogue, the more they might reveal.  The ability to bribe further adds to the chaos…after all, you can bribe and still tell the truth, just to throw someone off for the next time you decide to lie.  From a parental standpoint, some folks may take issue with the fact that the game is encouraging your kids to lie (and to become better at it). On the other hand, lying is optional and players can most certainly win the game without doing so.All in all, “Sheriff of Nottingham” is an extremely fun variation of the popular card game “Cheat” (you might know it as “BS” or “I Doubt It”).  You could, in theory, play it with two players if you’re willing to bend the rules a bit and accept the fact that not everything will be balanced properly. Ideally though, you’ll want four or five players.  The components are well themed and of fairly good quality, so no complaints there.  Jen expressed her desire to play again and this says a lot as she’s very picky about the board games she plays.  $30.00 (the current price on Amazon as of 2/6/15) is a fair price considering what the game has to offer, though one of the button snaps on the merchant bags came out of the box broken.  Luckily, you don’t really need to snap the bags shut…the Sheriff will just need to clearly to state their intentions.  This game is an easy recommend to folks with a sense of humor who love to lie through their teeth (or enjoy catching others red-handed).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7HO39YE7KW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EZMABG#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7HO39YE7KW3","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eight-Minute Empire: Legends – 2-4 Players, Ages 13+, Average Play Time = 8-20 MinutesFirst, let’s briefly recap what’s new.  The boards are modular, allowing you to switch up the aesthetics and configuration every time you play.  Instead of containing goods that are counted as VP at the end of the game, cards now of abilities that have long-term effects.  While some cards encourage players to collect sets of a particular type, there’s more variety here.  In “Eight-Minute Empire”, you tried to collect as much of a good as you could to score more points. “Eight-Minute Empire: Legends”, just to name one example, features a card ability that awards players VP for the coins they have left in their possession.  If it’s regions you’re after, you can forgo the VP abilities and go straight for the ones that allow you to “fly” or place extra armies by default. Oh, and the art on this title is most certainly an improvement!I won’t go too in-depth here because I’ve already done so in my review of “Eight-Minute Empire”, but I will say that I enjoyed this title just as much (if not more) than its predecessor. Again, this is a stand-alone product, so you won’t need to own “Eight-Minute Empire” in order to play this.  With that said, you could use the maps from “Eight-Minute Empire” if you so desired.  As a whole, “Eight-Minute Empire” is simpler and makes a better gateway game to the series, I feel, with “Eight-Minute Empire: Legends” taking it slightly to the next level.  Both are easy to teach and are relatively quick to play, so you honestly can’t go wrong with either of the two games.  My only complaint is that “Eight-Minute Empire: Legends” only supports four players as opposed to “Eight-Minute Empire’s” five, which may be a deal-breaker to larger families…still, it’s relatively fun to play regardless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZT29BUPS24YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSJ4IIW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZT29BUPS24YH","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Duke: 2 Players, Ages 13+, Average Play Time = 15-25 MinutesFirstly, I want to commend the game for having so many different ways to play (aside from the core rules).  Most common are the tiles with enhanced abilities like “Summon” and “Divination” that really change the way you’ll think about some of the pieces.  “Terrain” tiles can also be added onto any open square during game setup to limit piece movement and alternatively, “Fort” tiles can be added to help players block any ranged “strikes”. Then you’ve got “Dragon” tiles, “Flag” tiles, and gameplay modes with alternative objectives…trust me, you won’t be bored with this game.  I highly recommend however that you get used to the core rules first before implementing any of the extra content/rules.Speaking of the core game, there’s a lot going on here.  Part of the challenge with games like “Chess” is getting used to how the pieces move and I found myself in the same boat here.  “The Duke” takes this to a whole new level by including an alternate way of moving on the reverse side of the troop tiles…meaning that once you move and flip a tile, you’ll be presented with a different movement rule set.  In other words, what that piece may have done on a previous turn may not be what it is capable of doing on its next turn.  Thankfully, each tile lists its movement rules and further, players may even look at their troop tiles’ reverse sides on their turn to refresh their memory.  This presents players with all new strategies to plan for and try out…I couldn’t imagine what “Chess” would be like if the Rook could suddenly move like a Knight during the game!Normally I’d take issue with the $35 price tag (seeing as how some “Chess” sets can be bought for about ten bucks), but a number of things stand out here that’s worth some consideration.  Firstly, the tiles themselves are made of wood and of fairly good quality. Secondly, the game includes a number of different ways to play and includes alternate objectives in the rulebook.  Finally, there are customization tiles and sticker sheets available for players to create their own & unique custom armies.  Where “Chess” is a game with one primary way to play, “The Duke” is almost a full-blown kit.  To me, these features add tremendous value and make it easily recommendable to those who love strategy games. Further, there are two expansions for those who want to expand their game further.“The Duke”, hands down, is one of the best “Chess” games that I’ve had the pleasure of playing over the course of my lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGZ0Z2LVAMZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVM54KA#wasThisHelpful","R2CGZ0Z2LVAMZV","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dragon’s Hoard: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 30-45 MinutesThe first thing you’ll notice as soon as you open the box is how colorful the cards are.  It’s the kind of colorful that can really light up an entire room or attract attention from passersby.  The art is equally as fantastic and some of the best I’ve ever seen, hands down.  My only complaint is with the card quality and thickness…while not bad, they could have been better.  The manual does a good job in explaining the rules clearly and concisely. The colors do tend to blend together in the wrong light and may even be an issue for those with visual deficiencies like color blindness. With that said, the sheep (on the card backs) are in different positions based on their color so that you can easily distinguish one from the other. As cards are discarded, for example, one card from each color can be put off to the side as a guide.“Dragon’s Hoard” is an excellent filler game and I like the fact that it can be taught in less than five minutes. There isn’t a whole lot of depth here, but you will want to give some thought into which treasure cards you want to play and which ones you want to discard. I found it interesting that the cards you play act as both currency AND ways to perform actions/score points. As such, cards can only be used as one or the other, forcing you to make some difficult choices.  One might opt to complete cheap/easy treasure cards to end the game quickly, for example, while others might hoard cards to play better treasures that reward more points.Is “Dragon’s Hoard” a recommend?  Yes, absolutely.  It’s quick, easy to play, and suited for gamers of all ages.  The current price point on Amazon is about $20 (as of 1/29/15), which seems about fair considering how well done the art is (even though the card quality is a bit lacking).  I thoroughly enjoyed this title and I believe you will too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXQYAOY95QET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWZDEZE#wasThisHelpful","R3SXQYAOY95QET","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pyramix: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15-20 Minutes“Pyramix” is like “Othello” in the sense that it’s easy to learn but strategic enough to keep folks coming back for more.  I hesitate to use “difficult to master” as I don’t find “Othello” to be, well, difficult to master (*shrug*).  In this case, you’ll always be thinking about the opportunities you’ll be revealing to your opponent every time you take a cube…after all, cubes can only be taken when two or three faces are showing.  There’s also the risk of taking a snake cube for zero points…while you’re intentions may be to free up your next couple of moves, you could in turn be giving your opponent the same opportunity.My favorite aspect of the game lies with how the ankhs work.  By themselves, they’re only worth one point.  At the end of the game though, you can really rake it in and earn yourself a couple of eyes or cranes if you are the ankh leader of many colors.  So, do you take the eyes and cranes and focus on getting immediate points, or do you grab ankhs in the hopes that those bonus cubes at the end of the game will be worth it?  Both strategies seem to have merit, based on our play experience.Overall, “Pyramix” is a pretty fun abstract game.  The fact that setup is randomized will keep each game new and exciting.  The colorblind may have an issue as there is no way to distinguish the four different colors besides their actual color, but I don’t see why others in the group couldn’t accommodate and help such individuals out by answering their questions.  You can find “Pyramix” on Amazon for about twenty bucks and yes, I do believe it to be worth the purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPHVEY2IQGLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRGG3ZE#wasThisHelpful","R3GPHVEY2IQGLP","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Qwixx: 2-5 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesFirst and foremost, I like the fact that it is portable and can be played almost anywhere.  After all, the entire game consists of just six dice and some scorepads.  I do think that the game could have included more scorepads as you’ll tend to go through them quickly, though you can print/download my not-so-pretty version of the scoresheet for free on my official website.  The first page is in color, the second one is not (for the benefit of those who can only print in black and white). The instructions were easy to read and provided plenty of pictures and examples.Unlike some other dice games on the market, this one keeps players engaged no matter whose turn it is.  While the active player gets to cross off a potential two numbers on their turn, other players will have the option of crossing off one.  This mechanic is especially helpful in larger groups where there’s usually a lot of downtime waiting for your turn to roll back around.  I also thought that making the red and yellow values ascend in numeric order and the green and blue values descend in numeric order was an interesting choice.  This mechanic certainly gave us more choices as I didn’t find myself stuck rooting for just low/high values at the beginning/end of the game, respectively.All in all, “Qwixx” is a great choice for an easy-to-play, family-friendly dice romp on family game night.  It supports up to five players, which is great for families of five like mine.  It’s easily recommendable at its current price tag of $10-$15, though I do think that the replacement scoresheets offered through the official site are a bit pricey considering how quickly you’ll go through them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8H40YCDSWJ7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J57138C#wasThisHelpful","R8H40YCDSWJ7O","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gravwell: 1-4 Players, Ages 15+, Average Play Time = 20-35 Minutes“Gravwell”, at its heart, is a drafting game that encourages players to pay attention to what’s going on at all times.  For example, if you see your opponent drafting a lot of fuel cards that list an element that begins with a letter towards the end of the alphabet, there’s a good chance that most of your plays will happen first.  You can then take this into account as you pick your cards.  As such, the benefit of moving first and being able to count cards is probably the biggest advantage one can have in “Gravwell”.  I admit that my memory is getting crappier and crappier the older I get, so I tend to play my cards based on what’s currently in front of me.  On the plus side, each player gets a face-down card in addition to a face-up card during the drafting process, meaning that card counting fiends with eidetic memories won’t totally dominate their competition.I did take issue with the price, which I’ve seen be anywhere from $30-$35.  While the game is indeed a lot of fun to play, the number of components inside the box are incredibly sparse.  Six ships (two are derelicts), a small deck of cards, and a board…that’s it.  “Power Grid” and “Stone Age” come with almost ten times that amount and cost roughly the same price.  The components themselves, while colorful, are nothing spectacular.  Perhaps if the ship models were both solid & sleek-looking and the cards thicker & more durable, it might justify that kind of price…alas, they aren’t and therefore it doesn’t.  In effect, you’re paying for the “idea” of the game and quite honestly, $20-$25 would have been a bit more realistic.  As a side note, my copy was missing the yellow ship…I submitted a ticket, but the jury is still out on how quickly they’ll respond (if at all).All in all, “Gravwell” does more right than it does wrong by keeping players engaged from start to finish.  Who would I recommend this game to?  That depends.  I have a feeling this game might be frustrating for those who are used to being perfectionists in the games they play.  Despite your best intentions, you’ll sometimes find yourself moving backward with no emergency stop card available to help you.  Those who accept this as inevitable and instead think about how to minimize the backward movement will be much better off, I think.  By that same token, children who frustrate and upset easily over setbacks may not do well here…in that case I’d recommend parental supervision. Speaking of children, I think the minimum age should be 8 or 10 plus, not 15 plus.  With that said, if you can find this game for cheaper than $30 or if money simply isn’t a problem for you, then “Gravwell” is an easy recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR06UYXQ6OHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617682934#wasThisHelpful","R1RR06UYXQ6OHW","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dungeon Roll: 1-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15-30 MinutesI honestly wasn’t expecting a lot out of this game when I first eyed it on the “Barnes and Noble” shelf.  The box itself just looked flimsy and after unwrapping it from the plastic, I confirmed that it wouldn’t hold up from a lot of abuse.  I would have honestly gone for something a bit more durable, though I do appreciate the design and theme behind it.  Once you get passed the rather disappointing window dressing, you’ll realize just how much meat the game actually has.  It’s a bit like “Zombie Dice”, but pushed to the next level.While there is a lot of luck in how the dungeon dice roll, there’s an equal emphasis on how you use your party dice to deal with the bad rolls that may come up…and trust me, they will.  Since your companions are each good at dispatching a particular monster, you’ll have to think a bit as to which dice you’ll want to give up at that particular moment (once a party die is used for any task, it is discarded).  You might have two champions, a thief, and a warrior in your party for example, and be presented with two chests.  Your first instinct would be to use the thief to open both (warriors, clerics, and mages can only open one), but you realize that you have two dragon dice sitting in the lair and there’s a good chance you’ll be facing off against it soon.  Giving up a champion to open both will still leave you with the three different companion types you’d need to defeat it.The above situation is but one example of the choices you’ll be faced with in this game.  Sometimes you may opt to have a scroll drink a potion in order to revive a champion (you can make the party die anything you want) and others, you may decide to keep the scroll in the event you get a bad roll (three monsters of different types). Tokens score you experience points at the game’s end, so sometimes it’s best to bow out early on a delve in order to save them. Then again, one token might be all you need to go two more levels.  Each character also has a special ability, which can be upgraded (by flipping the card over after earning so much experience) and used to get yourself out of some nasty situations.  There’s no shortage of “if-then” dilemmas here.Despite the poor presentation, I found “Dungeon Roll” to be a joy to play.  It packs a bigger punch than “Zombie Dice”, I feel, and I honestly can’t wait to get back in there to see how well I can do the next time around. Twenty bucks was a fair price to pay in retrospect, though I do think fifteen would have been more realistic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LBSWMV8I2DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938146999#wasThisHelpful","R12LBSWMV8I2DJ","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Age of War: 2-5 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 45 MinutesThe process of turning a complex 4X (""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"") war game into a card game that can be played in under an hour is a rather difficult one, I'd imagine.  After all, you would be forced to turn some of the more complex gameplay mechanics into something a bit simpler and dumbed-down.  The combat, for example, operates on a ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" basis...that is, both players will draw the top card from their army deck (at that specific location) and resolve the battle automatically.  You could have more armies than your enemy, for example, but it's very possible that they'll have a counter to everything you're throwing at them.  Luckily, both players get to organize their draw deck before every round of combat so after a round or two, you can get a feel of what survivors your opponent has left and reorder your own deck appropriately.  I'm not too crazy about a ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" battle system in general, but I'm not exactly sure how else I'd design it in order to keep the game's play time forty-five minutes long.One of the things I really enjoyed was upgrading, which is possible by spending any currency you might have in your treasury (currency enters your treasury via the ""play a card"" action).  Metropolis upgrades allow you to draw an extra card (plus the extra action already allowed by a city), while citadels allow you to draw one extra elite army card to start each turn.  Being able to customize my kingdom is what really pulls me in when playing 4X war games...sometimes I'm an economic powerhouse and other times I simply enjoy stomp-rolling everyone that happens to cross my path.  Other cards can be used to force your opponent to pay you money and if they don't have enough, they may have no choice but to simply give you territory.  This whole concept reminds me a bit of the card game ""Monopoly Deal"", albeit a bit more complex and in-depth.  To that end, I honestly believe that the territory management aspects of the game is indeed its best feature.There's plenty more to talk about (princess cards, crusade cards, catapult cards, royal guard cards, etc.) but I'll simply opt to conclude this review by saying that ""Age of War"" has a lot of variety to it despite the fact that it can be played in under an hour.  The backbone of the game is relatively simple (acquire as much territory as possible to create sets), but the act of getting there is really where the game shines.  I was surprised by how well all of the different gameplay mechanics came together despite the fact that they were borrowed from other games of completely different genres (""Monopoly Deal"" and ""Medieval: Total War"", for example).  There are a lot of mechanics being thrown at you all at once, so be sure to reserve some extra play time until you get a handle on how everything comes together.  For this reason, parental supervision may also be advised (assuming you care if your kids are playing the game correctly).In short, ""Age of War"" offers a lot to the casual and hardcore war gamer alike and is relatively family-friendly to boot.  The price tag advertised on the official website ($7.95 as of 12/22/14) is more than worth the content being delivered here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8RK9NQOXT8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6ZMJOW#wasThisHelpful","RN8RK9NQOXT8D","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tales and Games: The Hare and the Tortoise – 2-5 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 20 Minutes“Tales and Games: The Hare and the Tortoise”, on its surface, is a racing game…that much is obvious.  What’s not so obvious is the fact that you’ll be doing a boatload of bluffing, as you’ll be trying to keep hidden what your two (or three) bet cards consist of.  Concentrating on one or two animals is a sure way to let others know what you’re going for.  With that said, the animals move in different ways and some only move so far despite how many cards might have been played with their picture.  The tortoise, for example, only moves one space even if three cards are played…this is a great way to get rid of this particular card type if you’re not betting on it.  Some wolf cards cause it to howl, preventing other animals from moving at all…another great way to get rid of cards you don’t need without worrying about your competition moving on up.The game is pretty family-friendly.  The manual lists a variant for “apprentice hares and tortoises” making the game easier than what it already is.  There’s also a championship mode which tallies the scores over the course of three games, extending the game’s length to about an hour.  There’s a good mix of strategy and luck here, the latter coming into play when you’re dealt you’re first bet card and when drawing racing cards from the deck.  The latter, as explained above, is about managing your hand and timing the play of your unwanted cards appropriately.  My only complaint here is with the components, though they aren’t as bad as their other release, “Steam Park”.  For one, the stickers didn’t peel off easily causing them to tear.  There’s also no reason why the finish line and podium couldn’t have come preassembled…between this and “Steam Park”, it’s like someone at Iello is purposely throwing as little money as they can into the quality of the components to piss someone like me off.  It’s a bit disconcerting in a way as the gameplay mechanics are well thought out.All in all, it’s not a bad little game…it just lacks a little TLC for its current price point of $25.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWK51OCW2L0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1WEU9M#wasThisHelpful","R1WWK51OCW2L0S","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phase 10: 2-6 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 45-60 MinutesI'm opting to keep this short because A) this game has been around a while and B) it's cheap and relatively easy to play.  The hardest part is getting used to how the phases work in conjunction with the game rounds, but once you have that down, it's all relatively simple. The escalating difficulty of the phases will help to prevent runaway leaders, though luck still plays a large factor in whether or not you'll get the cards you need to complete your phase before someone else goes out.  The cards were easy to read so no issues there and overall, I felt the game was worth the five bucks I paid.  I'm sure you could come up with a similar rule-set using a standard deck of cards or two if money is tight.  My only complaint is the box, which layers the cards into two decks and can be tough to close.

"BraveRats: 2 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 5 MinutesThe cards are pretty varied in terms of their individual power.  While a particular deck may only have eight cards, there’s quite a bit to consider.  The Princess, for example, is of fairly low rank, but automatically wins the game for the player if played against the enemy Prince.  The musician automatically placed the current round on hold, which is great if you suspect your opponent is about to play a high-ranked card.  A victory with the Ambassador awards the player with two won rounds instead of just one.  The Wizard nullifies special powers, leaving the cards’ rank to determine who stands victorious.  These are just a few examples, but you get the idea.I was very surprised to see a total of seven different variations listed in the manual, most of which can be summed up in less time than it takes to say “BraveRats”.  One variant involves players exchanging a card at the beginning of the game (“Traitor”), while another randomly deals the sixteen cards (red and blue) equally among the players (“Random Deal”).  The “Lucky Draw” variant is an interesting one, as each player will only have a hand of three cards while the rest remain in a draw deck.  You won’t have all of your characters right from the get go, making it harder to tell which character your opponent might choose.  “Draft” is a variation of “Random Deal”, though players get to choose through a draft selection which cards to keep.Kids will enjoy the card art and characters, while the adults will appreciate the special abilities and the “Poker-face” requirement that comes with serious play.  There’s also a bit of card counting too…that is, you’ll be able to better guess what your opponent plays as the game progresses.  This is assuming of course that you’re paying attention.  “BraveRats” won’t win any awards for longevity and depth, but I found that it doesn’t have to.  If you’ve got five minutes to spare and you need to satisfy that gaming itch, then look no further than “BraveRats”.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MGPIHGDQT8K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVQ3BSI#wasThisHelpful","R2MGPIHGDQT8K8","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monolith: 1-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesI’ll be honest for a moment here (aren’t I always?), part of what prompted me to reach out to the developer and request a press copy was the art.  I followed the game on and off since it was featured and funded through Kickstarter back in July 2012 and it’s unfortunate that I didn’t have the time to cover it until now.  Everything from the box art to ambience on the cards really blew me away when I first discovered the game.  I’m personally a fan of dark, sleek, and contrasting color schemes (those who follow my photography works know what I’m talking about).  Now that I’ve had a chance to physically hold it in my hands…well, it made me a happy camper.  I had no complaints with the quality of the components either and the manual was relatively an easy read.  The latter averages to about ten pages, not including the credits and white space.The first thing I’d like to note is that gameplay will vary greatly depending on how many people are playing.  There’s a solo variant in the manual that challenges the player to make it past toll stone four, though they’ll only have six rune/fate cards available to them on the grid.  It’s a great alternative to Solitaire, if you have the space available to play while you’re on the go.  Two player games play a lot differently than four player games, mainly due to the glaring absence of what I call “slot blocking”.  In most worker placement games I played, some spaces would be blocked off based on the number of people playing so as to limit the available options.  There isn’t anything like that here, giving two players almost complete freedom to do as they please.  Blocking becomes more strategic and frequent as you add more players to the game.  I may try experimenting with only using six or eight rune/fate cards instead of twelve for a two player game, just to see how that balances out.Along those lines, “Monolith” offers a lot of flexibility in terms of available options.  Most cards have more than one socket, giving players (in most cases) thirty or more effects with which to choose.  That, coupled with the fact that cards/sockets are resolved in order, make the game very strategic.  Usually players are at the mercy of luck in dice rolling games, though I didn’t feel that here.  That is…no matter what I rolled, I usually felt that I had at least a few good moves available to me.  This becomes more problematic with four players mind you, though rarely was a left with dice that I couldn’t place.  The fact that round cards are double-sided and rune/fate cards can be fixed or randomized on the game board only furthers the validity of the topic sentence.  If you want to get really crazy, you can switch out some of the rune/fate cards on the game board every round…I personally haven’t tried it, but I would imagine it would prove interesting.“Monolith”, despite having what some might call a complex setup, is fairly easy to play.  The learning curve is low to moderate with games lasting anywhere from thirty to forty-five minutes.  First time players may want to give themselves about an hour.  The biggest hurdle is figuring out how the cards tie together and how the effects work.  With so many options available, first time players and casual gamers might feel a bit overwhelmed with choices.  Jennifer and Carolyn (both casual gamers), for example, didn’t like “Wrong Chemistry” because of how many choices lay before them every game turn.  As an experienced gamer myself, I’ve come to appreciate just how deep “Monolith” really is because of those available choices.  This game really favors those who have the ability to look at what their opponents are doing and react accordingly.To that end, I’d highly recommend “Monolith” to anyone who isn’t intimidated by semi-deep and strategic gameplay.  It plays quickly, making it ideal for school nights or as a filler for long gaming sessions.  My only real complaint was the balance via the lack of the aforementioned “slot blocking”, though the game seems flexible enough to work around it if you’re creative enough.  Otherwise, it’s a solid dice-rolling worker placement game as worker placement games go.  “Monolith” features a ton of replayability and is backed up by some amazing visuals, giving it a consistent appeal factor.  This one’s definitely a keeper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFBW5GK3ROC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6L461S#wasThisHelpful","RTFBW5GK3ROC7","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got ‘Em!: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesIn terms of difficulty, the game is very easy to play.  In fact, I didn’t need to explain the directions more than once to Vinnie Jr (13).  The PDF directions I downloaded from the official site (link above) is only a page long, making it the kind of game that grandparents can play with their grandkids without having to feel overwhelmed by complex rules.  I can’t speak for everyone my age, but the older I seem to get, the less complicated I like my games to be.  Perhaps it has something to do with having a full-time job and consistent “dad” duties?  At any rate, the components themselves were very colorful and the cards easy to read.  Overall, I was very pleased with everything that came out of the box.I like the fact that there are two different ways to play, as one is more strategic than the other.  The bright rule set is a bit more luck-based, as the walls you place are dependent on the cards currently in your hand.  Let’s say for example that your opponent is sitting on a square surrounded by three walls.  The last wall you need to place in order to win the game has a groove that borders a red and blue space.  If you have all green and yellow cards in your hand, you’ll be unable to follow through with the win even though strategically you had them in your sights.  The cards for the bright side also include a few ways to get out of tight spots (the ability to move through walls, etc.), adding to the randomness that is that particular game mode.  With the brainy rule set, you won’t have this problem.  If you mess up and put yourself into a bad position, it’s your own darned fault.In all honesty both game modes have merit, depending on what kind of game you want to play and what group of people you’re currently with.  If your group is a casual lot who enjoy luck-based game and want a more guided experience, then the bright side will work fine.  If your group favors strategy games however, you may have a better time messing around with the brainy side.  As such, “Got ‘Em” would appeal to quite a wide audience.  Whether you’re playing for fun or want to stretch your critical thinking muscles a bit, “Got ‘Em” has everything you’ll need.  What’s more, most games only last about twenty minutes, making it ideal for families with a busy schedule.  I would have liked some more ways to play strategically, but the game as it stands offers enough to scratch that gaming itch.The price on the official site ($28.00 as of 7/2/14) is a bit high in my opinion, though Amazon has a number of offers ranging from $10.00 to $25.00.  If it were me, I’d place this game somewhere in the $15.00-$20.00 range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF5IXI2C9PV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G05C48#wasThisHelpful","R3EF5IXI2C9PV2","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ugh!: 2-6 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 20 MinutesThe cards were very colorful and appropriately themed.  I had no problems making out the values on the cards despite my relatively poor eyesight.  I did take issue with the manual, however.  I found it confusing and had to re-read it a number of times to get a handle on what was going on.  The information, at least to me, just seemed to be unorganized and scattered.  For example, the bottom portion of the first PDF page instructs players to “flip a card from the top of the deck and put it into a Safety pile”.  That gave me the impression that I could put the card in any of three piles I wanted.  Later, on the second page, it says “the first Number card you flip over is put into the first Safety pile”.  As such, some of the information seemed either redundant or misleading.Once I understood the rules however, I began to appreciate the game a bit more.  It’s relatively simple, but the push-your-luck mechanics keeps things interesting.  There’s also some light strategy present in the form of how you can safely handle Ugh! cards.  While it’s obvious that you’ll want high valued cards so that you can get more points when locking in sets, but having a few 1’s on hand of varying colors will give you some “redshirt” cards to safely toss away should you draw an Ugh! card.  Of course, you may never draw an Ugh! card, so there’s some risk in taking those 1’s over say, a 4 or 5.  Speaking of which, there are more lower numbered cards than higher numbered cards, so if you’re good with counting cards and calculating odds, you’ll have an edge over the other players.As such, “Ugh!” offers more than just a press-your-luck experience.  It’s still a relatively light card game, but offers enough strategy and risk-taking to appeal to a wide audience.  “Ugh!”, in my opinion, would serve as a great filler game.  Family game nights are another possibility, assuming you didn’t have a whole lot of time to play something more complex and time-consuming.  The price on the official site ($10.00 as of 7/11/14) is on par with my expectations and is overall a good value for what the game has to offer.  Besides the hiccups with regard to the manual, we found “Ugh!” to be a very enjoyable card game, one well worth picking up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NS35ZK2YWH49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BC9HHW#wasThisHelpful","R1NS35ZK2YWH49","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Double Double Dominoes: 2-4 Players*, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 45-60 MinutesHaving never played “Dominoes” (yeah, weird huh?), I didn’t know what to expect.  I actually took the time to Google how “Dominoes” was played to get an idea of the similarities and differences between it and “Double Double Dominoes”.  From my understanding, players in “Dominoes” draw seven tiles and attempt to be the first to empty their hand.  Domino placement seems to be consistent with what I’ve seen in “Double Double Dominoes”, though “Dominoes” is a bit more freeform as it doesn’t have a board.  When a player goes out in “Dominoes”, they score points equal to the pips remaining in other players’ hands (sort of like in “Rummy”).From my point of view, “Double Double Dominoes” expands on the original concept pretty well.  Namely, it introduces different ways to score that also forces players to think about where they are placing their pieces.  The biggest example would be with regard to how bonus points are scored…sure, you might be able to place a domino onto a score space, but SHOULD you?  If the only scoring piece you have at your disposal will push your opponent ahead three spaces, it might behoove you to wait until your opponent is on a different space/value on the score track or until you draw a domino that can score you the points without helping out your opponent.  I imagine I’d get pretty bored playing regular “Dominoes”, but the new mechanics that “Double Double Dominoes” introduces here almost guarantees that your game will be both strategic and interesting.Determining a fair retail price was also a bit of a challenge.  The official website lists the game for $30.00, while Amazon ranges between $17 and $27 (pricing/shipping costs depends on the individual shipper).  The first thing I did was look up how much a regular case of similar dominoes was going for…again, the prices vary, but I found a set of 55 Cardinal Double Nine Color Dot Dominoes in a Color Collectors Tin for $8.99.  I couldn’t tell you how much the board costs, but I’d imagine it would be somewhere around ten bucks in terms of value…it’s hard to say because the board is of pretty good quality.  When you put it all together you have a twenty dollar game (estimated) officially priced at thirty.  It’s worth noting that I am by no means a developer or have any experience in the business of making games, so there may be some hidden costs to which I’m not aware.  My gut tells me however that the game’s price would sit better with me had it been between $20.00 and $25.00 (which seems to be the average retail price on Amazon).In the end, “Double Double Dominoes” is both simple and engaging.  I had no issues learning the rules, despite the fact that I had never played “Dominoes” before.  Calliope Games has a habit of making solid, family friendly games and I’m pleased to report that they’ve done it again here.  It’s easy to play yet still requires the user to think a bit, though not so much as to make you dread playing after coming home from a ten-hour workday.  If you can get a good deal on it, “Double Double Dominoes” is worth picking up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73YXHWT76X42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BC0RT4#wasThisHelpful","R73YXHWT76X42","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heads Up!: 2-6 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesThere’s no doubt in my mind that “Heads Up!” is an ideal party game. After all, it’s just a reversed form of the popular party game, “Charades”. Instead of one player trying to act out a word for others to guess, everyone else will be the ones trying to hash out the best clues possible. As a competitive game, this really doesn’t work. In order to score points, you’re forced to rely on the cleverness of the very people you’re playing against. If you happen to have a spoiled sport in your group, he or she may hold back good clues so that others don’t guess the word in question.  As a casual party game where the points don’t matter, it’s quite fun.The board game version is fairly colorful and I really didn’t take issue with the components.  I did have a bit of a problem however the amount of categories that were in the box.  In doing a bit of research, I discovered that you can download the app for both Android and iOS devices, though the pricing structures vary.  Google Play (for Androids) shows that the app is free while the iOS store shows a ninety-nine cent download, with extra categories available for ninety-nine cents each.  Regardless of which was you go, you’ll get more bang for your buck via any of the electronic options as the board game (which costs between fifteen and twenty dollars) only includes four categories.  That translates to five bucks a category, not accounting for production costs.I’ll be honest, part of me feels like this is a shameless cash-grab considering what you get inside the box at the suggested retail price.  The electronic versions, while offering more content, have the added bonus of being portable and played anywhere.  There are some like myself who tend to get intimidated with today’s technology, in which case the board game might provide an alternate solution.  Since “Heads Up!” is first and foremost a party game, chances are someone in your group knows how to download and run the app…all you’d need to do is hold the thing to your head or shout out answers as appropriate.  With all of that said, “Heads Up!” is a great idea, but the development of the board game makes little sense to me especially since it offers much less than its electronic counterparts.  My advice is to steer clear of the tabletop version and stick with the app.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2306V4HG8R8U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FB6O9I2#wasThisHelpful","R2306V4HG8R8U9","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ruckus: 2-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 20-40 MinutesMy mind went through several phases of uncertainty when attempting to assign a difficulty value to this game.  On one hand, the game takes about twenty to forty minutes to play.  On the other, the manual is over twenty pages long.  Normally when I see a game manual consisting of more than eight pages, I know that I should probably buy a pack of Excedrin Migraine and prepare some emergency rations (which may or may not contain chocolate, ice cream, and/or cookies).  The game itself isn’t difficult to play, but trying to factor in the card effects and how they might affect the different phases of a round is tricky.  Therein lies the appeal factor for most tactical card game enthusiasts: the ability to plan and deploy a perfect army based on the cards you’ve been dealt.For those of you new to tactical card games, allow me to explain.  Chaining is often a huge part of combat and when it comes to “Ruckus”, there is no exception.  I’d go as far as to say that chaining is inordinately abundant in this game.  Each unit has some type of special effect or skill that does something out of the ordinary.  Some units can be sacrificed to deal unblockable damage to an enemy unit before combat begins, for example.  Some units, when played or discarded, might resurrect friendly cards or deal damage to enemy units.  Couple this with the fact that each of the four goblin guilds have their own play style, you’ll realize just how strategic things can get.  On top of that, players have the chance of drawing an enemy unit card from the upgrade deck (I call it the reinforcement deck), giving them abilities they normally wouldn’t see within their own guild.  Moral of the story: one action could snowball into a mass slaughtering of cards…hence, chaining.“Ruckus” is pure, unadulterated chaos.  Luckily, it manages to be fun in the process.  There’s some importance to playing tactically (especially when assigning unit cards to specific rows), but there’s also that “holy hell, did that really just happen!?” element that happens frequently and often.  If you can stomach the initial learning curve (it’s not as bad as say, “Power Grid”), you’ll be able to blow through games as quickly as the box indicates.  I recommend reserving an hour or two for your first few games…though I don’t see why you couldn’t simply play for say, three victory cards instead of five in order to shorten play time.  The art and overall theme was pleasing to look at and I took no issue with the quality of the cards.  Vinnie (13) enjoyed our two player games and I look forward to testing this out with three or four players, as time permits.  I’d imagine it would be even more chaotic, given that there are more cards (and by extension, their effects) on the table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4H126AK6I6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON5VSXG#wasThisHelpful","R3T4H126AK6I6U","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trifecta: 2 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 20 MinutesI couldn’t help but notice that the rulebook from which I was working instructed players to place the plus/minus/suit card duplicates back into the box.  That got me to thinking…why include them at all if you were never meant to use them?  Having done a little homework, I discovered that the rules have changed a bit since the game first appeared on Kickstarter.  Apparently, in the earlier versions of the rulebook, each player was assigned their own grid and had their own personal plus/minus/suit card column.  Players also didn’t have a “hand”…they just simply drew a card and placed it where they felt like it (whilst observing the placement rules, of course).My guess is that the rules were changed both based on critic/player feedback and to give the game more strategic flair.  The addition of a “hand” certainly gives the player some more choices and I’m glad they (the developers) decided to include this new rule.  With players using the same plus/minus/suit rows, there is also the possibility that flipping a “plus” to a “minus” and vice versa with the appropriate “king”/”two” card will mess up your opponent’s best laid plans.  In my opinion, a separate vertical column for each player would potentially give players in a bit more control over their own grid.  Now, in this newly reformed version, things are a tad more chaotic.Along those lines, our play sessions were positive overall.  I’ll admit that I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed the game based on the old rule set.  Drawing one card and placing it doesn’t offer the player in question a lot of choice, despite the fact that you could place the card onto your opponent’s grid if you wanted to.  Having a hand, at least, allows you to set up a combo or two with which to score.  Alternatively, you could save a very high or low card and place it as your opponent’s fifth card, placing the row’s total outside the required number and robbing them of a point.In the end, I’m forced to give it a passing grade and then some based on the fact that it’s simple to play yet still doesn’t feel like I’m mindlessly going through the motions.  As such, I think it would be an ideal casual game for couples & parent/child pairings.  With a little creativity, I’m sure you could expand the game to three or four players with the purchase of an extra deck (though I haven’t tried it myself).  The artwork is pleasant to look at, though the price is a few bucks more than what I would have expected ($10.99 as of 8/12/14) for a deck of forty+ cards.  Card games like “Phase 10″ and “Uno”, for example, can be found on Amazon for about seven bucks (the prices vary).  The instructions are also “part” of the box, making reassembly more difficulty than it needs to be.  Still, “Trifecta” both surprised us and kept us actively engaged from start to finish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18IHN147IZMSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI441QK#wasThisHelpful","R18IHN147IZMSG","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Munchkin Panic: 1-6 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 60 MinutesAt first glance, I didn’t think that “Castle Panic” and “Munchkin” would be a good combination.  I mean, they have totally opposite goals.  “Castle Panic” is all about working together to kill a common enemy, much like “Pandemic” or “Forbidden Island”.  Giving players cards they need is encouraged and almost required in order to win.  “Munchkin”, on the other hand, is survival of the fittest with the occasional “scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours (maybe)” mentality.  People who do well at “Munchkin” would make excellent Ferengi on “Star Trek”.  With that said, “Munchkin Panic” takes the best parts of both games and mashes them together both elegantly and brilliantly.  The components were of good quality and I didn’t take issue with anything in particular.As I mentioned in my opening paragraph, the game is a bit more like “Castle Panic” than “Munchkin”.  After all, you have castle cards, towers, walls, goo (instead of tar)…even the names of the rings and the number of arcs are the same.  The main difference (and hence where “Munchkin” begins to peak through) lies in the treasure cards and the negotiating that goes along with combat.  In “Castle Panic”, only the active player could attack monsters.  Here, players can seek the help they need for a price…those who have played “Munchkin” will be familiar with this ancient art of haggling and backstabbing.  The backstabbing bit comes more into play when utilizing the expansion as the leading player in trophies will be encouraged to help the monsters destroy the towers.All in all we enjoyed “Munchkin Panic”.  There’s slightly less emphasis on cooperative play when compared to “Castle Panic”, though I thought the earning of treasure cards upon a monster’s death was a neat mechanic.  This can also lead to some situations where you’re hesitant to do any damage to a monster IF you can’t finish it off, even if you could.  Why give up a great card or two if your opponent gets the last hit and the resulting treasure cards?  As I said, you’re less encouraged to work together for reasons like this…though groups who can put aside the greed can treat “Munchkin Panic” as a purely cooperative experience should they wish to.  Like “Castle Panic”, the game is highly modifiable to be as friendly or as difficult as you want it to be.  This reason alone keeps me coming back to games like “Castle Panic”…the fact that there’s now a bit of mischief to top it off only adds icing to the proverbial cake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LN0SQGX55BR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R2LN0SQGX55BR0","A1UP19XQH91JT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UP19XQH91JT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked it that the story had three points of view, Cain's, Julia's & Spike's. It helped to get to know these main characters better. It is uncommon to include a villain's point of view.  If it is multiple points of view then usually it is just the hero and heroine's but I am glad the author did this. No one was all bad or all book but Cain, a sociopath comes close to be all evil.  He is a cold blooded killer who feels very little unless he is torturing and murdering people until he meets Julia.  Julia  is taken by the Dragons and given to Cain to kill.  He feels things for her that he has never felt for another person and it confuses him.  He is not use to feeling anything.  He tries to keep her safe from others but not himself.  While he saves her life, he abuses her. He is extremely possessive and would kill anyone who tries to take her from him.I had mixed feelings about Julia. She is hard to like. She is cold and selfish.  She lacks morals and is a thief. However, she too begins to feel strong positive emotions for the first time for another person but hers are for Spike as opposed to Cain. I believe by the end of the story she loves him as much as she is capable of loving a person. While I did not like her, I wanted her to have a HEA ending.Spike is the most likable of the three.  He is a prospect in the Dragons and joined out of a sense of loyalty and wanting to belong. Spike views Cain as a mentor until he sees how he is abusing Julia. He falls in love with Julia and out of the three the love is the most unselfish. He puts her safety above his own, unlike Cain who tries to protect her but would never do anything that endangered his own life, even to save hers.The smex scenes between Spike and Julia were hot but the rape scenes bothered me and I tended to skim over them. This story is brutal but then again from reading the description I expected it to be because of the warnings and the fact the title states that it is a dark romance. If rape and violence is a trigger then skip this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MV9FZZOEZT14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L82ZQ8K#wasThisHelpful","R1MV9FZZOEZT14","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The things I like about the story.  It is from both the heroine Leila and hero Henrik's point of view allowing the reader to get a more complete story.  The author switched between the two well. With some stories, even though they are suppose to both alternating point of view, it sounds like the same voice, usually a woman's.  That was not the case here.  Henrik stops manhoing around after smexing Leila.  I hate when the hero and heroine sleep together and the hero smexes OW afterwards and the heroine is only with the hero after that.  Even though it initially seemed otherwise that was not the case here.  While Henrik attempted to have smex with OW  after a week after being with Leila, that stopped when he heard that Leila was coming to see him.  No other attempts were made on his part. While I have read other stories where both are with OP after being with each other, I have yet to read a story where it is the heroine has smex with OM after being with the hero when the hero refrains but I am sure they exist.  My preference is that they are each others last but that is not realistic when couples are apart for a long period of time.  Also this is a KU story.What I dislike: The one and only smex scene between them was at the beginning of the story and mediocre.  It never happens again.

"Not good. I read the first three parts which included this one and I am sorry  that I wasted my time. The parts are so short that they could have easily been written in one book instead of milking money from customers by dividing them up. It is not even like they were released with months in between. The second and third were both released in November and total less than 200 pages combined. It is not even a complete story yet. There appears to be many more parts left to buy to get a whole complete story.There was no chemistry nor feeling between the hero and heroine. She almost is raped and he tells her that they should talk about it later. He had football practice to go too. He thinks that she may have another boyfriend because they are not getting along and spending any time together but it does not seem too concern him until she yells out another man's name during smex. He gets over that fairly quickly without even questioning her about it. There is someone else she is very attracted to and thinks about sleeping with but that is never addressed. Talking about which the smex scenes are vague and mechanical. Smex by numbers until actual penetration and then it flowery but not descriptive. It is unclear during one of few times smex occurs If protection was even used.I will not be reading any more parts. I don't care what happens to them because what I read was not good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHTXF6D7A0L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017QFFEZM#wasThisHelpful","RFHTXF6D7A0L3","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed reading all of the books in this series including this one even though they include dark themes like child abuse.I really liked both Joey and Alexa and am glad that the book included flashbacks of their childhood relationship.  I loved Joey.  He was a possessive, protective, jealous and loving alpha.  He was faithful to her, even during a long separation. Alexa was with one another man during their separation but in fairness to her, I do not blame her. She was the one who was giving 100 percent to their relationship and always putting Joey first.  This included moving to wherever he went. Joey broke it off with her, telling her to leave him. Joey did not stay in contact with her and gave her no hope or indication that they would get back together. She met a nice guy and attempted to move on even though she was heartbroken/  I was glad when Joey finally woke up to the fact that he could lose her and decided to get her back.They had good chemistry and the sexy scenes were hot.

"Immature game playing hero. The hero runs so hot & cold it is like he has a personality disorder.  Ignoring the heroine at school. He is rude and hurts her feeling and then is tender towards her some of the time at home.  Other times he just ignores her at home too and gives flimsy excuses when she presses him for answers as to why he treats her so poorly.  The hero makes out with the Virgin  heroine and then shortly thereafter the OW claiming that he is doing it for her. His explanations as how it is in her best interest is just another lame excuse. The heroine is just as bad.  She allows him to treat her like a doormat. She just puts up with whatever he dishes out, pining and crying. I wanted to slap her. The smex scene which comes around 85 percent of the story is wooden and lacking in hotness.

"Out of all of Lynne Graham's romances that I have read, I like this one the best.  Unlike many of her heroes of the books that I have read, Alex was not a jerk. Also he was faithful to her.  Like many of the author's heroes, he was a protective, possessive, & jealous alpha hero, which I loved.  Alex was in love with Sarah and went after her when he realized he was about to lose her.

While the author teased with the hero and heroine making love by having a lot of near misses for various reasons, it did not happen until around the last 20% of the story.

"The kidnappers being a desperate man and his two hungry teenage sons was unusual & therefore it kept the story interesting. I felt sorry for the heroine, who was a likable character. However I did not feel the same way about the father/ hero. I took me almost until the ending to like the hero as he was too abusive towards the heroine and his sons. Also it was disappointing that the only sex scenes contained in the story involved unlikable secondary characters.  The hero and heroine hardly even kissed.

"I read the last book in the series Alexei first and then this one.  This story, in compassion is more of everything.  I liked this one a lot more as well. This is not dark romance lite like the story Alexei.  Shane is a much more intense character than Alexei, good and bad.  I love possessive and protective alpha heroes and he was that. He is possessive to the max and crazy about the heroine.  He admits being obsessed with her and was stalking her before she was taken. He would never let her go. Alexei was like a water down version of Shane, and at the end of that story, he offered to let the heroine go.  Since this is romanceland as opposed to reality, I want my heroes to be more like Shane (without the abusiveness) then Alexei.  Liked they would die without the heroines.  Because he fit, I was able to recommend this story for one of Amazon reading threads, ""Hero is Crazy in Love and Crazy Jealous/Possessive 5"" because he certainly fit.This story has more and hotter sex scenes than in Alexei.  However, by the same token, unfortunately, there is more abusive behavior that the heroine experiences in the beginning by Shane and by others.The emotions that I felt toward the characters was much more intense then in Alexei. I hated Shane in the beginning because he raped the heroine. There was no forced seduction like with Alexei.  It was rape which she did not enjoy.  However, shortly thereafter she did and by the time the book ended,  she had forgiven him and was in love with him and so I forgave him too, because again Romanceland not reality.  I wanted them to have their HEA and they did.  I hated the villain in this story  whereas I cannot remember who the villain was in Alexei, that I read around the same time that I read this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4UJG1BSBD8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015C74KME#wasThisHelpful","R2J4UJG1BSBD8C","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The premise of the story is uncommon.  The heroine, Laney was dating Austin, Jake's brother for 3 years. Austin cheats on her and is afraidof losing her and so he gives her a ""free pass"" to smex someone else for 2 weeks so they are even.  Jake, Austin's brother, has been attracted to  and in love with Laney for years.. When Jake finds discovers that Austin cheated on her he takes his chance to make her his.  I loved Jake.  He is caring, loving and dedicated to her. From his actions, which included possessive and jealous moments, it is clear that heis crazy about Laney.SPOILERS included belowI disliked Laney.  She played with Jake's emotions too much, causing him to get too worked up because she wanted to see him react, thinking that showed how much he loved her.  Usually I enjoy when the hero acts possessive and jealous but Laney took it too far in order to obtain that response, even letting Austin kiss her in front of Jake.  She decided not to have anything to do with Austin from the beginning of the book when she found out he cheated on her.  Supposedly too she could not stand of Austin to touch her anymore. However, she let Jake think that she would decide which man to be with as result of their two weeks together.  Austin was in on this, knowing that she would not longer be with him but wanting to get a reaction out of Jake, does thinks like kissing her.  Austin reveals to Laney that he only started dating her because Jake was interested in her.  Austin beat Jake to the punch because of competitiveness as opposed to interest. Laney and Austin were both deliberately hurting Jake, two people that supposedly loved him. It was wrong and he deserved a better brother and lover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVMZAJ1T5SZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQACNNG#wasThisHelpful","RGVMZAJ1T5SZ6","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the most part I enjoyed the story.  It moved at a good pace and was interesting.  There are good love making scenes and it is a KU book. I loved the hero Matt.  He was loving, protective, possessive and sweet and still very much an alpha. While he was usually a one night stand guy, I believe that he gave that up and was faithful to her, even during separations that she caused.  He was not afraid to say the ""l"" word.I did not care that much for the heroine, Emily. She was selfish, except when it came to her sister and thoughtless of all others feelings including Matt's, with the exception of again, her sister.  I usually prefer the hero to do the chasing as opposed to the heroine & that is true in this case too.However Emily made Matt do it too much and said too many mean things to Matt.

The heroine was admirable for her strong will and fighting spirit but way too immature for a 40 year old. She did not seem to have much ambition nor a career.

"There was a major problem with the story.  Too much telling, not enough showing. It was a ""clean"" romance which was fine but the problem was that it was completely lacking in romance and feelings.Spoilers ahead. The  heroine is with 2 men during two different periods. There is no cheating on her part, which is good . What is bad is that it felt like she was merely roomate's with each man. She claims about one of the men that their love making had been perfect and continued to be perfect but it was just words because I don't think there was any real kissing scenes with said man much less anything else sexual. It did not seem to bother either man that she slept with the other. There was no jealousy or hurt feelings or anger involved. It was lacking in emotion and apparently a non issue including for the man who was abandoned, which is not a normal response. She did not react in a normal way to it either. She never even questions if the man she unwilling left slept with other women in her absence. I did not care who she ended up with because I never felt anything for any of them, which is rare. Usually I have feeling for the main characters because they seem real and I become emotionally involved in the story. That was not the case here. The only feelings I had about the story was it was a depressing book that I am sorry that I spent my money and time reading.  The ending was horrible. It was never even clear if she has a HEA with one of the men.  Where the story ends she is truly just roomates with one of them and the other is no longer in her life.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5OOOKO7Z9L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHVOPWY#wasThisHelpful","R3H5OOOKO7Z9L3","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lena too was likable. Hard working, determined & loving, for the most part she seemed down to earth.  I liked it that they were both virgins and gave their virginity to each other.  It was sweet and the scene sexy.  However, they did a few things that irritated me.  The major one was their failure to use birth control.  I understand that teenagers let hormones get in the way of reason.  However, Rory & Lena waited to have sex for 3 years until they were both ready.  It did not make sense to me that they waited all that time and then decided to play Russian roulette, sometimes using a condom and other times not feeling like it and going without any type of protection. Also they made important decisions without consulting each other, which I did not understand given how close they were.

I loved Falk.  He is everything that a heroine needs.  Protective, dedicated, determined, loving, and willing to die for her.  My heart broke for Hannah.  At times it was difficult to read because of the excessive amount of times that Hannah and other women were raped although most of it was referenced and the scenes where it was shown were brief.

I want to read about a hero whotakes one look at a heroine, falls hard and does not even look at, much less have sex with OW.  Ryland was that way.When he saw Jade, he fell hard and was faithful to her even before they became a couple.  I did not have to read about him having sex with OW. The hero being faithful just does it for me.  Also,  I want heroes to have a decent enough self esteem that they don't start using the excuses to stay away from the heroines  like ""I am not good enough for her"".  Ryland knew that Jade was it for him and did everything in his power to make her his in a short period of time.  He did not watch and wait for years before making his move.  That drives me crazy when heroes are so risk adverse, afraid of getting their feelings hurt.The story moves at a good pace.  At no time was I bored.  Also it had a HEA ending.

"The story dragged in the beginning but picked up about 25 percent into the story.  After that point, the story kept my attention.  The sex scenes were good and I liked it when Damian showed possessiveness and jealousy.  It was refreshing though at no point was Damian a jerk to the Lily.  It was nice too that there were no needless separations and Damian and Lily did not have sex with OP after meeting each other.  They were faithful to each other.  I liked too that it was a KU story.

"Atypical storyline. Interesting story that read in one sitting.  At no time was I bored.  Likable hero and heroine. Satisfactory ending. Needless to say that I liked this book.  Actually I love it.For me no matter how good a story is if I do not like the hero then i cannot love the book.  It is just the way I am.  Here that was not an issue because I loved Ben.  Loving, faithful, protective, passionate and romantic he was the ideal hero. He was also Evie's rock.  She could always count on him and he helped keep her sane. Evie was likable too and I had no complaints about her.  She accepted what happened to her and tried to make the best of a difficult situation. Ben was her everything and she loved him as deeply as he loved her. I read around two hundred romance books a year and have for years. I can count on one hand the number of books where the hero and heroine are close friend as children, their relationship develops into romantic love when they are older, give each other the gift of their virginity and both never have sex with anyone else. Here they gave their virginity to each other as teenagers and kept true to each other. I know that it is very uncommon in real life but I do not care.  This is romance land and not reality and it was one if many things that I loved about this book.Everything cannot be perfect in a story for it to keep my interest and most readers probably feel the same way.  The hero and heroine must face adversity or have a conflict that is resolved.  Here they did which included facing separations that were beyond their control. I am not overly emotional but found myself tearing up on several occasions and feeling frustrated and worried right alone with them.  In fact I was concerned that I would not like the ending. I want a HEA ending or at least a HFN one and could see this story ending in a way I would not like. While I would have preferred a different ending,  I was ok with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UO6NYHO6FHJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMVWOJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1UO6NYHO6FHJV","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Lukas and really enjoyed reading this story.  At no time was I bored.  I read it in one sitting, staying up way too late to finish it.  If you dislike instant love then this book is not got you.  Lukas fell fast and hard for the heroine and wanted forever with her right away.  He pursued her and would not give up until she agreed to go on a date with him.  I liked reading the scenes were Lukas shows his possessiveness towards her. Also Iove it when the hero and the heroine are faithful to each other and even during times apart they stay true to each other.  That happened here.  No OW/OM sex in this story after they meet which was refreshing. Talking about which, the sex scenes were hot.  However they did not have sex until after at least 35% of the story which was nice too.  It allowed the chemistry and sexual tension to build up.  It was nice too there was no teasing.  I hate when books having the couple keep getting close to making love and then someone or something stops it from occurring.  It is very frustrating and not sexy.SPOILERS belowThere are possible trigger in this story.  This contains SPOILERS. 1 Older woman younger man 12 years age difference2 she is still married but separated when the become a couple. Her husband of 18 years left her for 20 year old he was screwing for one year. She had no idea and was happy with him even though her ex-husband stopped being physical with her after meeting OW. 3 her bratty spoiled 18 year old took a bribe from her father to set up Lukas to break them up because loser ex husband was jealous. Daughter physically threw herself at Lukas half naked. He was not attracted to her but got semi hard as many 24 year olds would. Pushed her away right away. 4. Separation because of number 3 but not too long and no sex or touching or flirting with OP during that or any other time. 5. Death of child. Child secondary character with limited contact but is a niece of Lukas that he loved.None of those things bothered me but based on being part of a reading threads I know that they bother some readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUR3B7AVC4A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VC9T5G#wasThisHelpful","R1FUR3B7AVC4A2","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enjoyed reading this story. I really liked Sophie and loved Lucas. They were not a cookie cutter hero and heroine, which was refreshing.  The story was not typical either, which again I liked. Both were kind and unselfish people who had not had an easy life as an adult.  Their childhoods, while not ideal, were not too bad despite both having less than ideal things happen.  I am trying to be vague as to avoid spoilers.  What happened to Lucas right before they met broke my heart and I wanted to hug and reassure him that everything would work out.  He was so loving and devoted towards Sophie and his grandparents that I could not help but love him.  I felt bad for Sophie that she was alone for too long.  It is sad because the only reason that she was alone all of those years was because she afraid of getting hurt after losing people close to her.  It she had only had someone to support and encourage her though a difficult time then she she would have recovered long before meeting Lucas.  While I thought that this would be a clean romance in terms of having not sex scenes (we were warned that the story contained a rape scene, which was not graphic), it wasn't a clean romance and I am glad. I will admit to wanting the heroes and heroines in romance books I read to include love making scenes.  Also in this case, it helped to view Lucas and Sophie as a romantic couple after reading about them consummating their relationship.  If the story did not include that then to me they would seem more like close friends as opposed to lovers lovers.There was only a few things that I wish were different about the story.  For one, while I liked the ending, I wished that it had included an epilogue showing their life 10 plus years in the future.  They have challenges to overcome as a couple including their twenty year age difference and being different races.  I wanted reassurance that they got to kept their HEA ending.  Another thing is that I wish Sophie was not insecure about about being a large woman, which is her word and not mine.  She did not want Lucas to see her in a swimming suit and thought that she was too heavy to wear shorts and still look good.  While it may be realistic because many women feel insecure about how their bodies looks no matter their size including me & I am thin (but want a larger chest) I do not like reading about it.  In addition, I found the scenes where she ate too much dairy and then threw up on the sidewalk gross.  It is funny because I could easily handle other scenes in the story that some would consider gross like the smelling like urine, bad breathe, body odor due to not bathing & bedpan usage fine but not the dairy scene.  I thought about it and the reason it bothered me so much is because Sophie did it to herself.  She knew what would could happen if she ate too much dairy but ate it anyway.  I think she even used a word like ""dump"" right before she threw up, telling Lucas before it happened that she was going to dump. The other things that I mentioned above were out of the hero and heroine's control, they could not help it.  The author is a good writer and I will be reading another book of hers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELY1J7JB0OOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008POU5VM#wasThisHelpful","R2ELY1J7JB0OOK","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The last story of the author's that I read was Kyland, which I loved.  These stories have similarities.  In both the love between the characters grows gradually.  It is a slow burn instead of instant love.  In both books all of the main characters have had difficult childhoods.  In Kyland it was mainly due to poverty.  Here, both the hero and the heroine came from wealthy families so money was not an issue growing up.  Rather it was due to inferior, unloving and cruel parents.  In both stories I really liked the heroine.  Both women were strong, loving, caring and willing to bend over backwards for other people.  So why not a higher rating?  Mainly because of the hero Grayson. The reason that I loved the book Kyland and only thought that this story was ok mainly because of my admiration and love of Kyland and my lack of it for Grayson.  Among other things, how Kyland displayed his love for the heroine and what he was willing to sacrifice for her blew me away.  He was unselfish and putting her needs before his own even to his detriment.  Admittedly the hero Grayson had a high bar to reach but unfortunately he did not get even close.  He was too selfish and wrapped up in self pity and anger to care enough of other people's feelings including the heroine's.He displayed this thoughtless, self centered behavior throughout the story including on the eve of their marriage. Even though it was a marriage of convenience, he acted cruelly, uncaring about the heroine's feelings. Also even though it was again a marriage of inconvenience, his considering infidelity on more than one occasion because he was horny due to his attraction to the heroine and wanted a release was a turn off.  Those type of thoughts never even crossed the Kira's mind even though she was frequently turned on from being around him too.  Grayson says and does other mean & thoughtless things to the heroine as well. At times it felt like she was his punching bag.  As discussed, he was neglected during childhood (which she was as well) and afraid of loving her but theses things did not justify his behavior.  The heroine is the opposite of him.  She is unselfish and proves her love for him on numerous occasions.Besides the hero Grayson the story had other things that bothered me as well.  The book had the near misses to them making love, which always irritates me.  They are getting close and then someone interrupts (which happened more than one) or one of the characters gets cold feet.  Don't tease.  Either have them make love or don't.  For me it does not build up the sexual tension but is rather like nails on a chalkboard and always feels like I am being played, much like the characters are playing with each other or the situations playing with them. There was potential to have hot sex scenes but it never pans out.  When they finally happened, it was lacking passion. I love when the hero displays possessive and jealous behavior as long as no one is physically hurt by the hero showing it. It is a turn on for me and sometimes leads to hot love making scenes.  Here, Grayson feeling jealousy had the opposite effect. It was like throwing cold water on him.  Also another ""good"" characters behavior, was wrong.  While I understand that the character had only good intentions, it could of resulted in a serious injury and there should of been some kind of consequences to insure the character never acts like that again and to make the person understand what could have happened. There was for that person and I felt like the person never understood what he/she did was wrong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MHXBZ83SXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","R4MHXBZ83SXK","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading this story.  It was different then the other three books in the series in terms of the relationship between the hero and the heroine.  Unlike the other stories,  Max was enemies with Erin Rule's brothers and kidnapped her to obtain his revenge.  It added an interesting element that made the story more entertaining and held my attention the entire time.  At no time was I bored nor did I feel like I could even put the story down.  Like most of the other stories in this series, the sex scenes were hot.  I love jealous, possessive & protective alpha men and so I was loving that about Max as he certainly was and was obsessive on top of it.  Some readers may feel that he went overboard in his attempts to keep Erin with him and his stalking her but since it is fantasy and not reality, I had no problem with those scenes.  IMO they added to the hotness.  I feel like I am being greedy when I say but would have loved it if there could be other meetings that Erin had with other men where Max has an opportunity to lets his jealousy have free reign.  Other than telling her before meeting with the neighbors not to flirt with the male neighbor, he had no reactions to her being around the neighbor nor did the neighbor show any interest in her at all.  In the first book  Rule's Obsession, Damian Rule, the hero from that book, almost lost it when he finds Angie, the heroine, in a room and sitting close to another man.  It was perfectly innocent but I loved his reaction. There was none of those types of encounters but again, I am probably being greedy.  I loved that there were no sex scenes with OW/OM in this story which is usually something that I can count on with Lynda Chance's stories, which is greatly appreciated.  Also in this story there were no needless separations.  Again the majority of the author's stories do not contain them.  Only a minority of them.I would have liked the climax to have been more drawn out which would have made it more exciting. Instead the heroine and her brothers gave in way too easily to Max and the conflict was resolved fairly quickly.  I liked the HEA including epilogue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTYI012PNII1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UBXRYK#wasThisHelpful","R2DTYI012PNII1","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the most part I enjoyed reading this story.  It surprised me that I occasionally teared up while reading it.  I am not a crier but it was hard to read about the pain the characters went through, specifically Naomi and Mason.  Jesse acted like a jerk when he was confused and young but I loved how he later manned up and loved Naomi.  He helped the story have a HEA.  It surprised me but the sex scenes later in the story were good, which I am always in favor of.  I will be honest and say that I disliked reading about the drug usage.  Also I could have done without all of the religious references.  I was not expecting any based on the description of the book. While I have a belief system,  I do not like mixing romance and religion, just a personal preference.

"For the most part I enjoyed reading this story.  Tag and Finch were likable characters. There was a role reversal which I liked because it was different. Finch had a romantic side, which he showed throughout the story.  He wanted a commitment from Finch as opposed to one night stand and liked to cuddle almost as much as having sex.  Actually he did not want to have sex.  He wanted to make love.  It was great that Tag was not a manhoe.  He had only been with one other woman before being with Finch.  By contrast, Finch had a lot of one night stands which is unusual for heroines.  If one of the characters sleeps around a lot, it is usually the hero as opposed to the heroine.  I was relieved that Finch and Tag did not have sex with OP, which was a concern of mine given that Finch frequently hooked up with men and there was a separation.As much as I liked Tag, it irritated me that he left for months without letting Finch know that he was going, right after having sex with her for the first time.  It was a sleazeball move not to say goodbye, which would have cost him very little.  I like when heroes are possessive and display jealousy and some of the heroes in the author's other books have been that way towards the heroines. Unfortunately Tag is not.  If he was then it would eat at him thinking that Finch was having sex with OM when he left her without word for two months.  She had no expectation that she would ever see him again and there was no commitment between them and so it would not be unreasonable, based on her usual behavior,  if she did.  However, it did not bother him.I was disappointed in the lack of chemistry between Tag and Finch and thought that the few sex scenes that there were lacked heat.  I did, however, like the ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU89F020NJF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXZ3ZQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2JU89F020NJF9","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love possessive, protective, jealous & faithful heroes and Tristan definitely is that way toward Kyla. This was an interesting story that kept my attention.  I read it in one sitting. The sex scenes are hot and plentiful and so if that is not your thing you will want to skip over them.  I liked that they were faithful to each other & no sex scenes with OW/OM.I disliked that there was a cliffhanger but liked that it is KU story.  I enjoyed it to the point that I will be buying it even though it was a KU read for me.Possible triggers for some readers: Forced seduction/rape of the heroine by the hero on multiple occasions- does not want to have sex with him,tells him no on multiple occasions & fights it but he makes her body want it.  Also for those readers who get grossed out by blood including period blood then this story will not be your thing.  He is a vampire and blood turns him on & feeds him and he does not care as to what type of blood he is drinking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLV84B538OV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0LOROM#wasThisHelpful","R3VLV84B538OV2","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were things I loved about this book including Carter, the hero. Carter was loving, faithful and an ideal hero. He fell hard for Ty and loved her and took care of her even though she had a lot of issues. Most men and women would at least hesitate to voluntarily tie themselves to someone who required so much of everything but he didn't and that is one of the reasons I loved him. At times it got overwhelming to even read about everything she went through and continued to go through.  Honestly it was too much to the point it lacked creditable and detracted from my enjoyment of the novel.  The heroine being terrorized and feeling terrified last until almost the end of the story and completely overshadowed the romance for me.  Carter seemed more like her brother than lover and the few sex scenes lacked heat. With that said I may read the next story in the series as I liked all of the characters including her brother Ethan and want to read his story.  He too was an exceptional man for how he took care of and loved his sister, putting aside everyone and everything if it interfered with meeting her needs.  He deserves his own heroine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW8FKFZ6U3YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5U922K#wasThisHelpful","R1WW8FKFZ6U3YY","A2ON53GR80JS8S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ON53GR80JS8S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Coming into this series relatively late with episodes 8 and 9, I was initially left wanting to know more about the central characters. However I quickly got over it and found myself thoroughly enjoying yet another police thriller from Sweden.It seems each new mystery show has to have a gimmick, which is understandable.  The gimmick with MARIA WERN is that it is set on the tiny island of Gotland, which is part of Sweden.  The premise is that Maria Wern, a police detective and single mother, wishes to move there with her three children in the hope of establishing a nice, quiet (for a detective) life for themselves.Obviously we wouldn't have a very watchable series if that were the case!  Somewhat like MIDSOMER MURDERS in that regard (where there is a disproportionate body count for the population) MARIA WERN sees herself involved in all sorts of murderous activity.Of the two episodes in this package, the second (episode nine in the series) is especially interesting as it incorporates a medieval festival as part of its background.  Gotland has an incredibly rich history, as shown by an extraordinary amount of rich archaeological findings.  It is a wise move on the part of the producers to include Gotland's history in the plot lines.As for Maria Wern herself, she is played by Eva Rose, a very accomplished Swedish actress whose career includes a part in Steven Spielberg's MUNICH (later cut out), an audition for the role of a Bond Girl in DIE ANOTHER DAY and a number of classical stage roles including plays by Tennessee Williams and Bertolt Brecht.  With this acting pedigree, playing Maria Wern might be slumming for a less conscientious actress, but Rose invests Maria with everything she's got.  There's a reason the show is named after her character: the show is less about murders (although there are plenty of them) and more about the character of Maria Wern--at least what I can tell from watching these two later episodes in the series.Let's face it, there are an awful lot of detective shows out there vying for our attention.  All I can say to that is for this reviewer, MARIA WERN was worth my time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WXODF05YJKAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWI1MJK#wasThisHelpful","R1WXODF05YJKAU","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone wanting to visit New Zealand after viewing the LORD OF THE RINGS films may be in for a shock.  The rolling, lush scenery one might expect from the land of kiwis is decidedly less appealing if one is to go by what is on display in HARRY, a 6 episode police thriller co-starring Sam Neill, the only big name in the cast.HARRY, co-written and starring relative new-comer Oscar Kightley, pulls no punches in its depiction of criminals and the less than admirable people who try to bring them to justice.  One might even say there are times when HARRY seems to layer on the violence and profanity with a trowel.Fortunately, for all HARRY's seediness and unrelenting exploration of the worst in people, there is also a smattering of light in the darkness, even hope, though redemption might be pushing it.Sensitive viewers will come away from watching HARRY (if they get through all of it) feeling like they need a shower.  I have to admit I found myself in places going ""all right, already.""  Fortunately the creative team realized that with all the bad they were showing there had to be some good.  Subtle though it may be, there are moments in HARRY that help you remember that not everything is hopelessness and despair.  I'm referring to a couple of supporting characters, such as Harry's mother, who is clearly shown to be a Christian.  Along with the parents of a young offender who is not given adequate protection by the police when in prison, these characters remind us there is more to human nature than just violence and revenge.  Without their tempering effect, this viewer would have found HARRY unbearable.Among all the performances there is a wide range of ability on hand.  Oscar Kightley, who plays Harry, is not the best actor going.  He sometimes comes across as forced or worse, one-note, as he plays scenes of strong emotion.Sam Neill, usually an outstanding actor, looks like he is slumming.  By far the best performance is that of one of the worst bad guys.  Errol Shand, an actor I'd never heard of before, is absolutely riveting as Chocka Fahey (even the name sounds evil).  His performance elevates HARRY into a program that is highly watchable for one reason only: you want to see what happens to Chocka.  Shand should attract a lot of attention one of these days.  He's a well-known character actor in New Zealand but deserves to be more widely seen.HARRY is very well done and deserves high marks for look, feel, style and execution.  Shand's performance makes it a must-see, providing you are not completely repulsed by the grim content.The fact that HARRY is based on a true story may justify, to some, its content and presentation.  For me, I have to ask myself at what point, when watching shows that assault one's senses, does a program cease to be entertaining?  As audiences become more and more desensitized by exposure to extremes of content this may become a moot point, but to me it's worth asking.All I know is I cared more about what happened to Chocka than I did about Harry.  And I'm not sure it's supposed to be that way!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLW36CG5GEY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKX6V40#wasThisHelpful","RBLW36CG5GEY4","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Place to Call Home returns for a second season with a very jarring opening set in contemporary times.  Thankfully this teaser soon reverts back to the time and place we've grown to love from Season 1--Australia, 1950s.Marta Dusseldorp's Sarah Adams faces more adversity and surprise in Season 2 as do most of the other characters.  It's all glorious.  More huffing and puffing in the bedroom and sundry other locales.  Frankly, the actors look better with their clothes on, the fifties' styles being so much fun.The attention to period detail is one of the show's strengths and apparently there is more to come with Season 3.

"A PLACE TO CALL HOME is a masterpiece of soap opera indulgence.  Clearly inspired by the lush, over-blown, emotion-heavy melodramas of Hollywood director Douglas Sirk in the 1950s, A PLACE TO CALL HOME delivers the goods.A compelling lead character played by Marta Dusseldorp is the backbone of the series.  Her haunted, determined Sarah Adams returns to Australia after the upheaval of World War II and its aftermath.  Desperate to find a place to call home, Sarah is nobody's fool and faces challenge after challenge with dignity and strength.  Her involvement with the Bligh family begins in her capacity as a nurse on board a ship returning to Australia.  From there the story strands weave and grow, all to the fulfillment of a soap opera afficianado's best dreams.To even try to encapsulate the various plot lines would be a disservice.  Enjoy, luxuriate and soak in the suds.Do be warned there is an awful lot of sex going on (did they have sex in the '50s?)  While not overly graphic, there's a lot of huffing and puffing, in case that is a concern.Otherwise, get out the hankies and popcorn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWSOP9J0V0EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKPGLOY#wasThisHelpful","R1LWSOP9J0V0EV","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well it's about time!  Remember the Oscar-winning film ARGO from a few years back?  Then you know part of the story about the rescue of six American diplomats who had evaded capture during the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, by Islamist students and militants after the fall of the Shah, which plunged the country into disarray.  The rest of the story?  Let's just say it is long overdue.  Thankfully, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN, a terrific, low-key but effective documentary tells the story from a more rounded perspective.  While ARGO emphasized the CIA's involvement and downplayed the crucial role of the Canadians, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN gives us the Canadian involvement and shows how important it was.Canadians, generally, are known as a nation of people who do not toot their own horn very often, but if this isn't a story worth tooting about, I don't know what is.  Ken Taylor, the head of the Canadian Embassy at the time, still youthful and somewhat self-effacing, finally steps into the spotlight in this film, along with other key players, to fill in the gaps that ARGO left out.  Proof that a film primarily of ""talking heads"" can be compelling, OUR MAN IN TEHRAN tells this story of heroism, daring and incredible courage in a simple, direct way.This taut, evenly-paced documentary relies on the story to drive it forward.  Well-chosen archival footage and intelligent interviews help it do just that.  One interesting touch involves filming the interviewees in long shot as well as in close-up, with occasional cuts to the subject being filmed/interviewed.  This reminds the viewer how low-tech a documentary can be and still be effective, rather a metaphor for the low-key but effective Canadians!After this nightmare was over, Canada and the U.S. had never been closer as friends and neighbours.  OUR MAN IN TEHRAN serves to remind us of that as well.  And that, like Paul Harvey used to say, is the rest of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9T7H07Q6FV0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZ6PK1E#wasThisHelpful","R9T7H07Q6FV0O","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears is a fresh look at very familiar material.Mears, who is well-known in the U.K. as a television host and presenter, is particularly known for his interest in bushcraft and survival techniques.  Many of his previous shows focus on surviving in the wilderness and on wildlife.Mears' love and veneration for the American West is clearly evident in this 2-DVD set of 8 half hour programs. He begins, logically enough, on the Eastern part of America, taking the viewer immediately up into the Appalachian Mountain Range, former home of the Cherokee Indians.  In this episode he speaks almost with awe about the tenacity and resourcefulness of the early occupants--both Indian and white.  One fascinating aspect of the Cherokees that I did not know about was their proficiency with the blow gun, a weapon I always associate solely with Amazonian tribesmen and some Africans.  The means by which the Cherokees helped the white settlers is presented in such a way that it is clear the settlers would not have survived without the compassion and generosity of the Cherokee.  And of course the fate of the Cherokee--relocation to farmland in Oklahoma--is sadly documented as well.Subsequent episodes strike a similar tone as they explore the various trails the settlers took to cross the continent and get to California and the other locations in the Promised Land that were so appealing that people were prepared to give up house and home and brave extreme weather, resistance by Indians and bandits, discomfort, disease and just about any other deterrent you can think of.  One doomed group of settlers, known as the Donner Party, probably exemplify the worst of what could go wrong.  Stranded by an early harsh winter, members of the Donner Party had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive.Probably my favourite episode was the one in Utah, specifically when it explored Monument Valley, which has been used in the making of countless films, many of which were directed by John Ford and starred John Wayne.  Mears excitement when he encounters such famous landmarks and places of note is genuine and palpable.The Wild American West continues to fascinate people the world over and this modest series helps to explain why.  Mears is a good host, he never gets in the way.  Rather he introduces in such a low-key fashion, interviews people with such skill and subtlety and shares information without the smallest inkling of forcing his opinion on the viewer.  He wants you to enjoy with him, not be impressed by his knowledge--the failing of many a television host/presenter.THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears comes with a 16-page viewers guide with a map of settlers' westbound routes and articles on stagecoach services, how the west was wild, pioneering women's right to vote, little-known facts about cowboys, and Geronimo's art of war.Occasionally the viewer could get the feeling that somewhere along the line the producers went ""oh, let's include that bit, too."" which explains why one of the Bonus Features profiles fascinating women of the west.  Interesting, yes, but it feels like an add-on.But to err on the side of too much information is better than to have holes in the narrative.  Getting the right balance in determining what material to present may have been a challenge, but it is an understandable one in a program called THE WILD WEST.Lots to savour here.  Fans of the West and Westerns will find much that is pleasing and entertaining in THE WILD WEST with Ray Mears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SN6A19AVK3Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKX6VYA#wasThisHelpful","R1SN6A19AVK3Z8","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES is a very good show.  Not great, but not bad, with the singularly attractive feature that it was produced in New Zealand, which provides some unique elements.Where the producers have maybe overstepped themselves a bit is by advertising the show as a ""New Zealand Midsomer Murders"".  For fans of Midsomer Murders, that is a pretty enticing lead in.  But as it invites, indeed emphasizes the inevitable comparison, things become problematic when it becomes apparent that, while very good, THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES just does not have the pedigree that Midsomer Murders has.Neill Rea as Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd is very good.  He projects the world-weary detective we are all familiar with, but succeeds in putting his own stamp on the paradigm.  Where THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES might have the slightest edge on Midsomer Murders is that Shepherd's sidekick is a very attractive female, Detective Kristin Sims, played by Fern Sutherland.  Her interplay with Shepherd has a long way to go before it will become as endearing as either Tom or John Barnaby's rapport with any of their underlings, but the fact that she is a beautiful woman and Shepherd is an oft-married sort of jaded Romantic--well, anything could happen.The four feature length mysteries themselves are pretty straight-forward.  No new ground here.  But as in most police procedurals, it's the style, the flair, the inventiveness that really counts.  In that regard, THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES is still finding its feet.Bravo though for showing the world that New Zealand is more than just a location for fantasy films.  As the show is being renewed for a second season, viewers can only hope that it will continue to evolve as a good show in its own right, and not one that relies on comparisons that might show up its weaknesses rather than its strengths.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYTQAOSBCN7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKX6V9U#wasThisHelpful","R2JYTQAOSBCN7C","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are some television series that evolve with such naturalness that viewing them is like spending time with an old friend. FOYLE'S WAR is such a show. Series 8 continues Foyle's transition from police officer to MI-5 operative, giving Foyle the opportunity to serve in the capacity he so dearly wanted during World War II. Now, as the Cold War descends and new enemies make themselves known, Foyle (and his trusty driver, Sam--played by Honeysuckle Weeks) is engaged in solving mysteries in some ways far more disturbing than anything he encountered during the war.For example, the rise of anti-Semitism in England just after the war is a blight on that country's history that is little-known today. What a powerful dramatic device to help fuel the plot of one of the episodes. Drawing from historical incidents and seamlessly weaving them into each episode's story is a gift that writer/creator Antony Horowitz utilizes again and again throughout this series. Some of the facts he unveils and employs are jaw-dropping. Others, such as the ruthless pursuit of oil are as familiar as today's headlines. The episode Trespass is built around a high-level Palestinian conference that is startlingly contemporary.At the centre of it all is Michael Kitchen's unflappable Christopher Foyle: stalwart, reliable, sensitive. Precisely the type of chap you want to see taking charge and keeping the bad guys at bay. Kitchen is supported by a team of exemplary actors, all of whom were champing at the bit to appear in such an admired show and to work with the legendary Mr. Kitchen.Over two hours of extra features remind us of the impeccable attention to detail that goes into making this show. From getting the costumes perfect to finding the right vehicles to drumming up the most accurate props, no detail is overlooked as an impressive team of artists comes together to transport the viewer into another time and place.A lovely bit of casting sees John Mahoney, so well-known for his role on the long-running sit com Frazier, in the episode High Castle. In one of the DVD set's impressive array of extra features Mahoney talks about his admiration for FOYLE'S WAR and the great excitement he felt in being asked to appear in it. Mahoney is English born and has a special interest in returning to the U.K. to work when he can.FOYLE'S WAR has apparently run its course. It was announced in January of 2015 that no more episodes would be produced. But this isn't the first time the show has been cancelled. In 2008 it was announced that no more episodes would be made, but numerous complaints led to a reversal of this decision. Will FOYLE'S WAR return?Meantime, Series 8 is to be savoured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARP0MV8UOE93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG6IESM#wasThisHelpful","R3ARP0MV8UOE93","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"World War One The People's Story is a brilliant, fresh take on the Great War that is essential viewing for anyone interested in war-themed documentaries. What is perhaps more surprising is that it is also essential viewing for anyone interested in historical drama, as well as straight-forward, true accounting of lives lived and sometimes lost during one of history's most tragic and senseless conflicts.Using a combination of rare historical footage (as well as some familiar images) with actual letters, diaries and memoirs from the period, World War One The People's Story wisely downplays the political and military overview of the years 1914-1918 and focuses on individuals. The effect is immediately engaging and intimate and the viewer can't help but be drawn into each story being told. Amazingly, this is achieved through actors speaking the source material directly into the camera (as well as occasionally in voice-over). For example, one feels for Reg, the upbeat, kindly young soldier from the slums who faithfully writes home to his mother. When his life is in danger one immediately feels a sense of dread as to his possible fate. Or Hubbins, the newly-married artillery officer whose frank, funny and deeply personal letters to his young bride will have you smiling at their playful use of language (""Hubbins longs to hold close his small wife,"" etc.). The brilliant performances of the mostly unfamiliar actors range from amusing to frustrating to absolutely heart-breaking.There isn't a false note in this four episode series which manages to cover the first patriotic furor that saw hundreds of thousands of voluntary enlistments at the beginning of the war to the frustrations of conscription as the years dragged on to the impact on the suffragist movement and even to the earliest serious attempts at reconstructive plastic surgery on the thousands of maimed soldiers who survived the carnage but whose scars threatened to make a return to normal life impossible. What is even more astounding is the occasional post script to a sequence which indicates that the letters we've just heard were only recently discovered, either in someone's attic, or packed away in a box somewhere. What is so close to being lost to history is brought vividly to life and serves as a vibrant reminder that so much of our past, much of it personal and therefore so much more accessible than the dry facts of academia, is still out there, awaiting discovery and, hopefully, preservation for generations to come. The tragedy of war is rarely better conveyed than when it is recorded in the words of a young soldier to his sweetheart, in a letter that has been deemed worthy at one time of being kept as the last link to a lost love.The success of this series is found in its format. The simple, direct readings of the actors into the camera is surprisingly effective. Despite some familiar faces such as Brian Cox and Romola Garai, most of the actors are unfamiliar to North American audiences. This makes them even more believable as their characters. When these living, breathing people from World War One emerge to tell their stories, one can only sit up and take notice. Human beings now are the same as they were then.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMREB6CQ05FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG6IEDM#wasThisHelpful","R1TMREB6CQ05FF","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Midsomer Murders is a veritable institution in Great Britain, a program so beloved that it invites comparison to ""the good old days"" when families would ritually gather around the radio (then, later, the telly) to enjoy their favourite program. So how does a show so enjoyed by so many stay fresh, while at the same time maintaining many of the elements that helped establish it as a perennial?Change is inevitable, and necessary, but perhaps the answer lies in understanding the delicate balance between what can and should be changed and what must be left well enough alone. Judging by the five episodes that make up the latest DVD release of this series, the makers of Midsomer Murders have found that balance.Usually, Midsomer Murders is released in sets of four, sometimes three episodes. Set 25 includes five episodes for the simple reason that the last episode of this three disc box set is the landmark one hundredth episode of the series, an important milestone indeed!Also of note, and arguably the biggest change here, is the departure of Jason Hughes as DS Ben Jones and the arrival of his replacement, Gwylym Lee as DS Charlie Nelson.  Lee has a laid back, almost laconic quality while at the same time projecting the desire to please his new boss.  Lee is a terrific actor and the transition from the much-loved Jason Hughes is as smooth as it can be.Sykes, the Barnaby's adorable Jack Russell terrier, continues to evolve into a wonderful supporting character always good for a laugh. In this set he even pulls at our heart strings when he appears to become ill, when in truth he is displaying some pre-baby anxiety. And of course, the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Barnaby's new-born is a touch of colour that just wouldn't have been possible back when the great John Nettles was spear-heading the show.The mysteries are all first rate, and the special, 100th episode sees a collaboration with Danish police which is as much a nod to the recent success and quality of some recent police procedurals from the Scandinavian countries as it is an opportunity to enjoy a literal change of scenery. Some first-rate Danish actors, such as Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, from such recent Danish hits like Borgen, also provide some temporary new blood.If there is anything to fault in these five additions to the Midsomer Murders canon, I fail to see it. Midsomer Murders fits like a well-worn pair of shoes, but without the need for re-soling.

"CESARE MORI THE IRON PREFECT is a true story about an Italian policeman who took on the scourge of the Mafia. This recent mini-series from Italy is one of the latest acquisitions for distribution in North America by MHz International Mystery, a company that is fast making its name by making such quality European programming available.Running approximately 200 minutes, the series attempts an epic scale in the telling of its tale which only partly succeeds, but when it does succeed, it really succeeds! Much of the credit for this goes to Swiss actor Vincent Perez in the title role. Perez is a distinguished, theatre trained actor whose impressive film credits include Queen Margot, with Isabelle Adjani and Cyrano de Bergerac, with Gerard Depardieu. In other words, Perez knows his way around period pieces and lends a special bearing that makes him wholly believable in such roles.Without Perez' presence the series might've been strictly B material but once again the validity of star power proves what a difference it can make. When a star as photogenic, as grounded as Perez is front and centre, the hub of the dramatic wheel is firmly established. Everything revolves around him and keeps things in perspective. Thus, when moments in part one almost threaten to slide into pseudo-Spaghetti Western territory, particularly with the Morricone-like guitar riffs of composer Pino Donaggio on the soundtrack, Perez brings the story and the style back to where it ought to be. And Mori's story is important, historically, as is anyone's who has stood up to corruption and violence.This is not to say the real Mori was a saint, but the occasional softening of his ""iron fist"" approach is acceptable in telling his story, if only to remind the viewer that he is the good guy here and not the iconoclastic Clint Eastwood character of the Dollar films, for example.There are some wonderful moments of inspired artistry throughout. The most vivid example that comes to mind is when Mori and his wife adopt a young orphan boy. Unable to have children of their own, little Saro brings a great deal of comfort to Mori's wife, Angelina. In one poignant scene, Saro has a nightmare. Angelina comes to him and props him up on the bed with her. Their positioning almost resembles a birthing position and is a moment of real beauty in a story that is mostly violent.The shared stars of the series, along with Perez, are the wonderful Italian locations and the costuming. There isn't a false note anywhere to be discerned. Even when occasional lapses in direction keep CESARE MORI THE IRON PREFECT from being a masterpiece, the series manages to convince and convey its setting and importance realistically.Admittedly not as polished cinematically as some of the outstanding European programming MHz is offering, CESARE MORI still manages to stand on its own as an important addition to their ever-growing library of entertaining alternative television.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7COFHF14C8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LW8APIQ#wasThisHelpful","RF7COFHF14C8O","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even better than its predecessor, LINE OF DUTY Series 2 has expanded from five episodes to six and every minute is needed to tell its gripping story. The police anti-corruption unit is back, this time investigating Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton who has survived a police convoy ambush. In the excellent bonus features there is an interview with Keeley Hawes, who plays DI Denton. She describes her initial reading of the script as totally absorbing and leaving her uncertain until late in the last episode if she was guilty or not!That is testimony to the superb writing of Jed Mercurio (who also wrote the first series and will write the next two commissions). How do you take the police genre on television and inject it with new vitality, with plot twists you just don't see coming and moral ambiguity without losing a moral centre? LINE OF DUTY does just that. It's an amazing show.Keeley Hawes has often been associated with glamour roles but if anyone was ever ""de-glammed"" for a part, it is her. She is stunning in her portrayal of plainness and in her incredible courage to play against her image. She is, in short, a great actress and if this performance doesn't propel her into the elite of actresses on British television, I don't know what will. How it may or may not evolve into a film career of equal importance remains to be seen, but her portrayal of Lindsay Denton is award-worthy a dozen times over.It is also a pleasure to see Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure back and their characters further developed, even when ""Britain's Sweetheart"", Jessica Raine makes a surprise appearance, miles away from her wonderful leading role on Call The Midwife. She almost unseats Vicky McClure... but there will be no spoilers here.The acting, like the writing and direction, is flawless. The shaky camera work is toned down, which is a huge improvement. Some of the supporting roles, such as Craig Parkinson and Neil Morrissey are absolutely gripping.LINE OF DUTY Series 2 makes a very strong case for its claim by many to be the best police show ever made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ROK6MB48LII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWXI2EU#wasThisHelpful","R16ROK6MB48LII","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LINE OF DUTY is being hailed as arguably the best cop show of all time. While it is perhaps too soon to make that judgment (after all, longevity should be part of the consideration) this reviewer found it gripping, enthralling and highly original. The perspective the show takes is ""who polices the police"" and while I am not a police basher by any means, it has been proven again and again (unfortunately) that sometimes corruption happens where it simply shouldn't. Thus the need for internal investigations, sometimes even of the most respected law enforcers.Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates is one of the best--according to his record. But does that make him suspicious? Superintendent Ted Hastings, the head of police anti-corruption unit, thinks so. What unfolds is a fascinating roller coaster ride of did he or didn't he, how could this or that happen and what's it all about, Alfie.The only drawback to this powerful five episode drama is the overuse of shaky camera work, especially in action scenes. We've seen this all before and it is nauseating. Fortunately the show is otherwise so good that these over the top moments are soon forgotten.Former professional footballer (soccer) Martin Compston has made a remarkable transition from one profession to another and is excellent as DS Steve Arnott, the anti-corruption officer front and centre for most of the game. He is matched by the extraordinarily beautiful Vicky McClure as his partner on the case. (Oh, those blue eyes! Cerulean pools to die for...)Like many of the edgier shows on British television there is a modicum of sex and bad language. This is mentioned out of respect for those who factor such things into their viewing hours.LINE OF DUTY was a huge hit when it premiered. It is easy to see why. And guess what, Series Two is even better... And the show is still in production at the time of this writing... Isn't it great to be left wanting more?This is precisely the kind of show that leaves its mark on you in that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347N49NYB3G13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7AM2YW#wasThisHelpful","R347N49NYB3G13","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The references to Greek mythology are one of the more intriguing aspects of THE EAGLE, a brilliant Danish police procedural produced in 2004 and now available on DVD here in North America. The more I watch these programs (mostly from Scandinavia, but also from France, Italy, Germany, etc.) that are released here by MHz International Mystery the more impressed I become by the high quality of virtually everything they produce--and I haven't even got round to some of the more well-known titles such as THE KILLING and WALLANDER. Like Acorn Media, which specializes in British mysteries, MHz International Mystery specializes in programming from Europe. Both companies have carved a niche for themselves and it has got to the point where virtually anything released on their label is guaranteed to be good.Honestly, I'm not trying to write a commercial here, but for fans of this kind of programming (intelligent, well-produced alternatives to American shows) this is a god-send.But back to THE EAGLE. Self described as ""a crime odyssey"", season one is indeed an epic journey as the crack crime-solving team headed by star investigator Hallgrim Hallgrimsson is formed then finds themselves chasing and foiling organized crime not only in Scandinavia, but in other parts of Europe as well. The budget for this show must have been considerable, as they filmed in various parts of northern Europe, from Berlin in Germany to Copenhagen in Denmark to Oslo in Norway and other locations including Iceland and Russia.This show has style. First off, the protagonist, Hallgrimsson, is nicknamed ""The Eagle"" because of his ability to rise above everything and see the big picture, which makes him such a good mind for solving crimes. But at the same time, Hallgrimsson is clearly haunted by some traumatic childhood incident that we catch glimpses of in recurring flashbacks. Nothing new in that, but the way his introspective memories counterpoint against his crime solving perspective is a nice twist on the brilliant but troubled detective. Second, speaking of style, there is one really cool gun battle that references the great Russian classic film Battleship Potemkin, when, in the midst of gunfire, a woman loses control of her baby carriage, which rolls into harm's way. The good guy in the gun battle (one of Hallgrimsson's co-horts) manages to dive in front of the carriage and halt its descent into carnage, all the while carrying on with the gunfight. If this sounds familiar, it's because director Brian De Palma did the same thing in the more recent The Untouchables, with Andy Garcia being the hero of the day.Hallgrimsson's colleagues are a real hodgepodge of personalities. Here is one of the main differences one might find between THE EAGLE and any number of American police procedurals: not everybody is trying to be cool, nor do we have twenty somethings trying to be believable as forensic experts. For this reviewer at any rate, this is a breath of fresh air.THE EAGLE won an International Emmy from the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for best non-American television drama series in 2005. Two more seasons were produced, which means we have a lot more to look forward to from THE EAGLE.I can hardly wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKJMCFMYUCCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLI7IKU#wasThisHelpful","R3SKJMCFMYUCCF","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kevin Whately, best known as Detective Sergeant Lewis opposite the late John Thaw on Inspector Morse, then later in his own spin-off series as Detective Inspector Lewis, took time between to star in this short-lived but entertaining series THE BROKER'S MAN, playing an ex-cop turned insurance investigator.As Jimmy Griffin, Whately plays a likable fellow who needs to grow up, especially when it comes to his personal relationships. The nice thing about this series is that he does, in fact, grow up, re-establishing his relationship with his wife and children. In his professional life, Jimmy is a little less successful than he becomes with his family, but nonetheless manages to keep his head above water. This is, in part, due to the dedication of his long-suffering associates, Vinnie and Harriet (Potter, no less). The interaction between Jimmy and his two ""families"", coupled with some genuinely good stories, makes THE BROKER'S MAN good, though not particularly outstanding, entertainment.Series Two, which ends with Jimmy on much more solid ground, maritally, is better than series one, in large part to the re-casting of aforesaid Harriet. Charlotte Bellamy, as Harriet (replacing Sarah-Jane Potts in the first series) is a dynamic actress who adds more colour and humour to the role of Jimmy's associate, managing to break free of the ""put the kettle on and make the tea"" role she was often relegated to in the first series.Like so many shows that revolve around a central character, THE BROKER'S MAN stands or falls on the charisma and capability of its star and Kevin Whately delivers. His weary sort of Everyman appeal is harder to understand for North American audiences who expect good looks and perfect teeth, but in Great Britain he is especially loved.While THE BROKER'S MAN lasted for only two series, it was the just the right amount. Taken for what it is, a change from the police procedural perspective, it still manages to present good mysteries with a breath of fresh air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G876IGBE2XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCA32P8#wasThisHelpful","R5G876IGBE2XK","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love HELL ON WHEELS. It just keeps getting better and better. In a day when a good Western is hard to come by, HELL ON WHEELS slakes the thirst of many who crave a good Oater. There continues to be an epic, poetic feel to the development of this series as characters grow in ways we would never expect. Others, most notably Colm Meaney's Thomas Durant, stay as consistently rotten as we want them to be, while still others, like Christopher Heyerdahl's The Swede transform in ways beyond our wildest expectations.This is one of the great aspects of this show, it is so character-driven. Yes, it has plenty of gun-play (with apparently computerized gun shots, requiring the actors to hold their guns as if they are really shooting, then ""act"" the recoil, all the while avoiding the temptation to say ""bang!""--this from a colleague who worked on the show) and plenty of other action: fist fights, domestic fireworks, full scale Indian attacks, etc. But all of these Western accoutrements are made all the more meaningful by the participation of characters we have come to care about, root for or despise, depending on who they are.The truly outstanding way in which HELL ON WHEELS continues to grow and be marketed is that the DVD/Blu-ray releases are so thoughtfully prepared. Aside from the nice packaging and the enjoyment of watching the ten episodes that comprise each season without commercial interruption, there is a train load of extras in each season's release. True to form, the discs for The Complete Third Season come with the following extras:A Look at Season 3Where Season 2 Left OffFour Behind-the-Scenes FeaturettesTen ""Inside the Episodes"" FeaturettesThese are not extras for the sake of extras, either. Rather they assume that the viewer cares about the show as much as the filmmakers do. Almost everyone seems to appear in the extras, whether its Common giving a tour of the set, or Anson Mount ruminating on the journey his character is taking, or the producers talking about the vision and direction of the show. And of course the purpose of all this is to prime audiences for the impending return of the series: Season Four starts at the beginning of August.As a fan of HELL ON WHEELS all I can say is I'm saddled up and waiting to go. I think you will be, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1BR8N3T0GEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAPC860#wasThisHelpful","R2E1BR8N3T0GEU","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The French language police series NICOLAS LE FLOCH first box set that has just been released in North America at the time of this writing is an excellent, beautifully produced alternative to most police procedural dramas on television today. The difference? NICOLAS LE FLOCH is set during the reign of Louis XV (and, apparently in later episodes not included here, Louis XVI). This immediately makes it unique, but does it make it good?Some of the best period films ever made, including today, are the product of French cinema. Films such as Queen Margot and Henry of Navarre come to mind, or miniseries such as Gerard Depardieu's definitive The Count of Monte Cristo. There is a tone, a flavour, a believability about these and so many other French masterpieces that it is no surprise that NICOLAS LE FLOCH continues that tradition. The locations, the costumes, the wigs, the makeup--everything contributes to a series of 6 films (all feature length) that demonstrate quality and care. In the first film, at the beginning, the camera pans amongst a group of aristocrats. We see jewels, fine details on costumes, extreme makeup including powdered faces and rouged lips (on the men!) and painted on beauty marks on the women, and then someone smiles and we see rotting teeth beneath the veneer. That hooked me.The first two mysteries seemed a little slow going at first. Perhaps the necessary absence of car chases and constantly ringing cell phones--as in most police dramas--affected the pacing? Or could it be the inevitable exposition that comes with a new series and a new set of characters? Be that as it may, the subsequent episodes more than made up for any initial lag. After all, maintaining a brisk pace in a police drama is essential. The viewer must get a sense that time is critical, that the policeman in charge--in this case, Le Floch--is under the gun to produce results or face the consequences from his superiors.And of course, Le Floch gets the job done. Though not without stopping for a little dalliance here and there. After all, he is French!To date, ten NICOLAS LE FLOCH films have been made. Six of them are included in this first box set. They just get better and better and more imaginative, too. One episode sees Le Floch sword fighting with an unseen spectre. It's very well done when it could've easily looked silly. In another episode, an evil count, whose impotence leads him to extreme measures to compensate for his lost sexual prowess, involves Le Floch in what is clearly an homage to the famous story/film The Most Dangerous Game.One other observation about the incredible attention to detail on display. There is a scene in a later episode when Le Floch enters the room of one of his acquaintances who is in the middle of powdering his wigs. The wigs are mounted on wig stands and are being positively drenched with white powder. To avoid breathing in the powder, the man Le Floch has come to see is holding a long cone device over his face, with two eye holes to allow him to see what he is doing without having to inhale the powder! It is priceless, amusing details such as this that make NICOLAS LE FLOCH a superior program.Another factor in the success of this series is that the actors are basically all unknown here in North America. This always works in a film's favour in my view, as it makes their appearance in a period setting more convincing. This is not to say that any of the actors are less than outstanding. Jerome Robart as Nicolas is especially good. He is alternately dashing, pensive, romantic, impulsive and, with his roguish grin, just a touch cheeky.Ultimately, when watching something completely new with the thought of setting down one's thoughts about it later, two questions must be asked: did I enjoy it and why? and do I want to see more? In the case of NICOLAS LE FLOCH, the answer to both questions is a resounding yes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP03PW82LBZUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L98QDM6#wasThisHelpful","RP03PW82LBZUQ","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the reasons MIDSOMER MURDERS has been so loved by its loyal fan base for so long is because it is so reliable. Reliability, while it implies familiarity, can also encompass change. At key intervals in its production history, MIDSOMER MURDERS has made changes that might have signaled the death knell for lesser loved programs. Losing the likable Daniel Casey as Sgt Gavin Troy after almost 30 episodes is the first example. Troy's interaction with his superior DCI Tom Barnaby set the tone of the series as much as did the bizarre murders and hint of rot under the idyllic Englishness of Midsomer county. After Casey's departure, the handful of episodes featuring John Hopkins as Troy's replacement, Sgt Dan Scott, maintained the status quo, but did little more, simply because Hopkins left the show before a comparable chemistry was established between his character and Barnaby. Had it not been for John Nettles' steady presence, the show might well have buckled under the weight of this interruption in character continuity. On the other hand, it helped stimulate a curiosity about who would next be helping Tom Barnaby solve his cases. This helped loyal fans adopt a wait and see what happens next attitude. Not a bad thing for a mystery program.Next up, the arrival of Jason Hughes as Sgt Ben Jones, while not as unsettling as Dan Scott's replacing Sgt Troy, was nonetheless another adjustment viewers' had to make. This time though, the change was almost like a breath of fresh air as the two main characters got to know one another. It didn't take long for Jones to become popular with audiences, to the point where he seriously challenged and in some peoples' opinion won first place in terms of popularity amongst the three Sgts thus far partnered with Tom Barnaby.Then came the ultimate test: could the show survive the departure of John Nettles? Wisely, Nettles recognized the reality that he himself (and thus Tom Barnaby) had reached retirement age. Should he not quit while still believable in the role and before he burned out? Equally wisely, Nettles announced his decision to leave MIDSOMER MURDERS well in advance of his actual departure. This allowed faithful viewers to adjust to the coming upheaval. It was as much Nettles' perceived calmness about his decision to leave the show than anything else that helped people make the adjustment. ""Everything will be fine,"" he seemed to be saying. Everything else was to remain: the beautiful locations, the almost constant sunlight, the eccentric characters, the imaginative deaths, etc. ""And what's more, a wonderful replacement will be found,"" we were reassured.And indeed it came to pass. Neil Dudgeon was introduced in such a way that his easy relationship with ""cousin Tom"" immediately dispelled any concerns of major revamping. There were differences in the two men, true, but enough similarities to take us comfortably through the transition. Nettles departure from the show in the episode Fit for Murder was low-key, classy and dignified. We didn't want him to go, but we wished him well and wanted the best for him. What's more we wanted the best for his successor, cousin John. Not many show's can pull this off and maintain its popularity. All in all, the major changes that have occurred on MIDSOMER MURDERS have all had positive repercussions and in hindsight, might even look like strokes of genius, to keep the show not just afloat, but continuing on its astounding voyage.Now, after the last episode of this current set of three episodes being released in North America, MIDSOMER MURDERS is poised for further change. Jason Hughes' character, Sgt Ben Jones, is leaving the show and a fourth Barnaby associate has begun his association with the series. We won't get to see him until the next set of MIDSOMER MURDERS is available over here, but apparently the new episodes already broadcast in the U.K. bode well for yet another timely change in the life of this great show.Of the three episodes in this current set, what accolades can be given that haven't already been said of previous episodes? They're all good, with the third, Schooled for Murder, being particularly entertaining. Sykes the dog features in all three episodes but especially in the last, to the point where he perhaps inspired his own biography, the sole extra feature included in this set. Sykes' contribution in Schooled for Murder is laugh out loud funny. It leaves you craving more MIDSOMER, even when the winds of change are again ablowin'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTH3OPHU6WN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWXI2RM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTH3OPHU6WN9","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interestingly, novelist Chris Mullin's novel A Very British Coup, written in 1982, was adapted for television in 1988 and set in the very near future (1991-92). The miniseries won a number of awards and is still highly regarded today. SECRET STATE, a new miniseries from 2012, describes itself as being ""inspired by"" Mullin's original novel. Instead of being a remake of A Very British Coup, SECRET STATE takes its basic theme of political corruption and updates it. Political corruption and its relationship with big business and the military is not a new idea. Why then, is any reference made to the novel which isn't really a source novel? Is this ""name dropping"" for the sake of piquing interest in the new series? Twenty years is a long time in television years, so there is arguably little value in referencing the previous series and the novel upon which it is based.All this to say, in this reviewer's opinion, SECRET STATE stands on its own as an excellent political thriller in the vein of Seven Days In May, if one insists on referencing previous films that address corruption at its highest level.But again, there really is no need to reference. With a powerhouse cast led by the always simmering Gabriel Byrne and the never-quite-sure-what-he's-up-to Charles Dance, SECRET STATE is highly watchable from its opening scene of destruction to its closing shot of the same destruction serving as a metaphor for a much greater political and moral destruction.The script is top notch and the actors bite into it with relish. Layers of plot development fall naturally into place and the introduction of characters evolves at a pace that is beautifully calculated to leave the viewer going ""oh, now who's this?"" With a wheel of dramatis personae so rich in variety, it requires a particularly strong presence at the hub and that is precisely what Gabriel Byrne provides. Seemingly physically large to begin with, (though he's only 5'10"") with an eagle-like nose that bespeaks dignity and strength in stillness, Byrne stays atop of the heap of people vying for our attention and sympathy. This is one of the true mysteries of the motion picture/television industry and one that is so readily taken for granted. It is the mystery of Star Power. You either have it or you don't. Byrne has it.Apparently, Byrne hates being described as ""brooding and intense"". It is one of the great curiosities for actors who play parts so effectively that people impose upon them the characteristics of parts they have played. It's really the ultimate compliment but for some, like Byrne, who have achieved a certain level of international success, it becomes tiresome. Be that as it may, Byrne is the man at the centre of SECRET STATE and not just the physical centre. He's also the moral centre. This is where all political stories ultimately must venture, into the Arena of Morality. As an elected official--elected because people put their trust in you to do the right thing--making the right decisions is believed to be inherent to the position. And yet how well we know that power corrupts. Perhaps the question asked in SECRET STATE is: will Byrne's character succumb to this inevitable crumbling away of moral integrity?There are certainly enough pressures. Whether it be shark-like political opponents like Rupert Graves or Sylvestra la Touzel, or a well-meaning but ultimately damaging journalist like Gina McKee, or a hard-nosed general like Nicholas Farrell, Byrne's Prime Minister is constantly under the gun. When asked at one point if he is having an affair with journalist McKee, he responds ""When would I have time?""As events come to a head, Byrne delivers a speech in the House of Commons that is quite unlike anything ever heard before or since. It makes for a stunning, inevitable conclusion to a compelling series that will have you hanging on every word Byrne utters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UP8Q6DZ10PCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW3ST90#wasThisHelpful","R2UP8Q6DZ10PCU","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CASE HISTORIES, after a long absence it seems, is back. Series star Jason Isaacs has been busy working in America the past few years and appears to be settled there for the present. When he was formally approached to revisit the role of Jackson Brodie, his world-weary character in CASE HISTORIES, he actually turned it down. Not out of disinterest, but for domestic reasons. With his family well-settled in the U.S., he didn't want to uproot them or require them to move back to the U.K. on a temporary basis. Fortunately, Isaacs has a very understanding wife! She insisted he sign on for series two. That's a good thing, because Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brodie has managed to carve his own niche in the detective genre. Without his star power, I suspect CASE HISTORIES would be just another detective show. With Isaacs at the forefront though, it is much more than that.Nonetheless, Isaacs would be the first to insist the pedigree of the show begins with the writing. The novels of Kate Atkinson served as the source for the first series and the first episode of series two. Having exhausted the source novels for the moment, there was some concern as to whether the continuity of the show would be compromised by having scripts by other writers created solely for the series and not published first as novels. Fortunately Ms Atkinson was on hand to tweak the scripts written from scratch and offer reassurances. The quality of the writing has been maintained. The choice to make the episodes of series two 90 minutes each as opposed to the two-part format of series one is also an improvement. The stories are more succinct and the pacing tighter. When you consider that CASE HISTORIES isn't really about the cases but about the characters, this is a significant improvement.You see, CASE HISTORIES, at its very core, is primarily a character study. And while many examples exist in the detective genre of the battle-scarred protagonist with a destructive tendency and a checkered past, few portray it as well as Jason Isaacs. His Jackson Brodie is a curious mixture of qualities which lead him to make the wrong decisions in his personal life and the right decisions in his professional life. Here's a great quote from Jason Isaacs himself, describing Brodie: ""He's a very noble and fearless individual and incredibly instinctive when it comes to peeling back the layers of what's holding other people back, and not just finding out when and why a crime was committed, but how people are crippled or imprisoned by their pasts…""This ""incredible instinct"" when it comes to helping people is the direct result of his own troubled past, a past he is constantly trying to reconcile within himself. This makes what could be a cliche (the ""battle-scarred protagonist"" etc.) a defining characteristic of Brodie and a fundamental element to each storyline.The quality of CASE HISTORIES continues with its brilliant cinematography on location in Edinburgh, Scotland and its rainy, Celtic moodiness. For example, quite often characters are shown against windows or other brightly lit backgrounds, suggesting that their shadowed faces are a metaphor for their shadowy circumstances, and that happiness, resolution, contentment, etc. is, for the moment at least, just out of reach. There is genuine artistry on display in CASE HISTORIES at every level of production, an attraction that helped to entice a number of outstanding actors to appear in the second series. Victoria Wood, for example, best known in the U.K. as a comedienne, is outstanding in the first episode, creating a wonderful character whose pain is just below her wise-cracking surface and who manages to find redemption when Brodie helps her cover up a legally dicey but morally right decision. This episode also sees Brodie acquire, at least temporarily, a dog, who adds some smiles to the goings on. The manner in which Brodie acquires the dog is a defining moment in understanding his character. He does what every one of us who love animals would aspire to do in a similar circumstance. No spoilers here, though. You'll have to find out for yourself.The second and third episodes do not miss a beat in furthering our understanding of Brodie. Given that these are the two original scripts in this series and not adapted from novels, that says a lot. And what's best about all this is that by the end of the third episode we are primed to want to know more about Brodie. A third series has not yet been announced at the time of this writing, but we can only hope that it will materialize.If there is one element of this show that has proven to be divisive among its audience it is the use of background music. Specifically songs. It is now a tired and worn cliche to see and hear in any number of dramas being produced today a montage-like sequence at the end of the episode where a song is played over snippets of scenes which help to wrap up the story. CASE HISTORIES takes this by now annoying feature one step further and inserts song bits throughout the episodes. I understand these are reflective of Brodie's love of country music (by nature inclined to themes about heartbreak and sadness) but enough is enough! As much as I love this show and stand by my rating, this one trying aspect almost had me running screaming from the room whenever it occurred.Please, Mr Isaacs, pull back on this. The country song as Greek Chorus no longer works (if it ever did).The behind-the-scenes interviews on this two DVD set from Acorn are fun and one comes away particularly impressed by the intelligence of child actor Millie Innes, who plays Brodie's daughter, Marlee. She is especially effective in episode two when she comes back from New Zealand to live with her dad.CASE HISTORIES is most welcome after its extended time away and we can only hope for further Jackson Brodie adventures in the near future. But ditch the music, please!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZZLUY18EZ11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A27OJ94#wasThisHelpful","R22ZZLUY18EZ11","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It could be said the Brits produce programs that examine world history better than anyone else, at least in the English speaking world. Their own history reaches so far back, even to Biblical times (the Romans in Britain), so it's no wonder, really. Add to that centuries of superior education and scholarship combined with contemporary technical skill and experience and you have an almost perfect mix of ingredients to create documentaries that are informative, educational, interesting, entertaining and enlightening.But there is still a magic ingredient that not all of these like-minded programs have: the perfect host.Well DAVID SUCHET IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ST. PAUL has the perfect host--David Suchet himself. Part brilliant classical actor, part TV icon, part enthusiastic Christian and part eager student, Suchet brings a life and energy to his role as Presenter in this wonderful 2-part documentary that is seldom seen in other similar programs. Looking substantially different from his most famous role, that of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, Suchet strides where Poirot would waddle, emotes where Poirot would ruminate, and enthuses where Poirot would explain. Much as I love Suchet as Poirot, I think I love Suchet as Suchet a whole lot better.The series really begins with what proves to be its underlying current, Suchet's fascination with St. Paul, not only as a towering historical figure, second only to Jesus in importance to the Bible's New Testament narrative, but as a potential role that he might play one day. This is what gets Suchet's creative juices flowing. Confronted with a fresco of Paul, Suchet suggests that he looks quite like Paul. In another segment he reads from a non-Biblical source what is quite possibly the only existing physical description of Paul and the similarities between the two are startling. Suchet could indeed make a convincing St. Paul should the right production ever come along. Consequently everything Suchet discovers about Paul and his world such as existing roads where Paul likely tread, or amphitheatres and small rooms where he likely preached, feeds Suchet's enthusiasm to know more about him. This is the mind of a great actor at work, gathering information about a potential role, absorbing details and delighting in sensory experiences (such as touching the foundation stones of the temple in Jerusalem, where his glee is almost child-like).Single-minded as this may seem, Suchet is also broad-minded enough to recognize that literally every detail he can gather is important whether it is specifically useful to his actor's research or not. Thus he takes his time speaking with Jews and Muslims to learn about their perspectives about Paul. He also speaks with a number of scholars and clerics and finds even his own long-held view of some of Paul's teachings being reconsidered. In short, Suchet seeks to be as comprehensive as he can be in his search for a better overall understanding of St. Paul. We are all the richer for it, for Suchet is a supremely gifted communicator. When he reads passages of Scripture the oft-repeated words take on a new life as only a classical actor can bring to such language. That is why, arguably, classically trained actors generally make the finest Scripture readers, especially when they invest the text with the conviction that is born of genuine faith.Ultimately, in programs such as these, there are two criteria by which they must be judged. Number one: what have I learned? and number two: I don't want it to end. Obviously if one feels they have learned pretty much all there is to know about the subject in the time allotted, it cancels out the possibility of number two, because of course it can't go on if there is no ground left to cover! Despite that quandary, I didn't want it to end and I did feel I'd learned an awful lot about St. Paul. Perhaps the next logical step is to see Suchet in this long-desired role after all? With the recent plethora of Biblical movies being produced it is hardly outside the realm of possibility.I honestly can't think of a better sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264E75LSHSQ9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW3SM1A#wasThisHelpful","R264E75LSHSQ9H","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Theatrical innovator Peter Brook is still, at age 89, exploring new ideas and seeking new artistic heights. His is a career unparalleled and unique in the world theatre scene. For although Brook is born and bred English, he has been based in Paris since 1970. Working multi and internationally, Brook has amassed a resume equally steeped in the classics (most notably Shakespeare and opera) as well as work based on myth and legend to contemporary issues and humanitarian causes.Long recognized as a revered and respected teacher, any record of his innovative and introspective teaching style is to be welcomed with open arms by performers and directors in a variety of disciplines as well as educators and teachers of drama.The image of a tightrope is arguably the perfect analogy for capturing the essence of true performance. Part risk, part showiness, part thrill-seeking, part life or death, artists who make themselves supremely vulnerable in performance are those we most admire and love. To accomplish this wonder--and performance at its highest level is a wonder--the artist must realize a level of concentration that is sometime understood as being ""in the zone"". Athletes often refer to this mysterious place where everything seems to come together and one needn't think so much as react to that which one is encountering. It is almost a spiritual place of achievement, always sought, seldom fully realized. Brook's simple exercise of walking the imaginary tightrope, while fully committing to the belief that one is truly as exposed and vulnerable as one would be above the ground without a safety net, is a brilliant way of focusing the mind and body of the artist undertaking the exercise.The film's director, Simon Brook, (Peter's son) wisely chooses to stay out of the way and let the exercise, the students' participation and his father's commentary speak for themselves. At the same time, Brook the younger manages to be close enough to capture the intense concentration being sought by the students as well as the moments of levity and joy of discovery as the international assortment of performers experiment and give themselves over to working with the Master.As a film, it is hardly innovative, but THE TIGHTROPE has incredible value as a record of Brook's relaxed, penetrating style of teaching, of his commitment to realizing the art of theatre as a collective experience between audience and performer. Performing artists will ""get it"" a lot more than people who have less interest in live performance. Therefore the recommendation here is for those who will benefit from seeing Brook's approach captured so intimately and simply.There is a nice selection of interviews with class participants as an extra bonus feature. This helps to clarify the importance of Brook's work to those who are most affected by it--the artists themselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPRLQOPLE9TG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT6QD9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1SPRLQOPLE9TG","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Marvin remains, for many fans of classic Hollywood movies, one of the most compelling of screen presences. Dwayne Epstein's wonderful, comprehensive biography reminds us why. Taking time to establish Marvin's background (a somewhat difficult childhood--particularly his relationship with his mother; his time in the Marines) the reader is enlightened as to what was behind Marvin's captivating power as a performer. An early anecdote about Marvin encountering the pompous acting guru Lee Strasberg says it all. While it can't be quoted here, it shows how Marvin would not kow-tow to anyone, even as an unknown and struggling young actor. He knew ""truth"" when it came to acting and didn't need a lot of esoteric (and misinformed) feedback to realize it.Marvin saw fighting and death up close and personal in WWII. Yet there is an hilarious anecdote about Marvin's surprising squeamishness while in conversation with his wife's obstetrician after the birth of the Marvins' first child. Details such as these make LEE MARVIN: POINT BLANK a fun read, as well as an informative one.A lot of space is given to comments by Marvin's former colleagues who remind us of his incredible gift for projecting masculinity and violence on screen. When directors like Edward Dmytryk speak about Marvin's ability to wear a uniform in a realistic fashion (a tear here, a broken boot lace there) one realizes what a valuable person he was to have on your artistic team when making a war movie, for example. And the beautiful tribute by director John Boorman that is quoted is enough to remind us that Marvin was a genuine artist. Boorman, who made a terrific documentary film about Marvin some years ago, is an intelligent and obvious choice to offer recollections having made two of Marvin's most interesting (yet under-appreciated) films: POINT BLANK and HELL IN THE PACIFIC.There is also some discussion as to how Marvin handled weapons. As a former Marine he certainly knew his arsenal, but that alone does not explain Marvin's poetical way of holding a pistol, firing a rifle, or imagining a knife thrust (as in THE BIG RED ONE, an act that is central to the movie). It speaks to Mr. Epstein's appreciation of his subject that he is able to recognize this. This is similar to Marvin's unique way of moving, like a life force ready to snuff out other life, as captured in his deliberate, fast-paced walk in POINT BLANK as he powers his way to his destiny, or, as referenced in Boorman's documentary how Marvin, also while filming POINT BLANK, told the camera man ""I'm going to fake going left, but then I'll go right,"" only to be so convincing with his fake that the camera operator ruined the shot (twice!) by following through on the fake movement!Lee Marvin. Complex, powerful, strong, independent.  And tragic. Author Epstein goes out on a well-considered limb when he opines that Marvin suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which explains so much of his behaviour after the war--especially his alcoholism. Not unlike so many of his great contemporaries how much more could Marvin have given us had he not been ""snared by drink,"" to quote Richard Burton, Marvin's co-star in the ill-fated film THE KLANSMAN. Also a heavy smoker, we lost Marvin way too early, at age 63. Imagine this epitome of manhood with a colostomy bag and every hospital tube known to man sticking out of him, and all so unnecessary...If one needs any further reminding of Marvin's star power, imagine his being compared to John Wayne (who wanted to do THE DIRTY DOZEN) or William Holden (who played--superbly--the role of Pike in THE WILD BUNCH, a part originally intended for Marvin, who helped develop the script). That is esteemed company indeed.Stars like Lee Marvin will never be forgotten, though often they run the risk of not being as well-known today as they should be. Mr. Epstein has done his part in reminding us why a resurgence of broader appreciation for the work of such a magnificent artist as Marvin is so important. Fans of classic cinema will find this required reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYGWC0IIRBH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0SAF3S#wasThisHelpful","R1OYGWC0IIRBH4","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HINTERLAND is the name of a new police procedural series filmed in Wales in both English and Welsh. The name is significant for a number of reasons. Often with police shows, the title is drawn from the name of the protagonist. This tells you that the show will be mostly about that individual. Murphy's Law, Taggart, Inspector Morse, etc. are but a few examples.In other instances, the name of the show is drawn from the location, which suggests a strong emphasis on culture, background and characteristics of the area in question. Midsomer Murders comes to mind.It is therefore a clue as to the style, tone and content of HINTERLAND, that it should be thus named. The word ""hinterland"" literally means ""the land behind"" and usually means a rural area. Interestingly, the word hinterland is also commonly applied in the United Kingdom to British politicians when referring to the depth, breadth and knowledge of other matters, specifically of cultural, academic, artistic, literary and scientific pursuits. It may also refer to their lack of knowledge of other matters. Apparently, this usage was used by British politicians in the context of the supposed lack of hinterland (i.e. ignorance) of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Be that as it may, the title of this show suggests multiple possibilities as to its direction. Initially, in the first four episodes, there is less emphasis given to character development and more to the rural, isolated place that comprises the hinterland. And with two of the four episodes loosely based on Welsh legends, this reference to the hinterland as an isolated, multi-layered place is reinforced.There is a Welsh word, hiraeth, that has no direct English translation, but it comes close to capturing the mood, the style, the tone of HINTERLAND. One attempt to define hiraeth is ""homesickness tinged with grief or sadness over the lost or departed. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire for the Wales of the past.Protagonist DCI Tom Mathias fits this description in many ways. Mathias is a native hinterlander and his return to his roots, though not yet fully explained, suggests his strong connection with the land and culture in which he grew up. We do learn that he is a loner, recently returned from 10 years with London's Metropolitan Police, that he has a wife who will not return his calls and two children he is not allowed to see. Richard Harrington as Mathias conveys infinite sadness or ""hiraeth"" in his expressive eyes and is a compelling presence, although it must be said that watching him over the course of four episodes is as frustrating as it is absorbing. Series 2 will hopefully shed more light on his back story and motivations. Series 1 walks a very fine line between not knowing enough to care about the protagonist and knowing just enough to want to know more. Fortunately Mathias has a great team of three associates who have sharply defined characteristics and who make more of an immediate connection with the audience. This tips the scales in the show's favour. The behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast are helpful in this regard, too. With every new cop show there is always going to be a grace period where audiences have to get to know the main actors/characters. Mathias can afford to be somewhat mysterious so long as his team is more accessible and he is eventually ""explained"".The mysteries themselves are good but the real star of the show is the hinterland itself. The Welsh countryside is stunning in its variety and beauty. As in the Irish series Single Handed, the land is an important part of each story. With HINTERLAND though, it is almost as if the hinterland is another character. The pacing of the show is deliberate, even slow in places, but the drama never lags. For fast-paced, action-oriented shows one will have to look elsewhere, probably to shows set in big cities, like New Tricks or Trial & Retribution. HINTERLAND carves out its own niche and has the confidence to draw its audience in using subtlety over suspense.The fact the show is filmed in both English and Welsh (this release is the English only version) also suggests a confidence in the quality and content of the series. Given the opportunity, HINTERLAND could really develop into one of the most intriguing police shows on the air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22B9YS7NULFDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3M54AW#wasThisHelpful","R22B9YS7NULFDS","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1977, at the age of 18, I sat glued to my television set watching a superb, 10-part adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's great novel ANNA KARENINA on Masterpiece Theatre. I don't know of many people my age at the time who would have bothered, but I did and the memory of Nicola Pagett's gracefully beautiful, dewy-eyed Anna, Stuart Wilson's dashing but sensitive Vronsky and, perhaps above all, Eric Porter's brilliant, fully-rounded portrayal of Anna's husband, Karenin, have stayed with me all those years.Versions of ANNA KARENINA come and go and have done so since the beginning of motion pictures. Anna has been portrayed by Greta Garbo (twice), Vivian Leigh, Jacqueline Bisset and Sophie Marceau, to name but a few of the beauties who have been drawn to the role.Nicola Pagett holds her own very nicely. Apart from being a stunning beauty and a distinguished, theatre-trained actress, Pagett brought a deep vulnerability to the role, a vulnerability which was later linked to Pagett's own bipolar disorder which manifested a few years after ANNA KARENINA in Pagett's real life, the details of which are irrelevant here. Somehow, perhaps subconsciously, Pagett tapped into her own dark, mental musings to understand and realize Anna, much the way the famously tortured Vivien Leigh did when she played Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire.What really helps the actors excel in their roles is the length of this version of ANNA KARENINA. Never before (or since, I believe) has such a thorough attempt been made to mine the riches of Tolstoy's novel as has this adaptation by Donald Wilson for the BBC.The epic running time allows for richer characterizations and fuller plot development than previous adaptations. After all, how do you condense a 1000 page novel down to a 2 or 3 or even 4 hour movie? But a 10-part series? That's more like it.To give but one important example, Tolstoy's spirituality was a vital part of his life and themes of spiritual doubt, genuine conversion, moral hypocrisy and divine forgiveness--all of which permeate Tolstoy's novel--are represented here. Instead of the typical plot reduction that most adaptations of ANNA KARENINA usually resort to, namely boy meets girl; girl is married; they have an affair; husband is outraged; guilt forces a wedge between boy and girl; society in all its glorious hypocrisy leads to girl's redemptive suicide; this splendid adaptation takes its time and explores the moral and spiritual implications that are inevitable in such a story.It is all too common in dramatized representations of illicit affairs to show the wronged party (usually the husband) as cold, dispassionate, distracted, unattractive, etc. in order to justify the adulterous actions of the (usually wife) and her lover. This attempt to simplify what is normally a much more complex situation is understandable as audiences are expected to feel empathy for the protagonists. But in the case of ANNA KARENINA, a psychologically rich and profound work of human interaction and behaviour, this will not do. It is therefore important to recognize that this version of ANNA KARENINA comes closest to honouring Tolstoy's work.To give a precise example, the scene in which Karenin (the magnificent Eric Porter) forgives Anna and Vronsky is one of the most beautiful, sublime representations of forgiveness ever captured on screen. It is almost as if one sees Karenin's burden lifted off his shoulders as he take Vronsky's hand and pronounces his forgiveness of Vronsky and Anna's adultery. How often is forgiveness factored into a plot? Especially compared to its antithesis, revenge? From Hamlet to your average Western revenge as the basis of drama is tried and proven. Forgiveness is much more difficult to portray, dramatically, in part because it is not action oriented. But here, in this glorious scene, a vital part of Tolstoy's story is allowed to shine. Some versions of the story, most notably the 1948 Vivien Leigh version, eschew this interpretation of Karenin's declamation and show Karenin's forgiveness in a cold, insincere light. But that's not what Tolstoy wrote. Tolstoy knew, as a great artist understands the great themes inherent in human nature, that for Karenin to demonstrate genuine forgiveness would eventually drive both Anna and Vronsky to make a choice about their own lives. Not that he (Karenin) was attempting manipulation--rather he was reacting to a genuine spiritual prompting that freed him from a devastatingly painful domestic impasse. How Anna and Vronsky chose to respond was up to them.Karenin is also freed in this scene from his earlier anger and rage, demonstrated in a savage scene when he hurls the pregnant Anna across the room and onto a chair. He, too, is in need of forgiveness. True, as the story continues, Karenin seems to become hardened toward Anna in ways that belie his generosity of spirit in the forgiveness scene--but it is still there as part of Tolstoy's understanding of human beings in all their complexity and sometimes seeming hypocrisy. Is Karenin's gesture genuine? Yes. Is his failure to remain completely forgiving hypocritical? Perhaps.Another observation about Eric Porter's performance: earlier, while involved in a heated argument with Anna, he begins to stutter as he loses control of his emotions, finally erupting in a strong lisp, pronouncing ""s"" as ""th"". He is shocked, as if a great, terrible secret about him has been exposed. His hand covers his mouth in horror as he leaves Anna without saying another word. For a man like Karenin to lose control and give up what must have been one of his great vulnerabilities as a child says so much about the guarded, everything-in-its-place aristocrat that Porter so memorably portrays. It is a stroke of genius, acted to perfection.Details such as these are lost in lesser, shorter adaptations. The BBC production of ANNA KARENINA is to be applauded for its commitment to fidelity and getting Tolstoy's greatest work right.The performances throughout are flawless. There is the role of a priest--only two scenes--that is played by the wonderful character actor Peter Copley. I refer readers of this review to my review of Father Brown The Complete Series, in which I share a personal anecdote about working with Mr. Copley. Great art is achieved by attention to details and casting such outstanding actors in minor roles is one way in which ANNA KARENINA stands out from the rest. It is a magnificent production.Each episode begins with a still close-up of Anna which then is revealed to be a picture in a locket. The point of focus in each of these shots is Anna's eyes. The shots are well chosen, for Nicola Pagett's cerulean pools will haunt you for a long time after.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PT1T18Y7PFF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKEM36Q#wasThisHelpful","R3PT1T18Y7PFF8","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The strip of land known as the Cimarron Territory and later the Oklahoma Panhandle, left virtually ungoverned for decades in the 1800s, is the perfect place to set a good, old-fashioned Western. Edna Ferber set her epic, sprawling novel CIMARRON in this area of the United States and the resultant film adaptation in 1930 starring Richard Dix was the first Western to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. It was re-made in 1960 with Glenn Ford, a few years after the first TV series with Cimarron in the title: Cimarron City, starring George Montgomery.By the time CIMARRON STRIP came along, TV Westerns were at their apex, with some shows, like Gunsmoke, running for over a decade by 1967, when CIMARRON STRIP was produced. Speaking of Gunsmoke, a number of the creative minds behind that still remarkable program were involved in the production of this new, ""90-minute"" Western. It looked like a sure hit.The budgets were big, and according to star Stuart Whitman (in a terrific extra feature bonus interview included in this collection) top dollar was paid to get the best talent. A look at this partial list of guest stars during the show's 23 episode run attests to this fact: Richard Boone, Beau Bridges, David Carradine, Seymour Cassel, Joseph Cotten, Broderick Crawford, Royal Dano, Robert Duvall, Steve Forrest, Victor French, Mariette Hartley, Robert Lansing, Darren McGavin, Leslie Nielsen, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Suzanne Pleshette, Denver Pyle, Telly Savalas, John Saxon, Tom Skerritt, Jon Voight, Tuesday Weld, Robert Wilke, Morgan Woodward and more!Stunning symphonic theme music reinforces this promise of quality. Composed by nine time Oscar nominee (he won thrice) Maurice Jarre, the sweeping score propels a hard riding Stuart Whitman over the opening and closing credits. It's a classic opening and screams ""BIG! BIG!""The supporting cast, though not in the same league as the supporting roles on Gunsmoke, are all very good, with Percy Herbert in particular adding some colour as Scotsman MacGregor. One almost expects him to say ""she canna hold much longer, Marshal!"" much like another volatile, fictional Scotsman on the small screen at this time, Canadian actor James Doohan's ""Scotty"" on Star Trek. Herbert's MacGregor is a vivid contrast to Whitman's usually calm Marshal Jim Crown. Randy Boone, as sometimes gullible but always sincere Francis Wilde, was fresh off of television's first 90-minute Western, The Virginian. Given another season, his character might've matured into a stronger, more reliable deputy, instead of the one who always wound up getting caught and handing over the keys to the jail cell to the bad guys. Jill Townsend, too, as Dulcie Coopersmith, fought hard to make her character into more than a one-dimensional virgin who nurses an unrequited love for Marshal Crown. She is lovely and her caring nature is more than just innocence--she is genuinely compassionate.So why did CIMARRON STRIP only last one season? Probably just timing. A clue is to be found, again in the interview with Stuart Whitman, when he divulges that one of the CIMARRON STRIP creators, Leonard Freeman, presented Whitman with a new pilot script he had written called Hawaii 5-0. Freeman strongly encouraged Whitman to walk away from his commitment to his CIMARRON STRIP company, predicting that times were changing and it was now the dawn of the era of the detective show. Whitman, to his credit, said no and stuck to his guns (in this case, a .45 calibre nickel-plated seven inch barrel revolver). Whitman had a one third producing interest in CIMARRON STRIP and really wanted it to succeed. He apparently loved doing the show, too. But, alas, Freeman was right, and CIMARRON STRIP was cancelled after 23 episodes (filmed over an incredibly tight 11 month period).Rather than lament what could have been, it's time to celebrate the proper DVD release of this terrific, albeit short-lived, series. Nitpickers may point and say that the episodes have been tampered with (some slight editing is noticeable in places) but given the age of the shows and their previous limited availability, this is a minor point of contention. Only one episode jarred in this way, with the climactic shoot-out being momentarily compromised by a bad edit.Overall, the picture quality and sound balance is excellent and, of great importance to more and more viewers of classic programs, closed captioning/subtitles is an option. Beautifully packaged on 8 discs, CIMARRON STRIP is a must-have for collectors of classic TV Westerns.A handful of episodes are a little sub-par, story-wise, but this is more than compensated for by the balance of the episodes which range between very good and excellent. Arguably the stand out is Knife in the Darkness, a take on Jack the Ripper which is so rich in atmosphere you can almost taste the fog. Written by Harlan Ellison, known particularly for his contributions to the Science Fiction genre, This show really packs a wallop and demonstrates how far the producers were willing to go to breathe new life into the serial Western.In stark contrast to the heightened drama of this episode are the delightful touches of humour that manifest now and then. Early in the series, while Marshal Crown is attempting to take a much-deserved bath, some bad guys ride through town, stirring up trouble. Whitman, wearing only a bath towel (!) grabs his .45 and jumps out the window and down onto the street, battling with the badmen until they are subdued. The towel, which in reality would have had to have been surgically attached in order to not fall off, adds an hilarious counterpoint to the violence of the scene. It almost seems a subtle acknowledgement of all those fight scenes involving Marshal Dillon on Gunsmoke in which his hat never falls off. Given the earlier mentioned creative connection to Gunsmoke, this is entirely possible!Again going back to Stuart Whitman, he says in his interview that rather than listen to him talk about the series, fans should just watch the episodes. He seems genuinely excited at the prospect of so many people rediscovering CIMARRON STRIP, a show that obviously meant a great deal to him. It's easy to understand why. Marshal Jim Crown is multi-faceted, often behaving in ways that are entirely unexpected, especially when in a tight spot. Yet he never compromises his integrity as a Western hero deserving of our esteem.CIMARRON STRIP is an outstanding series. It took awhile to make its way onto DVD, but now that it is here it is just waiting to be enjoyed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF967JR54O0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS6WQ2S#wasThisHelpful","RKF967JR54O0F","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A number of outstanding programs from Denmark and Sweden have become available in North America over the past few years. Shows like Wallander and The Killing have been enormous hits, to the point where they have been re-made in either England or the U.S. This is understandable as many viewers just don't like subtitles. Accessibility is what it's all about in the film business. Appeal to as wide an audience as possible.But for this reviewer, there is nothing like the original. Having recently enjoyed a number of European programs, many made available here in North America by a company called MHz Networks, who specialize in such programming, I've become hooked, waiting for that next great show to come along. After Borgen, the three season political masterpiece that came out of Denmark just a few years ago, it's been both fun to anticipate what that show might be and frustrating to watch shows that, while good, aren't quite up to the high standard set by Borgen.Well, THE BRIDGE comes awfully close to being that elusive next masterpiece. A co-production between Sweden and Denmark, this ten-part police procedural derives a lot of its dramatic power by setting the first murder at the precise point on the Oresund Bridge that divides Denmark from Sweden. Who is in charge is the first obvious question asked. The answer, both countries. While most of the office scenes are set in Sweden, with Saga Noren (played by Sofia Helin), the leading homicide detective in the Swedish city of Malmo apparently in control of the investigation, the Danish presence is more than adequately represented by Martin Rohde (played by Kim Bodnia) Copenhagen's leading homicide detective.As good as the plot is, and as thrilling as some heart-stopping moments are, the real thrust of the series is the interaction between the socially inept, cut-to-the-bone truthfulness of Saga and the more laid-back, family man Martin. As radically different as they are from one another, Saga and Martin are by no means one dimensional characters and their life decisions, their values and their ability to separate blatant truth from, at times, more appropriately sensitive responses, is one of the most compulsively watchable aspects of THE BRIDGE. The title of the show also comes to stand as a metaphor for how these two characters will bridge their differences and learn to work together.The style and look of the series is also important to note. Lovers of old films continue to watch Film Noir with the sort of veneration the best of that genre deserves. Where are the heirs apparent today? Right here in shows like THE BRIDGE, which is mostly shot at night and carries with it a gloom and oppression that seems inescapable, all basic qualities of Film Noir.There is a lot of darkness in ten hours of relentless murder investigation. Be warned that the show's world view isn't exactly life affirming. But it is not a world without hope. Central to that hope is the idea that a healthy domestic relationship is the most important aspect of life. While many of us might say there is a little more to living than that, important as such things are, in the dramatic world of THE BRIDGE, this is most appropriate, at least for now. Relational respite from the worries of the world are high stakes indeed.Apparently, season two of THE BRIDGE has been produced and a third is being written. Maybe the characters' respective world views will mature and grow...Meantime, don't be put off by the subtitles. THE BRIDGE is worth the time and effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SENI3QV1NJBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPNU8P0#wasThisHelpful","R2SENI3QV1NJBD","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"34 years old at the time this series was made, in 2012, rising Swedish star Malin Crepin embodies driven, young, thrill-seeking newspaper reporter Annika Bengtzon.

While not without cliches, the scripts are exciting and we come to really care about Annika. This is crucial and not a given, for any protagonist, especially female, who sacrifices her home life for professional success (and perhaps to feed her addiction to adrenaline) is bound to come under some criticism for her choices, even in this day and age. It helps that Ms Crepin is beautiful without being intimidatingly so (making her likeable) but it is also a credit to her acting abilities that she so ably pulls this off.The series gets off to a heart-pounding start when Annika finds herself at the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, “Nobel’s Last Will”, where she witnesses a shocking murder. But who is the real victim? It’s the story of a lifetime but a gag order prevents her from writing about it. One of the show’s ongoing cliches is established early in this episode when Annika appears to be in a very privileged position with the local police, who supply her with important crime-related information at the drop of a hat. Ultimately such details compromise the show’s integrity and prevent it from being exceptional. ANNIKA BENGTZON is, however, still highly watchable and one’s enjoyment level may be influenced by how forgiving one is towards these dramatic cliches.Annika’s home life is also somewhat predictable, with her husband a bit of a wet blanket the way he fails to put his foot down over Annika’s extremely-driven behaviour, especially when it comes to her sharing the load of raising their two children. Speaking of which, how on earth would such a career woman take the time to have TWO children, let alone one. It is hard to imagine Annika Bengtzon taking maternity leave.This is not to say anyone can’t have a successful career and a happy home life, but it isn’t easy, and perhaps the show could be a bit more creative when exploring this story arc.Having said that, ANNIKA BENGTZON is an enjoyable set of six thrillers with a refreshingly different point of view, that of the committed journalist who relishes the challenge of rooting out the Big Story, but who also values the journalistic integrity in reporting the news fairly and accurately to the public.The second episode, “Prime Time”, has an Agatha Christie feel to it, as Annika attempts to uncover who, out of ten possible suspects, is the killer of a famous TV host.Episode three, “Studio Sex”, is a real pulse-racer and goes a long way into deepening our understanding of Annika’s character.These first three mysteries are packaged as one three disc box set.The second box set continues Annika’s pursuit of journalistic distinction. The three episodes are “The Red Wolf”; “Lifetime”; and “A Place in the Sun”. The last is the most interesting as Annika travels to Costa del Sol, Spain, to cover a story involving a murdered Swedish family. The change of locale is welcome. It should be mentioned that ANNIKA BENGTZON is based on the series of best-selling crime novels by Liza Marklund.Perhaps it is unfair to compare a relatively straight-forward crime show like ANNIKA BENGTZON with BORGEN, from neighbouring Denmark, but with the latter outstanding show still fresh in this reviewer’s mind, it is inevitable. After all, Swedish and Danish sound the same to me–and will to most North Americans. A subtitle is a subtitle.

"The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of World War II during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though doomed from the start, the 200 soldiers garrisoned at Westerplatte held out for seven days, thus serving to inspire a nation as a symbol of resistance. In the process of enduring a naval bombardment, assault troops and dive bombers, the defenders of Westerplatte kept well over 3,000 German troops busy, buying time for other parts of Poland to prepare their defenses. The fact they didn’t stand a chance only served to reinforce, in the eyes of Poland and the rest of the free world, how vital it was to stand up to Hitler.It’s great subject matter for a film, and writer/director Pawel Chochelew has come up with a winner for the most part, even managing to inject some truly artful moments into what could easily have been just another World War II film. The problem is the special effects mostly, and the staging of the battle scenes, in part. Let’s face it, audiences are more sophisticated about CGI effects these days , so if you’re going to use them, they have to be well done. The above-mentioned dive bombers are a particularly good example of bad special effects.In Poland, the title of the film is slightly different, translating as THE SECRET OF WESTERPLATTE. Apparently the secret is that the men defending Westerplatte were actually commanded by Second in Command Capt Dabrowski, and not by Major Sucharski. While this is of only passing interest to audiences simply looking for a good war movie, it does aid the human interaction during the siege.Apparently Major Sucharski had some sort of mental breakdown during the battle, which paved the way for Capt Dabrowski’s taking over command. The scenes depicting Sucharski’s breakdown (here interpreted as epilepsy) are very well done and the director manages to find a way to bring something fresh to the war movie genre. Interesting as this is, the poor special effects and sometimes ineptly shot battle scenes (the German soldiers’ frontal beach assault looks ridiculous) undermine these efforts at originality.In the end, one’s enjoyment of 1939 BATTLE OF WESTERPLATTE will be determined by what is more valued: interesting human interaction or battle scenes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBJOMID3RC6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3XMA9A#wasThisHelpful","RPBJOMID3RC6G","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Professor James Shapiro has done the seemingly impossible and found a new light to shed on the life of William Shakespeare and his later plays. Although he makes a few assumptions here and there, (as when he says, most convincingly, that Shakespeare did such and such a thing at such and such a place), his opinion is nonetheless well-informed and his theories, for the most part, are impressively believable. We must remember though that Shakespeare’s actual life and career is very poorly documented, and while it is tempting to place the world’s greatest playwright in any number of circumstances, there is nothing to actually prove these imaginings.I’m willing to concede many of Shapiro’s major surmises, however, such as how events of the day may have impacted Shakespeare’s writings, for they mostly make perfect sense; but one must view this program with just a pinch of salt, at least when it comes to Shakespeare’s biography.But the play’s the thing, is it not? And Shapiro’s knowledge of the time and key events in the reign of King James I is the real meat of the story, drawing us in with a fresh perspective on Shakespeare’s works that has rarely, if ever, (to my knowledge) been considered before.And that consideration is Shakespeare as Jacobean playwright (meaning he wrote during the reign of King James) as opposed to being solely a product of the Elizabethan era, which many people assume. As Shapiro delves deep into the events and changes of the time, the significance of this “discovery” becomes fascinatingly apparent.This is the ultimate value of this outstanding three episode series: how it provides new insight into some of the most important plays in world literature. Not an easy task.While he isn’t the most absorbing on-camera host in an Athena-released documentary (Shapiro’s readings tend to over-emphasize key words which has the effect of sounding like Captain Kirk got an education), this is truly a fine example of content over style carrying the program. Many of Shapiro’s conclusions and observations are truly ground-breaking. And even with some mediocre performances of scenes from Shakespeare’s later plays (was the RSC slumming – especially their horribly-performed bits from King Lear?), the layer upon layer of significant observations about Shakespeare as a Jacobean author pile up so high that the cumulative effect is that of a significant contribution to Shakespearean scholarship. (Bits from Ralph Fiennes’ recent film of Coriolanus make up for some of the shoddy stage excerpts, so that helps, too).As a very special bonus feature is an outstanding (for the most part) production of Macbeth from 1983, part of the BBC Shakespeare series that ambitiously presented all of Shakespeare’s plays produced for television from the late seventies to the early nineteen-eighties. Nicol Williamson is in fine form as Macbeth and the shamefully little-known (in North America) Jane Lapotaire explodes in a technically astounding performance as Lady Macbeth. Note how she ascends several staircases without looking down, as one small example of her powerhouse technique.This two disc set from Athena is a keeper, something every fan of Shakespeare simply must own. Despite a few false notes, it is truly impressive and bound to set you thinking about some of Shakespeare’s late masterpieces in a new way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BLC7XQEHRUF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5DWF18#wasThisHelpful","R1BLC7XQEHRUF8","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this excellent documentary series released by Athena, a subsidiary of Acorn Media, specialists in quality programming, is somewhat misleading. The problem with using “narrow escapes” in the title is that it implies POWs and escapes from concentration camps. The series is so much more than that. Coupled with the informative learning guide that comes with this four DVD set, the viewer or “student” will come away enriched and even fascinated by some of the powerful stories recounted here. Athena presents many documentaries and has a particular focus on educational material. This is arguably one of their best.As a person reasonably well-educated on matters pertaining to World War II, I was delighted to discover a number of stories I’d never heard before in this at times riveting, always interesting series chronicling close calls (A better description than “narrow escapes”) in World War II.And lest one assume that all the stories focus on Allied protagonists, there is a very broad range of situations covered here, with a few Axis “escapes” thrown in the mix. There was a time when this might not sit well with a U.S./British/Canadian audience, but enough time has passed since the Second World War that people can be a little more objective about such things. Each episode is compelling and utilizes archival footage extremely well. In fact, the actual war-time footage is so good it makes the re-enactments look mostly weak by comparison.On the other hand some of the interviews that the producers have secured are fascinating. One episode, number 11,  called “Moore’s March” includes an interview with one of the four survivors of one of the most incredible close calls you’ll ever hear about, a 300 mile trek across the desert with no food and almost no water–and barefoot. The ordeal left the interviewee severely traumatized and while time has helped heal his stress, there are still hints of it on hand. Another excellent episode, number 3, “Wingate & The Chindits” includes a number of survivors’ interviews. This event, set in the Burmese jungle against the Japanese, movingly recounts the strong bond between the desperate men and their donkeys, who served them so well and had to be slaughtered for food towards the end of the campaign. One interviewee reads a poem about one donkey’s last moments and provides a fitting reminder of how animals serve and sacrifice for humans during times of war. I wouldn’t go so far as to call this “War Donkey”, and I’m sure Spielberg will never make a film about it, but it is very moving nonetheless.A number of recent historical documentaries have tried to jazz things up by using shaky camera work and rapid cutting techniques. Fortunately, NARROW ESCAPES OF WORLD WAR II is of a more traditional style and eschews this sometimes annoying approach. It recognizes that a strong story is the focal point of any documentary and the visuals are there simply to back up and illuminate, not distract.This series will be of considerable interest to military history buffs, but educators should also take note. This is an excellent resource for helping to teach young people about the pivotal historical event of the 20th-Century.NARROW ESCAPES OF WORLD WAR II is a worthwhile investment of both time and money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E45TNLP7TIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQUS3U#wasThisHelpful","R4E45TNLP7TIV","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I had occasion to teach a class to some university age students. During this class I brought up the name Winston Churchill. The students knew virtually nothing about this great politician and World War II leader. It reminded me that historical events like World War II –  arguably the single most important event of the 20th-Century — are little-known to many generations of young people today.That is precisely why DVD releases like the one under consideration here are so important.MISSIONS THAT CHANGED THE WAR: THE DOOLITTLE RAID is as good as any WWII-era documentary I’ve ever seen and superior to most. It has the perfect blend of narrative, archival footage, interviews both vintage and contemporary, and well-placed and unobtrusive re-enactments. I knew the basics of the story, but the details! Everything from the close calls so many of the 80 volunteers airmen faced to the eccentric touches such as painting a couple of broomsticks black and setting them up to look like a tail gun (the real tail gun having been removed due to issues of weight).This four episode documentary has no pretensions about its purpose. This is to-the-point, well-balanced, dramatically interesting storytelling of one of the most important U.S. military operations of the Second World War.There is sufficient examination of Jimmy Doolittle the man to understand what drove him to be the only person considered capable of planning and executing this crucial mission. Doolittle was a great American hero, though not without flaws: he praised the Apartheid system of government in South Africa in the 1960s, for example. Nonetheless it is the portrayal of Doolittle as a real human being that makes his story so compelling. Convinced the mission had failed because all the planes were lost after the raid, Doolittle had no idea what was in store for him or the other raiders if and when they returned home safely.The program’s sense of authenticity and solid research is anchored in Gary Sinise’s superb narration. Sinise is a worthy contributor to this program. He started The Gary Sinise Foundation several years ago, a charity that supports the work of America’s “defenders, veterans, first responders, their families, and those in need.” ([...]) His narration is a text book example of how to do documentary narration right.Also of great interest is the contribution of the handful of surviving Doolittle raiders who, now all in their nineties, give that important first-hand account that benefit all historical documentaries.THE DOOLITTLE RAID’s four episodes are titled “The Call To War”; “Special Aviation Project Number One”; “The Target Of This Task Force Is Tokyo”; and “The Legacy”. There are surprises in every episode that help make this program one of those rare gems you just can’t turn off.For those of you who, like me, were familiar with the bombing raid only from the excellent Spencer Tracy film “30 Seconds Over Tokyo”, you’ll be immediately drawn into MISSIONS THAT CHANGED THE WAR: THE DOOLITTLE RAID. It’s war documentary as it should be: informative, enlightening, entertaining and thrilling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290LRBWJA25SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8KJNMI#wasThisHelpful","R290LRBWJA25SV","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Previously, Acorn Media released The Doolittle Raid, the first documentary in the MISSIONS THAT CHANGED THE WAR series. It was truly outstanding and the review can be found here [...]High hopes, then, for subsequent documentaries in this series.Alas, Germany’s Last Ace, despite some excellent attributes, is a disappointment.Germany’s Last Ace is the story of three men who played decisive roles in the aerial battles over Germany. Most interesting of these is Luftwaffe squadron commander Gunther Rall. Had the film stuck with Rall it may have succeeded in achieving the same standard as The Doolittle Raid. Rall’s interviews are riveting, a real window into the past. In the accompanying 16-page booklet that comes with this 2 DVD set, Jon Tennyson, writer and producer of the program, describes Rall as “complex and unforgettable”.A truly heroic figure, despite having fought for Germany, Rall was never a Nazi and distinguished himself after the war as well as during the conflict.In stark contrast, the son of one of the American pilots featured in the story drones on and on in his interview segments, dry as bones and without much to say.This curious mixture of brilliant and mediocre material undermines any possibility of this documentary measuring up to the standards set by its illustrious predecessor.In addition to the unevenness, the structure of this four part film is maddeningly repetitive. Many such shows made for the History/Military/Discovery etc. channels utilizes the “re-cap” after every break (where commercials would be inserted). The needless repetition is particularly annoying when the narrative crisscrosses between the American and German story threads. The opening of each episode also includes a lengthy re-cap which is especially excruciating when you’re watching back to back episodes. This structure assumes a lack of attention, perhaps even intelligence, on the part of the audience. It seriously undermines the program’s effectiveness.Gary Sinese’s Foundation, which actively promotes the work of service personnel, needs to pay a little more attention to just how easy it is for a documentary with great subject matter to slip under the radar of excellence into mediocrity.It also needs to be pointed out, yet again, that the Canadians were step by step with the U.S. and Great Britain in most of the war in Europe. There are endless places where Canada is simply left out of the narrative. This is poor, even offensive, scholarship.While I was disappointed in many ways with this DVD set, the fact remains that the story of Germany’s Last Ace–Gunther Rall–is a compelling one. If the program focused exclusively on him, it would be vastly improved. Not every war documentary has to have the United States front and centre. Otherwise call it Germany’s Last Ace… and Others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFMUA9KKK9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2UMHYC#wasThisHelpful","RBFMUA9KKK9L","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve always entertained a certain fascination with the American Civil War. I’m not alone in that regard, which explains the ongoing output of documentaries, books and memorabilia associated with that terrible conflict.Let’s face it. There have been great achievements (Ken Burns’ “The Civil War”) and dozens of imitators. Finding a new angle to present this compelling subject matter is a challenge that is seldom successfully met.As Civil War documentaries go, Lee & Grant isn’t bad, but is so caught up in style that it overshadows the content. This is really too bad, because a detailed examination of the two most well-known generals from that war is a compelling topic.Perhaps the most-often speculated theory about the American Civil War is the idea “what if Robert E. Lee had chosen to remain loyal to the Union?” Would the war have been shortened? Would it have taken as great a toll as it did?Lee was arguably the greatest American general of the period. It’s a pretty safe bet to say his decision to put State over Country resulted in more death and destruction than many people are comfortable to admit.OK, so how could this subject not fail to measure up as a great documentary?Because Ken Burns’ comprehensive exploration of the subject matter has made it virtually impossible for any subsequent film about the Civil War to be as highly regarded, director/producers are tempted, I think, to try to find a totally different approach to presenting this subject matter.Fair enough, but the result, in LEE & GRANT, is overkill; style over substance.For example, when filming an historian, I don’t want to see a gigantic close-up of an oak tree in the foreground taking up two-thirds of the screen, with the dwarfed speaker sitting in the distant background. Such visual tricks are meaningless and distracting.Similarly, when explaining Grant’s aversion to blood, the filmmakers tell how, as a boy, Grant was exposed to the slaughter of animals as part of the family business. This is accompanied by repeated shots of a little boy’s bare foot stepping in a pool of blood as he runs along. Surely this is (excuse the pun) overkill?There is a wealth of information about Generals Lee and Grant that will be of value and interest to students and historians alike, but I, for one, don’t like my facts overshadowed by attention-grabbing camera work and direction. Subject matter this good simply doesn’t need it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TY380EVLYUO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YDSMZY#wasThisHelpful","R2TY380EVLYUO7","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Standing in stark contrast to the visual and stylistic excesses of “Lee & Grant”, executive producers Ridley and Tony Scott (and others) have put together an utterly fascinating film about one of the most tragic military engagements ever involving North Americans – the battle of Gettysburg.GETTYSBURG is full of rich visuals, but the film manages to match them with a compelling story that focuses on a number of individuals who were either directly or indirectly involved in the battle.The most heartrending of these stories involves Amos Humiston, a Union sergeant who has the distinction of being the only enlisted man to have his own monument at Gettysburg. The reason for this will really tug at your heart strings.It seems that Humiston knew he was mortally wounded. He crawled off to die and as he slowly bled to death, he retrieved from his pocket an ambrotype—an early type of photograph—of his three children.His wife had sent it to Humiston after he had gone to war, never imagining the impact it would have in helping to immortalize her husband’s memory.After the battle, Humiston was found, holding the picture of his children in his death grip. Since this was the age before dog tags, rendering dead soldiers unidentifiable unless they carried something that explained who they were, the picture was the only clue as to who this soldier was.The picture came into the possession of a volunteer physician, who, some months after the battle, decided to try to solve the mystery. Eventually newspapers published detailed descriptions of the ambrotype, since at that time they had no means of reproducing pictures.Eventually the description reached Humiston’s widow, who hadn’t heard of her husband’s fate. She made inquiries, eventually saw the picture, and was able to confirm her husband’s identity.This is but one episode that serves to put the tragedy of the battle of Gettysburg into perspective for the modern viewer. Most people know there was great loss of life and that it changed the tide of the war. But it is the human aspect of all such stories that is the difference between an outstanding film (which this is) and just another documentary.If you couple this GETTYSBURG documentary with watching the brilliant 1993 feature film of the same name, your experience of the tragedy of Gettysburg will surely be complete.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263HJCIPMX5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YDSN3U#wasThisHelpful","R263HJCIPMX5W","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even today, new stories about the Holocaust rise up out of the ashes and demand to be told. Each voice is worthy, every story worth telling. And some are more interesting than others.THE FLAT is certainly interesting, even important. But it falls short of being the compelling experience the filmmaker hoped it to be. The reason for this, in this reviewer’s opinion, is that there is no pay off. Granted, this is a documentary, where there are no guarantees as to the outcome of the story. One simply jumps in and hopes for the best. Arnon Goldfinger must’ve made a hasty decision to pursue his grandparents relationship with a high ranking Nazi and his wife when he discovered evidence of their friendship while going through his recently deceased grandmother’s belongings in her flat. (If it wasn’t a hasty decision, then that would mean the footage of his family going through his grandmother’s belongings was staged).It is difficult to understand the myriad of emotions he and his family must have felt at this revelation, but clearly, at least for Goldfinger, the stakes are high, even if his family members’ reactions to various memorabilia are, for the most part, subdued.One can’t help suspect that as events unfold the filmmaker was hoping for some catharsis to take place: either his mother breaking down and screaming “how could they?” or the daughter of the grandparents’ Nazi friend shrieking “it can’t be true!” This is a reasonable hope, for therein lies the stuff of good drama.Sadly, for the sake of the documentary, this does not occur. Goldfinger voices his disappointment with his mother’s guarded reaction (she knew nothing about this relationship), but the rest of the time he looks dazed, as if he cannot believe no one is expressing outrage.Perhaps a more objective perspective on the part of the filmmaker might’ve served the story better; something the best documentaries seem to have in common.THE FLAT is, to be frank, a little flat, dramatically. It still deserves to be seen, however, as yet another valid documentation of an unusual offshoot of the Holocaust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB9TCKQ3IOA6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AADAEH6#wasThisHelpful","RB9TCKQ3IOA6O","AD50CYPEWH6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD50CYPEWH6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing is built like a tank. Welds are as beefy as the steel they used to costruct this tool, so it's very heavy. Clamping and release functions work efortlessly without using your hands so you can control the work, though you do have to slide the lock/unlock tab by hand. Takes a little getting used to but when sliding the lock/unlock tab, the work is always in a clamped state. The tool is shown being pulled by a handle but while the tools does have rubber wheels, they are relatively close together so the tool is tippy with being pulled. Doesn't have a flat top surface like a Workmate but with the wide front legs, it is inherently more stable when working close in next to the clamping surfaces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB7F2IFDX36M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BTLXI8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB7F2IFDX36M","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 'Create Your Own' cover was a present for my wife. I uploaded a picture of her favorite dog for application to both sides and she is very happy, so I am happy...well, sort of. Had I bought it for myself, I'd be sending it back. The transfer process did not center the picture on the back side of the cover as I had done on the order page, (front page ok), the colors are washed out and have a decidedly blue cast, and the surface is tacky. It is so tacky that when you fold the front over onto the back, the sides sound like they are stuck together when you peel them apart to close. I'd give it one star but it wasn't for me and the recipient was very pleased. So when you average our responses, it gets three stars.

"Considered buying a retractable awning but already had the base for an umbrella. Pushed the long edge of this umbrella against the house in front of a bank of windows on an upper deck and it does the job for less than half the price of the manual awning (Considering the price for the hunter green color. Other colors more expensive). Brass pulleys work smoothly, Sunbrella fabric is top quality as are the support arms and brass pivot pins. The spider joints to which the arms attach including the one that slides up and down the pole are plastic vs an older umbrella I had in which they were wood. This is an Improvement! The older wood spider joints cracked and fell apart after a few years. Several issues of note, the pin used to secure the sliding spider joint in the 'up' configuration is bright brass coated zinc. If you manage to pull down on the hook instead of out to release the mechanism and close the umbrella, you'll break it like I did during a brain f _ _ _. So I bought a 24"" piece of 3/16"" REAL brass rod and made another pin. Even put a nice curve in it from which to hang the extra cord. This one won't break! Another issue is that you'll need a heavy base that accepts the large diameter pole (see description) and this could be costly. My recommendation is don't skimp on the base. Get the heaviest you can find. Finally, the wood is not teak but stained a nice 'teak' color. Oh, and the finial? It's plastic, big deal. Screw it in and forget its there. I'm very happy overall with the quality of this umbrella and would purchase it again over less expensive alternatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCCT8FSUA66H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WAH6KK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCCT8FSUA66H","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Small Hose rack, not a small Hose Rack. It might hold 25' of 5/8"" hose ok....that's it. I bought it to hold 50' of 12ga power cord and it works great for this. 50' of air hose would probably work on this rack as well. Mounting bracket is 3.5"" wide. Overall Height is 6.5"" and the hook extends out 5.5"". I found this rack for $25 elsewhere but they added about $13 for s/h. If you'd rather go there, search on Dura Loop. As for the Rack, it's built tough. The hook itself is mounted to a two piece bracket and seems to be a lot more complicated than it needs to be (meaning they should simply weld the wire to a thick back plate and call it done), but nothing flexes, bends or otherwise 'gives'.

"As designed, it was a no-brainer choice for my new elevated deck and should have been an easy set up, but......Please read the reviews regarding the packaging, they are dead on. Sitting on my front stoop, it looked like it had been poured into the bottom of a fairly large sized box. I held my breath and began to unpack. It comes packed in essentially three distinct parts. On top is the copper plated bowl that is 'secured' to the upper black iron ring assembly to which is attached the gas valve. Next are the legs that are stacked together in a couple of bundles and wrapped in thin foam, and finally there is the bottom larger iron ring.Sure enough, the lava rock bowl (and attached burner) had dislodged from the upper black, iron rim and gas valve. Ok, I'm handy, I can put it back together.  Which I began to do until I realized that the copper thermal coupling tube had been badly kinked and even cracked in the middle. The black 'striker assembly' electrical wire was disconnected from the back of the gas valve and the venturi tube had pulled away from the gas valve....darn.So I called Camp Chef. Wow! I explained the issues and Cassidy sent parts Immediately. I received a new copper thermal coupling tube AND a new gas valve! An hour later I had the new parts assembled and it works beautifully. It's everything I expected in terms of charm, warmth, and good clean fun.Cassidy also sent an email with a very good pictorial instruction guide on how to reassemble the unit should it come apart during shipping, (I had to laugh as I read it). And of special note, please be careful to leave the thermal coupling and igniter housing Uncovered in use! Covering it up to hide it Could compromise the igniter function resulting in an unintended collection of gas in the bottom of the bowl. The next time you try to light it....well you get it. The instructions are very clear about leaving this assembly uncovered and for good reason. FYI, the company listened to those who experienced the lava rock problem and included a metal screen designed to cover the fire pit the first time you use it to keep exploding rocks from flying out. They say it's only needed for the first 15 minutes of use and can then be discarded. My lava rocks did not explode/pop, or otherwise make noise.Hope that helps. When it's working it's wonderful. The tinkering required to get it to that state might be too much for some individuals resulting in a very disappointing experience. (And forget about trying to send it back! You'll have to find a brand new box and plenty of packing material :)Because of what a great idea it is, for how it performs when operational, and because it should last and work for a very long time (once assembled :),  I give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8S97JGW7XB2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZTJQMY#wasThisHelpful","R8S97JGW7XB2T","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am 100% satisfied with this jacket. Sizes are true, material is medium thick soft wool. Sleeves are perfect length, for me. I consider it more like a light coat rather than a jacket. Wool has excellent wind resistance so there's no problem there. It does not have a lining so if worn with a long sleeve shirt can be very warm on cool to cold days. I have worn this on 30 degree days with short sleeve shirts and it's at it's maximum usability as a standalone. Cooler than that, I recommend a long sleeve shirt with thin vest and if desired a scarf. Another nice feature of wool is that it 'breathes' and I seldom if ever take this jacket off when inside. It is comfortable and I don't overheat in it.Pockets are ample but not overlarge. Hand warmer pockets are convenient and don't close but don't 'communicate' to the interior of the jacket.I'm very happy with this jacket and wear it everywhere, layering it if necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBSMTYUWAZBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2PLMPK#wasThisHelpful","R1VBSMTYUWAZBO","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an all Gigaset phone system with the DX800A as the base to which are registered 3 various model Gigaset remote handpieces. I have enjoyed using the Gigaset products very much. They function well as remote telephone  handsets and intercoms registered to the base and they are all excellent hands free devices with great sound quality. We never lose contivity and enjoy the  picture library I uploaded from my personal photo files which serves to identify the caller (as well as using one of many distinctive rings) and as a screen saver/photo viewer (though small). There are too many features available with Gigaset phones to mention here.This handset, the S810H was supposed to register to my DX800A base but did not. I upgraded the DX800A  firmware but this did not solve the problem. I'm not sure why the unit did not register to the base other than to suspect that 1) the unit was devective or 2) this is a European unit and somehow did not interface with the DX800A base purchased here in the US but available worldwide. After several calls to various resellers in the UK and the EU, I was assured there would be no compatability problems so I purchaed the handset. Alas, no joy. Yes, it might have been defective but I'll never know for sure.

"Where to start.....I'm on my third one. First one, bought for a friend worked flawlessly. Preliminary set-up in my house was a breeze and it's now working great in her house. 2nd one would not recognize itself unless plugged into the same outlet. 3rd one had outlet issues too but I was determined to beat it into submission. Here's what I discovered: I couldn't plug either piece into power strips, or power conditioners. I've got them both plugged straight into wall outlets. Doesn't seem to matter if they are on different circuits or even across different service boxes, (I have two 200 amp services).I also have the router part connected downstream through two switches and then into the router. The first is a Cisco product, the other a Netgear product. But the software finds the powerline access point without problems....**UPDATE**, at least it used to. Can't seem to find the access point anymore but I am still getting a WiFi hotspot. Given it was behind two swithces and not conected directly to the router, I was never able to get an IP address for it.  But it still seems to work!Last, the WiFi range doesn't seem to be that great, like about 20 feet through a wall or two and it drops from 4 bars to 3, even down to 2 bars but this isn't a problem for me. The added value is the wired port that I prefer to use for a remote printer. Now I don't have to run a 100 feet of Cat 5 cable!So for set-up I give it a 3.5, and for convenience a 4.5; Average 4.**UPDATE** My friends unit has stopped working...the two pieces no longer recognize each other through the homes AC wires.

"Just got this yesterday to put in an outdoor hanging fixture whose sides are made out of clear textured 'seedy' or 'water beaded' glass. So to make the glass sparkle, I went with a clear bulb. Wow, this thing can be bright if you want it to be, (I have mine on a dimmer).  I am trying different kinds of clear bulbs and also bought something similar to this: Philips 222042 - 69A21/TS 130V Traffic Signal Light Bulb.  While this bulb is rated at 116 watts (at 130v), the two have entirely different personalities but are seemingly identical in output! Whereas the Halogen, (subject of this review) is white, more full spectrum even though rated at 2900K, the Traffic signal bulb, at 2850K, is almost yellow by comparison. It's got to have something to do with the type of filament used.This Halogen is rated for 1000 hours of use. The Traffic Signal bulb is rated for 8000 hours of use.Im my application, I picked the Traffic Signal bulb....purely personal preference. I love this Halogen and give it five stars for lumen output and full spectrum appearance. But for a front door application, it's almost too stark.

"Very nice strap with superior padding. The design is woven, intricate and sophisticated. Stitching is thoroughly completed on all edges; there are no loose threads, or misdirected sewing lines. The 1/4"" thick, dense, and full width padding really only extends about 16 inches and is placed squarely in the middle of the strap.  I consider this a good thing as it helps limit bulk and aids in flexibility from the end of the padding to the camera attachment points. The wide chromed metal buckles that transition from the neck strap to the camera straps are smooth with nicely rounded corners. The rivets are extremely flat and have no raised edges. The attachment to the camera is via narrow nylon webbed straps that fit perfectly in the eyelets on the camera. Excess can be trimmed but additional plastic loops are included to secure the floopy tails, (same idea as what is used on the tail of a belt).The strap gives every indication that it is strong enough for the heaviest of camaras and nothing about this strap will harm your camera's finish  We are very happy with this product and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DC4J0T1ZE1ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ2P06G#wasThisHelpful","R3DC4J0T1ZE1ZK","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very well made, has a quality feel. Remove the back cover of the remote and slide the base into the remote's rear cover slot. Really only goes on one way with the 'on' side oriented up, (May not look it from the picture, but the base has an incline built into the remote attachment plate...more on this below). I bought two and the remote on one base fits nice and snug. The remote on the other fits more loosely but nothing that can't be fixed with a shim. (Pls note, the fit issue is not with the base...I have two very different MRF2-600 remotes and it's the different remotes that fit differently. pls see below for more info on this) The base is nicely weighted and prevents any kind of tipping when the remote buttons are pushed. It also sits on a full surface rubber pad to keep it from slipping.I have three remotes, two in different locations within our home, and a third in my wifes car so she can turn on the front porch and an interior light remotely. These new remotes are much smaller than those that came with the previous MRF-600 and are very light. They don't come with their own rubber feet like the MRF-600s did so they really need something to help stabilize them and this base is the ideal solution, so I gave it 5 stars.Lastly, you may have noticed that the MRF2 remotes don't all have the same graphical appearance. Two of my remotes are solid white without the darker half indicating the 'off' side. You had to stop and read the fine print on the all white remote to know which end to tap.

"Replacing an old plastic Water-Pik showerhead, this item delivers in spades. My variant in stainless finish Delta Faucet  58471-SS-PK Universal Showering Components, Round Traditional 4 Function In2ition Hand Shower/Shower Head Combo, Stainless has a metal shell, plastic inerds, a stainless flexible hose and substantial stainless screw on fittings. There is a three position diverter at the juncture where the wand hose attaches to the main body; 1) halo, 2) halo and wand head 3) wand head only. The wand head has a push button on the wand handle which allows me to select 1) hard pulse from the center of the wand, 2 ) soft pulse from the center and spray from the wands ring around the center, 3) slow drible from both the center and the ring on the wand, (not sure whether this is defective yet or what. I'll update later. UPDATE: all I can figure is for you to use this setting to turn off the wand rather than to change the diverter).The thing that sets this shower head apart is when the diverter is set to head(halo) and wand, and the wand is set to both spray and soft pulse....you feel like you're in a hard rain....you are engulfed in water....Fantastic. And the wand head rests magnetically and snaps into the center of the larger stationary ring. This provides a frim attachment of the wand to the head(halo) but will take me a little getting used to. The ONLY thing the old Water-Pik had going for it was the ease with which you returned the wand to its' attachment point.My wife suggested this type of 'large ringed showerhead' when she used one in a hotel on a trip we took together. I don't remember that showerhead but this one is wonderful and she's elated, (we're older...it doesn't take much :) )**UPDATE** 19 June 2013: We've had it about 6 months now and have had no problems with this shower head. The stainless shell cleans up nicely with Scrubbing Bubbles and a soft non-abrasive sponge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZY415BYMMLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MLXJY2#wasThisHelpful","R14ZY415BYMMLP","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the stock handle for a couple of years, the one with the battery that makes it vibrate. It stopped working a couple of years ago :) and when it recently started to come apart, I figured it was time to customize. I read all the reviews of practically every offering and picked this one. Objectively this handle is larger in every dimension and slightly larger in diameter. Additionally it weighs A Lot more.....so much more it'll take some getting used to.  The knurling could be a bit deeper or more 'grippy' but it is satisfactory.This thing really is heavy and you'll have to figure out the balance.

"This is a nicely made all metal laser pointer that takes 2 AAA batteries. The casing is brass to which is permanently bonded the front end from which the laser emanates. The clip end unscrews providing access to the battery compartment. I looked for a pointer whose clip was not crimped into the side of the body. If the clip bends, then you sort of have to deal with a bent clip that doesn't do its job. The clip on this pointer is part of the tail cap and can be re-bent if necessary.This pointer does not have a strobe function or a constant on mode and I did not need these features. Dot size and output are right in line with all the other pointers I've used. So in general, it's a single function laser pointer that I think is well made.

"Used on my gas dryer, this product replaces an old 'disintegrating' plastic vent hose, (which should never have been used on a hot exhaust appliance in the first place). If you have to cut it, be advised that it will helically tear if you're not careful. I was concerned about its' crush factor, but the sidewalls hold up well and it will bend around tight corners without crimping.

"This review is a mixed bag of functionalily and mis-representation. I wanted an adhesive tie mount that was predrilled for support screws, if needed. I do not like the kind with the hole in the center since in use, the tie tends to catch on the screw head if just the right kind of screw is not used. And if tightened down too tightly, even ever so slightly, they tend to cup. So I saw these with what looked like holes on the four sides....Great! But that's not what I got.

"Not much to this brief and that's perfect for me.  From front to back: A couple of zipped front pockets; a shallow outer and large inner that is compartmentalized for phone etc. which has yet another inner zippered pouch, in front of an unsecured fullsize slip pocket to which the front handle attaches. Next, the zipped inner main section is lined on the front side and bottom with a 1/4"" layer of neoprene that protects a slightly padded slip pouch for either a full size Kindle Fire HD (with Amazon cover) or a full size iPad. Then comes the inner main section that is about 2 1/2"" inches wide. You can drop a compacted umbrella in it whithout it stretching the brief. Another zipped inner slip case follows, that barely accomodates a document folder depth wise. Next, outside the main compartment is an unsecured slip for full size documents but still within the confines of the two handles. Finally we have the main outer wall of the brief, not padded with neoprene, to which the rear handle attaches.  One more full size zip secured slip case outside the rear wall completes the brief. Through this rear outer slip case, a roll around luggage handle can be inserted (through a zippered opening in the middle at the bottom) to secure the brief to the top of your luggage carrier. I know what you are thinking and I agree, there are lots of zippered and un-zippered openings and all within a relatively slim brief.Yes, a laptop can be inserted into the main zipped compartment but it'll need to be protected in its' own slip case, and then you run out of room for anything else except for a few relatively thin file folders. And if you carry a laptop inside, forget the umbrella.Supplied shoulder strap is excellent but I tend not to use one.Finally, and reason enough (for me) to buy Tumi, is that it is very well made out of supperior materials; Zippers are strong, clips for the shoulder strap are robust, nylon material is thick, and the leather handles are smooth and well finished. It'll last another 10 or more years of daliy use.One last nice touch, inside the front zippered large pocket is a Tumi barcode that links this piece of luggage to your Tumi account once registered. A phone number is supplied that will assist the 'finder' in conjunction with a snapshot of the barcode in returning the lost brief to its' owner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7N2LTULAA3HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AX63CJM#wasThisHelpful","R7N2LTULAA3HZ","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I prefer the anvil pruner over the F2, F7, or the F8 bypass cutters, (I have the F8). Though the side cutters are robust, I've actually sprung the blades apart with some tuff material. That said, the pointy bottom blade of the bypass pruner is great for getting into tight spots.

Felco pruners are built so well they should last forever...and the blades are replaceable.If you are a purist, then here are a couple of professional recomendations to help sway your decision:""Anvils provide one blade that is pushed up against a flat surface. These are less expensive and are good on dried wood. Some experts also believe evergreens also prefer this type of cut. Bypass pruners allow you to cut larger branches."" (I'm not entirely sure I agree that Bypass pruners allow you to cut larger branches and Felco anvil's are Not less expensive!)According to the Master Gardener Foundation of Washington State University, anvil pruners ""have a tendency to crush rather than make a smooth cut"" when cutting back branches.""If still undecided, buy one of each from a less expensive manufacturer and try them out for a year......I have a professional carpenter background and appreciate specialized tools for different needs so, I like having both for different applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4RRU1EP7D78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0020JW66K#wasThisHelpful","R1W4RRU1EP7D78","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wish we could upload pictures but Amazon removed this feature from the product pages (or is about to).  I'd give this garden sculpture 5 stars except for the fact that the supplied picture doesn't quite tell the story.  Looks like the animals are nose to nose doesn't it? They're not.  The noses are offset as if they were touching the sides of their noses.  This is not a deal breaker for me and my wife (for whom I bought it) thinks it's very realistic much the same way our two huskies touch noses.The fawn is painted realistically though I'm not sure where you find a rabbit the color they've painted this one. Two brown criters, though realistic, wouldn't provide the contrast in colors these two do so maybe that's why the rabbit is a sort of a verdegris/taupe. Though the description talks about using it outdoors, I'm sceptical. I just don't think the finish or colors will look as crisp after a year in the weather but this is only an opinion, not an observation.Construction is very curious in the sense that the animals are assembled from pieces, and 'welded' together. Ex; the fawn's right front leg is 'tacked' on and gaps are filled to help preserve the anatomical flow of the limb. This is most evident when you lift the piece and look at the bottom surface. I was somewhat surprised when I took it out of the box and discovered it weighs all of a pound, nothing more.In summary, it has a nice presentation. You'd swear it's larger than the size as listed in the description.

"I had some trouble (see UPDATE below) but ultimately I got it to work; For 1st time setup, follow the instructions to the letter, ex: plug the Gateway into the router THEN connect the power, and you 'should' not have any problems connecting to the internet (solid green light). The wireless connection setup to the thermostat is the same as for all the other accessories and is flawless. Once all the electronic/wireless connections are up and running, you'll have to register the thermostat and gateway via various websites then authorize emails for alerts. This is cumbersome but doable. I've set up a host of email addresses to which the gateway will send customizable alerts and all the settings are adjustable. Ok, but so what? Why do I need this? I set the cool back during the day while away, (but not too far as I have Huskies), and I suppose I could crank it back down (summer) or up (winter) if I went home sick or left early from work. It's a great idea, and it works, but I don't really need it.Somewhat unrelated but I've been trying to upload new thermostat 'Home Screen Icons'. You've seen pictures of the Prestige thermostat with clouds in the backgroung? That is a pre-loaded 'home screen icon'.  I thought this Gateway might offer an upload to the thermostat's 'options' screen but now I don't believe it's designed to provide this functionality.  Rather, info must be uploaded to the thermostat through the USB port on the bottom of the thermostat. I have uploaded an Installer logo but it doesn't transfer to the thermostats home screen. If anyone has any ideas on how to do this, please let me know.UPDATE: I still love this thing EVEN THOUGH I just had a negative experience. I had my HVAC duct work guy over to make some modifications for a new electrostatic air cleaner and he turned off the power to the HVAC system. His work done, he flipped the switch and Everything started back up without a hiccup, the new Prestige thermostat, the Equipment Interface Module, all the peripherals, including a remote control, outdoor and indoor sensors, and, seemingly the Gateway. But then I started to get emails that my Gateway was no longer able to communicate with the system. A quick inspection revealed that all was right with the Gateway, all greens, (power, internet, and Red Link to thermostat). But the emails kept coming and I could no longer control the thermostat remotely. Removal of the Gateway (through the Wireless devices screen) and reconnecting to the thermostat did not fix the problem.  Finally, I entered the thermostat website, DELETED the Gateway account, and re-registered it. This Worked. Remote access is restored. Maybe there's an easier way to restore functionality but I'm not aware of it. Do I have to do this every time the power goes out?

"Just wanted to drop a note about the 'care and feeding' of this excellent dehumidifier.  When it works it puts out a prodigious amount of condensate. But mine only worked about 3 - 4 yrs before I began to notice a drop-off in output. Both Sylvane and Therma-Stor have been wonderful to work with....but finding someone to work on it has been a chore, and its not over yet.Turns out I was on the Last day of the 5 yr sealed system warranty but Therma-Stor had no problems honoring the 5 yr warranty.  Given this thing weighs a goodly amount, I can envision a host of problems packing it up securly not to mention the cost of sending it to Therma-Stor for repair. And Therma-Stor agrees. They told me to take it to any local appliance repair facility (none of theirs in my area) and they would send them the parts, making me responsible for labor only. After all it is quite simply a standard refrigiration unit that works really well at collecting condensate. Easier said than done. The first place I took it was highly rated but I called ahead just in case and they said ""bring it in, we'll take a look at it"". They had it over two weeks before they decided there wasn't any profit in it for them and told me to come pick it up. The thing is, they apparently make their profit on parts, and mine were covered by the warranty.I have other repair options (brother in law in HVAC business) and will pursue these, but Therma-Stor is proudly a business that puts the customer first. I emailed the repair recomendations to my contact at Therma-Stor and here is the response I received from him this morning;""Mark, Thank you for the kind words. It was my pleasure to help out in any way that I can. That is why we are here. I will process the order to have an evaporator coil sent out to you so that a repair can be made.""Several days later and I have a brand new evaporator coil.Thank you Therma-Stor.But if yours ever starts to go bad on you, don't hesitate (like I did) to let them know.UPDATE: Brother-In-Law has the unit and the new evaporator coil. He actually seemed delighted for the opportunity to tinker on something in the workshop. But from another review I read whose evaporator also went bad, it seems some repair facilities just don't want to burden themselves with this kind of work.

"I'm kind of a Titanium 'fan boy' but with good reason. Titanium is truly a wonder metal and excels in lots of applications. It's light, strong and corrosion resistant/proof. Bing/Google/ it or look it up on Wikipedia and I think you will be amazed at its' qualities.Titanium products are also more expensive but with normal use you'll never need to replace them.About the design of this product, the spoon side is a little wide and deep but ok. The fork side is perfect with the tines slightly rounded at the tip. One edge of the fork side is slightly serrated and does not work well as a knife but I get through pizza crust without any trouble, (yes, I eat pizza with a fork, sometimes). You may find the curve a bit of an issue to hold on to but I got used to it. Finally, given titanium is so strong, they didn't need to make this thing very thick so there's not a lot of volume to hold onto. This is kind of hard to describe but it's very thin; not at all like holding on to a piece of stainless flatware.So it has limitations, but given it's one utensil trying to do the job of two if not three and to everyone's satisfaction, I think it's a perfect compromise.Finally I'm never without a utensil at work.  While others scramble for extra plastic utensils, I'm set.

"I rate this five stars because of how well it does what it's designed to do. Please don't expect it to cut tall grass or even cut very evenly. But, for quick touch ups on mostly level or evenly graded slopes, it does exceptionally well. The blades are 'perfectly' aligned and the cutting action is smooth. Sounds kind of like continuously closing a large pair of shears.I haven't tried to adjust the depth of cut yet, but it's set at about 2 and 1/2 inches which is fine for me. And being so narrow, I'm not recommending it for anything larger than postage stamp size lawns.It's solidly built and should last many years if it's kept out of the weather.

"(Pls Note, I've posted pictures to help illustrate the following review):I wasn't quite sure what to expect but wanted something fast. As a result, and as a first offering, this product may not ultimately be the best choice of a screen protector for the D7100.  Some have argued ""Who needs one? It already has a Reinforced Glass screen.""  But I have also read how the traditional 'stick on' protectors have cracked, taking the brunt of a mis-directed blow, saving the oem screen below. And the oem Reinforced Glass on the LCD screen is not scratch proof. So I say scratch the protector, (if you can), and change it later at a fraction of the cost.The protector comes with main screen and eye piece protector in one unit (stock photo). To install, you have to remove the oem rubber viewfinder eye pad and slide the new 'unit' down over the viewfinder, (there are grooves down the sides of the viewfinder to line it all up). This centers everything up really well and sort of locks it all in place though there is no satisfying 'snap'.  However, the main LCD screen protector is a frame-like appliance that has no grooves to hold it in place.....it just sorts of sits on top of the main screen, or rather on the flocked edges of the integral frame. The frame holds the new screen protector off the oem Reinforced Glass by about a sixteenth of an inch. This creates the shadow box effect I referred to in the title. So while it all seems to sit in the right position, the new protector's frame doesn't completely seal over the oem Reinforced Glass.  One bottom corner does (right), the other does not (left). Disappointing.  To complete the installation, the oem rubber viewfinder eye pad, slides down over the new viewfinder cover in a sort of stacked assembly.  This actually seems to work quite well Except for the fact that the oem eye pad doesn't seem to slide down far enough...leaving the top edge of the rubber pad exposed and not at all flush with the top edge of the new protector.And last, the little piece of Optical Glass that covers the top window really is a stick on piece, is cut well for the location, and fills the recessed cavity perfectly. No complaints here.This item is not nearly close enough to perfect and I will continue to look for better D7100 screen protectors.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5KOFL2B2GG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6NKOK4#wasThisHelpful","R1G5KOFL2B2GG5","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This filter does its' job well in use on my Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Nikkor Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DX-Format Digital SLR Cameras. I guess my most helpful comment would be that I have purchased 4 B+W filters of varying sizes and all have been flawless in construction and use.  They screw down tight and don't bind all the way to fully seated.  I haven't had an opportunity to compare this to other high priced filters but the B+W reviews were (consitently among) the best so my confidence level is high.

"After 5 or 6 paper towel holders, most recently the ZACK 20702 ADEO kitchen roll holder that just didn't suit my needs (explination below), and before that the Lifetime Brands 4536AS Stainless Steel Perfect Tear Paper Towel Holder that lasted Maybe a year, I'd begun to loose hope that MY perfect paper towel holder existed. First a word about Zack products.  If you are mechanically inclined, you can tell simply by examing their products that they use only the best materials and put a lot of thought into how the products are constructed.  Case in point, the Zack paper towel holder mentioned above is, I think, a marvel of engineering. It assembles simply, ingeniously, and is built to last forever (all components are solid stainless). However, it is way too tippy for me, requiring two handed operation and is not suited for use with the larger rolls of paper towels.So with some trepidation, I ordered this paper towel holder. I suppose you're asking; Who in their right mind would spend over $100 on a paper towel holder? A couple of points prompted me to at least look at 'cost no object' products; 1) I'm ired of replacing things that are planned to wear out...that's just not right. 2) Nothing out there seemed to work well, or had some sort of limitation.In my opinion, this product is not worth the asking price. Having said that, I am once again, amazed at the degree of engineering design that went into this Zack product. The parts fit together like hand in glove, The function is flawless, and with care it will last forever. The product from start to finish was designed to be adjustable to whatever size of paper towel you are using. It accommodates anything smaller than and up to an 11"" tall roll and the flapper arm adjusts in and out 'automatically' to the shrinking size of the roll as it is being used. The foot print is essentially no bigger than a large paper towel roll and in my smallish kitchen that's perfect.  And it Doesn't Move! You can can yank paper towels out of it all day and this thing stays glued to the counter. Under the SS base is a vacum mechanism that is unique.  The rubber gasket it sits on is made out of some sort of material (neoprene?) that feels slightly tacky to the touch, though it is not sticky....it just molds well to any non porous surface. Once in place (cause it's not going to go anywhere), grab hold of the base with both hands and rotate it until you get a satisfying snap. While the whole unit is relatively light in weight compared to holders with 'weighted bases' this thing is welded to the the counter.Yes, I'm glad I bought and tried it if only to write this review for you. And yes, I'm keeping it. No I don't work or Zack or any of its' affliates :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBA5AQ8C2O3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00544V5MY#wasThisHelpful","R1KBA5AQ8C2O3R","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of new 'High Tech' kitchen knives out that sell for $hundreds$. Even Henckels offers a variation on this theme. But for my wife's money,(the chef in the family), why mess with a good thing. We've had Henkels Twin Four Star knives for probably 20 years and to her they just feel right, hold and edge, and are effortlessly sharpened. So why did I buy her a Twin Star II instead of the older Twin Star? I liked the SS end cap.Upon inspection, the blade has been reshaped a little to be a bit broader toward the tip but otherwise it's a wonderful SLICING knife. It's the one knife she goes to more than any other; kind of a cross between a paring knife and a chef's knife, (so expect some fexability in the blade). The only thing I'd improve on is the length. 6"" can be a bit short for some applications. So guess what I did, I bought her an 8"" Twin Four Star II as well. Turns out she loves this one just as much :)The 8"" is more to my liking. I thnk the extra 2 inches are handy when trying to slice through a boneless ham for instance. But here again, the blade is flexible at 6"" and even more so at 8"". Not a chefs knife, but it does 99% of what we need it for in our kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC4DEGKA7ZHOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FMVS04#wasThisHelpful","RC4DEGKA7ZHOM","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this product. It's simple and extremely well made; all solid stainless steel and very evenly and softly brushed.  It just doesn't lend itself to the larger rolls of paper towels.  The roll pictured is probably one of the smaller (fewer sheet) type rolls and certainly isn't 11"" tall.  So getting the wider rolls on presents a real challenge. And at 5"" the base is really quite small in diameter. An 'oversized' Bounty roll is just under 6"" and so would hang off at first, (if you could even get it on). And yes, it's tippy making two handed operation a must.So, Very well made of High quality materials to be used with small or medium size rolls only.It's hard to rate this product. I would give it a 5 on materials used and engineering alone but it's advertised on the ZACK website to work with All sizes of rolls, which it doesn't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZFOTX615821/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NN1W88#wasThisHelpful","R31ZFOTX615821","A31K6XBC9DQWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31K6XBC9DQWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With multiple POVs, Tiny Pretty Things makes us see ballet in a whole different way. With girls having such high hopes for a lead position, non-stop training, and backstabing at every corner, this is definitely an intense novel that's filled with drama. The only problem that I had with it is that it was a little too immature for me.You have Gigi, Bette, and June who are completely 3 different girls going to a prestige and exclusive ballet school with dreams of becoming the lead for some of the largest pieces that are put on stage. But with the weight ins, family issues, and trying to keep your head up high at the same time, it is not as easy as it seems. When girls get hurt, they have come back up and show that they are worth being on stage because of their dreams and their family's dreams.I was shocked at the pave in which this book was written. The characters made me wish that the society wouldn't be so hard on them but having them fight with their inner self and having all the confidence they could get was actually motivational. But the moments where those ""teenage love"" came out weren't for me. And I am not sure if it was the way it was presented or just me but I did not find them interesting.

"I LOVE THIS BOOK. It is truly inspiring. Ever since I was a little young, I have had some struggles with confidence and my overall self so this is just proves that you have to teach young women from young age to be truly to themselves and not worry the world and what its standards are.

"With so many different views on ""Gluten--free"", GMOs, and other factors that have been considered in the food industry, it is hard to tell what is true and what is not true when it comes to this industry. Mark Bittman tells us how it is on where the food comes from, where this whole industry is going and how everything reflects our future and the future of children.As knowledgeable as this was, it was a little hard not to feel like Bittman just wanted us to stop eating all of the ""junk"" all together and just eat the plants that we grow in our house. I understand the whole aspect of having this mindset and I have thought about it. More often we don't think about how the food is produced in the first place, especially when it's processed.

"Quote: ""Consequences have actions. We all own a piece of the blame - but only a small piece, because we wouldn't have made those bad decisions if someone hadn't put us down here in the first place.""Everything starts with pain.Girls wakes up what feels like a coffin and tears up her retrains. Something woke her up. She tried to get out of the coffin and ends up breaking the lid. After discovering others that laid there just like her, she decides that need to get out of that place and fast. All of them don't remember anything but have slight fuzzy memories that come up on surfaces. They look like adults but it couldn't be possible - it's the day of their 12th birthday. Salvage becomes the leader and she doesn't know anything that could be more perfect for her, even though she has doubts. After stumbling on another groups of ""kids"" , they try to figure out the tunnels and avoid areas where the skeletons and bones are not as bad.The story itself is hard to summarized without any spoilers because after you know the truth, everything just makes sense! In the beginning it's pretty unclear what happened to them or what the world building actually includes. But it doesn't make the book boring, the actions and the discoveries of kids' memories is exciting and made me fall in love with the book.

One of the interesting things that I have found about this is that the texture of yogurt itself could make the dish very different.

"Ever since I heard Jim Gaffigan's ""Hot Pocket"" set, I always think of it when I see hot pockets in the store. That's how addictive and memorable Jim Gaffigan is. The thing about him is that he doesn't repeat anything and does his own thing. Lives in NYC in two bedroom apartment? Why not! Oh and with 5 small children? Well, guess that will do.Dad Is Fat is filled with short, two-minute sets in which Jim tells us about his crazy life. Even though I don't have kids myself, I still found it very entertaining and relateable. I have tons of favorites but one of the ones that really made me laugh like crazy is the chapter called ""Oh My God, You're Pregnant""? We say ""Congratulations"" when we see a pregnant woman, but there is usually an element of scandal associated with it. Pregnant women are either too young or too old, or it's too soon after anther pregnancy, or she's going to get in trouble at work. She's too poor, too rich, too successful, too skinny, too fat, too crazy, too busy, too single, too married, too too.There's really tons of funny moments that made me laugh out loud and I really enjoyed it. One minor thing why this wasn't my favorite book is constant repeat that he has five kids and always likes to eat. Although it's all true, I would have liked to listen to broader aspects of his life. It might not be a big deal to some people and I still really enjoyed the book and recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P75GE3O7EX5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5MRG6O#wasThisHelpful","R3P75GE3O7EX5Z","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first - Camp Utopia and the Forgiveness Diet does have fat jokes in it. Yes, it is about fat camp. About a very insecure, overweight girl who focuses way too much on her weight and avoids the problems that are going on in her life. Throw in a trip that she didn't want to fat camp, her neighbor that she had crush on doesn't want her, and a dad who left years ago and never contacts her? Oh yeah, let's not forget her mother who always talks to her about losing weight and eating less.So, yes. Fat camp. The place where kids dreams go to die because their parents have other things to do other than show their children how to control their diet. Story started out funny enough, with Bethany being an innocent girl who just wanted to be happy and felt ignored and out of place. So when she gets to Camp Utopia, she's the heaviest girl there. Again, soooo out of place for a sixteen year old. I found it very interesting that the author never actually tells us her weight.Long story short, Bethany rebels and runs away with her new friend Cambridge and refuses to go back and follow the camp's routine that's been set in place. The problem with this part of the book is that I take my fitness and nutrition very seriously, so for her to completely ignore it and turn back because it's ""too hard""? I don't do excuses when it comes to getting your body healthy and in shape.But then Bethany opens up and I see her from a completely different side. The struggle that she went through, how everything in her past effected her decisions and why she is insecure. & I started to feel more respect for her. Actually seeing the change at the end was incredible and I'm glad that I stuck around longer to find out how it ends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24O66C7UQ76RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940192315#wasThisHelpful","R24O66C7UQ76RT","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chopped is one of my favorite Food TV Shows out there. It always mesmerized me how the chefs could create something astonishing from just one basket filled with random ingredients.

For example, The Chopped Pantry has a list of different ingredients and spices that chefs mostly use and are listed under categories.

"Filled with family traditions, culture, and Jewish folklore, The Angel of Losses is definitely a book you do not want to miss. Jewish myths and legends are very unfamiliar to me so reading about the White Rebbe and get to know the actual rituals was really interesting.In the book we are introduced to Marjorie, a young woman who lost her grandfather but always been close with him ever since she was little. Ghost stories always fascinated her so when she gets ahold of her grandfather's notebooks filled with stories that tie closely to Jewish myths, she loses herself in the research to try and find the truth. Meanwhile, she is getting further away from her family, especially her sister. Will this bring them together? Can her dreams really mean something? Marjorie goes through centuries worth of history to find the answers.The Angel of Losses was definitely not what I expected.

It didn't hold my attention for long enough to care.I don't even know where it went wrong. The story started out exactly how I thought it would - cute and fun, with Gemma being the best MC ever. But then she goes to spend summer with her dad and that's when she becomes a completely different person. She is way too focused on some drama that happened when she was 11 and by pretending to be someone else, she tries to fix mistakes that she made.I started to skim through the pages after about 60%.

"“Call it sentimentality. Call it curiosity.Just don't call it madness.”Her Dark Curiosity was the perfect follow up to the Madman's Daughter series. I actually think I liked it a lot better. Few months after Juliet returned from the island, she is now living with Professor who makes sure that she has everything she needs. No longer a maid, she is now considered an established lady who can marry without having any drama in her life. But then people start dying all around her. People that hurt her in the past. And she knows that this is personal.When she sees Edward, one of the creatures that her father created, she knows that they are very similar. And while trying to figure out the cure for each other, the beast has to be in control. With so much political drama and the group of people hunting Edward, the monster within her might not be quiet for long.First of all, I'm so glad that I decided to continue with the series. The first book was a little too slow for me but I realized that it was a perfect set up for the series. The amount of action in this book was perfect and I loved how fantasy met reality. The author shows us how crazy it would be for a woman to be a scientist back in those days and to actually work in the lab and do research had to be kept a secret. Juliet definitely did not disappoint and I really liked her.

"The idea itself is what makes a person pick up this book. I have never been so forgetful about it being sort of ""fantasy"" when every single detail was explained. The author really made us believe that this could be possible. Even someone got sick and frozen, we would be able to attach that person'd head to another body and bring him back to life.If you're still not sold on the idea of this book, try to get to know the characters. Every single conversation, every single emotion is so relatable, it's absolutely insane! If I would have been put into their shoes, it is exactly how I would have felt.We get to see the story from Travis's POV who, after years of being sick, was frozen until a donor body was found to re-attach his head. Five years later he has a different body and everything is just completely weird. Everyone is now older but he can't feel like time has passed. For him, it was just like closing his eyes for a nap and waking up refreshed. Finding out that his girlfriend now has a fiance is hard and he wants her to see that deep down, they're meant for each other.It would be easy to make this story confusing and just stupid.

"Coming from a different aspect, Fiend is a definite mix between Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. It's twisted, raw, and has all the dark humor that a person could possibly handle.When living dead come out, first the junkies think that they are hallucinating. Chase, the main character, has that rich-boy-gone-druggie symptom and have been in that hole for awhile. After killing a zombie girl with a typewriter by his friend Typewriter (get it, get it?), they go out to the streets to find survivors and some dope.I loved how expressive everyone was. A group of people trying to survive by cooking up drugs and fighting off ""Chuckes"" was really entertaining and the whole idea of drug addicts surviving was unique. I did like Chase, although KK annoyed me sometimes. He wanted a normal life, but he knew that it might never happen, now that the population has gone to sh*t.Fiend is a loud, disturbing, gore novel with strong language and sexual situations that is for the right person. That dark and twisted humor can only be handled for certain people and I'm definitely glad that I could say I never saw this side of me. Fiend brings up visuals from your head that you never experienced before and may never will with any other book.I received this book free from BloggingForBooks in exchange for an honest review.

"The ending almost got to me.. Almost.But then I shook that feeling off and continued to wonder why I'm still reading this book.The whole situation with complete NYC blackout and stuck elevator was cute. You have two strangers who were there at the right place, at the right time. But just spending a night with each other, they are completely in love. Even though there honestly haven't been as much connection as I thought it would be.Traveling the world (it's actually few countries and it's not really traveling, Lucy just ends up living there), and the US (again, not a lot of states and they more like live there too), ends up being their only connection for half a year. Sending each other emails and postcards is what you call ""their thing"", and for some reason they cannot put each other out of their heads.I didn't understand the plot. I'm not against insta-love but there was nothing here that could have made them be obsessive over each other for over 6 months, even though there was probably one conversations that could have been made out.And they think alike. all the time.IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE CUTE? BECAUSE IT'S CREEPY!Okay so maybe the story can have some work done on it. But what about the writing? Ah, that's a whole another issue. How does this sound:Chapter 29.In school, Lucy sat quietly at her desk, which faced west.Chapter 30.In between lasses, Owen paused for a moment, his toes pointing east.Chapter 31.In bed that night, Lucy breathed in.Chapter 32.In the car that afternoon, Owen breathed out.My brain hurts just remembering this part.the end.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260PKSGZMIRS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316254770#wasThisHelpful","R260PKSGZMIRS0","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a let down... When the concept of the book is so amazing that you don't know how someone could actually mess it up & that happens? Well like I said.. I'm disappointed.From the very beginning, the story itself was just.. wow. Cassie wakes up after 1,000 years discovering that in order to save her after an accident, they froze her in one of the capsules and accidentally discovered it in ruins of what used to be Cassie's world. Everything is different. The world itself was amazing, with perfect explanation of the world that they live in.But that's where the awesomeness ends.In order to actually write a successful Dystopia novel, world building is only half of the job. There are also characters that readers need to connect with and actually be interesting in their life. Cassie was not one of those characters.Hysterical.Emotionally unstable.A wreck.& those are just few things I can say about her. I mean, of course if someone would want to make me a baby-popping machine, I would freak too but she was just whining the whole time and I couldn't get past it. Also, ending felt rushed, like author gave up on the idea and decided to just wing it.

"This book was powerful. With multiple and ever changing POVs, it allowed the story to take a multi-dimensional spin that made us look from different angles. Because of the great writing, it was easy to follow the story while the characters stayed in their perfect personalities.This story was about cliches. About high school and it's drama and how something small could turn around and blow out of proportion. The rumors could ruin someones life and The Truth About Alive really showed that.I could not say anything more that wouldn't be as good as the other reviewers said about this book but I did really really love it. It made me sad, made me happy, and made me angry. Alice was definitely very likable and not reading from her POV made the story just that much stronger.ARC was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158OK98MVQ3KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVSABUO#wasThisHelpful","R158OK98MVQ3KB","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Supposedly you have an older sister and you idolize her. Then she has a secret that you need to keep. Your parents are divorced, you start high school, a boy likes you... blah blah blah.The whole summary of this book was way too dramatic than the story actually turned out. It was like watching one of those movies that had an exciting trailer but then you feel like $11 for a movie ticket was a complete ripoff because your life did not get better. That's how I felt after reading We Are the Goldens.The connection between the sisters was obvious but with all the subplots and different stories weaving in and out of the actual story, you can see that an over obsessive Nell hangs on to her older sister Layla. By the way it was written, you wouldn't assume that they're only a little over a year apart but about 10 years.I did love Felix and his relationship with Nell because they were just friends. I think that's why I didn't completely hate the book. It would have been a lot better if we could see Layla's thoughts to clear some things out. & what's up with Nell talking to ghosts, the Creed brothers? weeeeird*ARC received from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EO15MSMQ59WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H12955G#wasThisHelpful","R1EO15MSMQ59WU","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why is this getting such high rating? Why is it that Jojo Moyes is super popular & everyone wants to read & buy all of her books? Well because she made me cry with her beautiful writing & touching story.This was my first book by Moyes & I didn't really know what to expect. But right when I read first chapter, I knew I would be hooked. You have your unique but somewhat regular family. Jess is a single mother with two kids, her ex husband left 2 years ago and she's trying to meet ends. Her daughter Tanzie is brilliant! She gets offered a scholarship into private school but there is still a charge that needs to be paid off. When Jess tries to take her to Olympiad in hopes that the winnings could cover the tuition, Jess ends up going on a roadtrip with Ed, an attractive stranger who steals her heart.Now that I'm trying to write this review, I'm already missing Jess and her children. I thought it was genius to have the book written from everyone's POVs because it definitely made me connect with everyone more. I loved everyone. Jess, Ed, NORMAN!, Nicky, Tanzie. EVerything about this book made me happy. Their conversations were funny, thoughtful, and Jess's optimism wasn't over the top. Typically I don't like books are that too sweet but Jess got some wittiness to her & Ed definitely had his flaws that made me love him even more.Jojo Moyes.

"Aubrey James is Nashville's Sweetheart, a famous country singer loved by thousands of people. A daughter of famous gospel singers killed in a horrible accident. With so much fame, it is no wonder that people are always spreading rumors about her and when she realizes that she cannot be private in her world, she decides to provide an interview for a local media group about her life.Nashville Sweetheart is the kind of book that you think you will love because of the country theme & a sweet girl whom everyone loves. And that's true. Aubrey has an amazing personality of someone who went through hard times emotionally and wants to bring happiness to everyone. All throughout the book I felt like there was a ""mixed"" Audrey. A lot of the times everyone called her ""Diva"" and sometimes she did act like it. A lot of the book was also an interview style which is great when you're reading an article but not so good when you are trying to read Fiction and want to stay interested.Overall, this would be great for someone, just not me. I couldn't connect with the characters and the whole romance part of it was a little undeveloped.

"One Lavender Ribbon is an incredible story and a true modern romance. It was like reading two stories in one where you have the letters between two people in love back in WWII and the present where Adrienne was falling for Will. The amount of raw emotions in this book was so intense, I had tried even after I finished the book. Especially after I finished the book.Story begins when Adrienne moves to a new house in Florida. She just got divorced and wanted to do something that will make her feel powerful and free. Her new house is a Victorian style fixer-upper but she loves it. Then one day when she goes in the basement, she discovers old letters from WWII veteran that he wrote to Grace, a woman who used to live in that same house years ago. When Adrienne decides to find the veteran, she becomes close with them which changes herself and her whole life.I wasn't prepared for this story to change me. I wasn't prepared at all to feel like there's more out there than what I should feel like and understand that some of my silly problems were nothing compared to losing the one you love over and over and then finding them back again. I loved everything about this book and even though it was very sweet (which I'm not used to), all the characters were sincere and made me love them.

"Few months later, West has moved on with her life from being an assassin. Being an instructor and trying to go on with her life as a complete is different but she doesn't forget what she had to go through. With having nightmares of her Alt and passed away family, she doesn't know if she can ever get over what happened. On top of that, the Board knows that she used to a striker and they want to hire her to kill three teens to save their children in exchange for a good price.Divided gives us more details about the world of Kersh and its history. With explanation of why the city is the way it is and the Alt system is very detailed and it finally makes sense. This is what I didn't like about the first book because a lot of the stuff was in the dark. West herself is still the annoying teen that she was but in this book I definitely start to like her more. She cares about the people that she has in her life now and overcoming her fears is what makes me finally connect with her.The story itself is not very Dystopian driven since it's mostly driven on the plot itself.

But then she starts getting sick and finds out that she's now pregnant and everything that she worked for so hard has to disappear. Unless she makes a choice whether to have this baby or have an abortion.Sarah's boyfriend Matt still acts as if he was fifteen years old and never had a plan for the future. But Sarah's pregnancy is like a huge reality check & while she's making a choice, Matt has to go his own emotions and fears to finally understand that he needs to do the right thing.When Sarah gets a weird Christmas card from a strange lady, she doesn't give it much thought but after her first vision, she knows that it's God speaking to her, to guide her towards the right direction. Three visions that will show her what her life might be with her unborn baby and what life will be if she ends human's life. Throughout the book we see Sarah's growth and her relationships with other people. Having family on her side & still feeling the loss of her father is very raw and emotional and makes the reader feel it as well.I loved Sarah's Choice. Period. Although I thought it was a little slow in the beginning and everything was about babies, story had an amazing plot & I loved all the characters. Sarah's and Audrey's conversations were definitely my favorite. Sarah opened up and told stories about her father which made me bond to her more.

"One of the things that I realized when I received this book is that it was the forth book in the series and I have not read the first three. I was very confused at first and couldn't get into the story as much because I didn't have very good background coming into it.Once I got somewhat of a background and got caught up with the events, the rest of the book wasn't much satisfying for me. The concept itself was intriguing since Prissie could see angels but her faith still struggled. It was interesting to see the process of her faith grow but I was disappointed and pretty interrupted by the ending of the book.Writing itself was unique and interesting and I""m sure that if I read the first three books, it would make more sense to me but either way, this book wasn't completely for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ED2GC4XW715U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL0TALQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ED2GC4XW715U","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"West Grayer lives in the world where every person is genetically made as themselves and then offered the exact DNA to the next family. This way there two identical people in the world that gonna have to kill each other before their 20th birthday to determine who is the strongest and who deserves to live in the city. After losing her whole family, West has nothing else left until waiting for her assignment and she joins ""assassins"" that go under Strikers to kill twins for the people who can afford it.With a storyline like this one, there is a lot of potential for a great book but there was just so many things that didn't make sense! First of all - why is West so special? There is literally nothing that screams she's a super badass Dystopia chick who's a ninja and going to kick ass the whole time. Just no.That makes me think about why exactly Bear decided that she would be a good assassin. & if she's so good, why was she hiding half of the book from her Alt and wouldn't even man up to finish the job? Apparently she had no problem killing a bunch of other people but just someone who looks like her.Then there's this whole thing with the actual killings themselves. There is no mention of the world itself and we only know about this one city that exists and there's nothing else behind it. Like why do they even have to make twins in the first place and then have them killed? Why don't they just expand or regulate how many kids a family could have?

"Starting Bloom was somewhat of a mystery for me. I have never read anything by this author and with this book being fifth one in the series, I worried that I wouldn't be able to get into the story as much as I wanted to.But despite my fears, this was an absolutely beautiful story. Bloom is way more than just discovering yourself. It's about completely adjusting to the way you view the world, view life itself, and trying to find beauty in somewhere that's considered ""hideous"".Story begins when Sarah and her fiance James go out camping & he doesn't put out the fire. With a terrible accidents, coma, and long healing process - Sarah is stuck with scars all over her body that makes her feel like a monster. She is depressed and cannot even look at herself and knows that she has to let James go so he would be happy. But being obsessive, it's tough for him to let her go. When she meets Vasili, she knows that he would be a great friend for her. He knows what she went through and feels very open to him. If only a man could love her and look at her like the used to do before the accident...Quote: ""When we realize that the tears dripping from our eyes invisibly flow over the darkest parts of us, washing away the stains and revealing beauty we never knew we had. Real, strong beauty not shaken by even the cruelest of flames...""I still can't get over this book. In the beginning, I was a little worried that the whole story was going to be about Sarah being depressed but when we are introduced to Anastasiya, the story takes an incredible turn. Through this dying little girl, Sarah is able to see that there is more to a person than just how their skin looks or what kind of clothes they wear. All throughout this story we see the changes in Sarah's life and it's just so absolutely incredible and honest, it made me cry. Recommended for anyone who enjoys books that actually have a meaning. This is the book that makes you think about your perspective on life and what you consider beautiful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPAQJMK1LB408/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985723556#wasThisHelpful","RPAQJMK1LB408","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A thrilling and adventurous read, The Ophelia Prophecy is definitely on top of the list of Sci-Fi Romances. The romance itself wasn't your typical fall-in-love-with-first-glance type of love and the author definitely made a special effort to include the Scientific aspect of the story so it wouldn't look cheap. Yes, there was tension between main characters but I really liked how it grew with situations and time and allowed the reader to really follow their relationship with whatever happened to them.Asha was the type of girl that didn't put up with anyone's s*** and definitely stood up for herself. I liked that she still had a sense of humor and was brave, even after not remembering anything about herself. Pax was your typical hot man with that bad-boy attitude and confidence that just oozed from him. & let's not forget that he is half human, half animal so the hotness element may vary by your imagination ;)Great writing and plot, this was definitely a great read and recommended for any Sci-Fi romance readers who like a little spice with their world building.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FTDACHBLV2T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765374188#wasThisHelpful","R2FTDACHBLV2T0","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never having to encounter this author before, I wasn't sure exactly what to think about Matthew Quick. I heard a lot about his novels and after seeing this at the library, knew that I had to give it a shot and see how it goes. Oh boy... I definitely could not have predicted the experience that I went through with this book...Quote: “When something bad happens to us, something good happens - often to someone else. And that's The Good Luck of Right Now. We must believe it. We must. We must. We must.”The Good Luck of Right Now introduces us to some very interesting characters that are definitely nothing alike. You have Bartholomew Neil who seems normal all throughout the book but there is hints that he might be autistic. Along the story we meet Max, a guy who believes in aliens and is grieving about his dead cat. Oh and let's not forget the alcoholic priest with bipolar disorder and a lot of secrets.The whole story is being told by Bartholomew writing a letter to Richard Geer. It's so random and absurd that it really shouldn't make sense but weirdly, it works perfectly with the story. I can't believe how much this book moved me and how sorry I felt for the main characters.There was a scene in the story where the crew were discussing why they are weird and why can't they be normal. Bartholomew said that they are needed in this world to be weird because noone else can be. I just thought that was so beautiful and unique, it melted my heart.With that said, I think I have found my new favorite author and definitely will need to pick up more of his books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OP0AFZ5XZ7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3D5NW#wasThisHelpful","R12OP0AFZ5XZ7X","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before starting this collection of short stories, this is what the author wrote:""Stories can give you chills for many reasons. Sometimes, it’s fear; sometimes, it’s the suspense; sometimes, it’s the emotional intensity, while other times, it’s just plain old creepiness. One of the roles of fiction is to explore concepts in ways that we cannot do in real life. The stories in this collection are metaphors for fears that I or close friends of mine had to face.""I thought that was the most amazing dedication that an author could write and was absolutely in love with all of the stories. When you think of ""chills"", you may think that there are horror stories about someone dripping with blood. But this was very different stories that made you shiver because of the images your mind started to make when reading.This was genius, I absolutely loved every single one of them. My favorite is definitely short story named Karma that tells an unfortunate love story between Peter and Eve.

"Dark Luminance is an incredible story that is a mix in between of Doctor Who and The Walking Dead. With main characters being thrown into a parallel universe filled with zombies, it is action-packed and very fast-paced that keeps the reader on his toes.From the very beginning, I didn't really know what to expect from his author. With all of the scientific talk, it seemed like the author got a little carried away with all of the information. When starting a book, I like to ease into it, to make sure that I can get into the plot without being too overwhelmed. But after few chapters, I realized why the author did the beginning like this. With parallel universe, it was important to understand the background of what happened. I would have liked to see a smoother transaction.Main characters were well developed and with a fast plot, it was great to see how the description of these events planned out. The world-building itself was great and the zombies, or Psidead, was a refreshing read from all of the other, ""regular"" zombies. With a couple things that I could not have looked over, this is a pretty entertaining story that alot of zombie-lovers can find great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNJ887D5CV2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492803030#wasThisHelpful","RWNJ887D5CV2X","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Maze Runner is an incredible Dystopia book that takes us to a Maze where boys of different race and age have been taken to survive and figure out the Maze.Story begins when Thomas wakes up in a box that gets him to a field full of boys. Not knowing who he is, where he came from, or what has happened, he feels like this is familiar and he already went through it. Finding out that he in a Glade - place where the boys work and live, has shaken him up but he wants to know more and be a Maze Runner. Maze Runners are the ones that go out into the maze every single day and draw the maps that might help them escape from their nightmare.Wow. I'm not really sure what category this book goes into but Science Fiction/Dystopia is one of them. There needs to be a special genre for novels like Maze Runner, Fire & Flood, and Hunger Games. The Maze Runner offers a complex and detailed world building as well as making us wonder until the last minute what the story behind it is. I saw glimpses of the twists that were coming up but never expected what actually happened. Definitely recommend this to all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38KDK2PHGJ5AY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QE3CTY#wasThisHelpful","R38KDK2PHGJ5AY","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blood Always Tells was an incredible story about what means to lose a family and stick to them even after they are gone. It had everything. Amazing plot, great characters, and non stop action with twists that noone could have predicted.Story starts off when Dominique puts together a plan to set up her ex-boyfriend Gary to tell her the truth about his wife. Spending a weekend together should give her enough time to put her plan in action but when a guy in the mask kidnaps them and takes them to the middle of nowhere, Dominique has to find a way out.Desmond gets a phone call from his sister Dominique that she's in trouble. Ever since he turned his life around, he would do anything for his sister to ensure that she is safe and sound. But finding out the murderer can get him into a lot of trouble with the law and the bad guys and the only way to decide who is the real killer is to follow the leads.You know you read a good mystery book when you almost cry when it ends. It's so hard to find a good one too because you usually know who did it and don't even want to continue with the story. But Hilary Davidson definitely has an amazing talent for keeping the reader in the dark. I can't believe these twists actually got me, which is hard to do, and I enjoyed every single page.Definitely recommend to anyone who's been looking for a good mystery book or looking to change up the genres!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWAM46KRSY53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765333546#wasThisHelpful","R1WWAM46KRSY53","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world where two different planes and different realms exists, there is a selective group of people with gifts that can jump the realms and help people. Cantor has been learning how to be a realm walker ever since he was a boy and was blessed to have an amazing mentor who was a legend. When Cantor finally passes his final test before being a realm walker, he is set for an adventure to find his dragon, be a traveler, and make friends along the way.One Realm Beyond was nothing that I've read before. I rarely read High Fantasy books but it made me realize how exciting the world can actually be. The adventures, details, and character development was amazing. Although slow paced at times, it kept my attention and made me love the whole book. My favorite character by far was Bridger - smart, witty dragon who got into his head that he was Cantor's. Me and him could definitely be best friends! Definitely recommend for anyone who is a fan of fantasy and dragons and cannot read the next book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IK7WA6EV9TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310735807#wasThisHelpful","R15IK7WA6EV9TM","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"300 years after nuclear Earth, people that survived and now live on spaceships are ready to check if it's save to go back. With resources running out, the government decides to send 100 teenagers who are all criminals to Earth to test the environment. With different POVs and stories, the reader gets a chance to look at the adventure from different angles as well as be in the middle of action in all times.Quote: “That was the thing about secrets-you had to carry them with you forever, no matter what the cost.”The 100 started out so amazing and had so much potential! Insane plot, different characters, and an adventure that could not have been missed. But as the book went, there were couple of tweaks that I just could not have ignored. For example - Wells. He is the rich kid who got himself sent to Earth because of a girl. As romantic as it sounds, he doesn't live up to the ""hero"" status and you start to wonder why in the world he exists at all. Bellamy, on the other hand, is completely hot. Yes, we may have some anger issues but he cares about his sister and would do anything for her.As much as I try to think of the negatives, this book has a lot of positives. One thing that I really loved is that the author was able to give us those little hints of wonder that teenagers faced when they got to Earth. Hearing the birds for the first time, tasting the fresh water, and looking at a sunset with awe. These are the moments that made me love this writing. Can't wait for the next book and eventually, watch the CW series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I9U6ON02ONAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316234478#wasThisHelpful","R1I9U6ON02ONAL","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful Darkness - perfect addition to the series. Although not as good of performance as the previous book, it still held that mystery and magic that still held my attention.With Lena being upset over her uncle's death and blaming herself for it, she started to drift away from Ethan. Their relationship falters as the connection that they had before her birthday was almost impossible to feel anymore. She ends up acting like a high-hormones-acting teenager and runs away with Ridley and John Breed - hot/sexy incubus. & Ethan takes Liv and Link to try and save them before the rise of Seventeenth Moon.I fell in love with this series from the moment I started reading first book. But even though Beautiful Darkness still that magic behind it, I really disliked Ethan and Lena. They were acting like immature kids - with Ethan's jealousy and Lena's ""rebel"" stage. While following her like a puppy, he didn't even think about being with Liv!! She would have been perfect for him, specially after everything that she sacrifice.Neither to say, meeting Abraham was a surprise and with vision's that Ethan was having, it was very entertaining but I still can't get over Ethan's attitude throughout the first part of the book. At least the twist at the end really made me have some sort of hopes for the next books to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4457SOOFOW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316077054#wasThisHelpful","RS4457SOOFOW2","A1F4LQUCZO5UW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F4LQUCZO5UW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"ABS ABS ABS!That's all I could think about when I read this book. The MC was so hot, it literally made me sweat lol Not attractive but that's what this author did to me.Story about Sienna really made be a little worried for her. She is beautiful and talented but picking between career and love can be hard. Specially it's for a hot and mysterious guy like Erik. Their relationship was fast but I really wanted to be together. I couldn't stand Dave because he was the kind of rich jerk who thinks the world belongs to him just because he has money.I enjoyed author's writing and thought it was brilliant. I really wish this was a full novel instead of a short story but I do hope that Clare will consider doing a spin off on this with a whole series.

"After selecting 35 beautiful woman, Prince must choose a Princess that will join him at his throne and help him run the country.For those who are not familiar with The Bachelor show - Google it. It is the most fakest, dramatic relationship show ever with pretty girls and lots and lots awesome but ridiculous dates. Even though The Selection is based on a Dystopian world with royalty, it still has the drama between girls wanting the same guy.With a cast system in place, the country had strict rules about its government and how things were done. America was a five. From eight being a homeless person, she had hope to still manage and have a good life but all she wanted was Aspen who was a six. She knew the relationship wasn't going to work but when Aspen said that he wanted to break up with her, it broke her heart.She filled out the application for The Selection to be one of the lucky girls to have a chance to win heart of a Prince and she passed. Coming to the palace was nothing she expected but it didn't stop her from knowing that she didn't want the Prince. Even if he wanted her.With so many rebels trying to break in the palace, America is not sure where she is really safe. And her relationship with the Prince may start off as a friendship but the feelings and the intimate conversations eventually take their toll...America's character really stood out to me at first. She was very sweet, really cared about her family and her intentions were really genuine at first. I always liked the whole I'm-Going-To-Make-Fun-Of-You-Until-You-Love-Me flirt but when it turns into something more, it's kind of boring. Neither to say, story was slow at times but none of the less, I enjoyed it.

"Republicans have been worried for some time that their standard ideology speaks only to middle-aged middle-class white males. Demographics are turning against them, so may conservatives have been exploring new directions. This books is a deeply knowledgeable contribution to this process.All of the traditional ideology of American Conservatism (the centrality of tradition, adherence to Christian fundamentalism, wild-west individualism, glorification of the minimalist state, opposition to welfare) are chucked by Rubio. There are a couple of right-wing ideas he champions that I find objectionable, including opposition to gay marriage and a sustained attack on the Affordable Care Act.Rubio speaks directly to struggling Americans, and proposes social policies to help them succeed. The most imaginative is the Wage Enhancement credit, which is like the Earned Income Tax Credit, but based on individual income not family income. This overcomes a weakness in the EITC that gives poor couples an incentive not to marry. Rubio also champions online education, and faults the bureaucratic accreditation boards for creating a monopoly of mortar and brick schools that thwarts low-cost high-quality higher education.Rubio's objection to gay marriage is not religious at all. He believes gay marriage ""weakens the family."" I think exactly the opposite is the case.There is a lot of fluff in this book, but it is basically entertaining reading and its social-science based ideas are a breath of fresh air.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HT667UPIWQ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595231137#wasThisHelpful","R2HT667UPIWQ4X","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is science leading to social emancipation or to our enslavement by technologically sophisticated masters? This question has been the perennial subject of learned disquisitions. It is relatively new that they are now asked by behavioral scientists using scientific evidence. Science historian Michael Shermer’s The Moral Arc is a brilliant contributions to this contemporary branch of sociopolitical discourse.Applying scientific principles to human society is hard. Society is a perfect example of a complex dynamical adaptive nonlinear system. Moreover, it is non-ergodic: rapid technical change, increased population density and globalization mean that we cannot reliably predict the future from the past. Even human nature, forged in the remote Pleistocene, turns out to be stunningly plastic.Shermer’s The Moral Arc, while grounded in recent advances in behavioral game theory and social psychology, is a challengingly speculative book. He offers a rallying defense of science and reason as emancipatory tools in the face of bigotry, pseudoscience and faith. He too argues that humans are basically moral and cooperative, but adds that they are extremely parochial, willing to fight for and contribute to their community. When this community is threatened, people turn compassion for kith and kin into hatred for outsiders. This propensity, Shermer observes, is part of our evolved human nature and arguably always will be so.Shermer’s central point is that even evil people are generally morally motivated. Violence perpetrated against outsiders is the application of justice in the perpetrators’ minds. This justification requires that the enemy be morally inferior and the cause of a community’s problems — an excuse historically manipulated by Machiavellian leaders to gather support for their ambitions, as when the Nazis blamed the Jewish people for Germany’s economic woes. Here is where science, technology and reason come into play, Shermer argues: the growth of our global information and communications networks has rendered it increasingly difficult to perpetrate the falsehoods authoritarian leaders demand to maintain their rule. In Shermer’s view, an increasingly educated populace with access to information technology tends to undermine parochialism and pseudoscience, allowing people to judge for themselves. The role of cell phones and social media in fueling the recent Arab Spring uprisings is a case in point.This is a curious and welcome turn-around from The Believing Brain (2011), in which Shermer argues the rather nihilistic postmodern position that “beliefs come first, explanations for beliefs follow”. That would imply, for example, that people who believe autism is caused by vaccines would only listen to supporters of that belief. But in The Moral Arc Shermer, founder of the Skeptics Society, adheres to classical Enlightenment thought. The subtitle, How Science and Reason Lead Humanity toward Truth, Justice, and Freedom, evokes the call to arms of eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant in What is Enlightenment?: “Have the courage to use your own understanding.”Some of Shermer’s positions would have surprised Enlightenment writers. Kant, for instance, believed that the oppressive state and authoritarian church were the sole impediments to truth and justice. We know now that even people with access to the ballot box and a modicum of free expression can embrace intolerant and obscurantist doctrines. Moreover, Voltaire and others believed that the uneducated lacked a capability for applying reason to the affairs of life. Shermer, by contrast, is a vigorous proponent of political democracy and equal rights.Shermer’s is an exciting, emancipatory vision, but he is mistaken in thinking that truth, freedom and justice are the inevitable byproducts of scientific advance. Modern liberal democracy is indeed the product of masses of people collectively throwing off the yoke of authoritarian states. But the power of popular action was made possible by a new military technology, the handgun: this displaced elite cavalry and required nations to cede the vote to peasants and citizens, who became the lifeblood of national military defense. Despite an awesome array of modern military technology, the foot soldier with portable fire power remains the bedrock of military power. Even the United States, with its formidable drones and missiles, cannot win a war without “troops on the ground”.We cannot predict the future of technology, but we must be on constant guard against new instruments of information control, persecution and death that could once again render secular and religious totalitarianism a viable social alternative.

"Are humans basically selfish yet browbeaten by society into curbing their instincts, or are they basically altruistic yet corrupted by unjust societies? This question has been the perennial subject of learned disquisitions. It is relatively new that they are now asked by behavioural scientists using scientific evidence. Evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson's Does Altruism Exist? is a brilliant contribution to this contemporary branch of sociopolitical discourse.Applying scientific principles to human society is hard. Society is a perfect example of a complex dynamical adaptive nonlinear system. Moreover, it is non-ergodic: rapid technical change, increased population density and globalization mean that we cannot reliably predict the future from the past. Even human nature, forged in the remote Pleistocene, turns out to be stunningly plastic.Wilson's question is: does altruism, or actions mainly benefiting unrelated others at personal cost, exist? How could anyone doubt it? We give to charity, vote for public education even when we have no children, volunteer to fight and die in war. People regularly conform to social norms even when no one is looking, and sanction the anti-social behavior of others even when it is costly to do so. Yet for decades a countervailing theory has held in biology and economics.Richard Dawkins, in his wildly popular The Selfish Gene, reflects the current opinion among biologists in 1976: ""Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish."" Some 45 years later, in a letter to Nature, 134 prominent evolutionary biologists petitioned that ""natural selection leads organisms to become adapted as if to maximize their inclusive fitness"" -- meaning that even in the most highly social species, individuals limit helping others as much as possible to genetic relatives. In fact, natural selection does nothing of the kind. Inclusive fitness maximization is a pious wish of many population biologists that has never been validated in theory or fact.Wilson has struggled for decades against this received wisdom. His basic principle, delivered in a joint 2007 paper with Edward O. Wilson, is the group selection credo: ""Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups. Everything else is commentary."" So within each social group, selfish individuals will do better than their altruistic counterparts, but groups with many altruists can outcompete groups with few. As Darwin noted in Descent of Man (Murray, 1871), a hunter-gatherer band with many brave, altruistic soldiers will triumph over a group with mostly selfish cowards, even though the best thing of all for an individual is to be a coward surrounded by brave compatriots. The mathematics supports this scenario.It is fashionable to question this view, but the difficult theoretical issues have been resolved for decades. I go through the details in my article ""Inclusive Fitness and the Sociobiology of the Genome,"" Biology & Philosophy 29,4 (2014):477-515. Groups do not mate or produce offspring, and hence do not have biological fitness. Rather, the particular social organization of a species, its mating patterns and social groupings, is inscribed in the genomes of members of the species. Groups with more successful social organization tend to enhance the fitness of their members, whose genomes code for this social organization. Altruism can evolve in such groups provided altruists tend to be grouped preferentially with other altruists, in which case their biological fitness can on average be at least as high as that of selfish types.As Wilson shows, another important source of our success as a species is that human cultures stress cooperation within the group, and so punish antagonistic individuals. This has led to humans ""domesticating themselves"", favoring a human nature that is relatively docile and dependent upon the company of and approval of others. You can find the details in Ann Gibbons,  ""How we Tamed  Ourselves-and Became  Modern,""  Science  346,6208 (2014):405-406. But Wilson's book stands alone as a great introduction to the subject of human cooperation and prosociality.Moreover, humans have evolved to be collaborative, coordinating their behaviour through each member of a team ""reading the minds"" of the others and identifying with common goals. This is described well in Michael Tomasello, A Natural History of Human Thinking (Harvard University Press, 2014).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTV76GHXT3LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300189494#wasThisHelpful","R1UTV76GHXT3LY","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a synthesis of the humanistic study of human emotions, the economic theory of rational choice, the experimental evidence on human choice behavior, and Darwinian evolutionary theory. It is a deeply insightful, sensitive, and revealing book that completely justifies the notion that the humanities and the science each grows with the proper association with the other. This is not a self-help book, but if you are an aspiring artist or writer, you will learn much about human nature from this book.Feeling Smart brought to mind for me one of Yeats’ most poignant yet enigmatic poems, An Irish Airman Foresees His Death. Here is how it goes:I know that I shall meet my fateSomewhere among the clouds above;Those that I fight I do not hate,Those that I guard I do not love;…..Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,A lonely impulse of delightDrove to this tumult in the clouds;I balanced all, brought all to mind,The years to come seemed waste of breath,A waste of breath the years behindIn balance with this life, this death.We are told that we should make rational, deliberate choices, and the emotionality is the enemy of good choices. Make a list of pros and cons---balance all, bring all to mind. We are also told to follow our heart, to go for our dreams---Faint heart neuer wonne faire Lady. There is, in fact, a deep Aristotelian truth in the notion that wise choices result from an intimately intertwining of reason and emotion---which is why the young are all too often incapable of making wise choices, while the old are incapable of implementing wise choices.Winter makes excellent use of laboratory game theory, which is a development of the past few decades that links the rational actor model to behavioral game theory in an effort to tease out the varieties of human preferences, reasoning patterns, and systematic strengths and weaknesses. But Winter always relates the results of experiments back to his personal experience and the larger humanist tradition. He also makes it clear that our emotions are the product of evolution. Some of our emotions are quite primitive, including fear and anger, while others, such at shame, guilt, and embarrassment are probably purely human.As Winter shows us, anger can serve as a mechanism for creating credible commitment, enabling us to improve our strategic positions in interactions with others. … However, although anger is intended to benefit us from an evolutionary perspective, often it also harms us—not only because of the mental suffering that anger can cause, but also because of the implications it can have on our relationships with those toward whom we express our anger. We are often limited in our ability to control our anger in situations in which it does not serve us or even harms us.Also, Winter shows us how in some cases, the evolutionary advantage of certain emotions can be overwhelmed by their disadvantages in the modern world. Blushing provides a very interesting example. Regret, which has very clear evolutionary advantages, is also an emotional reaction that can have negative effects, sometimes leading us to make suboptimal decisions. If we never felt regret for any of our actions, we would doubtless be quite miserable, doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.Winter concludes that the border delineating the twin spheres of emotional and rational systems is very thin and convoluted. In most of the occasions in which we are called upon to make decisions, whether those are monumental life-changing decisions or the most mundane, that border is liable to become so blurred that it may disappear entirely. The two systems become intertwined around each other so tightly that they become inseparable. In many cases our emotions are there to enable us to arrive at rapid and nearly automatic decisions, but in other cases, especially when weighty issues are at stake, our emotions challenge our rational thought processes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNZRP29YSI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610394909#wasThisHelpful","RJNZRP29YSI7","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would give this book three stars for the amount of information conveyed if the book were not so compromised by the author's arrogance and lack of the capacity for logical thought.The argument that voters are irrational as opposed to simply uniformed is never made. The evidence that voters are uniformed takes the form of saying that they disagree with economic theory. What else is new? Voters disagree with global warming and Darwinian evolution.The argument that voters are uniformed and therefore it is better to leave decisions to experts is not cogent, because experts can be corrupted when they are the sole arbiters of policy. Moreover, the experts may have their own internal dynamics leading them to be wrong in systematic ways.The notion that voters are irrational because rational agents have no incentive become informed about political and social issues is obviously illogical. Self-interested rational voters will be uninformed, not irrational. But rational self-interested voters will not vote. But people do vote. Even if they are irrational, why should they do that?

"Jonathan Israel, Revolution of the Mind (PUP, 2010)In the late sixteenth century in Europe, thinkers began to question church authority and the unquestioned reverence for Aristotelian natural philosophy. Francis Bacon in that period lay down laws for scientific research that remain insightful to this day. Galileo, Giordano Bruno, Descartes lay the basis for a secular epistemology, and Kepler demonstrated the elliptical shape of planetary orbits.We tend to think of the resulting period of Enlightenment thought as rather a whole cloth, but Jonathan Israel rather convincingly shows that this was not the case. Rather, he argues that the early Enlightenment figures were rather conservative, wanting a reformed state and religious elite to lead the way in social progress. Four out of six of the Enlightenment’s philosophical founding fathers---Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza and Bayle--- believed that enlightened states and religions could improve the masses understandings of the world and improve society thereby. Spinoza was rather more skeptical of dominant institutions, though, although he to believed extensive structural reform of Christianity could lead the way.Turgot and Adam Smith first developed coherent theories of social progress, based on the human capacity to learn from experience, innovate technically, and to evaluate evidence rationally. This led to the idea that education and reason were all that was necessary to improve society. Political democracy thus became a possibility for the new Radical Enlightenment thinkers, whereas democracy was anathema to the earlier moderate Enlightenment thinkers.There was considerable wavering over this key issue. Kant, for instance, supported a pervasive liberalism and qualified support for the French Revolution, but was not anti-aristocratic or anti-religious.  Rousseau started out quite radical but became moderate in his old age. Kant, Ferguson, Kames, Smith, Voltaire, Hume, Locke and Turgot considered the basic social order not defective, but needing change. They argued that history has proved the value of basic institutions of church and state.The radical Enlightenment figures included Paine, d’Holbach, Priestley, Diderot, Godwin, and Bentham, who dropped the reverence for history and tradition in favor of promoting “reason”  as the basis for all social, political, and moral decisions. They believed in full individual rights, freedom of expression, democracy.Israel tells a persuasive story, though I thought for the average reader the job could have been done in about a third of the number of pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YMUHODPLG1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691142009#wasThisHelpful","R10YMUHODPLG1M","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Shermer's other books and columns, this is a very informative and engaging volume. However, his central thesis is surely wrong, or at least incomplete. Here is his central thesis (p. 5): ""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional, and psychological reasons ... after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations. Beliefs come first, explanations for beliefs follow. I call this process belief-dependent realism...Reality exists independent of human minds, but our understanding of it depends upon the beliefs we hold at any given time.""If this were true, then ""reality"" could never lead us to change our beliefs. But we do change our beliefs, often in response to new information. The really critical question is when do we change our beliefs in response to reality, and when do we not?Note that if Shermer's thesis were correct, then he believes it and all of the book is a rationalization of his pre-existing belief. Why should we bother to read his rationalizations? More generally, why ever listen to anyone's arguments about the nature of reality? they are just rationalizations of pre-existing beliefs.At a minimum, we should add something about the costs of holding incorrect beliefs. For instance, it does not much matter what a non-scientist believes about evolution, so there is no cost to being a Creationist. By contrast, a biologist pays a high cost by believing in Creationism. He might, however, believe in God at very low cost.Problems arise when people believe in wrong things even when the costs are very high. For instance, parents may doom a child to disability or death by believing in faith cures.A more difficult problem is why people ever believe in things that are uncomfortable when the belief cannot help them in some way. For instance, a devout religious believer may still reject Creationism simply because the evidence is against it.There is clearly more to be said on the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP38C30BVXNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GHN26W#wasThisHelpful","R3QP38C30BVXNV","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Stiglitz is one of the greatest economists of our time, a Nobel Prize winner, former head of the World Bank and Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. He is also seriously concerned about poverty and inequality in America. I remember well hearing him on NPR radio being interviewed on the day he was informed that he was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics: he spoke passionately and almost exclusively about the need for eradicating poverty in America and around the world.The economic argument for policies that favor the poor over the rich are very simple, being based on the universally accepted principle of the declining marginal utility of income. What that means is that  one dollar is worth a lot more to a person who makes $20,000 a year than it is to a person who makes $200,000 a year. Thus a policy that gives $1 to the poorer and reduces the income of the richer by the same amount will increase general social welfare. Some people have argued that this is a value judgment rather than a fact, but that is just wrong. It is a fact, pure and simple.The bottom half of the income distribution in America earns only 12% of total income. Why don’t they just vote to take money from the top 1% of earners, who capture about 20% of total income? If voters took away half of the earnings of the top 1% and gave it to the bottom 50%, each recipient household would receive about $14,000, a not insignificant sum.I do not know why voters do not expropriate the rich (both supporters and opponents in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries certainly expected that to happen upon the advent of democracy with universal suffrage), but there is one strong arguments against expropriating the rich: to the extent that high incomes motivate the talented to acquire and exercise skills and to take risks, excessive taxation will lead to economic stagnation.In fact, my observation of American politics leads me to a very simple understanding of voter sentiments: people care about injustice but not about inequality. The current wave of anger at the top 1% is not fueled by resentment against inequality, but rather against the injustice of the people at the top gaining while others are losing jobs and houses due to the economic elite’s anti-social and greedy machinations.There are of course societies where people care about inequality per se. But those are invariably relatively poor, clannish societies. For instance, in hunter-gatherer societies without forms of material wealth, when one family is very successful, others who are less successful will demand sharing the bounty. This of course eliminates the incentive to be successful and entails enduring social poverty of the group. In rich societies such as our own, people are used to congratulating the successful, whether sports stars, movie stars, real estate wheeler-dealers, and other celebrities. People object only when they feel success was based on some form of injustice, or the well-off are behaving uncharitably. Inequality per se is simply not something people think is wrong (except, of course, for a fringe of super-liberals, who are politically irrelevant).Stiglitz draws precisely on this sentiment in this spirited call to action for income redistribution towards the less well off. Recounting the well-established fact that the very rich have done extremely well in the past few decades while the fortunes of those below the top 10% have stagnated, Stiglitz argues that the good fortune of the winners is indeed unjust, being a reward for their inveterate rent-seeking rather that their contributions to society. Stiglitz writes: “This book is not about the politics of envy: the bottom 99 percent by and large are not jealous of the social contributions that some of those among the 1 percent have made, of their well-deserved incomes. This book is instead about the politics of efficiency and fairness. The central argument is that the model that best describes income determination at the top is not one based on individuals’ contributions to society… Much of the income at the top is instead what we have called rents. These rents have moved dollars from the bottom and middle to the top…In the United States the “Occupy Wall Street” movement echoed the same refrain. The unfairness of a situation in which so many lost their homes and their jobs while the bankers enjoyed large bonuses was grating.”Stiglitz recognizes that because the increase in inequality is due to rent-seeking rather than inexorable “market forces,” it can be reversed by ending the rent-seeking---in effect by changing tax laws. He writes “while we may be able to do only a little to change the direction of market forces, we can circumscribe rent seeking. Or at least we could, if we managed to get our politics right.” Much of the book consists of suggestions to this end. These include curbing the financial sector, stronger pro-competition and anti-trust laws, limiting the power of CEOs, eliminate “corporate welfare” in the form of subsidies to privileged sectors of the economy, improve access to education, institute comprehensive and universal health care, follow a vigorous full-employment fiscal policy, expand affirmative action for minorities, and restore the power of workers’ unions.Perhaps Stiglitz’ most ambitious suggestion is his proposal for curbing the inegalitarian effects of globalization. He writes, “Globalization and technology both contribute to the polarization of our labor market, but they are not abstract market forces that just arrive from on high; rather, they are shaped by our policies. We have explained how globalization— especially our asymmetric globalization—is tilted toward putting labor in a disadvantageous bargaining position vis-à-vis capital. While globalization may benefit society as a whole, it has left many behind— not a surprise given that, to a large extent, globalization has been managed by corporate and other special interests for their benefit. Too often, the response to the threat of globalization is to make workers even worse off, not just by cutting their wages but also by lowering social protections. The growth of the antiglobalization movement is, under these circumstances, totally understandable. There are myriad ways in which globalization could be brought back into a better balance.”It strikes me that Stiglitz’ analysis and his policy recommendations are closely tailored to what progressive Democrats in America are thinking, and to what seasoned politicians believe it is possible to attain politically. However, and while I fully agree with many of his policy recommendations, I disagree with some crucial recommendations, and there are important policy options that he does not discuss.Most important, I think it is likely that the increase in before-tax inequality that we have experienced in the past few decades is in fact market-driven rather than rent-seeking-driven. This is because there are similar trends in all the advanced market economies, the increases in income accrue to members of high-skilled professions, such as law, medicine, and management, and the most income-skewed sector, finance, as grown exponentially through increased public demand for financial services. I should note that Stiglitz himself admits that his rent-seeking thesis is more or less untenable, and he accepts it for reasons of personal taste. He writes: “It is essentially impossible to single out any one factor’s relative contribution, given how intertwined the various forces shaping inequality are; there can be honest differences of opinion. But… markets don’t exist in a vacuum. They are shaped by our politics, often in ways that benefit those at the top. Moreover, while we may be able to do only a little to change the direction of market forces, we can circumscribe rent seeking. Or at least we could, if we managed to get our politics right.”This admonition reminds me of the old saw about the economist looking for his lost keys one evening under a lamppost despite the fact that he dropped them in the bushes, explaining that there is more light under the lamppost. More to the point: if the problem isn’t rent-seeking, then you can’t reverse it by curbing rent-seeking! It would be more plausible to say that before-tax income inequality has been caused by market forces, but could be corrected by higher taxes on the rich (think of avoiding taxation as a form of rent-seeking). The problem is that the well-off already pay most of the taxes. The top 5% of the income distribution, who receive 45% of national income, pay 71% of all federal income taxes, while the bottom 50%, who receive 12% of national income, pay only 2% of all federal income taxes. There is not likely much leeway for increasing tax rates on the rich much more without generating very strong tendencies for tax avoidance and reduced economic participation of the economic elite.Another indication of Stiglitz’ adherence to the agenda of the Democratic Party is his pandering to unions. Public sector unions are especially great contributors to the Democratic Party coffers, but it is not clear that they are in any way a force for the mitigation of inequality. Take for instance the teachers’ unions, which are inveterately hostile to competition in education, and which must be pulled kicking and dragging even to allow the firing of incompetent teachers. Stiglitz repeats several times in the book that teachers are underpaid, but never mentions the fact that incentive pay is virtually impossible without serious educational reform. He does not include charter schools or education voucher plan in his recommendation for progressive policy reform.I have an alternative vision for progressive reform in America. It is not predicated on redistribution through tax laws, strong unions, or crippling the power of business and banking leaders. It is through what Samuel Bowles and I have called “productivity enhancing redistributions” (PEDs) These are policies that both improve the productivity of the economy and at the same time materially benefit the less-well-off. To the extent that a more competitive educational system contributes to the work skills and attitudes of poor youth, it is a productivity enhancing redistribution. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a productivity enhancing redistribution, as are on-the-job apprenticeship programs, support for some forms of job retraining, and support for community health programs.  Probably most such policy endeavors can be implemented without increasing tax rates.Perhaps the political types are correct in believing that productivity enhancing redistribution are not politically feasible, but I cannot imagine why not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I49ZW94FOGAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MKCQ30#wasThisHelpful","R1I49ZW94FOGAH","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jason Weeden and Robert Kurzban, The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won't Admit It (Princeton University Press, 2014)It is common to view politics in America as reflecting a fundamental split between two general philosophical world-views, the conservative represented by the Republican Party and the liberal represented by the Democratic Party. Weeden and Kurzban wide-ranging study of political preferences in American shows that this is not at all the case. Rather, there are as many political viewpoints as there are major life-styles and networks of demographic relationships. This is certainly a deep truth about American politics, and the authors present their case quite well. This is a careful, dispassionate, informative, and enjoyable read.Weeden and Kurzban analysis of this data is that people are really self-interested in their political opinions and behavior, but they sanctimoniously wrap themselves in a cloak of self-serving pseudo-morality. Early in the book they write: ""while people often pursue their interests, part of this pursuit occurs through self-deceptive efforts to portray one's own preferences and actions as not so much about one's interests, but about one's competent and generous character."" Many pages later they write more definitively: ""people ... are, in the final analysis, basically self-serving politicians in the worst sense of the word. They fight to advance their interests at others' expense and engage in blatant spin to hide their real motives, usually without even being aware that this is what they're doing.""There are several problems with this argument. First, the authors show that demographics are important, but they do not show that they so well explain the data that such a strong conclusion is warranted. The authors present difference in voting behavior and political attitudes across different demographic groups, but they don't do an analysis of variance to show the relative importance of the demographic traits they measure and the total variance in the behavior. For instance, suppose there are two groups of voters, Young and Old of equal size, the Young vote Democratic with probability 30% and the Old vote Democratic with probability 70% (I made these numbers up). That certainly is a big difference. But a simple statistical calculation (analysis of variance) shows that Young vs. Old only explains 16% of the variance in voting behavior, so there could be five other factors equally important in determining voting behavior. Moreover, they avoid standard statistical analysis in which multiple factors are evaluated for their contribution to explaining the dependent variable. Thus, cultural values or philosophical positions could explain differences in political preferences, but because they are correlated with demographics, the authors would attribute these effects to the demographics alone. A standard linear regression model could clear this up.Thus even if it were true that Democratic politicians strongly favor the Old over the Young, much more than ""self-interest"" is needed to explain the observed voting pattern. But this is pretty obvious even without the calculation. If only the poor voted for welfare, there would be no welfare. If only people who have or expect to have children in school voted for funding education, there would be no public education.A second problem with the authors' analysis is their use of the term ""self-interest"" in the title of the book and elsewhere in the book to describe what is in fact thorough-going prosocial, even altruistic, behavior. They write: ""Something is in a person's ""inclusive interests"" when it advances their or their family members' everyday, typical goals."" Perhaps one might consider inclusive interests as selfish (biologists certainly would), but later, in an effort to explain the data, they radically revise this notion, writing: ""And so our earlier notion of ""inclusive interests "" needs to be expanded further. People's everyday, real-life endeavors are enhanced by various kinds of material and nonmaterial gains, over shorter-term and longer-term horizons, received by themselves, their family members, and their friends, allies, and social networks."" I submit this is so far from ""self-interest"" as to represent a misrepresentation of the word. This is especially serious in the title of the book, which is indefensibly misleading.So what the authors really are saying is that people's political behavior is strongly affected by the social networks to which they belong. This is a nice piece of work. There is no need to distort it for public consumption. Moreover, there is nothing cynical or hypocritical about supporting the values and interests of one's social networks. People freely admit that they do this at least some of the time. When I read in the journal Nature that ""scientists should fight for better funding for science,"" I do not consider that selfish or self-serving. Quite the opposite.Another problem with the author's ""spin"" on their data is that people join social networks often out of deep moral conviction, so their morality explains their demographics, and hence the politics. The general movement is in fact probably network -> network's social culture -> individual morality -> individual political behavior. This is the opposite of the story the authors are trying to tell.Perhaps the deepest problem with their interpretation, however, is one they share with many political analysts who fail to appreciate that for the average citizen and voter, political activity cannot be explained instrumentally at all. Whether an individual is selfish or altruistic, money-grubbing or generous to others, conservative or liberal, his vote does not matter at all. In the whole history of the United States, no single voter has ever made a difference in any state or federal election. Never. And probably no single voter will ever matter in the future. Voting, becoming politically knowledgeable, and even participating in large-scale collective actions are individually non-consequential.Conclusion: a selfish individual will not vote. Even an individual who is embedded in a complex web of social relationships and cares very much about these relationship and the other individuals involved therein will not vote, unless he affirms the value of non-instrumental, non-consequential behavior. Such an affirmation is deeply prosocial and altruistic.But of course humans regularly act as political creatures who sacrifice on behalf of society even when they make, as individuals, absolutely no difference at all, any more than a single cell in your body can make any difference at all to your survival and prosperity. Humans are, as Aristotle said, fundamentally and irreducibly Zoon politikon.Go read this book, but think carefully before accepting the authors' flawed interpretation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R597U7PA681G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691161119#wasThisHelpful","R1R597U7PA681G","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Hammerstein and Jeffrey R. Stevens (eds.), Evolution and the Mechanisms of Decision Making  (The MIT Press, 2012).This volume is the result of a Strüngmann Forum workshop. The Strüngmann Forum is the successor to the very influential Dahlem workshop series, and like the Dahlem workshops, it is dedicated to bringing together high-profile researchers from a variety of behavioral science disciplines for a week-long series of discussions and interactions on a particular interdisciplinary theme, culminating in a book published by The MIT Press. Several of these volumes have been produced and are worthy contributions to the literature.This volume contains some incisive syntheses of the literature by Alex Kacelnik, Nick Chater, Jessica Flack, David Krackaur, Peter Hammerstein, and Robert Boyd. Some of the collective summary chapters, however, are needlessly combative, misrepresent classical decision theory, and offer illogical arguments supporting the capacity of evolutionary biology to displace the rational actor model in contemporary decision theory.In the opening pages the authors write: “We propose … the goal of initiating an alternative to the existing axiom-based decision theory by developing a theory of decision making founded on evolutionary principles.”  The authors call this ‘Darwinian decision theory’ and assert that this is a theory of “substantive rationality” (p. 3) because evolutionary fitness is an “external standard” for measuring rationality. I should explain to the reader (Nick Chater does this very nicely in his chapter on basic decision theory) that “formally rational” means that the choice system is internally consistent (mostly that it exhibit transitive preferences over alternatives), while “substantively rational” means that the choice system is optimally geared towards achieving some external goal, such as biological fitness, individual well-being, or foraging efficiency.This argument is needlessly combative because there are many very well documented applications of classical decision theory (I will call this the ‘rational actor model’) in biology, economics, and the other behavioral disciplines, and the mathematical decision theory based on a few simple axioms is extremely elegant and powerful. There are situations where the rational actor model appears not to apply, especially if we ask too much of it (e.g. both time inconsistency and prospect theory fit into the rational actor framework, although they require appropriate specifications of the choice space---the traditional models simply do not work in these cases). This does not mean that evolutionary theory is irrelevant in these cases. Indeed, I have spent many years using evolutionary theory to explain why humans have the particular preferences they do (especially other-regarding, moral, and political). But in most cases the rational actor model is complemented and deepened, not replaced by, evolutionary models.In cases where the rational actor model fails so that a decision-maker exhibits inconsistent choices, in the sense that he prefers A to B, he prefers B to C, yet he prefers C to A, of course we need a new model of choice behavior, and perhaps evolution can suggest one. But there are almost no such cases in the literature except where subjects are forced to make choices about things they really don’t know much about and concerning which they have no developed preferences. I explain this in ""A Framework for the Unification of the Behavioral Sciences"", Behavioral and Brain Sciences (2007)  and in the final chapter of my book The Bounds of Reason, Princeton University Press (2009) . Even where the rational actor model fails, an evolutionary approach may help us understand why, but it does not and cannot supply an alternative model. The collective authors simply do not supply real analytical model of “irrational” behavior. Imprecise verbal “why” arguments cannot serve the job of providing “how” models of choice behavior.There is one very interesting situation in which we might expect decision-makers to display inconsistent preferences. This is where an object to be chosen varies on several different dimensions, such as accuracy, weight, longevity, size, and the like. If different parts of the brain “vote” on the agent’s choice, the Arrow Paradox may kick in: something like majority rule can easily lead to choice-inconsistency. I speculate that this is more likely, the less experience the decision-maker has with the object in question. I do not know what this has to do with evolution, though.The disparaging opening arguments are supplement by a long Chapter 7, written by nine participants, the major claim of which is that “In some cases, irrational behavior might be adaptive.”  In fact, they give no examples of adaptive irrational behavior, if irrational means a violation of the axioms on which the rational actor model is based. The authors present the von Neumann-Morgenstern version of these axioms (p. 101), although the more relevant version would have be the much more cogent Savage (1954) axioms. They then argue that “the axiomatic approach fails on both conceptual and empirical grounds” (p. 104). The first conceptual problem is that the theory does not say why people have the preferences they do. This is a truly silly objection, like criticizing Newton’s Second Law for not saying why the force is what it is. The point is that it does not matter why---the theory is valid for all consistent preference orderings. The second conceptual problem, they say, is that the theory assumes that “agents are able to maximize their utility functions.” I kid you not---they really do put this up as a conceptual objection! In fact, theory proves that if the axioms hold, then decision maker act as though they are maximizing something. The supposed conceptual problem is simply non-existent. If there is something wrong with one of the axioms, the authors should say what it is. The third objection is that “decisions are typically made in a highly structured environment.” But this is no objection at all. The structure of the decision-making environment is captured by the available choice set and the probability structure of the model. Finally, our august nine authors suggest that people might get the probabilities wrong. Well, of course they might. The theory does not say that the decision-maker’s subjective prior over the implications of their choices are objectively correct probabilities.I will not go into any detail concerning the supposed empirical weakness of the rational actor model. Except for regret theory, they all are wrong (such as saying that time-inconsistent preferences cannot be fit into the rational actor model) or simply do not apply (such as when agents are making dynamic choices over time in which they can learn more about the outcomes and the relevant probabilities). To be clear: the rational actor model is not a model of learning over time at all.The rational actor model can easily withstand the fumbling and ill-considered criticism proffered in this volume. This of course is not to that evolutionary theory has nothing to tell us, but rather that it is an important tool in the behavioral scientist’s repertoire, along with many other tools, including the rational actor model, game theory, agent-based modeling, ethnography, and many others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XGSD1OBEFAM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=026201808X#wasThisHelpful","R1XGSD1OBEFAM5","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philip Mirowski, More Heat than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990.Philip Mirowski is a talented, widely read, exceptionally broad thinker with excellent training in the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities and philosophy. He is well equipped to contribute fruitfully to the history and interpretation of economic theory. In fact, as I explain below, his substantive claims are mostly wide of the mark, and even egregiously so. But first, we must understand what led him to take the shockingly intemperate and arrogant tone exhibited in virtually every paragraph of this long work?I will spare the reader an account of the ungenerous stance Mirowski assumes facing both physics and economics, but rather recall two reviews of this book. The first appeared in Methodus by UC Davis economist Kevin Hoover. Hoover writes “I hold no special brief for neoclassical economics. … Yet, reading this book gave me a slowly rising feeling of outrage. Taken as a whole, it is an outrageous book: neither the history nor the methodology is persuasive; the scholarship is often slapdash; the tone is intemperate; and the style is often obnoxious. Mirowski's hatred of neoclassical economics borders on the pathological… Mirowski strikes a flashy, bullying tone throughout the book, patronizing the reader, economists and physicists.”The second review, by D. A. Walker, appeared in the Economic Journal. Walker writes “Mirowski portrays neoclassical economics as a conspiracy to delude the public hatched by prevaricating fools… A dispassionate critique of the work of the neoclassicals, both old and new, would not destroy the perception that they were scientists. Scientists, after all, have often been wrong, but have nonetheless been scientists. To destroy the perception it would be necessary to demolish the neoclassicals' legitimacy, moral authority, and prestige in the mind of the reader, and to do that it would be necessary to destroy their dignity. That is the effect, if not the intent, of Mirowski's presentation. Whereas the reader would refer to their scientific dedication, their search for truth, their research papers and scholarly debates, Mirowski refers to their 'tiffs and squabbles', their 'contretemps over marginal productivity, periodic shouting matches over capital theory, pothers over supply curves and empty boxes, and pouts over the superfluity of the firm and the entrepreneur' (page 284). At best their work had a superficial resemblance to science; they 'were dazed into incoherence' by it; but they pretended to be scientific (page 271). As Mirowski tells the story, the neoclassicals' motives, sincerity, and veracity were questionable. They 'smuggled' assumptions; they made 'gambits'; and even the modern neoclassicals engage in 'one big shell game' (pages 273-4). Paul Samuelson, for example, is disingenuous and deliberately misleading on the relation of his work to physics (pages 378-85). The neoclassicals may have used mathematics 'to browbeat and hoodwink their colleagues' (page 249), and they concocted their theories 'surreptitiously, generally under the guise' of one or another pretense (page 273). Of uncertain mental health, they 'clutched neurotically' to their field theory of value (page 275; cf. pages I97, 243). Emerging from the pages of Mirowski's script as petty and childish, they are given to throwing tantrums, 'breast-beating, wailing, crowing, and soul-searching' (page 356), and to 'calumny and cacophony' (page 28i). They 'squirm in a most apprehensive and guilty manner' (page 287), but are also prone to 'smug satisfaction and self-congratulation' (page 356). 'Lost in the funhouse' (page 377), they caper and emote, by turns coy and assertive, naive and cunning (pages 279, 367-8, 37I). Thus, under Mirowski's expert direction, they perform exactly as he wants, deftly reduced to the undignified status of buffoons in an animated cartoon.”To understand Mirowski’s stance, we must recognize the author as experimenting with a mode of analysis known as postmodernism, which Wikipedia describes as “a late-20th-century movement in the arts, architecture, and criticism that was a departure from modernism [i.e., Enlightenment thought]. Postmodernism includes skeptical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, economics, architecture, fiction, and literary criticism. It is often associated with deconstruction and post-structuralism because its usage as a term gained significant popularity at the same time as twentieth-century post-structural thought.”The most important tenet of postmodernist treatments of science is that all truth is socially constructed. In particular, theories create their own criteria for truth, and the Enlightenment method of testing theories against exogenously given “facts” is completely discredited. It follows that one cannot compare theories by assessing their relative ability to explain the facts, because different theories explain different sorts of facts. The historian of science Thomas Kuhn is often drawn on for support of this position, although he was in fact a strong critique of this interpretation of his work.If theories produce their own facts, then the scientist who follows the Enlightenment method is of necessity deluded and even complicit in hiding the true nature of the scientific enterprise. Therefore it is perfectly appropriate to consider scientists as  fools and scam artists, and to treat their “discoveries” as deceptions no different from that of the astrologist and reader of tea leaves. Whence comes Mirowski’s intemperate and arrogant tone.Postmodernism is today mostly discredited, although it leaves a powerful residue in the older members of university faculties throughout the world. It was an interesting experiment, but its limits were carefully revealed in the literature prior to 1990. The Enlightenment method of comparing theories against empirical reality reigns supreme in most areas of natural and behavioral science. For this reason, Mirowski’s work now seems bizarre and embarrassing. If I had written this book, I would apologize. I might ask that the book be read as an exercise in (academic) mob psychology, however.Neoclassical economics does some things right and some things wrong. I have outlined my take on the theory in my book The Bounds of Reason (Princeton 2009), which includes strong support for the rational actor model, and my work with Antoine Mandel, which shows how to handle the many weakness of the standard general equilibrium model. My critique of Mirowski is very simple: the only effective critique is one that (a) shows explanatory weaknesses in some area and (b) provides a theory that conserves the correct parts of the old theory and modifies the incorrect parts so as to explain the area in question and (c) explains new, previously unanticipated, phenomena.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XEVF9I4FLJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521426898#wasThisHelpful","R39XEVF9I4FLJV","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In behavioral theory (economics, biology, etc.) an agent must have sensory inputs allowing it to assess its environment, as well as organs and other means of interacting with its environment. In addition, an agent must be capable of choosing among various available behaviors in a given context based on it store of knowledge plus the sensory information available to it. An agent must have sufficient unity as an actor that it has transitive preferences; i.e., under identical environmental conditions and internal states, if an agent chooses action A over action B when both are available, and chooses action B over action C when both are available, the when both A and C are available, the agent will choose action A over action C. When this property fails, there is no meaningful sense in which the entity can be described as an agent seeking to attain certain goals subject to its material and informational constraints.List and Pettit include all of the above criteria in their definition of an agent, confining their analysis to groups of humans that must make a single choice in a situation in which each member of the group has a preference ordering over the choice. Their concern is discovering a set of conditions under which the group’s choice represents in some meaningful sense the preference orderings of its members. This of course is the classic setting of the Arrow Impossibility Theorem. In his doctoral dissertation and later a book Social Choice and Individual Values (1951),  Kenneth Arrow showed that when group members have at least three distinct available choices alternatives and member preferences are arbitrarily heterogeneous, no aggregation of individual preferences can be Pareto efficient (no alternative to the group choice can better satisfy the preferences of some members without hurting some other members) and satisfy the independence of irrelevant alternatives (the ranking of any two choices is the same regardless of what other choices are available) unless it is dictatorial (i.e., the group choice is that of a single one of its members).This book explores the more recent literature on alternatives to the Arrow axioms that might permit “corporate agency,” by which they mean that the group choice does reflect individual preferences in meaningful ways. The literature on this is technical and tedious mathematically, but not particularly deep or interesting to non-specialists (in my humble opinion). The answers they provide are of a simple form: if we restrict the range of preferences of group members, then corporate agency is possible. For instance, if membership in the group requires that all members have certain beliefs and goals, then it is reasonable to attribute attitudes and beliefs to the group. This is fairly obvious, but nonetheless a significant result because it delegitimizes many forms of social bias and bigotry, such as attributing beliefs to all members of an ethnic group on the basis of the collective behavior of some subset of members of the group.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CW0ZX4X5OE05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199591563#wasThisHelpful","R2CW0ZX4X5OE05","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael S. A. Graziano, Consciousness and the Social Brain (Oxford University Press 2014)There are two major problems in understanding consciousness. The first is: how do we account for the qualia of consciousness---the sensation of seeing a sunset, feeling pain, hearing a symphony or a bird call. This is often called the hard problem. The second is accounting for the brain mechanisms that are responsible for being conscious. This is often called the easy problem. Of course, the easy problem is extremely difficult; it is just easy compared to the hard problem.If you are concerned with the hard problem, this is not the book for you. Indeed, I know of no scientific treatment of the problem of accounting for qualia. If you do, dear reader, please inform the rest of us. I know of no plausible philosophical treatment either, but I am not very interested in philosophical treatments.If you are interest in the easy problem, this book has a lot to offer. I am generally uneasy about neuroscientists who watch the brain light up and then try to tell us the nature of the human spirit. They remind me of actors who play TV doctors, to whom many fans turn for medical advice. But this book is extremely judicious and informative. Indeed, the book is rare in that it gets more interesting as you move into later chapters. So don’t despair if you find the first few chapters less than satisfying.Graziano identifies consciousness with awareness. He begins with the notion of attention. The mind, inundated with much more sensory information that it can handle, must select out at any point in time a small subset of signals to process intensively. This is attention. He then identifies awareness with a reconstructed model of attention in others and in oneself. The basic question is: why do we need a model of attention at all? What is consciousness for?Graziano argues that attention plus low-level cognitive processing (I suppose he means the stimulus-response and operant conditioning so loved by behavioral psychologists) are sufficient for many purposes and do not require awareness. But there is often a huge fitness gain to an organism that can decipher the nature of it environment more subtly.For instance (my example, not the author’s), take the awareness of pain. Basic behavioral psychology explains why a brain might register pain and learn to avoid conditions that give rise to pain. But consider preparing food with a sharp knife. The first time you cut yourself, your behavioral brain might instruct you to keep away from knives, but it cannot do more than that. But suppose we have brains equipped with expert systems that make high level models of the networks of complex causality involved in cooking a meal. Suppose that when we cut our finger while chopping, our attention turns to this expert system and we become aware of the multiple possibilities for adjusting our behavior so as to reduce the probability of cutting our fingers in the future. No system of operant condition could handle this adjustment process, but if we focus our attention on this expert system (i.e., if we become conscious of being in pain), then we might be able to work out a superior coping mechanism. This, for Graziano, is the essence of consciousness.I find this a very compelling analysis. Of course, it does not explain the qualia of feeling pain, but that is a bit too much to ask. Moreover, it is a purely functional explanation. It does not tell you at all what brain processes are involved. Graziano does talk about the regions of the brain in which the mechanisms producing consciousness are located, but this is extremely poorly known.This book might be supplemented by another the tracks the biological roots of consciousness. We know that members of some non-human species are conscious, including probably many birds, most mammals, and all primates. But I know of no study that attempts to explain the evolutionary process of the emergence of consciousness in animals. Perhaps some erudite reader can help me here. Of course some will say that we can’t know that an animal is conscious. True, but I can’t know you are conscious, either. We can however, list some behavioral and physiological conditions that appear to be associated with awareness of the environment and high-level problem solving. The biological roots of these conditions would be nice to know in some detail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TIACMZBL9ZKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199928649#wasThisHelpful","R3TIACMZBL9ZKJ","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remember when I was five or so, my father was telling my grandfather that he had to go to Newark, which was fifty miles away, and he could drive at a speed of 25 miles per hour, so it would take him two hours to get to Newark. I recall thinking: distance, speed, time---I know what they all are. But there is a relationship between the three---that is absolutely incredible. I had perhaps my first feeling of awe at the inscrutable unity of the world we live in.I remember that one Saturday when I was about twelve, I went to the Philadelphia Public Library and took out a book called Analytical Geometry. I had no idea what this could mean, although I knew what geometry was, and looking at the equations I saw that ""analytical"" meant algebra, which I also knew (and loved). When I got the book home, I came to a picture of circle in the plane with a caption that said that the circle was the solution to the equation x-squared + y-squared = 1. When I figured out what that meant, I had overwhelmingly strong spiritual experience of awe and reverence. I still feel this awe and reference when I deal, either in my work or teaching, with mathematics that represents reality.I recall when I first realized that the voluptuously gorgeous Orchid I gave my prom date was a member of a species that arose through evolution in dense forests where the only creature the flower had to attract was a flying arthropod. This idea took longer to sink in, but the resulting feeling of awe and reverence was all the deeper for it in my breast.My life, like that of Ronald Dworkin, Albert Einstein (who appears to have inspired Dworkin to write this book), and many other scientists, is full of such mysteries of the universe. They bombard me virtually daily with feelings of awe and reverence. My very existence, and my poignant consciousness of my existence, continually bombard me with feelings of awe and reverence. And gratitude.The point of all this is that I believe I feel exactly what Dworkin describes as ""religion without God,"" except that, unlike Dworkin, I am not an atheist. I do not have an active belief in the non-existence of God, but rather doubt that the wonder of the universe, and our place in the universe, could be explicable unless we are the product of an intelligence of higher order than ourselves. One of Dworkin's most ingenious arguments is that the fact of God's existence has no moral implications, for the much the same reason as given by Hume for the fallacy of passing from fact to value.What Dworkin calls ""religion"" I believe is better expressed as ""spirituality,"" which is a human capacity, much as our physical, cognitive, aesthetic, and moral capacities. Moreover, when we think of spirituality as a dimension of human awareness that allows us to fell awe and reference in experiencing the universe, I believe the argument for the validity of our assessment that the spiritual world is a real realm of being becomes easier to state. Indeed, Dworkin makes exactly such an argument, and with great force. The argument is that spirituality is a human capacity as much as cognition (and aesthetic appreciation), so there is no more reason to question its reality than that of the product of our cognitions, and in particular, than the reality of the physical world around us. Of course we could be wrong on one or both counts, but it is a denial of our sense to deny the existence of the spiritual dimension of our lives. You can no more convince me that the spiritual world is imaginary than you can convince me that colors do not exist.I have one problem with Dworkin's analysis. Dworkin considers morality to be a part of ""religion"" as he conceives it (I would call it spirituality), whereas I think morality is the product of human evolution. The capacity for moral conception is a distinctly human capacity and has nothing to do with our spiritual capacity. Many people are deeply spiritual (religious) but horribly and grotesquely immoral, and many deeply moral people virtually never operate on a spiritual plane. Some established religions have falsely claimed to have authority over moral judgments, but that appears to me to be just stupid. The idea that what I am allowed to eat as moral person is dictated by some God is pretty absurd and petty.I confess I don't much like books about theology (just smoke and mirrors), but this book is pretty interesting and thought-provoking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G2SZKVPEZJR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674726820#wasThisHelpful","R1G2SZKVPEZJR3","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Churchland, who is both neuroscientist and philosopher, tries to accomplish two goals in this book. The first is to tell us what modern neuroscience has to tell us about the brain and its relationship to human behavior and consciousness. The second is to do so in a popular language that conveys the information accurately without the professional message delivery system as found in the professional journals. Now, I have nothing against the professional manner of communication, but it in fact as difficult to understand as some of the biochemical terminology that is known only to those who deal with it every day in the lab.For an instance of successful communication, Churchland says to the reader, ""You are not just a big rat,"" by which she means that studies of neuronal structure and hormonal pathways that describe rat behavior do not necessarily transfer to humans. You have to be really dense not to understand this. Otherwise, why could she possibly want to tell us something that we all obviously know. None of her readers has fur, whiskers, and a tail. Nevertheless, you will rarely find in an academic article a sentence like ""humans are not just big rats,"" and for good reason.Like many people, I am deeply fascinated by the nature of the brain and what it tells us about human nature and behavior. As a young academic, I turned to the French phenomenology philosopher Merleau-Ponty, who analyzed the neurological science of his time with prescience. When Oliver Sacks came along, and the incredible movie Awakenings (Robert de Nero and Robin Williams), and I have followed the literature ever since. With increased popularity, however, has come a huge amount of what one might call ""neuro-woo,'' literary and romantic excesses of interpretation that mix a few facts from scientific studies with a large dollop of the author's own half-baked prejudices and wishful-thinkings. Readers are not well served by neuro-woo. Churchland is a sustained antidote to neuro-woo.Now some readers have faulted Churchland with being a ""reductionist"" because of her avoidance of neuro-woo. I think this is a misdirected criticism. Of course the brain is a complex dynamic adaptive system with emergent properties beyond mere communication among synapses, just as a computer is more than a bunch of electrons shuttling back and forth among solid state devices. However, we can say exactly how a computer goes beyond electron dynamics because we have well-developed models of computer architecture and dynamics. We know virtually nothing about the larger structure of the human brain.Where is consciousness located in the brain? Churchland's discussion of consciousness in mammals, and its specialization in humans, is authoritative and very enlightening. Consciousness is, however, distributed over the whole brain, and we haven't the faintest idea how that works. We can locate a single structure in the thalamus that, when disabled, deactivates consciousness, but that is about it. Churchland conveys this quite clearly. However, her presentation of the comparative anatomy in the brain of mammals strongly supports the notion that the origins of consciousness go back to the evolution of the class Mammalia, and all the major known brain areas involved in consciousness have remained essentially conserved over this evolutionary period.Churchland is a delight to read, she is very informed in several fields, and unless you have some sort of personal chip on your shoulder, you will appreciate this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K69GTN1UFSJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393058328#wasThisHelpful","R2K69GTN1UFSJ8","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the information available to an animal that will be used to survive and thrive in a complex environment is transmitted from parent to offspring genetically. Some, however, is transmitted epigenetically through teaching, and some is acquired through the animals personal interactions with nature, other animals, and conspecifics. The latter two forms of information acquisition are called social learning. This volume is a highly sophisticated yet clear hands-on manual of what one needs to know to do professional level research in social learning.

"""Morality seems to me to be a natural phenomenon--constrained by the forces of natural selection, rooted in neurobiology, shaped by the local ecology, and modified by cultural development."" So Churchland summarizes this book. I am totally in sympathy with this view, which Churchland supports with clear and logical argument supported by copious notes and references. Churchland's own formulation of human morality is not original and subject to some dispute. For instance, she grounds human morality in empathy/compassion as it develops in the family. There is no evidence, however, that human family life is very different from that of many other species, including several primates and many passerine birds. The notion that the capacity to cooperate with strangers, which is surely a foundational element in our success as a species, flows from empathy and compassion as generated in the family is almost certainly wrong. For plausible alternatives, see E. O. Wilson's book The Social Conquest of Earth, not to mention many papers and books mentioned on my web site, as well the work of Sarah Hrdy and her colleagues on cooperative breeding. Churchland knows this material well and refers to it in later chapters, but does not consider these perspectives to cast doubt on her empathy/compassion story.This book rates high for its cogency and transparency in presenting and critiquing the literature on the sociobiology of morality, but the title is misleading to the point of being  false advertising. Neuroscience may in the future tell important stories concerning human morality, but in its current state, it can do no more than asserting that this or that portion of the prefrontal cortex lights up under this or that situation of moral choice. I do not understand why we should care what region lights up under what conditions. Of course, if the disgust region and the contempt region seem to be the same, this might suggest some evolutionary pathway through which disgust (a non-social emotion shared with many omnivorous mammals) becomes contempt (a social emotion shared with few if any other species). But to say that Churchland's insights flow from her understanding of neurobiology is quite far-fetched. Indeed, the most important contribution of her training in neuroscience is to deconstruction popular interpretations of recent brain discoveries, such as the notion that human mirror neurons explain human theory of mind. This is very useful material indeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OHKHYW2UP2I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691156344#wasThisHelpful","R2OHKHYW2UP2I4","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The message of this book is eloquently expressed by a blurb on the back cover of the book: ""In the wake of World War II, a generation of self-proclaimed 'action intellectuals' fought to save the world from nuclear Armageddon. They nearly destroyed it. This extraordinary book explains how and why a generation of American social scientists reconceived human reason as algorithmic rationality---and how, when they did, they delivered us into a world that remains anything but rational.""In fact, and despite the almost unethically misleading title, the book does no such thing. Indeed, it could not because there is no systematic discussion of actual Cold War nuclear policy in the book, and the academics involved did not advocate disastrous policies at all. The issue of algorithmic rationality was extremely important for defense reasons, because nuclear alerts were signaled by computers with sophisticated sensors. But the rational decision theorists and game theorists did not suggest that rule-bound computers should dictate when to launch thermonuclear war.The book does suggest that these ""action intellectuals"" conceived of the Cold War as a prisoner's dilemma in which the only rational action was to defect (launch the bombs), but in fact (a) the Cold War was closer to a game of chicken than a prisoner's dilemma; (b) most of the intellectual participants recognized this fact; and (c) very few, except the extreme hard-liners, motivated not by a crazy academic theory but rather by their hatred of Communism, suggested a preemptive nuclear attack.It would be difficult for me to convey to you, dear reader, the vast gulf between the intellectual credentials of the authors of this book and the quality of the final product. A couple of chapters are perceptive and well written, but most are just a hodge-podge of mundane description and speculative excess.

"George Santayana one famously said ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" Perhaps even those who remember the past may be condemned to repeat it, unless they learn sufficiently from it. Borrello adds a bit to the well-known history of the debate over levels of selection, but he does not help us understand what the real issues are, and how they might be resolved. Perhaps it is not his fault: the whole issue seems to be a hopeless muddle even in the hands of the most adept contemporary thinkers--present company excepted, of course. ;)Biologists have debated the nature and status of group selection since the early twentieth century. The debate continues. Curiously, there have always been both extremely eminent supporters and equally eminent detractors of group selection, such as J. B. S. Haldane vs. Ernst Mayr (early years), John Maynard Smith vs. Stephen Jay Gould (recent past), and most recently Edward O. Wilson vs. Richard Dawkins. So pitched has this debate been that in reviewing Wilson's book The Social Conquest of Earth (which eloquently defends and extends group selection arguments), Richard Dawkins (who treats such arguments with characteristic distain) wrote ""To borrow from Dorothy Parker, this is not a book to be tossed lightly aside. It should be thrown with great force."" My more temperate and supportive review of Wilson's book, by the way, is published in BioScience and entitled The Clash of the Titans The paper is available from my web site.To add fuel to the fire, in a response to a paper in Nature in 2010 by Wilson and coauthors Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita that trashes inclusive fitness and extols group selection, some 150 well-known biologists wrote a vitriolic reply in a letter to Nature in 2010, resoundingly rejecting Wilson and coauthors' arguments. More heat, in my estimation, but less light.I am an outsider to this debate. My training and most of my research until a couple of decades ago was in mathematics and economics. But I have come to work in biology as an adult, a situation that may have allowed me to avoid the emotional baggage attached to the dispute.The group selection dispute shows the immaturity of contemporary population biology. No mature scientific dispute can sustain itself at so a high level of emotion and so low a level of progress for over a century without resolution. Indeed, most participants to the dispute agree that one can describe sociobiological behavior equally validly at the level of the gene, at the level of the individual (in a sexually reproducing species with a sequestered germ plasm), or at the group level (in species that live in groups engaged in social interaction). This admission, surprisingly, does not stop the disputants from intemperate diatribes at each other's expense.Borrello's book does a competent if breezy and non-technical overview of this controversy, with some historical emphasis on particular papers presented by the disputants at different times. He does, however, seriously underestimate the importance of R. A. Fisher in laying the groundwork for the position of the Oxford school in this research area, and he has a long, unoriginal, and irrelevant analysis of Lamarckism. However, Borrello makes no attempt to cut through the verbiage and miscommunication to put the issue into insightful theoretical perspective. History, for Borrello, is not one damn thing after another---it is the same damn thing over and over!So let me here explain what is really going on in the  controversy over group selection. Population biology is based on careful accounting at the level of the gene (this is why Ernst Mayr criticized J. B. S. Haldane's work as ""beanbag genetics""). Indeed, all of Darwinian evolution can be analyzed, at least in principle, in terms of changes in gene frequencies and correlations among genes in the genome. The two sides to the debate over group selection differ as to how correlations among genetic loci in the genome are to be treated. In the tradition of Fisher and Haldane, inspired by the mathematics of heredity developed to deal with animal husbandry, only the additive component of a gene's contribution to the fitness of its carriers need be analyzed because ""evolution only sees the additive component."" Those in the tradition of Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky, by contrast, consider the genome itself as a unit that is subject to natural selection, and it is the cooperative interaction of genes in the genome that governs its evolutionary success.This distinction is then carried over from interactions among genes in the genome to interactions among individuals in a social species: inclusive fitness theorists, the heirs to the Fisher-Haldane gene's-eye view, reduce complex interactions among individuals in a social species to simple influences at single genetic locus (inclusive fitness), whereas the heirs to the Mayr-Dobzhansky tradition take social cooperation to involve complex dynamical and nonlinear interactions (multi-level selection). The inclusive fitness adherents argue that the genome cannot be an object of selection because it is broken up in every generation through meiosis and crossover, while the gene is conserved intact over many generations. The multilevel selection adherents claim that inclusive fitness analysis ignores all the substantive complexities of social interaction that in fact account for the evolutionary success of a social species.My own studies have provided me with a third perspective. First, inclusive fitness analysis is extremely important and valid under almost all circumstances in dealing with sexually reproducing populations. Its strength comes from the fact that its reasoning is on the level of a single genetic locus. Popular expositions obfuscate this point by implicitly, without argument, treating a complex social behavior as governed by a single genetic locus---the so-called ""phenotypic gambit."" The correct analysis, that proposed by William Hamilton in 1964, shows that genes are utterly selfish in the sense popularized in Dawkins' great book ""The Selfish Gene."" What this means is that the conditions for the evolutionary success of a gene are distinct from the conditions under which it promotes the fitness of the reproduction population. Thus individual genes have absolutely no regard for the evolutionary success of the species in which they reside.For instance, take the basic inclusive fitness equation, Hamilton's Rule. This says that if an allele at a genetic locus causes a behavior in the individual (the donor) that costs the individual a fitness loss c, and provides a fitness benefit b to another individual (the recipient), then the allele will increase in frequency provided b r > c, where r is the degree of relatedness between the donor and the recipient. The total contribution of the allele to the population is then b-c, which must be strictly positive provided that the degree of relatedness is a probability (the usual case), and b,c > 0. This is because b - c = b(1-r) + br - c > b(1-r), which is non-negative. However, there is no reason to limit the analysis to b, c, and r having particular signs. Hamilton's rule holds no matter what the sign of the cost c (which becomes a benefit when less than zero) and the benefit b (which become a cost when b is less than zero). Thus Hamilton's rule says that a selfish gene that helps its carrier by hurting other members of the population is just as capable of evolving as an altruistic gene that induces its carrier to take a fitness hit in order to confer a fitness benefit on others, despite that the former reduces mean population fitness while the latter increases mean population fitness.For instance, suppose b and c are both negative, which occurs when the allele helps its carriers by hurting other members of the population. In that case b - c, the fitness contribution to the population, will be negative unless individuals interact almost exclusively with their genetic relatives. For instance, suppose b = -0.4, c = -0.3, and r = 1/2. Then b-c = -0.1, which is negative, but b r - c = 0.1, which is positive, so Hamilton's rule is satisfied.The validity of inclusive fitness theory allows us to formulate the central problem of sociobiology as follows: Individual genes are utterly selfish, yet evolutionarily successful species consist of genes that predominantly cooperate with one another (this is the reason  there is an ""appearance of design"" in multicellular organisms), and evolutionary successful social species consist predominantly in individuals who cooperate in a manner furthering their joint biological interests. By the very fact that inclusive fitness theory abstracts from interactions among loci, this theory cannot help solve the central problem of sociobiology.The irony in the debate over group selection is that the theorists involved in the debate fight endlessly over it even though they know that there is nothing to fight about, while the onlookers, such as those tempted to read this book, believe the debate must be over something real and of momentous importance. Usually, onlookers think the debate is about whether ""biological altruism"" can exist, and more specifically, whether human society is based on self-interest or truly moral behavior. That is a very important question, to which Samuel Bowles and I devoted a whole book: A Cooperative Species (Princeton University Press, 2011). We conclude that our success as a species is based on the essential morality embedded in human nature. But this has nothing to do with the group selection debate as it is properly formulated. We argue in this book that the fact that humans evolved in small groups (hunter-gatherer societies) is central to the evolution of human morality, but our analytical models are equally well described in terms of inclusive fitness (applying the phenotypic gambit) and multi-level selection. Indeed, the models themselves use neither concept, but are simply sets of equations that represent plausible dynamics underlying the current constitution of the human genetic structure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VADVFGOFDPF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226067017#wasThisHelpful","R3VADVFGOFDPF3","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Bloom is a psychologist who studies moral behavior in infants and young children. Much of the field consists in finding ways to tailor games developed for adults (the prisoner's dilemma, the trust game, the public goods game, the ultimatum and dictator games) for very young children. This research is ingenious and extremely interesting.Bloom argues that humans have an innate moral sense in the same way that we have innate predispositions for many other social behaviors, such as communicating with language, living in families, and cooperating effectively with strangers. The basic material in support of this idea comes from laboratory and field work with human groups (see my edited volume, Moral Sentiments and Material Interests, MIT Press, 2005 for description and bibliography). Bloom argues that even very young children have moral sensibilities, and that these grow with age not only because children are taught to be moral, but also through the maturation of the brain as a child grows into adulthood, and through the use of reason as an adult.Bloom depends on his authoritative knowledge about children to press his message, but in fact after the first two chapters, most of the experimental evidence involves adults, and he insightfully discusses may issues inspired by everyday social observation. I found his social analysis very well written and often insightful. Bloom never simply regurgitates the received wisdom on a topic, but constantly supplies his own interpretation, which is often superior.When I began studying social theory, the accepted wisdom was that we are born purely selfish, with morality being a convenient social veneer that hides are fundamentally sociopathic selves. The only reason people act morally, I learned, is because they are afraid of getting caught acting immorally. Moreover, I learned that every society has is own moral rules, and such rules have no communality across societies. The bulk of research in the past twenty years has shown that both of these notions are incorrect. There is a such thing as human morality, this morality has a common substrate across all societies, and we (sociopaths and other wrong-doers excepted) are predisposed by our nature as human beings to express and affirm these moral principles. Indeed, as Samuel Bowles and I show in our book A Cooperative Species (Princeton 2011), and Edward O. Wilson shows in his The Social Conquest of Earth (Norton, 2012), our success as a species depends integrally on our moral constitution. There is no better place to start in appreciating the psychological side of human morality than Paul Bloom's fine book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPNC9W2SQRL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886840#wasThisHelpful","R2LPNC9W2SQRL1","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Tomasello is a behavioral and evolutionary anthropologist who heads the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. His major contributions deals with the ways in which human thinking goes beyond that of other primates not simply quantitatively (we have bigger brains that can do more computations faster) but especially qualitatively (we can think in ways that are not available at all even to the great apes).Tomasello derives his conclusions from careful and close study in the laboratory of differences in behavior of adult and child humans on the one hand, and non-human primates, especially the great apes, on the other. He shows that there are three types of human cognition, only one of which, individual rationality (“me-thinking”) is shared with the great apes (and a fortiori with other animal species).Individual rationality is exemplified by the economist’s utility maximizer. Individual rationality can be purely selfish, in which individuals are sociopaths who care about others only as objects that may help satisfy their personal needs, but can also include elements of empathy in which individuals care about the suffering of others, and also elements of negative hostility in which individuals gain pleasure from hurting and punishing others who have displeased them..A second kind of human cognition is what Tomasello calls “collective intentionality,” Tomasello writes: “Modern humans became cultural beings…by creating…cultural conventions, norms, and institutions built not on personal but on cultural common ground. They thus became thoroughly group-minded individuals.” (p. 80) This sort of human cognition is extremely well-known, as developed in sociology by Emile Durkheim, George Herbert Mead, Talcott Parsons and many others. Tomasello offers the reader an informative overview of this aspect of human cognition. He stresses that humans obey social norms altruistically when they are considered legitimate, even at personal cost, and humans spontaneously punish others who are observed violating social norms for selfish gain (for a more expansive treatment, see my paper with sociologist Dirk Helbing, “Homo Socialis” available from my web site). He adds to the standard repertoire of arguments the contention that this sort of cognition is absent even in the great apes. He writes: “Although great apes retaliate for harm done to them, they do not punish other individual for acts toward third parties. In contrast, three-year-old children enforce social norms on others even when they are not personally involved…” (p. 87)Tomasello’s unique and quite stunning contribution is his analysis of what he calls “joint intentionality.” The idea here is that two or more humans can “collaborate” in accomplishing a goal. Collaboration is more complex than cooperation, which merely involves all participants in a task carrying out their part the process of achieving some end. For instance, chimpanzees cooperate in catching monkeys, but they do not collaborate. Each chimpanzee wants to catch the monkey and eat as much as he can before the other swarm him demanding a share. Each chimpanzee does better in catching monkeys when surrounded by other chimpanzees equally intent on catching the monkey because when a number of hunters chase their prey at the same time, there are fewer avenues of escape for the monkey. But this form of cooperative hunting is pure “mutualism:” the chimps are each out form himself, and each chimp is oblivious to  what is going on in other chimps’ minds and does not modulate his activity strategically by anticipating what the other chimps are about to do. Such cooperative hunting is pure individual rationality me-thinking “parallel play,” as is observed in very young children in a sandbox.Collaboration goes way beyond cooperation by linking the minds of the collaborators together in a form of networked minds with consciousness and intentionality distributed across the minds of the participants. Joint intentionality is “we-thinking,” a form of cognition that even children understand, and is quite unavailable to other animals. Tomasello’s analysis of we-thinking is, to my mind, completely convincing, and quite new in the literature on human cooperation.The notion of joint intentionality can be dramatically illustrated by reference to a very simple example from game theory (Tomasello does not use this example). Consider a game in which Bob and Alice each receive 100 when both say “Up,” and 1 when they both say “Down.” If they say different things, they both get 0. The joint intentionality solution is that both say “Up.” However, pure individual rationality cannot predict what Bob and Alice will do. The game has two Nash equilibria in pure strategies, and either player will choose “Down” if he or she believes that is what the other will do. It take social rationality for Bob to reason as follows: “Alice is socially rational and therefore she understands what a collaborative effort is. Alice will see that we are involved in a collaborative effort in which we have a common payoff and by considering the rationality involved in joint intentionality, Alice will know that I expect her to choose Up, and therefore she will choose Up. Therefore my best play is Up.” Alice will analyze the situation in the same way, and both will choose the high-payoff strategy Up.Note that in this example, both Bob and Alice have perfectly selfish preferences and their behavior is completely amoral. All they share is a common social rationality that allows them to predict what each other is thinking, and therefore what each other will do.I first came across the notion of collective intentionality in the works of such philosophers as John Searle, Michael Bacharach, Margaret Gilbert, Raimo Tuomela and Nathalie Gold, and the economist Robert Sugden. However, I was quite unpersuaded by their arguments.Consider John  Searle’s contribution “Collective Intentions and Actions,” in a volume entitled Intentions in Communication. Searle argues (a) collective intentionality obviously exists, and (b) it cannot be explained as an aggregation of individual intentionalities, but rather ""is a primitive phenomenon."" His argument for (a) is that ""It seems obvious that there really is a collective intentional behavior as distinct from individual intentional behavior. You can see this by watching a football team execute a pass play or hear it by listening to an orchestra."" (p. 401) However, this is not only not obvious, it is plainly wrong. What is experienced in this and similar cases is highly coordinated cooperative behavior. In both cases, the role of each participant has been carefully marked out by a single agent, whom I will call the ""choreographer,"" or perhaps a few interacting agents using a collective decision process to adjudicate differences among them in the content of the choreography, and conveyed to the members of the ""team."" A ""pass play"" in football is diagrammed, memorized by the players, and carried out on precise cue under objectively given conditions. A similar analysis holds for the interpretation of a musical score and its execution by the musicians.Searle argues that we can see the collective intentionality in the idea that there is a collective goal to the group---winning the football match, and producing beautiful music. However, individual group members may place some value on this ""goal,"" but are unlikely to be motivated thereby unless they are properly rewarded in other, usually more material, ways. Moreover, some group members may actually have the intention of out-performing other members, thereby gaining personally at the expense of the ""collective intention"" of the group. Similarly, group members may be performing solely for the pay, or for the chance to get a better job, or even to get a date with another group member. Perhaps Searle can introspect and discover that he has performed in a group with ""collective intentional"" behavior, but I have not. I am certain that I am not alone. Therefore, even should some people like Searle exist, it would be a miracle if they more than rarely constituted any real collectively interacting cooperative group.Tomasello’s contribution is the reposition the concept of joint intentionality from the realm of collective behavior to that of social epistemology. Although Tomasello calls this form of cognition “joint intentionality,” it is really a high level cognitive representation in each participant of the mind of the other participants that can be used to predict their behavior in the face of the various contingencies involved in carrying out their collaboration. This way of thinking about the cognitive basis of collaboration might better be called “joint representation” of a task, which is an aspect of a larger capacity of social cognition in humans, who have evolved in groups as networked minds with cognition distributed over this network. It is this aspect of the human mind that permits the forms of collaboration that has rendered our species so successful.I have only one quibble with Tomasello’s analysis: his attempt at a game-theoretic formulation of joint intentionality.  A game has payoffs, strategies and information structure (see my book Game Theory Evolving, Princeton University Press, 2009). Game theory is based on pure individual rationality, although it can be extended to collective rationality by drawing upon other-regarding preferences and treating social norms as correlated equilibria (see my book, The Bounds of Reason, Princeton University Press, 2009, and with Samuel Bowles, A Cooperative Species, Princeton University Press 2011). Collaboration, by contrast, is a non-strategic coordination process closer to engineering that to strategic interaction. Tomasello tries to conceptualize joint intentionality in terms of the famous  Stag Hunt game, in which hunters can gain a small reward by hunting hares individuals, but a large reward by hunting stag collectively. But this is a poor formulation. Collaboration is an instance of returns to scale through a complex division of labor, as first outlines by Adam Smith in his famous book The Wealth of Nations. It has little to do with the Stag Hunt Game.Indeed, the most serious task facing collaborating individuals is that of dealing with “free riders” who shirk in cooperating, but still demand a share of the product of collaboration. There is a huge literature on how this problem is handled, and it is quite unpersuasive to argue that the Stag Hunt scenario is an alternative, to this analysis, which is traditionally, and correctly, I believe, rooted in the analysis of social dilemmas, of which the Public Goods Game is the most well known example.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXFMVAI4PQCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674724771#wasThisHelpful","R3GXFMVAI4PQCP","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 1995, the Cato Institute published a groundbreaking study, The Work vs. Welfare Trade-Off, which estimated the value of the full package of welfare benefits available to a typical recipient in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It found that not only did the value of such benefits greatly exceed the poverty level but, because welfare benefits are tax-free, their dollar value was greater than the amount of take-home income a worker would receive from an entry-level job.Since then, many welfare programs have undergone significant change, including the 1996 welfare reform legislation that ended the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. Accordingly, this book, which is really just a long paper, mostly consisting of table after table of numbers, examines the current welfare system in the same manner as the 1995 paper. The authors find that welfare benefits continue to outpace the income that most recipients can expect to earn from an entry-level job.Welfare, they find, currently pays more than a minimum-wage job in 35 states, even after accounting for the Earned Income Tax Credit, and in 13 states it pays more than $ 15 per hour. Only 2.6 percent of full-time workers are poor, as defined by the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) standard, compared with 23.9 percent of adults who do not work. Even part-time work makes a significant difference; only 15 percent of part-time workers are poor.Contrary to stereotypes, the authors argue, there is no evidence that people on welfare are lazy or do not wish to work. Indeed, surveys of welfare recipients consistently show their desire for a job. At the same time, however, the evidence suggests that many are reluctant to accept available employment opportunities. Although it would be nice to raise the wages of entry-level service workers, they maintain that government has no ability to do so, attempts to mandate wage increases, such as increases in the minimum wage, primarily result in increased unemployment for the lowest-skilled workers.I am an economist, but not an expert in this area. The authors research is highly professional, but I do not agree at all with the authors' conclusion that an increase in the minimum wage would lead to widespread unemployment of low-skill labor. I think it is worth raising the minimum wage, as well as extending on-the-job skill training to low-skilled workers, as a supplement to community college and vocational training.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLIGPB75U25Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJVW74I#wasThisHelpful","R1FLIGPB75U25Y","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most notable attributes of this collection of essays on evolutionary genetics are: broad, authoritative, up-to-date, well-presented. This is not a book for beginners, and the authors are not afraid to assume you know some math, chemistry, and biology. If you want to find up-to-date syntheses of major topics in genetics and evolution, including fine bibliographic references to recent empirical studies, this may be the books for you. I particularly liked the section on the passage from genotype to phenotype, including modern evo-devo theory, new results in canalization theory, and a nice chapter on epigenetics. Quantitative genetics is also well covered, including genotype-environment interactions, sexual selection, and social selection. The genetics of speciation is thoroughly handled, as is host-parasite interactions, senescence, and laboratory techniques for the study of speciation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUS949UQDIEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195168186#wasThisHelpful","R3OUS949UQDIEP","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no such thing as alternative medicine. There is medicine that has been tested under clinically controlled conditions for safety and effectiveness and has passed these tests, there are products that have failed these tests and therefore are not true medicine, and there are products that have not been tested. Calling the latter ""alternative medicine"" is a sick joke, and a contemptible one when those who profit from making groundless claims refuse to subject their products to controlled testing.The following products have failed controlled testing funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Ginkgo bilboa, which is purported to treat dementia, does not. St. John's Wart, which is purported to treat depression, does not. Garlic is purported to treat high blood pressure. It does not. Saw palmetto is purported to treat prostate enlargement. It does not. Milk thistle is purported to treat hepatitis C. It does not. Chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine are purported to treat joint pain. They do not. Echinacea is purported to treat colds. It does not work.Despite their abject failure, these and other ""alternative"" treatments are avidly gobbled up by an over credulous public.I am interested in this issue because I study why and how humans develop strong beliefs without there being any supporting evidence. Most curious is that when evidence contradicting these beliefs comes to light, people are often moved to deny the evidence rather than alter their beliefs. Taking a critical attitude towards evidence is healthy, but in many cases rejecting the evidence is quite irrational.  A case in point is Offit's book. His critics reject the evidence, claiming (without evidence) that the author made it all up in the service of Big Pharma, for which he is rewarded with copious monetary payments. How completely predictable!The main problem with this book is that the author is totally uncritical of standard medical treatments. This is a serious error. Doctors have several motivations to prescribe treatment that does not help, and may harm, the patient. People should always keep this in mind in assessing a doctor's recommendation.First, doctors are often paid by the procedure, so they have an incentive to oversubscribe. Second, doctors almost universally practice ""defensive medicine,"" prescribing procedures solely to prevent law suits in the case they are wrong, even though the net effect of the treatment may be harmful to the patient (e.g., because of excessive numbers of false positives). Third, doctors do not study probability theory and do not usually understand the meaning of a diagnostic test. Rather, they tend to accept all false positives and false negatives as though they were the truth. Finally, doctors prescribe treatments because that's what the patient wants, even if the doctor knows the treatment is counterindicated.This book is very well written and fun to read, even if you already believe the message, and even if you have read much of this in your daily newspaper or professional journals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8Q91BOQVMIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062222961#wasThisHelpful","R2E8Q91BOQVMIU","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Michael Chwe is a smart and talented economist whose multidisciplinary predilections led him to the political science department at UCLA. I know and love Jane Austen, and was skeptical of the title of this book. Indeed, I think the title is somewhat tangential to the content of the book. There are no Nash equilibria, no common knowledge assumptions, no mixed strategy solutions---all the standard fare of game theory.What Chwe has authoritatively explored is the complex back-and-forth psychological dynamics of making decisions based on psyching out what other people are thinking, and taking actions that can reverberate three or more times from one mind to another, in the search for achieving one's goals. I had not thought just how central this idea is to the Austen novels. Indeed, it may just be what makes Austen the fine novelist that she is.Chwe is always interesting and insightful. You will not learn academic game theory from this book, but you can take what you learned back to your reading of the Austen novels, and see dimensions of human behavior you may have missed in previous readings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1GKTV9YS094/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691155763#wasThisHelpful","R1B1GKTV9YS094","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in an age where most passionate political activists have limited vision, the right being passionate about the horrors of government income redistribution and need to avoid budget deficits, and the left being passionately alarmed about increasing income inequality favoring the ultra-rich, and the need to counter the austerity policies that protect the big banks against losses brought about by their reckless lending practices. I must admit that I am not much concerned with either of these threats, but rather with the growing cultural rift between the intelligent, motivated, and talented upper middle class and the increasingly dysfunctional lower middle class, and especially its male integument, which seems to have lost its way in a society that increasingly values drive, creativity, and capacity for abstract thought over pure upper body strength and physical stamina.It is interesting that the phenomena is increasing recognized as a serious problem by conservative writers, such as Charles Murray and the author of this fine book, Brian Lindsey, whereas the liberal pundits cannot cease for a moment from wringing their hands about the excesses of the ultra-rich. Lindsey is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, which is a very, very conservative institution, although one whose analyses of society are usually worth paying attention to. The title of this book, Human Capitalism, refers to the fact that increasingly the goodies go to those who have ""human capital,"" which is the result of investing in the development of individual skills and ability to address and solve social and technical problems. This development has long been anticipated, most eloquently in Michael Young's 1958 book The Rise of the Meritocracy.Of course, conservatives love meritocracy (except when it interferes with the inheritance of wealth), while liberals hate the idea (having no faith in the abilities of the `lower classes' and an exalted estimation of labor unions). However, as Lindsey shows, the current meritocratic dynamic is destroying the working class family and leading to a generation of hard-working white collar women with loafing and indolent lovers and husbands. The situation is well described statistically with a minimum of tables and graphs, based on the brilliant research of David Autor, Susan Mayer, and others. This book can be read with pleasure by those who do not care to go into great statistical detail, and the references lead those who do to the proper sources.Certainly this situation, especially the differential effects of modern business organization and technology on men versus women, was not foreseen by Michael Young and the early students of the meritocracy revolution, bit Lindsey shows that it is quite real, and he presents thoughtful suggestions as to how to deal with this situation through social policy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349MF2UQ72HKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691157324#wasThisHelpful","R349MF2UQ72HKK","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decriminalizing recreational drugs for adults may be the most important improvement in life for Americans and the honest people in countries that supply the US drug habit. Most recreational drug users never become addicts, but the 10% or so who do ruin the lives of themselves, their families, and those that they prey upon for drug money. Our prisons are full of people who are otherwise ordinary citizens who have only the high price of a drug habit to blame for their plight.The problem with decriminalization is that it will be effective only if it radically reduces the price of recreational drugs, which means, by a simple and almost inevitable economic logic, the amount of drug use will increase significantly (perhaps double, according to some reliable estimates, based on the long-run elasticity of demand). It is not clear that this will increase the number of drug addicts in the USA, though. Probably the most important test case is Portugal, which abolished penalties for possession of drugs in 2001. According to an authoritative report by the Cato Institute, between 2001 and 2006, recreational drug use among teens actually declined. ""Judging by every metric, decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding success,"" write the report's author. ""It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better than virtually every other Western country does.""Nevertheless, it is important to accompany decriminalization with therapy for the unfortunates whose psychological and genetic makeup renders them susceptible to addiction, because excessive use of some recreational drugs is bad for one's health and social functioning (alcohol is of course probably the worst in this regard). That is why I picked up this book.In fact, this book debunks lots of myths and has sage advice based on scientific evidence, but it does not offer a reliable way out of addiction. Its suggestions are mostly completely obvious, such as ""addiction is a disease."" The best part of the books is his relating the experiences of addicts and their families. Heartbreaking but fascinating. The author is an accomplished writer, so virtually every sentence and episode is expertly crafted. Read this book to avoid some mistakes if there is a loved one who is an addict, but don't expect easy answers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RST9PWKQ047JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R8PNJW#wasThisHelpful","RST9PWKQ047JG","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"William Hamilton was one of your ordinary brilliant scientists, grappling with fundamental questions in sociobiology all his life. His claim to fame is a single article that he published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1964, ""The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior I."" This article gave rise to the terms ""inclusive fitness,"" ""kin selection,"" and ""Hamilton's rule,"" three terms that are explained in every sociobiology article and book. He of course did other things of interest, but in everything else, he was just another brilliant scientist, of whom you might not be inclined to read a long biography. Segerstrale claims correctly that many consider Hamilton the Darwin of the Twentieth Century. Indeed, Hamilton is like Darwin in having shown the world a simple idea that explains an immense amount of biological dynamics. Unlike Darwin, however, Hamilton did not write a Great Book, his simple idea is in fact extremely subtle and not available to the critique of such dimwits as Creationists and Intelligent Design blowhards. This book will not appeal to the casual reader, as might a Life of Charles Darwin.Ullica Segerstrale is a talented and insightful historian of biological thought. Her 2001 book ""Defenders of the Truth: The Sociobiology Debate,"" covering early clashes between sociobiologists, especially Edward O. Wilson, and their critics, especially Stephen Jay Gould, Marshall Sahlins, and Richard Lewontin, is a well written and exciting documentary of this fascinating period. There is no question concerning her sympathies in this book: she gives a rather manachean account where the sociobiologists are Good and their critics are Pathetic.This book is well worth reading, but it is not up to the standards of ""Defenders of the Faith."" Part of the problem may be with me: I really don't care about Hamilton's childhood, or where he sends his kids to school, or how he behaves at dinner parties. Moreover, his recurrent disputes with journal editors and his dismay at his treatment by article reviewers, stressed repeatedly in this book, is supremely uninteresting. Every academic has such experiences, and they are so common that they are not even worth mentioning.Hamilton is not the sort of Lovable Creature that we associate with the likes of an Einstein or a Freud. He's just your typical brilliant scientist. Moreover, Segerstrale spends only a small portion of the book dealing with Hamilton's substantive contribution, inclusive fitness, and a much larger portion deal with how his other ideas fared---which was about average for a big thinker like Hamilton. She should have elaborated on the development of his ideas in the larger field of population biology and sociobiology. More important, Segerstrale does not appear to understand inclusive fitness theory that well, never deals with the substantive intellectual debates surrounding this theory (most of which are misunderstandings, not by Hamilton), and just acts as a rah-rah booster for William Hamilton. One might describe this book as a Readers Guide to the Narrow Roads of Gene Land (Hamilton's book about his own work).Hamilton's 1964 article is a masterpiece. Indeed, in my study of inclusive fitness theory, have never seen anything in print with the analytical power and depth of Hamilton's original article (I explain this in my paper ""Inclusive Fitness and the Sociobiology of the Genome, which is on my web site). Before I read Hamilton's 1964 article, I could not even make sense of standard expositions of his theory, because they misstate and overinterpret it. His article, on the other hand, is extremely opaque, despite that fact that he uses only simple algebra. I arrived at an understanding of his model only by starting with the basic equations, and working backward to determine the underlying model. This model is a paradigm of rigor and clarity.Karl Marx once said, after hearing some of the claims made on his behalf by so-called supporters, ""Je ne suis pas Marxiste"" (I am not a Marxist). William Hamilton could say the same thing when encountering the bizarre claims of some of his supporters: ""I am not a Hamiltonian."" By God, he'd better not be!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JW5SPVUHINN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019860727X#wasThisHelpful","R1JW5SPVUHINN5","A2U0XHQB7MMH0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U0XHQB7MMH0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first rate book in every way. It is short, to the point, the points are all correct, and it is very affordable. It is also quite unbiased (lefties think it is right-wing and righties think it is left-wing---always a very good sign). It central message is that the budget crisis is caused by the voting public, who want all sorts of perks, but don't want to pay for them. Thus we borrow to pay for them, and this is unsustainable in the medium to long run.There are legitimate reasons for the government to borrow, just as there are good reasons for firms and households to borrow. For the government, investments in social infrastructure, education, and other projects that have high up-front costs and whose payoffs lie in the future should be financed by debt. There is no burden involved because these productive projects generate the income to repay the debt. But borrowing for current account purposes, such as paying for social services and recurrent military operations is a no-no. The voting public hasn't figured this out. As Leonhardt puts it, ""The problem is us-- the voters. We have not managed to figure out what kind of government, and what kind of economy, we want...The seemingly irrational politicians in Washington are, to some extent, responding rationally to their own confused constituents.""The answer to the chronic deficit situation is some combination of raising taxes, lower expenditures, especially the entitlements Medicare and Social Security, and eliminating waste from government expenditure. No one really wants to tackle waste and corruption, although recent health care policies instituted by the current Administration are making serious headway into dealing with health care costs. Republicans have followed the losing strategy of holding the line on tax increases (we owe a debt of gratitude to them for this), while Democrats have embraced heady vision of solving the problem by ""taxing the rich."" Taxing the rich in the name of ""fairness"" may be acceptable, but as a means of solving the deficit problem, it is a pipe dream.Why, you ask, is this a pipe dream? Here Leonhardt does not really answer this question. Here it is.The US government does not tax to get money. The government can simply print money. It taxes to reduce the purchases of taxpayers so it can increase its own purchases or transfer the purchasing power to others. The rich predominantly save, and taxing them does not much reduce their consumption spending. Moreover, when it does, the items involved are mostly high-priced non-producibles, such as gems and valuable property. If taxing the rich does transfer purchasing power to the government, it is through the reduction of business investment. This is because the savings of the rich go into banks, and the money is for the most part lent out to investors. Thus ""tax the rich"" really means ""lower investment so we can consume more now."" This is a really, really, stupid strategy. Leonhardt should have made this clear.""Ask Americans if they are willing to accept higher taxes on themselves,"" says Leonhardt, ""and most say no. Ask if they favor cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and most again say no.'The United States faces a fundamental disconnect between the services that people expect the government to provide, particularly in the form of benefits for older Americans,' Doug Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said in 2010, ""and the tax revenues that people are willing to send to the government to finance those services.' "" This is the central message of this little volume.""From a purely economic perspective,"" says Leonhardt, ""the deficit remains a manageable problem. Relatively modest changes to Social Security would eliminate its shortfall. Military spending could be cut significantly and still be much greater than in the past and much greater than in any other country. Some domestic government programs truly are wasteful and could stand to be cut. Even Medicare and Medicaid, the heart of the problem, are not intractable.""

First I tried it with my OtterBox MYSYMMETRY iPhone 6/6s Case - Retail Packaging - SCARLET CRYSTAL / FAN RED INSERT. Sure, it's an Otterbox, but it's as slender as that brand gets. It didn't come close to connecting.But no worries, I thought as I slipped on my very favorite (and by far the least expensive) case.Omaker Slim Bumper Case with Soft Flexible TPU Material for iPhone 6/iPhone 6S (4.7 Inch). It almost connected. Not quite. The Omaker is easy to remove, and when I did, my iPhone 6 slipped right in and began charging. (I tried it with a third case - a very slim one - and that worked, but I had to give it a good shove. No point to that though: I don't use that case since it doesn't give the front of the phone any protection.I will use this when I really need to surf while charging - using the built-in cord will keep me from wiggling the cord until too much - but removing a case - when it claims to be case-compatible really irritates me. All Belkin had to do was bring the charging port a little higher in the holder. Sure, I could modify my case, but I really don't want to. Know what I mean? I'm usually a fan of Belkin, but not this time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CM7J36ON7J9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06D5G#wasThisHelpful","R3CM7J36ON7J9B","A3QL857ALV5RCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QL857ALV5RCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is up on the roof this very chilly (for SoCal) morning installing a new layer of roll roofing on our patio in preparation for the El Nino storms. Without these warm gloves, he would be waiting until afternoon to do the work since the cold makes his hands ache.He's pleased with these Dickies. The fleecy lining is perfect. The pigskin leather is soft and supple and covers the entire palm and fingers. On the back of the hand, it's brown canvas and leather. They have ribbed cuffs that keep the warmth in - and grit or grass or whatever you're working in - out. He really likes that.These gloves will be especially great for working with wood and bricks - particularly during cold weather.My husband has always worn large and these fit like ... gloves. They're slightly tight (due to the warm lining) but are loosening up as he uses them.  The little finger, as at least one other reviewer has mentioned, is extremely long and the thumbs are a little long on his very average large hands. (I only mention the thumb because that's never happened before - it doesn't affect how well they work. - and if you have long thumbs, you'll really appreciate those extra couple of millimeters.If the gloves were a tiny bit roomier and the little finger more proportional, they'd rate a five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JTKTCRHTF8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLYXMQ8#wasThisHelpful","R39JTKTCRHTF8X","A3QL857ALV5RCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QL857ALV5RCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This big (to babies, at least) soft fuzzy ball is a delight when it comes to tactile fun and learning. My grandson is only four months old and, of course, can't possibly push on the top to make the monkey pop up, but he loves to see his mother do it. It makes him giggle madly. (As a child, I was terrified of jack in the boxes and somehow I think this little monkey to will help the grandbaby avoid that.)There are different sides to the ball, each with different colors and textures. One has a ""mirror"" - that's a big hit. It's set into colorful (blues, yellows, and whites) zigzags. There are short colorful ribbons to touch, too.  Another side squeaks, though our boy is too young to master that yet. There are parts that have ridges that are horizontal and vertical. The monkey on top pops out of leaves that make fun crinkly leaves.He's very young right now and his favorite thing to do is push it around in his crib and watch it move. I'm certain he will enjoy it more and more throughout his first year or two.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHNZ3KKUJFSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q1310A#wasThisHelpful","R1KHNZ3KKUJFSR","A3QL857ALV5RCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QL857ALV5RCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted this porcelain angel bell to call everyone to the table at Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the ring is rather soft - not like a metal bell - it's quite charming. This piece comes with a red ribbon so you can hang it on your tree, and it would work well with a large strong-limbed tree. Even if I didn't have cats who consider our 6-7 foot tree their personal Mt. Everest, I wouldn't hang it - it's rather large at about 6"" tall.She stands upright on any surface easily. The angel has a beatific face and is detailed discreetly with 24K gold and green holly with red berries. The angel itself is glazed but the graceful wings are not - they're are like a confection, reminding me of spun sugar. She holds a small gold star in her hands. All in all, this angel bell is very attractive and will grace our holiday table for years to come.The piece comes in a nice red box with the image of the angel on top.

"This is a gorgeous little ring. The band is silver coated in rhodium which makes it very shiny. It's studded with clear and very pale green cubic zirconia and the stones go all the way around the band, which means you never have the back of the ring showing if it shifts.The green stones are obviously green in daylight and good interior light, but in the shadows, they're almost indistinguishable from the clear stones. That's not a criticism, just an observation.My ring is very sparkly and just a spritz of glass cleaner will bring the stones back to full shine if you get them dirty. The ring would make a great gift for someone with an August birthday since the pale green stones look like peridots.

My driveway is bumpy brick cobblestone.

"This book attracted me because it includes ADHD as another name for ""brain fog."" While I call ADHD another name for ""creativity,"" it is true that the fog is a frequent and less aspect of it. If I - or my equally ADHD husband - don't get VERY interested in something, we forget about it - and that can be annoying.This simple book offers answers to this that are definitely helpful. For ADHD, it's no cure - nor would I want it to be! -  but we find that following Dr. Dow's instructions is quite helpful.The book is about changing your lifestyle over three weeks, starting with sugar consumption. You begin by cutting out all sugar for a week - which is very difficult at first. But the main focus is on paying attention to all the forms of sugar that are added to processed food and trying to eat more naturally. We've been doing this for a while - since well before receiving the book - and I can honestly say that these days an apple or orange is more of a treat than a cookie. (Maybe not a cupcake, but you won't crave it so much.) Go for less-processed foods, get rid of the excess glucose added to those products, the chemicals and additives, says Dow. It's true. It helps.Dow says that this, along with a reasonable amount of exercise and some form of meditation - whatever works for you - will help rebalance your  your brain’s serotonin, dopamine, and cortisol. It does work and you won't suffer that lack of added sugar for long. If you are ADHD like we are, don't worry - it will only improve your creativity and lessen the less-welcome aspects of your busy brain.If you're not ADHD, I have absolutely no doubt that following Dr. Dow's methods will improve that fog and make you healthier, too.  My husband, who fights depression, has found he's fighting far less of it since getting rid of the sugar-caused blues, and now that he's meditating (he already exercised enough) he's feeling lots better, too. I can attest to that: he's far more pleasant to be around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAT9PXBPBEIZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140194647X#wasThisHelpful","RAT9PXBPBEIZR","A3QL857ALV5RCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QL857ALV5RCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Viva Labs' glucosamine-chondroitin-MSM supplements are the best anti-inflamatory I've found. (We had been using a glucosamine and chondroitin-only supplement from Costco and that worked - but this, with MSM too, is a little better.) My husband uses these all-year round for an old knee injury and various aches and pains and truly suffers if we run out. I use them probably a quarter of the year when my hip acts up or when extended wet weather makes me achy. My husband has had mild arthritis in his ankles since his youth that acts up when it rains - this stuff knocks it out like a champ.For both of us, two pills a day - the recommended dose - is enough to make NSAIDs unnecessary. This is really important to my mate since they don't play nice with his stomach. Viva Labs' offering is not only US-made, it's reasonably priced.

"This is an amazing mp3 mp4 player. Came with a 16G micro SD card, one earphone, one USB cable and a user manual. Make sure after you insert the SD card you format it so it can clear it for the device before you put the music on it. I've played songs in it through headphones. It really does sound great. I like the recorder too. I use this one a lot. I can record anything in anywhere. It holds a lot of music and relatively easy to store my music. I am very impressed with this Mp3 mp4 player. Great value for price. The record sound is clear and sharp. Great battery life and very lightweight. Well-made product. Highly recommended.

"This ocean blue crystal pendant necklace is really so beautiful. Bought this as a surprise gift from my loving wife. This necklace is breathtaking. Got it with a gorgeous gift box. The clarity of the crystal pear is awesome. The chain is very thick with a beautiful circular pendant. There is a crystal with multiple crystals surrounding it that sparkles gracefully and beautifully. The pendant also slides off the chain very easily so you are able to remove it and put it on a longer chain if you want. She wore it for a dinner party and received a lot of compliments. My wife liked it a lot. This pendant necklace is really “eye-catching”. Well-made product. Highly recommended.

"This is really a gorgeous bracelet. It has lovely sparkly Swarovski Crystals. The bracelet is white gold plated and has genuine Austrian Swarovski elements crystals. The white gold is so unbelievable realistic also. I have allergy problem. The most important thing of the bracelet is its anti-allergic which I like most. And also nickel free. So, no need to worry about itching or anything. It came with deluxe jewelry gift box. It's also perfect gift for a bride on her wedding day. The bracelet has gorgeous design all over and looks elegant. In fact, it looks like real, the finish is perfect. The Swarovski Crystals are perfectly shaped and they are absolutely stunning.

"The future is finally here, ever since I saw Back to the Future II I’ve been dreaming of owning my own hover board and going on adventures. This isn’t quite the hover board, but the closet thing we can get to it. The hottest holiday gift item of 2015! With this bad boy you can reach speeds of 7 in a half mile an hour on this balance board.The design is very sleek and comes in 2 colors. I purchased the black one as the Blue LED lights that light up under the board looks AMAZING! Comes with a very nice travel bag. Great way to take your self-balancing scooter and impress your friends or use to get around in the mall or parks, etc. The royal blue carry bag is durable and stylish.PROS:☢▱▱☢ The future is here, your own equivalent hover board.☢▱▱☢ LG Lithium Battery, excellent brand and long lasting.☢▱▱☢ Fast Speeds☢▱▱☢ Easy to maneuver and control☢▱▱☢ Comes with bumper guards and carry bag as well as battery charger and manual.☢▱▱☢ Looks Fantastic!!!CONS:☢▱▱☢ NONEThe best feature of this balancing scooter compared to others is the battery life. This uses a LG Lithium 18650 battery, so it charges really fast and lasts for longer periods than other balancing boards. Just takes one hour to fully charge so you can hit the road with your personal transporter.Very easy to use, at first you’d think it’d take a long time to get used to it. It’s nothing like riding a skateboard, this is very easy to use, ages 13+. Once you have it fully charged, which I recommend doing when you first get it, to expand the battery life. You just turn the power switch on. 2nd, step on with one foot and activate the magical self-balancing system, then step on the other foot. Try to stand straight when first getting on. Then shift your weight forward to move front and backwards to slow down and reverse. It’s like using the balance board on the Nintendo Wii, except this is thing is actually moving!The motors are very intelligent in that if you apply pressure on only one foot, it starts to rattle abruptly. This is an indication that you can’t move forward in this situation. Pressure needs to be balanced on both motors in order to move. Both motors have a blue LED light in the front which gives it a cool look and gives you some light as you navigate at night. The lights turn blue as soon as the balance sensor is set to green when you stand on the pads. The lights also act as an indicator light, so if you are turning, the turning side light starts to blinks and automatically turns back to solid once the turn is complete.This is very well packaged. The weight is pretty heavy which makes it feel like you have the real deal. The balance board is roughly 28 pounds. Comes with free bumper guard adhesive that you can attach to the hover board. I highly recommend this for anyone thinking of purchasing for themselves or a nice gift. They will thank you for it.

"I ordered this Label Pack cause I always like to organize my house with these types of labels. Here are enough different shapes that you could organize by the shape of the box. You can write on the label the specific items enclosed in the boxes. Once you stick them on something they come off too with no residue. Of course, like most other labels, they are reusable, so that is an added great feature. When you go to stick them on something else again, they are just as sticky as they were before. I can wipe them off easily. I just take a very damp washcloth wipe them off, take a towel and dry it and rewrite another item that I have in any given container. I absolutely love chalk labels.

"This is an excellent dual function security bar.  You can place it against the door knob and that way people can’t get in from the other side.

"The quality of this pillowcase enhances any kind of pillow you own from down feather, standard fill, to memory foam, or bamboo pillows. I love sleeping with this pillow cover. This is high-quality standards and the best pillowcase I’ve ever owned. This comes in 19 momme silk, as it’s measured in weight. The higher the number of momme the heavier and better quality of silk. Industry standards range from 10 to 15 mm of pure silk but this brand by OOSILK is 19 momme. I have yet to find a product over 19 so this is one of the highest out there and should be strong enough to last for years. Mulberry silk is super soft and feels wonderful when resting your head. Mulberry silk is usually cultivated by silk worms that fed on mulberry leaves and the chameuse silk refers to the final product. So the description means that they use 100% mulberry silk fibers to weave into charmeuse weave. You even get a sample of the silk in a ziplock bag as well as other colors that are sold on Amazon. I love the royal blue color even though I ordered the white one. Now that I saw the sample colors up close, I will get the other color as well.This pillow case is 100% Grade A mulberry silk on both sides.  The silk is super smooth.  Silk is also great for your hair and face, thus making it added benefits of using this pillow case. It’s also easy to maintain, just wash the item in cold water with a mild detergent that’s labeled safe for silk.The pillowcase is long and can fit most pillow types and sizes and shapes as this is the Queen Size. The zipper enclosures keep the pillow from falling out and keeping the pillow clean as well. This comes in a wide variety of wonderful colors. I highly recommend you get this pillowcase for your bed. Wonderfully packaged and makes for excellent gifts.  Super comfortable to sleep on and just makes you happy to sleep and get lost in a dream.

"Multi-functional fishing grip.  The claw is made of stainless steel, so don’t have to worry about rust or chemical corrosion. This works for all types of fishes. This also has a comfortable grip, that is easy and comfortable to hold. The trigger to open the claw works flawlessly. There’s also a nice stretchable lanyard to hold, carry the fish gripper with comfortable grip.My most dreaded part of fishing is actually holding the fish after you catch it. Don’t have to worry about that anymore with this Fish Grip. Hold the grip with one hand, as you use your other hand to get the hook and fishing lure out. My favorite feature of this fish grip is the weight scale that lets you read the weight of what you just caught. Can weight up to 55 pounds.  Also a temperature sensor is built-in.I’m a huge fan of this fishing grip, I got the red/black color and it looks great and has a nice holster to attach to your belt.

"I love these type of products that are maintenance free, chemical free and safe to use.  This comes with a nice LED nightlight as well that helps give you enough light at night as you roam about the house.  Completely natural and safe way to get rid of inserts such as ants, mosquitoes, roaches, spiders and even mice and mouse. Easy to install, just take out of the package and plug into the wall. This ranges for about 5,000 square feet, which is fantastic and powerful.  All you need is one for the whole house in most instances. Pests and rodents will be gone within a couple of weeks. The ultrasonic technology gives a high pitch sound keeps insects away and can't hear at all for us humans. The sound annoys and irritates the pests, they might not leave right away, but after a week they will start to leave their nests. It works for the critters that are inside your walls too. A fair warning once you plug this in, they might start to be active and start to find a way to leave. It’s a good idea to do it in the daytime so you can leave a window or door open as they insects try to escape. So be prepared to see some pests at first. No more toxic smells, no more traps and no costlier pest control fees.The unit also comes with a Blue night light which is soothing and pleasant to see. This is a multi-functional pest repeller with the following features:Red Light = Electromagnetic Waves (can go through walls and cracks and all areas of your home)Yellow Light = Anion Disinfection (Air Purifier, makes your home with purified air to lead a healthier life)Green Light = Ultrasonic Function (waves moves in all directions, giving you a full pest control)I'm definitely a fan of this product as it contains no poisons and toxic chemicals and super easy to use. I leave this product on 24/7 and it’s working great. I’ve noticed spiders and ants have stayed away from the Kitchen where I placed the device.

"This is an awesome essential oil. Specially it has no fillers, additives, bases or carriers added in it. This oil has a pleasant scent which I like most. I read about Lemon Oil and heard that it worked really well as a natural cleaner. Lemon oil can be mixed with tea tree oil, peppermint, orange or lavender oil along with a bit of white vinegar for an effective, low cost household cleaner. You can mix & match your oils to satisfy your scent preferences. It's also good for skin. As far as what I have seen, and it's 100% pure Lemon Oil. Well-made product.

"This is a great spy gadget by Conbrov.  This is a mini pocket digital video camera.  The built-in battery lets you charge the device like plugging in a flash drive.  All you have to do is attach the USB end into wall/battery/car charger or computer USB port.  The camera is very lightweight and portable.  It has a 75-degree angle and can run for 5 hours continuous recording.  There’s a timestamp feature which helps you stay organized.  The video is recorded in AVI format which most computers can read and programs can read such as Windows Media Player.I'm quite pleased with this product; I like how conspicuous this is so I can place this camera wherever I choose with the clip.  Uses a micro-SD card to record which isn't included, but pretty cheap to get these days, you can store up to 32GB.  Takes 5.0 MP images, JPEG pictures.  Packaged well and makes a great spy gadget.

"I like this solar powered wireless motion sensor light. I used this item outside my house door. It was easy to install. The build quality is excellent. The light is completely waterproof and heatproof. It has three different mode:Dim light mode;High light mode;Sensor mode.When motion is detected and the light goes bright, visibility is high which is wonderful. During the day, the light is off since there is enough sunlight around. This is a wonderful light to get, especially if you don’t want to be paying slightly higher on your electricity bill. You’ll have very nice illumination at night, and it won’t bother anyone until someone comes close enough to activate them. Very useful for at night and we got lots of compliments on it. The power lasts quite long. This is one of the brands I have been happy with and they are the lowest price. Overall, this is a good Solar Motion Sensor light which can make your house safer and secure. I hope it continues to work great for many years to come. Well-made product. Highly recommended.

"I love this Solar-power Fountain Watering Kit. This was easy to set up and adds a new dimension to our back yard. No electric outlet or battery is needed for the solar-power fountain. The installation was too easy. It comes with different types of fountain spray head and does exactly what it says it does. This works well in my birdbath.Please Note:1. It works in full sun only not shade or cloudy day.2. It does not store even 1 minute of energy so your shadow can cause it to stop.3. Make sure to never let your fountain dry up or it will burn up the motor.The solar power works great and the fountain looks beautiful. I couldn't believe how high it sprayed in the sun. A little too high, as most was spraying outside the bath. It is easy to clean out with a toothbrush. It's really pretty powerful for a little fountain. I hope it will last a good long time.

"These are excellent of steak knives that comes in a set of 6.  The blades are sharp and made of stainless steel.  Don’t have to worry about rust and you know it’s durable and will last a long time.  Doesn’t need sharpening as it’s serrated edges.  The black pakka wood handle is a nice touch.  The curves on the handle is easy to hold and cut through steaks.  Comes in a very nice gift box and thus makes them for great gifts or just great presentation when guests come over.  Comes with a 5-year warranty, and well designed and packaged. The wooden gift box makes for great a storage.  The 4.5 inch serrated blades are great length.  Easy to maintain, just hand wash and air dry.  A helpful tip is to use wood oil once a month to keep them looking sleek and will make it last longer.  I definitely recommend this set of steak knives.

"This grabber really comes in handy when trying to reach high items or even low items.  For instance, my mom loves using it for the laundry as we have top loading washing and drying machine, so reaching to the bottom of the bin is quite difficult for her.  So using this grabber she can easily pick up the loose clothes and put them in the hamper or to the next machine.  I personally love using it for the high shelves in the kitchen.  Since those shelves are rarely used because they are so high, it’s always empty.  Now I can start placing stuff and grabbing stuff when I need it with the extra available space to my disposal.  This grabber is 32 inches long made with aluminum alloy with a rotating head that can pivot and get the perfect grip on your item.  This works right out of the box and super easy to use.  This is a great tool to keep around the house, never know when it’ll come in handy.  Works really well, and I definitely recommend this grabber.

"This LED Wireless Solar Powered Motion Sensor Light is amazing. It's waterproof and heatproof. No batteries, no cables required. Easy to fit. These LED lights are great for putting light in a place exposed to the sun but without electrical connections. This works just as it should. In fact, it is noticeably brighter than the other lights when I walk under it. The sensor turns on the light from a good distance away which I like most. If you've got a dark spot outside around the house try this nice LED. Just make sure it has plenty of access to sunlight during the day. It's super easy to install. I like having light where I need it and not have to worry about plugging it in or turning it on or changing the batteries. The light is super bright.

"These CraftyCroc chalk markers are so awesome. They are simple to use, and really easy to clean off if you make any mistake or just want to re-write something. Came 4 White Liquid chalk markers. White goes with everything and reminds me of school and writing with chalk on the board. These work really well on chalkboard label. The writing stays on the labels much better with the markers versus regular chalk plus the writing is darker and no chalk dust. These work like a paint pen. The liquid flows out very nicely and smoothly. These are fun to use in so many different ways. I feel like they last a long time so I get plenty of use out of them.

"I love hair building fibers that helps minimize bald spots by commingling your existing hair. I’ve used most of the brands on the market, from Toppik and Xfusion. This art naturals hair fusion works like magic, easy to use and apply. Takes a few minutes to get it right and you're ready to go out on adventures.This is a quick fix solution to your hair regime as you try hair growth products to restore thinning hair. This is the interim solution as you wait for your hair to grow back. This product will cover up thinning hair giving the illusion it's fuller than it really is. Truly a dream come true for people with thinning hair. Can be used for everyday use, the keratin fiber is good for the hair so not to worry about damaging your hair.Compared to the major brands Toppik and Xfusion, this is right up there. The best part about Luxe is that it's price is significantly less than the competitors by almost 50%! You get 25 grams in this bottle compared to most brands that only provide 12grams in a bottle. All products work the same as far as keratin fibers are concerned. This product the black color runs a little darker than other brands. Not a problem for people with truly black hair.SOME HELPFUL TIPS AND SUGGESTIONS:Use with Fiberhold spray. I use the XFusion Fiberhold spray that keeps the fiber in place all day long. You can go out and wind will not blow the fibers away. If applied correctly, no one will be able to tell that you're using any products in your hair to conceal baldness.Be sure to shower and shampoo before you sleep. If the fiber is left on your hair, it'll get on your pillow and you don't want the fibers to get into your eye as you're sleeping.Usually one bottle lasts me for a couple of months, when using it every now and then as needed. I'm truly happy with the product as it's great quick fix solution for hair growth. Packaged well and makes for a great instant solution to bald spots.

"*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*DESIGN - Like other Willnorn products I've tested, the design is sleek and minimalist. The 6s case (also compatible with a 6) is one piece that snaps snugly and carefully around the phone. The thinness means that it works with any charging cable and the button cutouts are aligned perfectly.PROTECTIVENESS - Here's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. I'm just not convinced something that thin and firm can cushion any impact onto a hard surface. Most protective cases are built to absorb impact, but the hard edges and backing of this case will deflect impact, meaning that you're fine unless the impact shatters the case...and at 0.7mm thick, the case's most impressive feature becomes less so.Overall, this is a good phone case, but not the best I've seen. If you're looking for something minimalist though, this is the one to check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXMF9S9W65Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168CIZSC#wasThisHelpful","R1TXMF9S9W65Q7","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*PROTECTIVENESS - This case from Willnorn boasts that it is a ""thin armor."" I hesitate to test that theory because it is incredibly thin and is simply a hard plastic. Usually, hard plastic cases are MORE prone to breaks because they don't absorb impacts well. I really like the sleek look, but I'm not convinced I trust it on protectiveness.DESIGN - This is a lightweight, minimalist style that looks sleek and stylish. It comes in two pieces (back and front plate) that snap together. Others have said they felt the case was too tight, but this case is meant to wrap snug and seem like it's part of the phone. Beautiful design! However, one discrepancy from the product photos and the actual product is that the brand name Willnorn is painted in white on the back of the base, not etched or branded in like the promo pictures show.COST - Given that this comes with a tempered glass screen protector, this is a good deal for a basic phone case. Buy this if you want something sleek and minimalist, and you don't think you'll drop your phone much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERLGBHASYFHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445UR9U#wasThisHelpful","R3ERLGBHASYFHG","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a upgraded model of the old QY8, though the upgrades and updates seem to be minor at most. That's not a dig on the product, as both the old and new models are quality products. If you already have the old model, you probably don't need an upgrade.DESIGN: This model is simple in its design: just one about 2 foot long cable connecting two ear pieces. Easy enough. The cable itself can be adjusted with an included hook. The only downside is that all the volume and other control options are located on the ear piece, which makes it difficult to use easily.SOUND QUALITY: No problems whatsoever here. Very good sound quality.FIT: This is critical. It's awful to have earbuds that look nice and function well, only to not fit. The average sized ones that come attached worked well for me, but if they don't, then this set comes with several different sized extra earbuds to choose from.Overall, there's really no doubt about this. This is quite a good product. It's a little bit on the expensive side for earbuds, but the extra cost is worth the quality - something reflected in everything from the design to the packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IX5VQIEYJEZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01761XLVK#wasThisHelpful","R1IX5VQIEYJEZD","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get a lot of products to review (this product was provided for free for in exchange for review), but only a select few replace whatever it is I used before. My old wallet is about 10 years old and due to be replaced. It's an older style, bulky wallet, and even though I don't carry a whole lot of cash, it was size prohibitive to where it was uncomfortable in my back pocket. I was dubious that this wallet, which is so much smaller, would be able to fit everything my old wallet did...but I was wrong.CARD SLOTS - This wallet has two outside card slots with vertical inserts and six inside card slots with horizontal inserts. The outside card slots hold firmly, which is very important, yet were wide enough that I could fit two cards in each slot. The inside card slots are made a bit tighter and will fit one card.ID WINDOW - The driver's license/ID card slot is exterior. That can either be a good thing or a bad thing based on your preferences. I haven't decided how I feel about it yet.MONEY CLIP - This is what I was most concerned about, but in the days I've had it, it's proven to be an invalid concern. This clip is flexible enough to hold a decent amount of cash, yet will securely hold even a single bill.OVERALL - If you want a wallet that has a space for pictures of your kids, to carry receipts, change, or anything else, this is not for you. This is a minimalist wallet, meant just for cards and cash. But it does exactly what it's supposed to do: be a slim, streamlined wallet. In the picture below, you can see that this wallet FULL is thinner than my old wallet EMPTY and flattened as much as possible.

"Children need to know about private parts. That’s how Justin and Lindsay Holcomb’s book God Made All of Me begins. On the surface, that seems obvious, but past parents really do a poor job of talking with their children about the private areas of their body.All too often, private parts are treated as dirty or shameful. When a young boy touches himself in public, a parent might slap the child’s hand and say “No, that’s dirty.” I’m all for “don’t touch your penis in public,” but the message you’ve just sent to the child is that there is a part of him that is dirty and shameful. Parents need to know how to balance the message that God Made All of Me with the message that not all of me is to be shared and that not every touch is good.This is especially important because, as the authors state in their parental preface, One in four women and one in six men will be sexually abused in their lifetime. Go to a park with your kid. Watch the children there playing and let that statistic sink in. It’s absolutely horrifying.Education is important in preventing inappropriate sexual behavior or contact. Teaching your child to say NO! to unwanted touch (even if it’s just overly-huggy Auntie) is imperative to your child’s safety.What I loved about this book is that it is positive. The message is “God made all of me and all of me is good.” Another refrain is “Some parts of your body are for sharing and some parts are not for sharing.” Then, one of the most powerful statements in the book: “If OK to say no because we don’t always want to be touched even if it’s by someone you love.”God Made All of Me teaches the correct anatomical terms for “private parts” and defines them as “the parts covered by your underwear or bathing suit.” This is important because there are so many parents afraid to teach these terms, which just lends a vague uncertainty to an already confusing part of the body.God Made All of Me teaches children that they are in charge of their bodies. They have the authority to say stop, all done, or no more. It very clearly advocates that children tell their parents of any such times they have felt uncomfortable by a touch. The book ends with a discussion of the difference between secrets and surprises. Secrets are not good. Surprises are. You shouldn’t keep a secret that makes you feel confused or sad.As a parental addendum, there is a couple pages detailing nine ways to protect children from sexual abuse. It’s complete, comprehensive, and serves as the underlying structure that forms the book. This is perhaps my only concern about the book - not that this part is poorly done, but that it isn't intended for children. There's a kid-friendly meat of the book, but the beginning and ending content that is addressed to parents is just that, addressed to parents. I feel that the beginning and end material should have been detachable or come with the book in such a way that children could focus on the child-centric parts without being exposed to the beginning and end.In all, this is a must-read for your children. It puts big, confusing, and even scary concepts in terms that are easily understood. Perhaps more importantly, it serves as a great example to parents on how to speak to their children on the topic outside the book. Let me be clear: you cannot just read this book to your children and call the job done. This book is a powerful tool in raising safe and healthy kids, but it just the beginning of what should be many conversations about their bodies and about sexuality over their childhood. As a pastor and counselor, God Made All of Me receives my full recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F8R10VF5Z4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942572301#wasThisHelpful","R8F8R10VF5Z4E","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.*The first thing that's kinda odd about this is that, of the 12 designs in the product photo, you will randomly get 6 pair. So you have to be willing to not know exactly what you're getting. However, all 12 designs seem cute (and I can attest that the 6 I received were).The highlight of these is the skidproof bottoms, which are super important for a newly walking or standing toddler.While these are one-size-fits-small, these will not fit a newborn, or likely any non-walking child. It's really intended for toddler age.That said, the quality here seems decent and the designs are fun.

"If I had to write a one-word review of this case, the simple answer would be this: posh.This phone case is undeniably elegant. The PU leather backing brings to mind the stylings of a fancy handbag. The gold trim adds a bit of flair, with the whole thing creating a sort of retro-stylish look on what is otherwise a modern-stylish device. It's an interesting mix of cold, sleek, and modern with bling and frills, and Arezio pulls it off flawlessly.Since this case was built with looks in mind, you shouldn't expect too much from it in terms of safety. But you can. The edges are firm and unbending, sure to prevent any damage to your phone's most sensitive areas. The PU leather backing also provides some amount of support from the back of it, and the edge's lip will keep the face of the phone off the ground. The leather backing will also dampen the vibrate sound when left on a table or counter.Button placement is a bit awkward and doesn't work as well as it should, which is why I knock off one star. I'm not sure it'd stand up to heavy-duty use, but if you're looking for a case with flair and style, this is the way to go.*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ANT2KVW3G6JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161WWOX6#wasThisHelpful","R1ANT2KVW3G6JX","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first, I'm sorry and I feel your pain. If you're reading this review, you are going through a rough time. No one buys these things for fun and whatever reason has you considering this purchase, I know it's a painful one. I pray that the need for this product is temporary and that your story has a healthy and happy ending.I can't do much to help, really all I can do is leave the best review I know how to leave. So, let me help where I can:SIZEThe mattress is 36"" wide, 78"" long, and approximately 3"" thick (when inflated). The standard hospital bed is 36"" x 80"", meaning that this product is intended for, and therefore is a perfect fit for, an in-home hospital bed. However, all too often, hospital beds are not available or not desired. A twin mattress is 38"" x 75"", which provides a fairly good fit. In the pictures below, the mattress is on a king size bed (76""x80"").STABILITYIf you use this product in something that is not a hospital bed with sides, you may need something to secure this mattress to the bed to keep it from sliding. It does not come with straps to tie it down as it is intended for use in a bed that would not have any chance for slippage. (However, the instructions manual does seem to indicate it should come with straps). An appropriately sized yoga mat underneath or twin mattress topper on top will help.SHEETSEven if being used on a larger bed, cover this in a twin sized sheet to help with comfort.MATTRESS PRESSUREAs seen in the pictures below, the pressure is adjustable in a range from 1 to 5. The box indicates a pressure range from 70-130mmHg, but the instructions manual indicates a range from 35-130mmHg (0.75-2.5psi, roughly). Though I have no scientific method of testing, I believe the range on the instructions manual to be the correct one. I have submitted this question to the company for clarification and will update my review when they reply. (As a sidenote mmHG is the medical unit of pressure, the same unit blood pressure is measured in.)CYCLE TIMEThe bed alternates pressure every six minutes. Pleas note this does NOT serve as a substitute for manual movement of the patient. This product will aid in the prevention of bedsores when used alongside standard medical practice for preventing bedsores, it will NOT prevent bedsores on its own.INSTALLATIONSetup was easy and took just a few minutes. Very intuitive.RANDOM THOUGHTSThis took about 4 minutes to fully inflate.It's very quiet for a running motor.The rubber tubing is high quality.The electrical cord requires a 3-prong outlet. Unless you have an outlet at the foot of your bed, you may need an extension cord. However, the tubing length combined with the cord length allowed me to wrap it back around the side of the bed to an outlet about 6 feet away.CONCLUSIONSThis product works wonderfully at a very good price. I highly recommend it for any temporary need. For a long-term solution, I would seek the recommendation of a doctor or medical supplies professional.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZPW54PQBC3XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ73MUY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZPW54PQBC3XP","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*SIZE - This really is mini. The water basin holds 18 milliliters (0.6 oz) of water, meaning that just a couple drops of essential oil creates a noticeable aroma.USB FUNCTION - At first, a USB function seems rather odd, but this makes it perfect for travel or office use. I envision this being best used in an office or cubicle setting. Water and electronics don't really mix, but it would be very difficult to accidentally spill the water off the top.DURABILITY - This is sturdily made and well done, if you enjoy essential oils and need a little pick me up for work, it'll easily stand up to most whatever you can throw at it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97AH341QW6UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CLCBUC#wasThisHelpful","R97AH341QW6UY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a small amount of storage space and a large amount of clothes to store for the season, vacuum space saver bags can be a good way to go. This bags from Townpeak get the job done, but in the end are just average.INSTRUCTIONS - There weren't any. This product would have greatly benefited from having some, as I really had no clue what to do. It's not that it's difficult to figure out, but it's not that difficult to include an instructions sheet.SUCTION - You are supposed to use your standard vacuum hose for suctioning out the air. The hole is 1"" in diameter and the vacuum hose is meant to cover the raised lip of the hole. If you have a round vacuum hose, then this should be fine for you. I didn't have any problems with suction.DURABILITY - The plastic material here seems a bit flimsy and could definitely be higher quality. I'm not sure it'd stand up to any accidental punctures, and that'd completely ruin this.COST - This is comparable in price to other products on Amazon that are Prime eligible and not shipped from China. Between the two, I'd always choose Prime just because it's easier to deal with Amazon than with a 3rd party.Overall, it's a good but not great product, but it does suffice.*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRRFWI0B5X59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ULPCVM#wasThisHelpful","RTRRFWI0B5X59","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product for free in exchange for a review*Ever worried that you'll drop your Go Pro and it'll sink to the depths of the ocean? If so, this is for you. It's one step above a regular wrist strap in that, should it ever come off, it'll float right to the surface. The product works exactly as intended (it's a small flotation device...hard to screw that up) and easily attaches to your Go Pro or other similar device.WRIST SIZE - This is my only concern about the product, as another reviewer notes. I have an average sized wrist that's 7"" in diameter and this was tight on me. If you unsnap it, it is still held together with a smaller band, adjustable from 12-14"". That's a rather large difference, making it more of a forearm band, which doesn't work for use with the Go-Pro. I give it 4 stars because it works, but take a star away because of it potentially being uncomfortable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6UGSB3KRKYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S1XIAE#wasThisHelpful","R3F6UGSB3KRKYS","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're an athlete or weightlifter, you know the importance of wrist support. I'm a former gymnast (current coach) and, after two broken wrists, any intense floor, pommel horse, or parallel bars training required wrist support. I played around with a bunch of different wrist supports and found a pair that I love. Used it my entire competitive career and still keep them in the closet (ya know, just in case). So, I have a LOT of experience and high expectations with wrist supports.These mostly met my expectations. Easy to put on, easy to adjust tightness, good velcro straps, and allows for support with flexibility.If you have a severe wrist injury, or are recovering from one, you might need more support. Flexible, cloth wrist wraps can only do so much. If you're recovering from a wrist injury, a hard brace always beats a soft support to start out.The only thing I didn't like about these was the thumb strap. It's fine for most uses, but not for gymnastics purposes. No worries, just tuck it in or cut if off if you don't need it. It's there to serve to align and stabilize the brace, but you can manage that just by putting it on well.I'm difficult to please, but these meet my standards!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RCNVA4SZ8C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FKQD8W#wasThisHelpful","R24RCNVA4SZ8C0","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product in exchange for an honest review*SIZING: This is one size fits most and will be a little loose on those with smaller hands and little tight on those with larger hands. I'm average sized. Hand measurement from wrist to tip of middle finger is 7.5"" with 4"" width and these fit rather perfectly. The gloves themselves are 5"" wide. If your hand is wider than 5"", it will not fit you.HEAT RESISTANCE: Placed my hands in a 400 degree oven and you could definitely feel the heat, but it didn't hurt. You could just tell it was warm. These are not recommended for temperature lower than -40 or higher than 425 Fahrenheit. These would also be great for working with dry ice.DEXTERITY: You're not going to be able to play the piano with these on, but it certainly gives you more dexterity than an oven mitt. You can also pluck hard boiled eggs straight from the pot with these on.Overall, these are really good quality and if you need something a step up from an oven mitt and your hands aren't too big, they'll work!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19BR4TE7M9KSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014504QNM#wasThisHelpful","R19BR4TE7M9KSW","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found these to be just as sturdy and durable, if not more so, than the original wheels on my rather pricey office chair.INSTALLATION: It's super easy! Just pop off the old wheels and pop the new ones on. The stem size is a standard 11mm (7/16"") diameter, 22mm (7/8"") in length.DURABILITY: Only time will tell for long term use, but the materials used here are strong, and look like they'll last.PRICE: At $3 per wheel, you can't really go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8GQ8A335GS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG9430E#wasThisHelpful","RM8GQ8A335GS2","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"QUICK HIT – Intersect is a five-week short film resource for small groups to help engage others in spiritual conversations. The storytelling element is wonderfully done, the discussion questions and study guide a bit lacking. It’s a good resource, but be prepared to put in some legwork to use it in your small group.Intersect hits my heart in a very important place: it absolutely loves Story. The series is subtitled Where Your Story and God’s Story Converge. That’s right in my wheelhouse, it’s the same kind of worldview I have. (Hint, hint…just read the name of this website.)The series was made by the Awaken Movement, headed by Rob Peabody and Cris Rogers. I first met Rob a while back when I read his book Citizen and later interviewed him here. It was a wonderful conversation about the kingdom and about storytelling. They were in the middle of working on Intersect then, so I’m especially happy to be able to see the final product now.Intersect is five short films of about 5-7 minutes each. The five topics are:ExpectationsRestDisappointmentTrustControlThe story begins with different individuals telling their stories. For instance, in the film on disappointment, a man discusses his unexpected and unwanted divorce just before his second anniversary. The story ends with a discussion of wider application. Where was God here? How does this story apply to your own? Where does God’s story converge with ours?The goal of the film series is to start conversation s. These five areas are universal areas of struggle. Learning how Jesus can come into these universal areas opens others up to the practical realities of the Gospel: that Jesus isn’t just for heaven and on your deathbed, but has real power, now power, I like to call it.The cinematography is quality and the stories and video discussion are thought provoking and conversation starting. My one complaint is that there’s just not really enough to follow it up. Intersect comes with a discussion guide that divides each section into five questions. In general, the questions are divided as follows:Topical question about the video’s theme.Deeper question about the root of that theme.Question for the specific story in the video.A Bible passage with a question about how it relates to the themeA challenge to seek God’s truth in relation to the theme.That’s a wonderful and thorough structure, but one question per section is not enough. Unless you already have a very open and talkative small group or a very short small group time, it’s going to be hard to fill the time and keep conversation flowing.I don’t mean that Intersect should throw in questions just for busywork, but based on my experience, it’d be tough to fill more than 30 minutes with the material provided. These themes aren’t so narrow that only one discussion question can be raised from them and more could have been done to develop the Bible study side of things.With that said, you can always develop these yourself, just be aware of that ahead of time. For what it’s worth, I think the video content is worth the extra prep time, but based on the video alone…this one gets 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUD1GN8HTWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443970#wasThisHelpful","R2JUD1GN8HTWS","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I actually get into the review, I want to address something I've seen happening a lot recently. If you look at the different ""colors"" for this product in the product page, what you actually get is totally different products: a $25 aluminum watch-only stand, a $10 bamboo watch and phone stand, a $17 metal watch only stand, a $25 rose wood 3-in-1 stand, and the $17 3-in-1 bamboo stand that is actually listed. You could buy any of these five products and a review for any of them would be placed alongside this review of the bamboo stand. This just doesn't make sense to me. Different colors, yes; but different prices and products, no.With that said, I was initially excited about this 3-in-1 stand because I thought my app developer of a father-in-law would like it to store/display his Apple devices. Unfortunately, this fell short.APPLE WATCH STAND - The Apple Watch stand is detachable from the baseplate and secured by magnets. The reason to detach it is to be able to run the Apple Watch charger down the side and underneath, effectively getting the cable out of the way. It's a great idea and decently implemented, although the cuts for the cable are shoddily done and the 90 degree bend you're asking the cable to make will eventually wear it down. Overall, a 3.5/5.IPHONE/IPAD STAND - If you use a case on your phone/ipad (and you should) this will fit awkwardly or not at all. Further, there's absolutely zero cable management, meaning that you can't effectively charge either the iPhone or iPad while in the charger. Lastly, the weight/height of the iPad causes the base to be a little less than sturdy. I can't recommend this. A 1/5.AESTHETICS - Just to give it a plus side, the bamboo wood is pretty and provides a nice aesthetic contrast to the cold, tech look of iDevices. The three pen holder holes in the back is a nice touch.Overall, though, it's just not a good enough product for me to like it or gift it to my father-in-law.*This product was provided in exchange for an honest review*","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R238QVYQK0D1O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUF4JHI#wasThisHelpful","R238QVYQK0D1O0","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our devices need charged. Always. This car charger/power bank is a good way of making sure they stay that way. This 2 port charger is a two-for-one special. By day, it charges your device as you drive your car. By night, it charges your device from the external power bank. Okay, forget the night and day metaphor. The big perk of this device is that, if you need to charge your phone in your car but your car is off, you can use the power bank and not drain your car battery.POWER BANK SIZE - At 2800 mAh it holds a charge equivalent to the battery life of a Samsung Galazy S5. The iPhone 6+ is a bit larger at 2,915, while the iPhone 6 weighs in at 1,910. Basically, this will get you 1-1.5 full battery charges if it begins at full capacity.TWO USB PORTS - As it should be, because I most need to charge my phone on road trips, which is when EVERYONE needs to charge their phone. Just plug this in the front seat cigarette lighter and your front seat passengers are good to go. Grab a couple of cheap 3 foot charging cables to keep in your car so you'll never be without a cable.PRICE - At $10, it's a price that really cannot be beat.

"So you've got a brand new iPhone 6S Plus. The newest and biggest out there. Only stands to reason you'd want to make sure that you're protecting your mini-computer/phone the best you can. This 2 Pack is an good product for its purchase price, just be sure to apply it correctly. Some other reviewers have complained about alignment, but I had no issues.My one complaint is that the protector doesn't extend to the bottom of the iPhone, instead cutting off near the bottom part of the home button. Corners and edges are the most likely places a phone can break and are in need of protection. It also makes the phone feel weird, as it now has a slight lip right at the home button.This gets an A on protection and price, but a D on aesthetics. 3.5 stars overall.

"I work in a small Christian preschool/early elementary that's been on an organizational kick, updating the signage in classrooms and labeling every area. They needed a cute way to do it, so when I was offered these labels in exchange for review, I jumped at the chance. I must say, they have been A HIT.DURABILITY - I was worried that, at such a low price point, the quality of these wouldn't be so great. You do have to be careful when peeling off the backing, but other than that, if you're careful, these are quite durable and suitable for a number of uses. You can unstick/restick these, but I'd limit the number of times you do so.ERASABILITY - These labels can be erased, which is both a high point and potential trouble area. Like any liquid chalk, it does tend to smear a bit after a while, but that's hardly a problem. It's difficult for them to get ""accidentally"" erased, but it does happen.PRICE - Really, at this price point, it's worth the price even if it's not reusable.

"QUICK HIT – Gideon is a goat herder in first century Israel…and he keeps finding himself in the middle of some pretty strange and important events. At the center of it all is this guy named Jesus. The Big Pig Stampede is a wonderful amalgam of stories riffing off of one of the greatest stories ever told.Want to engage your child in Scripture in a way he or she might find more fun than just straight-up reading the Bible? (Though encourage that too!) The Big Pig Stampede is your answer. Bob Hartman’s series of short stories tells some of the craziest moments of the Gospels from the eyes of Gideon, aka Goat Boy.The story progresses in a somewhat linear fashion as Hartman tells the story first person narrative from Gideon’s perspective. Some of the stories lie on the periphery; others he gets put smack dab into the middle. Hartman really captures the voice of an eleven-year-old well and makes the story relatable and fun for kids right around (or just a bit younger than) that age.The Big Pig Stampede doesn’t preach and isn’t a Bible story book. It’s just the fun tale of Goat Boy and his adventures…adventures that sometimes cross paths with some pretty wild circumstances. But it does always, always, always point toward the True Story. This is the type of story that will leave kids going “Wait. That’s real?” and scrambling to the Scriptures to read the real deal.The Big Pig Stampede is an entertaining teaching tool, one that teaches without your kids even realizing it. (Shh! Don’t tell them they’re learning!) Encourage them to tell you the story in their own words and seek out the True Story together. At about twelve pages per chapter, a child could easily read one story a night. It’s just the perfect length for a short attention span and a budding reader.I really can’t say enough good things about this book. It’s fun, quick, and clever.

"Thom Rainer has made a name for himself with what I like to call “blog books”. These types of books are either derived from a blog post gone viral or written as an expanded sort of list article. I Will identifies nine traits of the outwardly focused Christian—i.e. a Christian who is missionaly focused on the world around them—and deftly lays them out point by point.Weighing in at just over a hundred pages in 5x7” page format, this is light and quick read that, frankly, needs a little more depth. I expect blog posts to be list-based, quick to the point, and segmented. Books can follow a same structure, but with more substance. Rainer’s book reads, to me, more like a printed out blog post series than a book. I think that’s a calculated decision on his part, so I’ll let you as the reader decide whether this is a strength or a weakness.Rainer’s nine points are as follows:  I will move from “I am” to “I will.”  I will worship with others.  I will grow together with others.  I will serve.  I will go.  I will give generously.  I will not be a church dropout.  I will avoid the traps of Christianity.  I will make a difference.Rainer moves through them steadily, at about twelve pages per chapter. His advice and his anecdotes are solid and force you to focus on the question of how outwardly focused we are. At the core of Rainer’s nine points is a commitment to community. Community is such an important part of going from going to church to being the church. He also talks strongly about the need to give generously.This is a hard book to review because, although I’m in agreement with pretty much everything that he says, there’s not really anything here that…you know…makes it worthy of being put in a book. Rainer doesn’t say anything new or profound or even substantive. I’d like this on Facebook if it was a link to a blog post, but as a book it just simply needs more meat. Rainer doesn’t feel like he’s very invested in this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJE4X7C6B7U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433687291#wasThisHelpful","R2IJE4X7C6B7U1","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanksgiving is the season for getting together, fixing a big meal, and enjoying family. There’s something about table fellowship that really brings people together and Thanksgiving fellowship especially.That’s begun to get lost in this era of Black Friday chaos and even Thanksgiving Day sales as the season to be grateful for what we have is overshadowed by the season of wanting what we don’t. McElmurry and Miller take us back to a simpler time to a simple story of a family coming together to prepare a special dinner.Each page of the book details a family member’s special contribution to the meal. Mama gets the cooking pot, Daddy makes the fire hot, Sister kneads the dough, Brother bastes the turkey…you get the idea. Though it’s never explicit, the central theme of the story is the idea of family and community. Each family member works together and therein lies the success of the meal. Heady stuff for a children’s book, but it’s couched in a simple and catchy rhyme perfect for reading aloud.Sharing the Bread is an old-fashioned Thanksgiving story that deserves to be read aloud the year round. The simple rhyme scheme—A-A-A-A-B-B-B-B—creates a lyrical pattern that relies on the syllable structure of each line to carry the rhyme’s flow forward. That makes it a unique sounding read and one that will stay in your head once it’s been read aloud.But strong mechanics only work with an underlying theme and there are a number of factors that pull the theme together. Community, family, table fellowship…all of these things make the book more than just rhyming words on a page and into a quaint little book that’ll warm your heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PC9ZYYLYX6JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307981827#wasThisHelpful","R3PC9ZYYLYX6JM","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the concept of the HeartSmart series. It is never too early to get children into the Word and never too early for them to commit it to memory.The book begins with a child named Emma calling you in for a playdate. You visit her room, you meet her teddy bear, you eat lunch, and then, finally, you learn about the Lord’s Prayer. Emma then takes you line by line through the prayer, explaining it as it goes. You then retreat to Emma’s room to teach the prayer to her teddy bear.I felt like the book was a little slow to start. It’s not until halfway through the book that the Lord’s Prayer is actually introduced. The purpose, I’m sure was to build the context for the prayer and to insert Emma as a Dora-the-Explorer-esque interactive character. Emma talks directly to the reader/listener and asks questions. This is all well and good, but, in my humble opinion, could have been condensed some.I do very much appreciate that the prayer is broken down line by line with an explanation of each concept. The goal of Scripture memorization should never be rote recitation but active understanding of the text. I wish that it would have gone further with this, taking time to explain the “big words” of the prayer. What does “hallowed” mean? Or a “debtor”? Or “temptation”? Be sure to your child understands what he or she is saying. That’s much more important than getting the exact words right.The book (and presumably the series) utilizes the English Standard Version (ESV), which is an “essentially literal” translation of Scripture. The ESV, on average, reads at an 8th grade level, which is why you see some of the “big” words in the prayer. For those unfamiliar (or take issue with) the ESV, the Lord’s Prayer is essentially the same in the more popular NIV. The only difference is the use of “this day” instead of “today” and “deliver us from evil” instead of “deliver us from the evil one.”Let’s Learn about the Lord’s Prayer also chose to include the addendum “For yours is the Kingdom, the power…etc.” This closing phrase has been removed from more recent translations (including the ESV and NIV) because it is not found in the earliest Greek manuscripts. Of course, this does not make the book unscriptural or wrong by including the phrase. I only make note of it in case you, as a parent, are following along in your own Bible—that phrase is not likely to be there.Overall, I get excited about teaching kids the Bible and I get excited about kids reading books and I get excited about Scripture. That makes me triply excited about this book. The key to memorization is repetition, repetition, repetition. Use this book as a launching pad to develop a system of teaching memory verses to your children. Train them up in the way they should go and, when they get old, it will not depart from them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUSRB4GQPCN7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781412692#wasThisHelpful","RUSRB4GQPCN7I","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure here: I like Rand Paul. I am wary of politics. I am sure that he has political motivations for releasing this book now, even as I am sure that he does have an honest interest in the faith lives of our past presidents. So while the cynic in me wants to call this a pandering gift to the Religious Right, I’ll refrain from taking that stance in this review.The book is coauthored by James Randall Robison, which is a fact worth noting, since it’s specifically mentioned that he compiled and edited the quotes in the book. To me, that’s not a good thing because it already distances Rand Paul from the actual spiritual content of the book. What’s left for Paul to do? Comment on the quotes set before him and not-so-subtly lay down some of his own political opinions.The fact that Paul has ulterior motives comes just a few pages in on page 6 with the word “Obamacare.” Didn’t take you long to get sidetracked from presidential prayers, Rand! And that, to me, is what really detracts from this book. Rand Paul inserts his own stories, political positions, and current events commentary into a narrative that should be focused on Our Presidents and Their Prayers.Paul, to his credit, does go through all 44 Presidents, though the book lacks a uniform structure. The key leaders—Washington, Lincoln, and the like—all get extended treatments complete with artwork and an excursus by Rand Paul on something somewhat related. Other Presidents barely get a page. Millard Fillmore, for example, barely warrants two paragraphs. Of course, some Presidents give more material than others and that’s okay, but Paul seems hesitant to say that.Moreover, Paul very rarely engages with the Presidential prayers—or should I say, Presidential quotes, as many aren’t prayers but just references to God. Sometimes, Paul seems to forget that there are any Presidential quotes there at all. A discussion of Jefferson leads to his thoughts on warfare. The section of Madison leads to a discussion of his Spring 2015 filibuster. And so on.Instead of a deep look at the personally profound faith of some of our nation’s greatest leaders, we instead get a politically sanitized taste of American civil religion interspersed with Rand Paul talking about…whatever. It takes what could have been a very powerful book and turns it into a shallow regurgitation of a faith I don’t recognize.I’m a Republican. I’m a pastor. I’m supposed to eat this up. And, undoubtedly, many of my colleagues in the pulpits and pews will do just that. But I can’t. There is a difference between my country and my God. And there is a clear delineation in between the two in which one has my primary allegiance. I do not mix the two.What I wanted and hoped for from Rand Paul’s book was an honest reflection of an honest look at the prayer lives of our Presidents. I wanted Paul to interact with their statements. To agree, disagree, wrestle with, and expound upon. What I got was a book that lacks any sort of cohesive structure or message meant to sell Rand Paul’s name to the Christian Right and fundraise for his political campaign.Oops, I guess my cynicism won out.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQYY5WVYD0FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455535737#wasThisHelpful","R3EQYY5WVYD0FI","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:51 MinsI received this product in exchange for an honest review. Here are my thoughts.When you're juicing a lemon or lime (or anything else, for that matter), you want to get the most out of it. No other juicer I've tried has done such a good job as this Superjuicer from One Life Improvements. First of all, it's sturdy. Made from stainless steel, there's no worry that this is going to fall apart. Second, it's easy to use. Just insert a half lemon/lime open-end down and compress. The bowl shaped squeezer inverts the rind and guarantees that every last bit of juice gets out.It does exactly what it says it'll do, just as it says it'll do it.

"A while back, I reviewed iPhone 6 Case, GMYLE Snap Cover Glossy for iPhone 6 (4.7 inch Display) - White Marble Pattern Slim Fit Snap On Protective Hard Shell Back Case. I mentioned that I loved the design, but was afraid it was not protective enough. In response to that, the company kindly sent me out this case, very similar in design and structure, but a but more reinforced. Here are my thoughts:DESIGN - Love, love, love the design. The marble background is just beautiful and brings out the stylish tech-beauty of the iPhone. Cutouts for the camera are perfectly aligned, as are the cutouts for side buttons and bottom inputs.PROTECTIVENESS - Look, it's still not a LifeProof, but it's not meant to be. What I like about this one is that the case's sidewalls go up and around the buttons, rather than just being a backplate. That provides a lot of added and needed protection. That design also reinforces the edges, holding your phone more secure and providing greater shock absorption. It also has a bigger lip around the top. Altogether, I'd trust this with my phone.COST - Excellent price point! Couldn't ask for better.Overall, it's as if GMYLE took my critique of the previous case and custom made me a new case to my specifications. Love it!

"This is a BIG container of coconut oil. 54 ounces big. Now, the seller mentions that quite clearly but I don't think it registered to me until I saw it. At first, I was afraid this would make the oil to be of poor quality, because it's a GREAT price for the size.I've tried a couple other brands of coconut oil and this hold up well. Since I don't use very much all the time, I used what I needed and gave the rest to a friend who incorporates coconut oil in her hair and skin care regimen and she's been pleased as well.One criticism to note, though this is Amazon's fault, and not the manufacturer's. At some point in transit, the jar came slightly unscrewed and spilled out. Luckily, it was just a small amount, or else the entire block's mail would be been covered in coconut oil.

"I just became an adult. You know how your parents (or you, if you're the adult) just had a thermometer somewhere. Yeah, I didn't. So I went out and bought a cheap one I didn't like. When the opportunity came to review this ear thermometer by VIVE, I jumped at it.ACCURACY - The normal average human temperature is 98.6. I say ""normal average"" because some people's resting temp is higher or lower than others. The true test of accuracy is repeated tests at a similar temperature. After about a dozen tries in a few days, the temp was always within 0.2 degrees, between 98.4-98.6.SPEED - As a kid, I HATED having to hold the thermometer in my mouth for a minute or more. With this one, it's just a few seconds and it's done. This is great option for kids and adults alike, but especially useful for those with young children.MEMORY FUNCTION - This is a great way for tracking a person's temperature over time.

"Three years have passed since Maviah the slave became Maviah the Bedu Queen—Queen of the Outcasts, Daughter of Yeshua. Those three years have not been easy. Her lover lies in prison in Dumah. She is the leader of all those cast out by the Thamud. Life is harsh, yes, but life is real and worth living as a daughter of the King. And now the time is come. It is time to set the captives free.From page one, A.D. 33 throws readers back into the carefully crafted Beduoin world of the first century, a world strangely foreign to even scholars of the Gospels. Dekker wastes no time getting readers up to speed, meaning that while A.D. 33 can be read by itself, you most certainly will not want to do that. Instead, take some time to travel through A.D. 30. It’ll give you much needed insight into the characters and their motivations.The story is a surprise a minute, peppered with thoughts that make you slow down and think. The A.D. series has been some of Dekker’s most personal work and, as such, let me be frank, the message is not very subtle. Many times I heard Ted speaking, rather than his characters. Take that as a flaw, take that as a highlight, your choice.But the message is wrapped around an incredible story of war and intrigue as Maviah seeks to hold true to identity as a daughter of Yeshua while yet dealing with those who would come against her to destroy her. Though I doubt Ted would forthrightly claim such, I definitely saw shades of Thomas Hunter in Maviah’s character.I shan’t say much about the plot, lest I spoil the surprise. Dekker handles the characterization of Yeshua very well. Usually, “Jesus characters” either come off as less-than-Jesus or incredibly forced and stilted. Dekker manages the balance well, holding true to the teachings of Jesus (for evidence, just see the appendix) while yet making this Jesus seem real to the story rather than a cardboard cut-and-paste from Scripture.Dekker’s historical background is immaculate, a skill he learned, I’m sure, from the great Tosca Lee. He opens up the reader’s eyes to an ancient world we thought we knew, but one just beyond the borders of our experience. By making Maviah an outsider to the Jewish culture, he portrays the story of Jesus in a way not often thought about. How did Messiah affect those outside the Roman Empire?The storyline and pacing flow well, though it’s a bit slow at points. Dekker’s writing is a bit fuller and deeper and makes you slow down to really immerse yourself. That’s not a bad thing, but it, along with many other things, makes the A.D. series much different than his other works.A.D. 33 is the book Ted’s wanted to write for a decade and, coupled with his new spiritual awakening, the passion and power from a story held in so long just pours out on the page. Take a wild camel ride through the desert and join Maviah, Queen of the Outcasts, in her pursuit to follow the man called Yeshua.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMDPY1CNA2FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599954176#wasThisHelpful","R2KMDPY1CNA2FG","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether wearing your child is, to you, a matter of attachment and bonding or just a convenient way to keep your baby close to you, this ultralight baby carrier is the answer to your problems.SECURITY - The first question that must be asked is ""Is this safe?"" The last thing you want is for the baby to fall out or for the straps to come undone. Of course, you must always make sure that you have safely secured the straps, but, if secured, there is no way that your baby will come loose without you noticing first. The straps are easily adjustable to fit all sizes, up to about 25 lbs. The strap structure also minimizes the strain on your back, making it relatively easy to carry around your child.FUNCTIONALITY - I personally prefer the front-carrying method, just because you can see your baby that way. However, it can just as easily be turned around backpack style. It comes with a detachable (via a zipper) neck support, meaning that it can support the head/neck of very young children, yet be removed once the child has control of the head/neck. With the neck support removed, the baby could also be faced forward, giving him or her access to view the world.DESIGN - I love that there is a little velcro pouch included in the front. It's just big enough to be useful but not so big as to get in the way. The various pieces fit together well. Like I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the design really is ergonomic and flexible to the needs of your child. The color tone makes it fit with either gender.DURABILITY - I've not had this for a long time, but from my observation, the material is strong and durable, of good quality. This should certainly, barring abuse, last for the duration of your child needing it and even on to a second child.Overall, I really could not ask for a better product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HREQQTBNNCTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01066OEHW#wasThisHelpful","R3HREQQTBNNCTO","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Here are my thoughts.*I had been looking around for a replacement laptop bag, so when this handbag/briefcase was offered for review, I thought I'd try it out. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my hopes.SIZE - One of the first things I noticed about the bag I received was that it looked different than the one in the product description. Product description estimates a size of 15.1"" x 12.2"" x 4.3."". Mine is approx. 14.5"" x 14.0"" x 4.0."" As such, the bag looks more like a square than a rectangle and really messes with the aesthetics of the bag. The decreased width did not affect the bag's ability to handle a 14"" laptop (as specified).AESTHETICS - I have seen good PU leather and bad PU leather and this is not up to snuff for the price of the bag. The leather looks and feels fake. It's marketed as a men's handbag/briefcase, but the squareishness of the one I received definitely makes it look more like a purse.FUNCTIONALITY - This bag lacks any sort of clear pockets or dividers inside the bag. There are two small pouches on one side and a small zippered pouch on the other. There are no outside pockets. The inside offers no padded protection, meaning I would not trust it with electronics. As you can see in the included pictures, the main zipper has an extended flap that made the bag very difficult to zip. It took me about 3 minutes and both hands to get the thing closed.PRICE - As you've gathered, I don't exactly recommend this bag. But especially not at this price point. The MSRP, per the tag on the bag, is $98. The $44 price tag here on Amazon isn't even a good buy. There are a lot better bags for a lot less money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYH30YSOXEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPDV8O6#wasThisHelpful","R1XYH30YSOXEY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dare socks have proven themselves to be a quality brand, so when they offered their low-cut socks to me in exchange for a review, I happily cleared out my sock drawer and made room for six more pairs of Dare socks. Unfortunately, my happiness was short-lived. I've loved their ankle-length socks (it's all I wear anymore), but these below the ankle socks are simply just too small.Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that if it didn't clearly state on the product description that ""one size fits most"" means men's size 6-12. I wear a men's 10.5, which is about the national average. The socks were clearly too tight, and after about five minutes, caused numbness and tingling in my feet.From a quality perspective, they are well-made with a great color pattern that makes them usable for either casual or formal use.

"QUICK HIT – In this surprise ebook short, Ted Dekker takes readers on a personal journey through his life and how he found his faith again by losing it.I’ve known Ted for a long time and I’ve heard his story and been there as he’s worked through trying to word exactly what this experience actually is. I’ve seen a total revitalization of Ted, both in his person and in his writings and, if you’ve read any of his recent works, the content of this 25 page self-reflection shouldn’t much surprise you.Waking Up: How I Found My Faith By Losing It is an ebook exclusive meant to pair with the release of A.D. 33.My experience wasn’t lining up with what I thought I believed. That’s how Ted begins his story. At the height of his NYT bestselling career. A successful CBA novelist now with a “secular” publisher and writing like a madman. It should have been the pinnacle of success, but it was there he had a crisis of faith.I mean, I believed all the right things about God, but could I really let go of everything…? And this begins a very personal and very honest journey of faith. This is Dekker’s soul laid out, not because it’s easy for him but because it’s necessary for him to share this story. Does Christianity actually change anything?Ted strikes right at the heart, underlining the Christian journey of more than just himself, telling the story of a person who knew and believed all the right things, so why was it not all working out? In the end, what Dekker discovers is that “What matters isn’t our stated belief and doctrine but how we live and what we experience in the story of our lives.”The second quarter of the book is a summary of Dekker’s upbringing. If you’re familiar with The Slumber of Christianity—his first non-fiction book—then you’ll be familiar with most of the information here. All of this leads to his new awakening.This new awakening, as any who have read the A.D. series knows, is all about finding identity, purpose, and destiny in the person of Jesus Christ. We are united with Christ. We don’t have to do good deeds to please the Father, the Father is pleased by our existence in Him. For Ted, he found the meaning of life in being loved by the Father.The last half is a manifesto of sorts, a clarion call for others to jump the divide, to dive deep, to drown in Elyon’s waters, one might say.

"Compression sleeves are meant to help both athletes and non-athletes with a variety of circulatory, lymphatic, and vascular problem. Compression helps relieve soreness, cramping, and fatigue. It promotes blood flow and supports the surrounding muscles. You have seen some of your favorite basketball players wear one on their shooting arms for this reason. However, these types of sleeves can also be good for the non-athlete dealing with bad circulation or neuropathy.Please note that compression sleeves should never be overworn, lest the body become dependent on them.SIZING - Like with the leg compression sleeves, I take one star away for the lack of definite sizing options. Neither the product description nor the drop down sizing bar tells you exactly what a small, a medium, or a large actually is. That obviously leads to some problems. I ordered a medium, but definitely should have gotten a large. According to the box, sizing is as follows:Measure circumference right below elbowSmall: 8-9.5""Medium: 9.5-11""Large: 11-13""FIT - Can't comment too much on this, as mine was way too tight given it was the wrong size. I will comment that the sleeve length should extend from the bicep to the wrist and, unless you have freakishly long arms, it should do so easily. I was able to comfortably stretch this to 21"".QUALITY - VIVE has a history of producing nothing but quality products and this is no different. The material is high quality, firm, yet breathable. It's made to last and made to withstand impacts and scratches. It is a bit pricey, so if cost is a concern or you don't think you'll use a compression sleeve much, you may want to go with a cheaper option. But if you want durability and quality, this is the way to go.I received this product for free in exchange for a review.

"VIVE Health has proven themselves to me with a variety of healthcare products and these compression sleeves are another notch in their belt when it comes to a quality product.Compression sleeves help the lymphatic and vascular systems, as well as promote circulation, which makes it perfect for post-workout recovery for athletes or non-athletes with circulatory problems. As an athlete, I'm always looking for ways to stay healthy and, for feet-heavy sports (think basketball especially) these compression sleeves can really help.SIZING - This is where I take off a star. With the current sizing chart, you're left to basically guess whether you're a small, medium, or large. According to the package, sizing is as follows:Measure circumference right below knee.Small: 12-14 inchesMedium: 14-16 inchesLarge: 16-18 inchesIt'd be very easy to add this information to the sizing options box and would help individuals make a sizing selection. I received this product free for review and figured that a medium would work for me (I'm 5'8""), but I'm more a large.FIT - Provided you get the right fit, the compression sleeves fit perfectly. They should (as the image indicates) begin a couple inches above the knee and extend to the ankle. When stretched, these went comfortably to a length of 21,"" which, unless you have abnormally long legs, means it should work for anyone under 6'6"".QUALITY - The rubber lining at top ensures a secure fit that won't droop. The material itself is breathable and thin, yet strong. It's really a high-quality product. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. If price is a concern or you won't be using these often, then maybe opt for a less expensive pair. For heavy use and good quality, these will do the job.I received this product in exchange for a review. If you have benefited from this review, please consider voting my review as helpful.

"The Psalms are filled with one man’s longing heart-cry for his God. But it is also filled with God’s longing heart-cry for his children. Shouldn’t we be listening? Speak, Lord is all about hearing the Psalms in the first person. Not as written four thousand years ago and not as spoken to a different time, culture, and person. But now. Hearing God speak to you in Scripture directly.Let me give you an example from the book. Psalm 1:11-2 says:  Blessed is the one  who does not walk in step with the wicked  or stand in the way that sinners take  or sit in the company of mockers,  2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,  and who meditates on his law day and night.Here is how Black paraphrases it:The company you keep is very critical to me and your overall success. I really want to bless you. I want you to be happy and prosperous. I want others to look at you and be envious of my goodness evidenced in your life.I will bless you if you do not walk so close as to hear and consider the counsel of the wicked. Why should you consider their advice?I will bless you if you do not stop, stand, and lean against the wall where sinners normally travel, down the path they regularly take.I will bless you if you do not pull up a chair and join the environments where the ungodly scoff and laugh at all that is good and righteous.And this here is the essence of the book: learning to take the Psalms and make them yours, taking them from words said to others to words said to yourself. Now there’s no way for Black to give examples of all 150, but he does cover 19 of the most significant and important. After each paraphrase is a section on writing prompts and a section on devotional thoughts, each about a page long.This isn’t a book you can just read, it’s a book you have to commit to and make part of your life. Paraphrasing Scripture is a powerful way of seeing it in a brand new light and discovering the applicational value to your own life. But, the pastor in me also says to be cautious: don’t read into the text what you want to hear from it. Be open and honest with God and pray over the process. Write down what it says, even when—especially when—you don’t like what it says.I really wish that Black had included more interaction and less his own thoughts. A few full length examples are necessary, but after those first few, I think he should have broken it down more verse-by-verse. I say this because, since every example in the book is preceded by Black’s own persona full-length “answer,” there can be a temptation to merely write again what he wrote. After the first two or three chapters, I would have appreciated a more thorough breakdown. Taking things in small chunks makes the task seem more manageable and keeps readers engaged. I know the thought was that there are a 131 other Psalms to sample, but people are most likely to get engaged with what is in the book.But overall, this is a valuable resource and teaching tool, not just for the Psalms but for Scripture as a whole.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1511E0OPVT7JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCK0WHO#wasThisHelpful","R1511E0OPVT7JA","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best known for his eponymous biography of German theologian and thinker Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Eric Metaxas has become the go-to person for Christian biography. After seeing his work perform well in a full-length version, Metaxas decided to try shorter anthology-type biographies in Seven Men. With that experiment of success, Seven Women was an anticipated and expected follow-up.A good biography requires two things: an interesting subject and an interesting writer. Maybe I’m just a cynic, but while the biographies are good, there’s nothing in there that makes them great. Bonhoeffer was a massive work of academic precision that shed new light on an before under-appreciated historical figure.Because of the length of these biographies—about 25 pages each, average—Metaxas can really only give a bare bones summary of their stories and thus, at least for me, not really tell me much I didn’t already know. Further, the subtitle—And the Secret of their Greatness—implies that there’s going to be some evaluation, some discussion, about the qualities that made their lives great. I expected Metaxas to spend his space focusing on the singular area for which they were great, not giving a general life biography.Life is Story. I understand that. And when you write a long story, you can tell the whole thing. But as any good short story writer will tell you, in a short story you must be focused, directed, and condensed, The applicational value of the story must lie more on the forefront. I think Metaxas missed the point of a short-form bio when he assembled them as a collection of facts rather than a dynamic interpretation and discussion of those facts.I also question at least one of his choices. He begins with Joan of Arc, which is a gutsy move considering that he writes to a primarily evangelical audience while holding up an individual who allegedly had supernatural revelations from Saint Margaret, Saint Catherine, and the archangel Michael. He discusses none of the theological problems with Joan’s visions or whether or not the visions were a good thing. The secret of her greatness was…listening to the voices in her head? Metaxas seems like he just wants to have included an enigmatic and popular choice without offering any real discussion about her.Perhaps I came into Seven Women with my expectations set too high, but they were certainly not met. A lot of people seem to love Metaxas, but I’m just not seeing it. However, if you liked Seven Men, you’ll enjoy this one as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNXHEQ5JY8SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718021835#wasThisHelpful","RWNXHEQ5JY8SQ","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“He will be the preacher.” Whether this was just an offhand remark or the woman leaning over his crib was speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, either way, her prediction cam e to pass.I’ve always been fascinated by the lives of great pastors. What series of circumstances led to their success? How was the guiding hand of God behind them? What mentors and leaders and teachers did they have along the way? Success is driven by God, of course, something Erwin Lutzer acknowledges in his subtitle The Story of God’s Providence in My Life.I am fascinated because, frankly, that’s where I want to be. Whether I get there is totally up to the grace of God, but I also firmly believe that God has called me to make the most of my calling, and that includes standing on the shoulders of giants and learning from their lives. Erwin Lutzer is one such giant.Beginning with his school days in Saskatchewan and his family’s history, Lutzer weaves a story of unlikelihood—one controlled by the providence of God. The most prominent one comes on April 3, 1977, when with about ten minutes before the start of Sunday service, he was asked to preach at the historic Moody Church. Simply this: Dr. Warren Wiersbe, the pastor at the time, had gotten sick and was going home. A staff member was going to preach a message based off of Wiersbe’s notes. Lutzer had never attended Moody Church before but decided so this week because he had just resigned a pastorate in order to complete his Ph.D. dissertation . A “chance” meeting in the hallway. An off-the-wall request from Dr. Wiersbe. And a last-second sermon that built a relationship that led to his succession of Dr. Wiersbe some years later.As the pages go by, there can be no doubt of the providence of God in Erwin Lutzer’s life. It would have been easy to call his success due to his own connections or own competence. But in everything Lutzer gives praise to the God that opened up those opportunities.I especially connected with the stories about the influence of Dr. Elmer Towns on his life. It was a young Dr. Towns who recommended Erwin Lutzer to Dallas Theological Seminary and an older Dr. Towns that encouraged Lutzer to write books. Many years later, a much older Dr. Towns is still influencing lives at Liberty University, my alma mater.Fans of biography, especially Christian biography, will love this book. Pastors need to read this book. Its insights, observations, and experience teach much more than a didactic book of facts ever could. Thank you, Dr. Lutzer, for a life well lived.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317N5TYB48I67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802413064#wasThisHelpful","R317N5TYB48I67","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only 35-40% of engaged couples seek out and receive quality premarital counseling. This despite that fact that such counseling makes divorce 30% less likely and results in a 30% increase in marital satisfaction. In other words, counseling makes your marriage last and it makes your marriage better.There are thousands of books out there on marriage and many of them are solid books coming from a Christian worldview. Ready to Wed stands above many of these and becomes a must-read by bringing in a whole host of counselors to talk about what they know best. With fourteen chapters of about 20 pages each, the book’s format easily lends itself to counseling purposes. In fact, I’d love to see a small group DVD series to come from this! (ed. Note: There is! Fall 2015).Part one covers proactively investing in your marriage and begins with the all-important chapter on leaving and cleaving. Chapter author Ted Cunningham lovingly and tactfully covers how to separate from one’s parents while still maintaining a relationship with them. Other chapters cover communication (Joshua Straub), sexual intimacy (Juli Slattery), and an intense focus on commitment (Scott Stanley, Gary Smalley) and spiritual intimacy (Joe White).Part two focuses on conflict management and covers topics like personal differences (John Trent), expectations (Bill and Pam Farrel), chores (Susan and Dale Mathis), money (Scott and Bethany Palmer), and dealing with crises (Greg and Erin Smalley). One thing you’ve probably noticed is that most of these chapters are written by a couple. That means you don’t just get a profession opinion, you’re getting a professional opinion that’s also based on real-life experience.The only chapter I have any criticism on is Greg and Erin Smalley’s chapter on fighting well. While I agree with their suggestions for conflict resolution, I do not agree with the premise that fighting is necessary. Marriage sometimes means differences and conflict, but I don’t believe that those things must lead to a fight. They write that out of these fights comes growth, but can’t such growth also come from dealing with the situation before it escalates to a fight?Perhaps the Smalley’s are defining fight differently than I am. And I do think that’s partially the case. They certainly aren’t advocating having knock-down-drag-out shouting matches. To them, “fighting” means to learn to positively deal with conflict. But I still don’t like the terminology. Fighting pits two people on opposite sides and must have a winner and a loser. That’s the opposite of what conflict resolution in marriage should look like!But, given that my only criticism is quite literally mostly semantics, I’ll let it slide. Ready to Wed is a fountain of needed advice that will start your marriage off right. Stop planning for the wedding and start planning for the marriage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJCNLFHZHWCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624054064#wasThisHelpful","R1DJCNLFHZHWCY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anger gets a bad rap. It’s often pictured as wild, out of control, and consuming. Think about the latest Disney movie, Inside Out. Anger is depicted as short (denoting little patience), red (a fiery, bold color), gruff, and easily knocked out of control. But if anger could be a good thing? With that bold premise, Gary Chapman, best known for his Five Love Languages books, tackles the topic of anger and how to control it.Gary Chapman’s first couple of chapters builds the argument that anger is not inherently negative, but can be controlled and tamed and released positively. Anger, he writes, is something that we experience because we are made in the image of God and God experiences anger as well. However, God’s anger is wholly positive and just, an appropriate reaction to sin or injustice. We, as fallen creatures, have perverted anger to make it something negative and petty.Anger, therefore, should stem from our sense of moral concern. It should arise in us when our sense of morality is shaken. He talks about the righteous anger of Jesus, the anger against drunk driving that led to the creation of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the anger against slavery that led to its abolition, and more. Anger, properly controlled, is a powerful force for good.The following chapters deal with difference aspects of anger, from how to control and release good anger to how to control and restrain bad anger. Chapman also discusses specific relationships: anger against God, anger against a spouse, even anger against oneself. He covers both quick-tempered anger that builds quickly and festering grudges that slowly poison. One of my favorite chapters his chapter on teaching children how to handle anger (it applies to us older ones too!). The closing chapter also does a great job in explaining best practices for dealing with angry people (an excellent resource for anyone in the service industry!).Each chapter (after the first two) ends with a Quick Take recap that summarizes and distills the content down into its bare bones structure. For example his quick take on handling anger:  Consciously acknowledge to yourself that you are angry.  Restrain your immediate response.  Locate the focus of your anger.  Analyze your options.  Take constructive action.Anger: Taming a Powerful Emotion is an important and vital read that redeems a much-maligned God-given part of our identity as images of God. This book is a paradigm shifter that will completely change how to react toward your own anger and the anger of others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GJREQMLB7HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802413145#wasThisHelpful","R23GJREQMLB7HQ","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Timothy Dailey’s The Paranormal Conspiracy begins with an intriguing premise: Humankind’s fascination with the paranormal is a Satanic attempt to draw people away from God. Okaaaay…I’m not saying he’s incorrect, but how? Dailey writes that the paranormal conspiracy is a “diabolical plot [meant] to overthrow the Judeo-Christian worldview and plunge the world into darkness and chaos not unlike that of the cinematic zombie apocalypse.” Seriously? That’s not just poor writing, he never actually explains any of this in words that mean anything.Instead, Dailey contents himself to merely talk about alleged paranormal phenomena and alternately say it either doesn’t exist or is evidence of demons. Nothing else. In his chapter, “Beings of High Strangeness,” he begins by talking about Bigfoot sightings and following it with several pages criticizing Bigfoot believers. He then concludes that discussion with a single page basically saying “But there is a lot of eyewitness evidence.He then jarringly switches to a discussion of UFOs and, in the span of two pages, goes through the same formula as Bigfoot: while there’s no solid evidence, lots of people believe. He then concludes the chapter with this bizarre question: “Could these ‘inhumanoid’ entities [Bigfoot and UFOs] be preparing the way for a techno-occult variation appearing in the heavens as fantastically advanced spaceships—proclaiming a New Age formulation of the primordial lie ‘You will be like God’?” Again….what???The next two chapters focus on UFOs almost exclusively, detailing in very boring manner a number of alleged sightings and how they can be debunked. Dailey focuses on alien abductions and draws the conclusion that they are demonic and meant to draw people away from God. But he does this just after talking about how it’s unlikely that UFO sightings and abductions are real! Throughout the book, Dailey tries to both discredit the reality of the paranormal while also claiming it as the work of demons. Furthermore, Dailey fails to realize that very, very few people who claim to be abductees look on the experience as a positive one. Thus, the argument that demons are doing it to…draw people away from God?…he’s not real clear on specifics, so I don’t quite know what he’s going for, is just absurd.The four chapters that follow detail the “extent to which individuals will go to answer the siren call of psychic forces.” The first story is Percy Fawcett’s search for the Lost City of Z. Fawcett was convinced—Dailey tells us in a long and uninteresting fashion—that the lost city was a city of the gods. Long story short, he went and never came back and was never found. Dailey offers this in conclusion: “Misled deep into a jungle trap, beguiled by deceitful spirits, was Fawcett the not-quite-full Colonel.” Again…what??? Poor writing and no real conclusion.The second story, that of Joe Fisher’s descent into spiritism, is probably the highlight of the book. Dailey outlines Fisher’s involvement with séances and communicating with the dead. Fisher ultimately committed suicide, which Dailey attributes to demons or people, he isn’t quite sure which.There’s more to the book, but it’s really just more of the same. Dailey never draws any conclusions, makes any connections, or even fully commits to his own premises. The book lacks any sort of cohesive structure, the writing lacks clarity, and Dailey himself seems to not know the point he’s trying to make. Incredibly disappointing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVU74H8NF623D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800797760#wasThisHelpful","RVU74H8NF623D","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The field of apologetics is in need of good translators. In a field filled with jargon from science, philosophy, and theology, it’s often difficult to make a connection with the average person. There is a distinct lack of lay-level apologetics books that find the balance between dumbed-down simplicity and over-your-head-and-boring academics.J. Warner Wallace has proved himself to be a top-notch translator with Cold Case Christianity and the trend continues magnificently in God’s Crime Scene. In the book, Wallace posits the Universe as a crime scene and asks the all-important question: Has anyone been in the room?Chapter one cleverly asks if the universe was an inside job. That is, did the universe come into being on its own? Through the chapter’s twenty pages, he builds a diverse, cumulative case for a universe that has a beginning (and therefore, a universe that has a cause). Philosophical evidence, residual evidence, quantitative evidence, thermal evidence, observational evidence, theoretical evidence: it all compiles together into a solid case for a Creator. But like all good detectives, Wallace considers alternate theories as well. The chapter is filled with sidebar summaries and key witnesses (primary experts on the topic of discussion, both Christian and non) and well-crafted informative charts and illustrations.This primary chapter sets the style and tone for every chapter to follow. The first four chapters deal with origin and design; the last four deal with the mind, morality, and evil. After this, Wallace has compiled a 70 page chapter of secondary investigation, that is, an evaluation and explanation of naturalistic claims. In these chapters, Wallace goes deeper, giving a more academic approach, but still retains the same style and tone.To me, it’s this chapter that makes the book. It’s not necessary reading, but it shows a dual realization on Wallace’s behalf that this material would have bogged down the main points of the book but that it is also a discussion required to make a strong case.Overall, God’s Crime Scene is one of the best lay-level apologetics books of our age. I’d call J. Warner Wallace the Lee Strobel of this generation but Lee is still writing excellent books too! I’m sure Lee welcomes the company at the top of the apologetics game. An excellent read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI00EPLHN1OY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434707849#wasThisHelpful","RI00EPLHN1OY8","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the few of you who don’t know, Dave Ramsey is the host of the eponymous Dave Ramsey Show, the #3 talk radio show in the country. Dave’s no-nonsense guide to getting out of debt has helped millions and, while he’s not without his detractors, the evidence overwhelms them. At the foundational core of Ramsey’s philosophy is the Seven Baby Steps.  Save $1,000 in a beginner emergency fund ($500 if your income is <$20k).  Pay off all debts beginning with the smallest.  Save 3-6 months of expenses as a full emergency fund.  Invest 15% of your income into Roth IRAs and pretax retirement plans.  Begin college funding for your children.  Pay off your mortgage.  Build wealth and give.It’s under that paradigm that all Dave Ramsey advice flows. Disagree with any of the above and you’ll not be agreeing with much else he has to say. The first couple of chapters deal with your relationship to money: both in terms of dealing with budgeting and working with your spouse to create that budget. That’s quickly followed by a chapter on getting rid of debt, which is, of course, the foundation of Dave Ramsey philosophy.I was excited that a lot of the book focused on what to do in steps 4-7. Listening to his radio show, the majority of people calling in are in the process of getting out of debt. I love hearing their stories and his answers, but I personally find myself past that process. I’m interested in understanding investments, real estate, insurance, how to buy a bargain, and things along that line. (Sidenote: Although it didn’t play to me and hopefully never will, the chapter on dealing with credit bureaus and collections agencies was super informative.) This is where I hadn’t heard Dave talk as much and it was great to see his philosophy on paper and fleshed out.I wish that the chapter on investing had more meat to it, although I do realize that Dave has a pretty bare bones investing philosophy. It’s definitely my own personal weak point and where I’m most interesting in learning more.The appendices in the back of the book include all the budgeting forms put out by Financial Peace, which is, in itself, an invaluable resource.

This is the best adapter I've found.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UR6WJPKA9UZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PL4B3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3UR6WJPKA9UZC","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always looking for a cheap way to illuminate the outside of my house during the night. Not looking for anything too bright, just enough to dissuade any wannabe intruders. I've got a few different systems set out at my front door, but thought this setup would be perfect for the side gate.There is a ""dim"" setting that stays continuously on that flashes to ""bright"" when motion is detected. It's a great way to provide security lighting and notify others that people are in the area. It's great for me because now I can pop out the side door to take the trash out without needing a flashlight.Make sure you install this in a place that will get sun. No sun, no light. But with light, this is all you could ask for in a solar charged LED. Perfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I5EZEXBHS073/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPJ6ZW#wasThisHelpful","R2I5EZEXBHS073","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
