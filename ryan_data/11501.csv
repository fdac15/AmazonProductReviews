"I am a skeptic by nature, a physicist by training, and an oenophile by pleasure.The idea of catalyzing the removal of CO2 from wine didn't seem too far fetched. But then I received this item. It has a stopper that goes in the bottle, but that would seem to defeat the idea of removing CO2 from the wine. Why seal the bottle and cause a build up of pressure, which inhibits outgassing? And then include a pump to remove the CO2, which would naturally leave the bottle if it wasn't stopped?I saw no sign of any removal of CO2, buildup of pressure, or effect of using the pump when trying this item on several bottles of wine. Nor did I notice any improvement in taste.If this thing does anything I suspect it involves the long, rough grooves in the ceramic having a lot of surface area which would hold air against them and, when plunged in the wine, allow the oxygen in the air to slightly aerate the wine.Mostly, I suspect, this device relies on the placebo effect. If that works for some people, it may be worth the cost ...","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6XRTVBZRFRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5MGO6S#wasThisHelpful","R2C6XRTVBZRFRS","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought an SSD to speed up my old laptop, and needed a USB adapter to clone the old drive. This adapter is bare bones, but was cheap and did the job. Couldn't ask for anything more.

"I have an old Fujitsu laptop I liked, except for its speed. Especially the time it took to boot. I'd check into the hotel, start it up, then unpack while I waited for it to boot.I thought an SSD might help, and this one was pretty much the choice. I didn't pay a lot of attention when I ordered it, and didn't realize it would ship from China. And on the slow boat from China, at that. (No fault of the product, of course.)When it finally arrived I set it to the side, and didn't get back to it until a few days ago. Well, the old gray mare is moving faster than she has in years. No, she's no modern race horse. But for use on a trip now and then (I'm on one as I write this) the experience is no longer painful.A new laptop is still on my horizon. But this drive is a cheap way to get some more months out of the one I have.By the way, if you get it as a replacement drive you'll probably want to get a USB adapter so you can clone your current drive.

"I was curious how Gray was going to move from elements to molecules. The elements are a fixed and defined set, so the book organized itself. But molecules are a huge and complex set, beyond the ability of any book to discuss them all.Gray's solution is effective. He groups molecules into groups that will be meaningful to the reader. Thus he has sections on, for example, salts, soaps, and artificial sweeteners. Salts have a strong meaning to chemists, as well as to lay readers. Soaps are less clearly a clean chemical concept, but still meaningful to readers. Artificial sweeteners represent a desired end to industrial chemists more than a group of similar molecules, but are still of interest to readers. Thus he bridges the gap between the science of molecules and keeping a reader's interest.The format is superficially similar to The Elements, with lavish illustrations, discussions of applications, and technical information about each category. Definitely a beguiling volume.What the book lacks, in comparison to The Elements, is the irrefutable logic and sense of completeness of the earlier volume. Which it could never have. At first I leaned toward four stars because The Molecules didn't quite meet the standard set by The Elements. But, then, it couldn't, so that is an unfair standard. Judged on its own merits, this is a five star book.The publisher provided me a copy for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY87O1RPVKABJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579129714#wasThisHelpful","RY87O1RPVKABJ","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: my Acura TSX takes one 26"" and one 16"".My first impression was that they look pretty good, at least for wiper blades. (I'm not that into wiper blades, really.)The instructions are minimalist: two steps, ""Identify wiper arm"" and ""Install new wiper blade"". There are three sets of pictures for three different installations. The pictures are small--Bosch couldn't afford to print them on a full size piece of paper so they'd be easy to see?--but a quick squint and I had the general idea. My installation required squeezing tabs to lift a cover. Not that easy with bare fingers, but I used needle nose pliers for one, which made it much easier.Slipping them on was easy, as was lowing the cover. They hug the windshield well enough, and pick up the windshield washer fluid cleanly and effectively. Plenty good blades for a non-connoisseur.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEMCG45SFRW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ4LS#wasThisHelpful","R3HEMCG45SFRW2","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some reason not everyone enjoys the smell of a sweaty bear. But you can't always hop in the shower when the need arises. When traveling, for example.These wipes worked better than I expected them to. Although about the size of one of those hand wipes that come with the BBQ, these are plusher and have a lot more, and much gentler, cleaning fluid. A quick wipe of the offending areas and the offensive smell is replaced by a subtle, powder smell.

"I'll start with the chocolate, of which there are four varieties:Milk: I'm not a big milk chocolate fan, but this one is a bit richer and darker than the norm.Semisweet: Again fairly rich, but somewhat light and sweet for my taste.Bittersweet: At 70% cacao it is close to the 72% Ghirardelli I often buy, but it tastes lighter and sweeter.Extra Dark: This was my favorite. For an 82% cacao chocolate it is quite rich and smooth. It actually is closer in taste to the 72% Ghirardelli than is the bittersweet.Overall these are good chocolates, but I wouldn't rate them as being all that special.The gimmick is the idea of pairing them with wines. (Which is not novel, other manufacturers have long packaged chocolates for wine pairing.) To this end two small booklets are included in the package. One is about half about how great John Scharffenberger is, and about half a brief introduction to the history and production of chocolate. The other is about the pairing. This second booklet was obviously written for a different product, because it only refers to three of the four varieties (the milk is not included). The pairing information is minimal, and specific wines, down to the vintage, are recommended. More recent vintages of those wines are currently being marketed, again suggesting the booklet is leftover from another product.Also, the hinged lid on the box is cheap and hard to open and to keep on the box.Not a bad product, but not a great one or a great deal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CW5T2XK1TIZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVQ452A#wasThisHelpful","R2CW5T2XK1TIZ4","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this, and then the closing spring on a door started squeaking. Next a cooling fan in a small appliance started rattling. So I had uses for this oil upon arrival.It fixed the door squeak just fine. But the snout was too blunt to get oil into the fan bearing. WD40 helped that one, although I ended up replacing the fan.As for this oil being dry, it isn't really. It feels less oily than regular 3-IN-ONE, and it doesn't leave a very oily feel on surfaces.

"From a purely functional viewpoint, this soap dispenser efficiently dispenses soap. And the big plunger on the top makes the dispensing easy.From an aesthetic standpoint, tastes will vary. Some will see the design as modern, others as industrial. What I hadn't thought through was that the stainless steel part spots very easily. So keeping it looking nice means wiping it off a lot.

Penguins are very in, but they only live in the southern hemisphere.* This little puffin gets tired of being mistaken for a penguin, and goes on a little rant. Sure, he's a bit unfair to penguins. But he has a point, and rants don't tend to be fair.Cute and informative, this is a fun little book.Not to spoil the story, but it ends on a puffin-friendly note.* While the book refers to penguins living in the antarctic, there are also penguins in the Galapagos Islands.

"This knife is probably hurt by Amazon's description saying ""this utility knife is a perfect choice for cutting meats, slicing vegetables, or tackling a loaf of bread"". Oxo's own packaging more modestly says it slices ""soft fruits and tomatoes"".This knife it too short to use as a bread knife. (It might slice a small roll.) As for meat, think the over-sized steak knife some steak houses give you as they try to convince you that everything they offer is big.So here's where my niche problem comes in. I have a Messermeister tomato knife that is nearly as long as this knife, but with a narrower blade and smaller serrations. It's perfect for tomatoes. As I go beyond it's limits, I have high quality, non-serrated, knives that I keep sharp. So this knife doesn't really fill a need in my kitchen.That said, this is a very inexpensive knife for its quality. For someone who doesn't have good quality knives, or doesn't want to keep sharpening them, this knife may fill a niche.Finally, there is the question of the handle. It is rather bulbous. I have small hands, and I don't like the feel of this knife. For someone with larger hands, or trouble gripping things, maybe due to arthritis, it could be a much better fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58W4NQ6GWIWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCJ3#wasThisHelpful","R58W4NQ6GWIWR","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not really that large or heavy but, as something to pack, kind of a brick.It paired with my phone, and the sound is pretty good for its size.

"The Walter Pons Trio recorded soft jazz versions of some popular tunes about fifty years ago. Knowing these recordings only from a handed-down vinyl album, I wondered if they would ever be professionally digitized.I've found a few tracks on other albums, but the transfers were poor. These transfers are excellent. They sound about as good as a fifty year old record is ever going to sound.The original album has a blurb from ""Der Bingle"" (Bing Crosby) saying how much he enjoyed hearing the trio. These are clean, simple, and innocent arrangements performed by a very talented trio. The very fact that after half a century there is still an interest in this album is testimony to it being worthy of notice. If you are looking for edge you won't find it here.

"I have some qualms with this book. Some are questions of presentation, others are errors of fact. I consider these issues to be of particular significance because this book is intended to draw a child's attention to errors of science past.For example, the author says the planets move in oval paths. While I accept the concern with expecting a child to understand the concept of an ellipse, the problem is that a child may have a sense of the word ""oval"" that is inaccurate for the case of planetary orbits, which are very close to circular. Perhaps something like ""the orbits of the planets are not quite circles, being stretched slightly into ovals"" would have been better.The author uses the term ""optical illusion"" to describe the apparent motion of planets. But their apparent motion is not an optical illusion, it is exactly as seen. And it is easily understood in a heliocentric, but not in a geocentric, solar system.This book asserts that ""First, people sent spacecraft to orbit Mars."" The first Mars probes were flybys, which sent back the first pictures showing Mars as a cratered planet.It is noted that ""wobble"" (which I consider a poor choice of term) of another planet's orbit led to the discovery of Pluto.

Instead, it leaves the issue open.The author mentions the legend of Galileo dropping objects off of the Tower of Pisa.

"To begin, I have a very tough beard, and have trouble getting a good shave even with a blade. But my face doesn't like being scraped with blades every day, so when I need to shave on a weekend I tend to go electric.The best electrics I've ever found are by Panasonic, and the ES8243 I currently use is the best electric I've ever found. But it's not perfect, so I'm open to trying other options.This Remington is interesting because the instructions are written for four different models that don't actually have the same instructions. You are told to charge it for 24 hr before use, but the nominal instructions don't describe its behavior, so you have to piece it together. It turned out that the shaver came fully charged. While I understand the need to condition rechargeable batteries, I'm a bit at a loss as to why they want you to charge fully charged batteries for 24 hr.Most current electrics have a head that pivots on the theory that it will better conform to the shape of your face that way. What I have found is that, with a beard as tough as mine, I need to control the angle of the shaver to get a good result.

"OK, a publisher is willing to give you a free copy of a book about sex for a review. Of course you agree.Well, maybe not of course. A key point here is that this is a book by serious authors who want to get the facts out. Yes, they have a sense of humor. They are even willing to titillate a bit. But this book is not raunchy, nor does it pander. If that's what you are looking for, this isn't the book for you.The structure of the book is a series of ""myths"" that some people hold about sex. (I'd say some are far more widely held than others.) They are grouped into sections about men, women, sex, disease, and pregnancy. In each case the authors discuss the best science or surveys available to determine the likely truth. When there is no sound basis to decide, they admit as much.So you can learn, among many other things, how men really measure up. (And how researchers really measure men!) What really is safe. How you really get infected. And how pregnancy really happens. And what won't prevent it.On that last point, I'm amazed that there is enough ignorance out there to support myths like a woman can't get pregnant if she has sex in the water. People really believe that? And there are more like it!The myths are treated as self-contained discussions (although there is an occasional reference to another myth). This is likely good if you read a chapter here and there. But reading the book straight through it leads to some repetition of material. In fact, there are two discussions of premature ejaculation in two different sections, with a lot of common material between them.Written with a solid but light touch, and seemingly well researched, this is an interesting book for someone interested in sex (i.e., most people) and also interested in understanding the facts thereabout (perhaps fewer people).The publisher provided me a copy for review. In case you didn't pick that up. (The authors, by the way, discuss the myth that two condoms are better than one. I won't spoil the surprise.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6M3V559FBM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042267#wasThisHelpful","R1E6M3V559FBM3","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The combination of the reduced size of the popular APS-C sensors with advances in optical glasses and fabrication of aspheric lenses has allowed the creation of compact lenses with remarkable zoom ranges. This lens spans 16-300 mm, a zoom ratio of 18.75. (With the Canon APS-C factor of 1.6, this is a 35 mm equivalent of about 26-480. At the long end that's quite a telephoto!) All this in a package slightly smaller than my Sigma 18-200 from a few years ago.It is, however, a little bigger than its less ambitious competitors, the earlier Tamron AF 18-270 and the Sigma 18-250. Mounted on my 70D it has a nice balance. On a smaller body it might seem a bit big for a ""compact"" zoom.Overall it feels well made, a bit better than the 18-270.To be clear, my rating is for its class, not against a set of prime lenses or a pair of smaller range zooms. This is a lens for when you want to travel light. By its nature it's pretty slow at the long end (f/6.3), which is unavoidable without increasing the lens diameter. It's sharp, but not razor sharp. I see only a little pincusion at the long end, but some clear barrel at the wide end. All typical of this kind of lens, but overall fairly well controlled.This is a lens for carrying around, taking on a hike or a trip, or to an event. It's not a lens for studio work, serious architectural photography (although it will do OK in its mid zoom range), or where you are worried about parallel lines.In other words, it is good at what it claims to be, a fairly compact lens with a huge zoom and without excessive compromises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23A0SB5ZC02T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQ7TD6A#wasThisHelpful","R23A0SB5ZC02T7","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a long time user of CorelDraw, and sill prefer it for vector graphics. (I'm forced to do graphics in PowerPoint at work, and when you've used a program like CorelDraw you understand that PowerPoint is not a graphics program!)For someone serious about computer drawing it's hard to go wrong with Corel. You can do just about anything with it, and if you check out some of the art users have generated with it, people have done just about everything with it. (That, of course, also requires a level of artistic talent I don't have.)PhotoPaint is decent photo/bitmap image editor that has improved over the years. The convenience of being able to edit bitmaps ""within"" CorelDraw is certainly a plus. But I'm a long time Photoshop user, and still prefer it for photo editing. With Adobe having moved to a monthly payment model, however, PhotoPaint looks more appealing in comparison, and the price for the two programs bundled is hard to beat.The value of upgrading from a recent version is less clear. Corel lists a bunch of new features, but they are mostly minor.

"When my Ergo Lounger disintegrated after a few years of use I decided to try something different. After reading some of the negative reviews of Ostrich products, I decided to try this one. Turns out it's an Ostrich, even though the description avoids mentioning that.Some reviewers have complained that it is flimsy, but it's designed to be easily portable, and that implies lightweight construction. It's easy to carry and not overly fragile, at least so far as I have experienced.On the other hand, it's not really a lounge, it's a chair with a footrest. I assume the model in the pictures is quite short, as my legs extend well beyond the end of the footrest, and I'm not very tall. It lies flat, but only sort of. There is a concave region and gap right at your lower back when you flatten it out. (I use a cushion from the old Ergo Lounger to cover and flatten that region.) The handles jut up at an awkward angle when the chair is flat, which inhibits ingress and egress.I do like the flap to cover the reading hole when you aren't using it. On the other hand, the cushions around the reading hole are small and not really up to the job; I supplement them with another cushion salvaged from the Ergo Lounger.So it's adequate, but no more than that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRT8XYI4WH7GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OBKQ54#wasThisHelpful","RRT8XYI4WH7GF","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sandra is very, very smart. Sandra can be very insightful, and very amusing. But Sandra is a prima donna (she's a performance artist, after all--not exactly the realm of those of normal ego).As Sandra relates her life during her period of change--apparently, if I interpret the acknowledgements correctly, in somewhat fictionalized form--she is often insightful and very often funny. But there are times when her self-absorption and sense of entitlement cause a bit of cringing. Many women go through the symptoms she went through, but most won't view themselves as being as special as she views herself.Fortunately, the worst of the self-indulgence is in the first half of the book, and it's easier to laugh and enjoy the ride later on.For all the humor of this book, I walked away from it thinking I would not want to actually be someone close to Sandra. She seems to suck the life out of her sphere of influence to feed her performance art.

"""God Bless America"" and ""This Land is Your Land"" are two seminal songs about America. Their paths to composition, however, were very different, and actually linked.This book brings together three threads. The first is about American musical traditions, from minstrelsy to hillbilly, that provide the background for the two songs. Second are the alternating biographies of two composers who had many things in common, yet were very different in outlook. Finally, there are the details of how each song came to be written.Berlin and Guthrie both rose from aching poverty to success. Both were strong advocates for civil rights and integration. Berlin was a Jew who married a Gentile over her father's objection. Guthrie was a Christian who married a Jew over her father's objection. But they had very different worldviews.When Berlin was a child his family came to America to escape the pogroms in Russia. They were very poor, but there were no pogroms in America, and it was a time of opportunity. Berlin became successful at a young age, and was wealthy and famous by the time of the Depression. He felt a deep love and gratitude toward America.Guthrie, a generation younger, grew up poor in Oklahoma, and experienced both the Depression and the Dust Bowl as a young man. He saw a nation with both wealth and poverty, one that failed to take care of the poor and needy. He became a leftist and communist sympathizer.Shaw looks at the history of anthems, and particularly American anthems, and discusses how they arise from their times, and sometimes fall out of favor. (He frequently mentions ""Yankee Doodle"".) One, ""America the Beautiful"", was an influence for both Berlin and Guthrie. Shaw also discusses how different American musical traditions influenced the two songwriters. Tin Pan Alley, from whence Berlin arose, had strong roots in minstrelsy. I was surprised to learn that Berlin, who insisted on an integrated cast when he produced ""This is the Army"" during World War II (the real Army was not integrated) also included a blackface number! Guthrie's musical roots were different, more aligned with what might now be considered country.When, in 1938, Kate Smith wanted a patriotic song from Berlin he, being both sincerely patriotic and also very fearful of the Nazis (recall he was a Jew whose family fled pogroms in Russia) reworked a song he had cut from a WW I production into ""God Bless America"", which was an immediate hit, filling a need the American public had for such an anthem at that time.Guthrie and his crowd had different feelings. In fact, Guthrie started ""This Land is Your Land"" as a response, and included leftest and communist verses in the early versions. He reworked it many times over many years, but what we know today is far from his original version.But America is a great assimilator, if not always a melting plot. Both songs have become embraced and loved as part of our heritage.Ultimately, life is not fair. Berlin lived to be 101, and lived well for most of those years. Guthrie died at 55 of Huntington's disease, following fifteen years of very poor health.This book is fascinating, well researched, and well written. One criticism is that the author knows almost too much about America's musical history, and sometimes wanders away from the central story for too long in displaying his knowledge. A bit more editing would have resulted in a tighter book.This is a niche book, but if you find the premise interesting you should enjoy it.The publisher provided me a copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXW4UNWI9YP2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161039223X#wasThisHelpful","RXW4UNWI9YP2X","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Greg Bellow, oldest son of Saul, has written a memoir of his life with (and, often, without) his father, and with the extended family and world his father created. For anyone familiar with the Bellow story, it will come as no shock that there is a lot of heartache in the story. Saul Bellow was married five times, carried his disputes with his wives and others around him into his books, and was known as a curmudgeon in his later life.(Tolstoy's comment that ""every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"" comes to mind reading the story of the Bellow family.)It is difficult to evaluate a book like this one. You read it because it is about Saul, but it is the memoir of Greg. It is Greg's story, but he knows that what the reader wants to hear about is Saul. But he can't tell his story without drifting away from Saul at times.While seemingly not a great premise for a book, the topic of Saul Bellow is important enough that the book adds to our understanding of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. While hardly objective, the son's memoir allows a viewpoint on Saul's pains and the pains he inflicted on others that it would be hard for an objective biographer to achieve. A reader should, of course, read it with a grain of salt. But a Bellow lover should read it.Greg Bellow is a (retired) psychotherapist, and his training and experience both adds to and subtracts from the story. Sometimes his training provides insight into Saul's behavior, but at other times the analysis gets a bit in the way of the flow of the story.Of particular interest is the author's evaluation of the evolution of the ""Young Saul"" into the ""Old Saul"". In his youth Bellow was a very progressive voice. Late in life he became very conservative, and often not in a constructive way. Greg provides a lot of discussion of the transition, but mostly from a personal viewpoint of how it led to differences with his father. (Importantly, he discusses the influence Allan Bloom had on Bellow.)My takeaway from the discussion is that Bellow was disillusioned when his progressive ideas failed to lead to a greatly improved society, which he likely also saw as undermining his chance to be seen as a prophet. His son takes it more personally, as a betrayal of earlier, commonly-held beliefs. I think this is an example of where the author's closeness to the subject gets in the way of the story.Nonetheless, warts and all, this is a good book to have. And it's hard to see how we could have a book with this valuable viewpoint without some warts.The publisher provided me a copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32NB9TMYUPZEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608199975#wasThisHelpful","R32NB9TMYUPZEG","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My prior experience with Undset was reading the epic Kristin Lavransdatter set in medieval Norway.* This work is very different.Marta Oulie is an introspective (but not autobiographical) novel. Like many young authors in early works, Undset is exploring how she differs from those around her. Her perspective on the world is big, and her surrounding seem to constrain her. The conventional and expected life doesn't fit her.Marta has the additional burden of being a woman in a world that hasn't yet accepted women working after marriage, much less being full participants in intellectual life. (Although early twentieth-century Norway was hardly as oppressive as many societies.)While Marta is self-centered--hardly a rarity among author-surrogate characters, as authors tend to need to be self-centered to endure the obstacles to success--she is also acutely aware of how she hurts those around her, something not always found in this type of early, introspective, novel.Marta tries at, fails at, yet again tries at love with her husband. But the pieces never completely fit together, because her inner life never completely fits with her outer life. She can dissect the problems with herself and her life analytically, but she can't impose solutions on herself emotionally.This is a short but remarkable book. It provides an insight into Undset the person that a reader could never deduce from reading a work like Kristin Lavransdatter. Highly recommended.I was provided a copy for review by the publisher.* A more recent translation, which I have not read, is available: Kristin Lavransdatter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UCDQPEV4MC8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816692521#wasThisHelpful","R1UCDQPEV4MC8Z","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For context, I am a physicist by training, and well versed in relativity theory. And I've been faced with the challenge of explaining relativity, and therefore know it's not as easy as it may sound.Overall, I will say that Bennett has done a good job. He walks through many simple examples, slowly building up the story of what Einstein realized and codified from his student days through the final papers on the general theory. It's a cute but non-obtrusive choice to have many examples place the reader in a scenario with his or her friend ""Al"" as the second party.While I don't know of a better choice for the beginning relativist, this book is not quite perfect. I think Bennett draws out some of his scenarios a bit long; most readers will either have gotten the idea or aren't going to. He opens with the idea of someone traveling to a distant star and aging slower, but defers the ""twin paradox"" this raises until much later in the book, when he is into the general theory and ready to explain it. (This is fine if you believe that your readers won't figure out that there is a ""relativity"" problem with the story and spend chapters wondering what is going on.)My biggest issue with the book centers on a personal peeve, and maybe most people won't care about it. Bennett employs the rubber bedsheet model, and while he admits it has limitations, to me it misses the point of the general theory. The rubber bedsheet model invokes a mythical gravitational force at the bottom of the page that has nothing to do with relativity. The curvature of spacetime is intrinsic to spacetime, and I find this model to be a distraction.This book also fails to highlight what I consider the most profound aspect of relativity. Einstein began by realizing that light is seen to travel at the same speed in every reference frame. But the special theory teaches us that what we think of as the speed of light is merely a conversion constant between space and time units, which are really the same. Bennett introduces the idea of setting the speed of light as 1, but doesn't really talk about how fundamental a geometric principle that has become in physics. In the general theory we learn that light travels on a null geodesic, which ultimately separates the casual from the noncasual. I realize this may be a little deep for a popular book, but it is, to me, at the heart of relativity theory.The publisher provided me a copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R77AJUCO8297Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231167261#wasThisHelpful","R77AJUCO8297Z","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rassoul is sent to Leningrad to study by his communist father. He loves Dostoevsky, but not Russia nor communism, and he returns to Kabul, a city chaotic, anarchistic, and dangerous.Having few prospects and a fiancee and her family to support, he decides to murder a woman of questionable morals and steal her money. In mid blow he begins to think of Raskolnikov and sees himself recreating Crime and Punishment. He ends up killing the woman, but can't take the money. He moves to the side, and sees a woman in a ""sky-blue chador"" appear to complete the crime. This is not a hugely useful piece of information, because there are many women in sky-blue chadors in Kabul.He begins to inhabit the story of Raskolnikov, and imagines he is being sought for the murder. But late twentieth century Kabul in not mid nineteenth century Saint Petersburg.* There is no functioning civil authority, and death is commonplace. No one seems to notice that the woman was murdered, much less care. Her family thinks she may have gone away. The body and the blood disappear.Where Raskolnikov played a psychological game against the investigator in his head, Rassoul plays a psychological game against confusing stimuli and an invented moral force in his head. When he finally seeks authorities to confess to and be punished by, he finds that they either don't care, or actually believe he was justified in the killing.The comparison to Kafka is slightly unfair, as in Kafka the protagonists faced a labyrinth of incomprehensible bureaucracy, while here the labyrinth is more sprawling and encompasses the lawlessness of the whole society. But I invoke Kafka because where Raskolnikov faced the certainty that an investigator was pursuing him, Rassoul suffers similar moral and psychological doubts while also confronting uncertainty about what is really happening around him. Where Dostoevsky was very focused on what went on in Raskolnikov's head, Rahimi's story is more divided between the story in Rassoul's head and the chaos of the Afghanistan he interacts with.This book is not as deep and gripping as Crime and Punishment, but it pulls you along and is intense at times. Without wanting to give away anything, I found the ending to have a little of bit melodrama that broke the intensity of the story.I very much enjoyed this book, and recommend it to lovers of Dostoevsky and those interested in Afghanistan.* Saint Petersburg was known as Leningrad in Soviet times.I read the UK edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5Q99ZQ691MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590515471#wasThisHelpful","R2U5Q99ZQ691MH","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What most attracted me to this album was the premier recording of the Leroy Anderson concerto. As is to be expected of his music, it is light and tuneful, although none of the tunes stuck in my head. Interesting to hear, but not a significant addition to the repertoire.If Gershwin's Second Rhapsody is heard far less often than his more famous pieces for piano and orchestra, it is for a reason. While pleasant enough, it is not Gershwin at his best.Gottschalk's Grand Tarantelle is the best piece on the album. It's jaunty and tuneful, as is typical of the composer.

The book is well illustrated and has the text in both English and Spanish.Given his age, the tortoise sufferers memory lapses. Fair enough, and it adds some flavor to the story.

"Having read about the abuse of First Nation's children in residential schools, I was interested in reading this book. I suppose if I'd read the description more carefully I would have realized that this was an academic monograph about the commission itself, not a work more specifically about the history of the schools. No fault of the author there.Niezen is fair upfront about what the commission was and what it wasn't. It wasn't an attempt to learn historical truth. It offered people who had been hurt an opportunity to tell their stories and, possibly, achieve some catharsis. But he also discusses how some people suffered from remembering long-suppressed injuries, and how some witnesses were really more aggrieved by events that happened to them later in their lives.While the commission was was titled ""Truth and Reconciliation"", Niezen titles this work ""Truth and Indignation"". That is appropriate, because the commission didn't try to ""reconcile"" the two sides. It was a relocating forum for victims to testify to their molestation. But while there is no question that many native children where harmed, that in and of itself doesn't tell a complete story. What fraction were harmed? While any child abused is one too many, a system that abuses 1% of children is not the same as one that abuses 99% of them. Were the people--mostly from religious orders--who ran the schools mostly monsters, or mostly good people with a few monsters among them?Niezen also interviews people--primarily priests and nuns--who worked at the schools. They present a very different version of history, and also express their hurt that the commission seemed focused on publicizing the bad while burying the good that happened in the residential schools. Hearing the other side greatly complicates the moral certainty of the story.While some of these people acknowledge knowing that there was abuse taking place, many come across as sincere, caring people. They note that they tried to run schools for the nation without being provided adequate resources. Some learned and tried to preserve native languages, while the commission portrayed them as dedicated to extinguishing native culture.So the commission provided a forum for people hurt by the system to express their pain, but did not serve to generate a fair assessment of the larger impact of the residential schools. And that ultimate assessment is beyond the scope of this book.Where this book does come up short is in its overly academic and convoluted language. While I understand the need for academic works to be precisely written, that doesn't generally preclude simple English expression. In the early pages alone there are phrases like ""[t]he methodological paradigm of ideography ..."" and ""... in contrast to the the crowded heterogeneity and simultaneity of the multiple-venue regional and national events ..."". The author reverts to simpler discourse in his final summation, but the damage is done by that point. I think a harsh but loving editor would have made this a much better book.The publisher provided me a copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDM1BYCLJFYEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442606304#wasThisHelpful","RDM1BYCLJFYEV","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ran across the ""Healthy Grain"" style in a supermarket, and decided to give them a try. Liking them, I decided to give these a try. With only 90 calories (25 from fat) and 9 g of fiber, using one of these to make a wrap rather than two slices of bread to make a sandwich is a great way to add some fiber while cutting a few calories and simple carbohydrates.With that much fiber and that little fat, they are inevitably on the dry side.

"Perhaps unfairly, I expected this book to delve more generally into how math has influenced art. In fact, the author presents various mathematical symmetries and theorems, and the artist creates artwork based on them. Each mathematical topic is a chapter, with a few page explanation of the math, a plate of artwork, and often additional drawings.Although presented clearly and at an introductory level, the math is serious. If you have no interest in math you probably won't enjoy this book, and if you have no basic understanding of math, at least through introductory algebra and geometry, you may have trouble following it.Likewise, if you don't enjoy art, and specifically art based on symmetrical patterns, the artsy part of the book may not interest you.This is a case where the Amazon ""Look Inside"" feature can be used to good value. You can read a chapter or two, and look at some of the pictures. If you want to read more, this is a good book for you.

"It wasn't too hard to figure out why my garage door opener didn't open my garage door anymore. It wasn't even that hard to figure out that, although this is the part that commonly fails, no one locally has it available.So I had to order it. Installation, in principle, is easy. The old part slips off the track and the new part slips on. Because of the placement of my door hardware, however, it wasn't that simple. To create room to get parts off and on the track I had to remove four additional bolts so I could rotate as well as translate the track. With that I was just able to make the swap. What might have been a 15 minute job became a 45 minute job.And this part is just the basic part. You need to reuse the connector and cotter pin, the disconnect pull, and the warning label from the old part.

"The subtitle of this book is ""the Science of Champagne"", and this is a book of science. It starts with an historical introduction to sparkling wine (the real history, not the myths). But then it get into science. Real science.As you go through this book you'll encounter Henry's law and Van der Waals forces. You'll learn the difference between the fluid sphere limit and the rigid sphere limit. On one page you'll encounter wake instabilities and hydrodynamic instability.

"To be honest, when I first saw the title of this book my thought was, ""Yes, but not as smart as they think they are!"".But a key to this book is the subtitle, ""The Mammal Behind the Myth"". Because a lot of what we think about dolphins is based on the Einstein of the Sea view that John Lilly promulgated for years, based first on questionable research, and later on speculation and fantasy. Gregg, a dolphin researcher, first extricates the question from Lilly's grip, then begins to present the evidence.He starts by explaining that there is no definition of general intelligence that allows clear comparisons across species. Science can define (and sometimes test) specific cognitive skills, but can't really define a basket of cognitive skills that can be used to rank species in intelligence.Some birds do extremely well on certain tests of cognitive skills, better than animals generally considered to be ""smarter"". This is not a surprise, as species evolve to thrive in a particular environment, and so a species can evolve a particular cognitive skill without evolving a broader ""intelligence"". In fact, some insects have behaviors that might seem intelligent, but clearly aren't due to highly capable brains, which they lack.As Gregg reviews dolphin performance on various tests, he shows that they do well on some, and not so well on others. They certainly don't seem to reach human levels.He then takes on the idea of a ""Dolphinese"" language. In the Lilly mythology, if we could only figure out the Dolphinese-English (or Spanish or Swahili, the particular human language doesn't matter) dictionary, we could share with dolphins profound insights and witty aphorisms. But the evidence doesn't support dolphins having a human-like language. Yes, they communicate, and in ways similar to other pretty smart animals. (And pretty dumb insects can manage pretty sophisticated communication.) But Dolphinese as a human-level language just doesn't exist.Next, Gregg takes on the idea that dolphins are gentle, caring animals. Yes, they often play with or help each other, and sometimes with dolphins of other species, and sometimes with humans. But they also commit infanticide and attack (and kill) dolphins of other species. And they are carnivores; Gregg notes that there are no vegetarian dolphins.One issue that concerned me throughout the book, and which Gregg addresses near the very end, is that ""dolphin"" encompasses a lot of disparate species. While most of the research has been done with bottlenose dolphins, he relates information from other species, as well. There is no reason to suppose that all dolphins are of similar intelligence.Consider, for a moment, a book called ""Are Apes Really Smart?"". We know that apes differ widely in intelligence. Humans are very closely related to chimps and bonobos, yet we are generally considered much smarter. Gorillas are often viewed as extra-large chimps (partly because they both knuckle-walk). But gorillas don't seem to be as smart as chimps. And the so-called lesser apes aren't as smart as the great apes.So, while Gregg touches on the issue of different dolphin species at the end of the book, it is such an important issue that I think it would have been better for him to discuss it early on.So how smart are dolphins? They certainly aren't as smart as the myths Lilly created suggest. They don't seem to approach human intelligence. But where they rank compared to other animals isn't clear based on the evidence available. We know they're pretty smart, but we don't know just how smart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4HGD56GZ90L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019966045X#wasThisHelpful","R1H4HGD56GZ90L","AOKQZVWCLONRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKQZVWCLONRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like color. Really. While I can admire black and white photos, I prefer color.

That's mostly well done, but I would have liked more depth. (As a physicist I might not be the average reader ...)Later parts of the book alternate between sections about different colors and how color is related to things like the universe or animals. Here it get a little bit choppy.Sections on each color seem a bit like grab bags of things that color. Color in nature seems to lose focus. For example, one section discusses the color of animals, but from the standpoint of how we see them in their environment. Another section discusses how different animals see color differently. I would have liked to have seen a discussion of how animals are seen by other animals they want or don't want to see them.There are some things that are a bit off. Pictures of the planets seem arbitrarily sized, so you might think Venus was the largest planet, and Mars bigger than either Earth or Jupiter. The discussion of the color of gemstones is oversimplified. They say a cardinal stores berries in its feather when they surely mean the pigments from berries.

"I've been tasting--and drinking!--wine for decades. My friends tend to think of me as something of a connoisseur. But when I read descriptions like ""undertones of rose petals beneath burnt shoe leather"" I roll my eyes.This book, on the other hand, oversimplifies, decomposing wine into a handful of aromas. I think that's a good starting point, and I applaud the author for cutting through the crap of wine puffery. But there is another level or two of subtlety beyond this book, and it won't make you an ""expert"".In format it's a 22 page board book, much like you'd give a small child. But the text, as well as the subject, is grown up. It walks you through the basic categories of wine smells--the biggest components of taste--and lets you ""scratch & sniff"". As such, it's a great starting point for understanding wine.What's peculiar is that while the author does noble service in cutting through the pretense that surrounds--and inflicts--wine tasting and wine descriptions, he feels the need to posture his brief, otherwise excellent, introduction as a guide that will make readers experts. In that, he's actually pretentious in attacking pretension.If you are a beginner trying to understand what wine people are talking about, this book is a good starting point, as well as a good corrective to snobbery.

"I always wanted a dash cam, but I'm particular about features and quality. I researched for days before deciding on this one for my minivan.POSITIVES:* I am impressed by the video this tiny thing can capture! The picture is nothing less than crystal clear HD. Need to read that license plate? No problem!* The dash cam is so unobtrusive, if you mount it so that the lens is just below your windshield's tint strip, no one will notice you have a dash cam unless they specifically look closely for it.* Continuous-loop recording means you'll never have to swap out memory cards.* After six months of continuous, daily use, my dash cam is still going strong.NEGATIVES:* The camera records continuously, but saves the video to the memory card in five-minute segments. So, for example, if you want to review a two-hour trip, you'll have to open and view 24 independent files. Fortunately, the video segments overlap slightly, so you'll never lose a second of video.  But that also means if you want to use editing software to create a long, seamless video of your trip, you'll need to do a LOT of tiresome video stitching.* The menu and the five black buttons are not very intuitive. It will take patience to navigate the menu to find what you need and get the camera to do what you want.* The video is slightly choppy (it jerks about once a second), however, that may not have anything to do with the camera. I've read up on the problem, and it could be the memory card or even my computer.Summary: This dash cam does exactly what I want it to do -- it gives me peace of mind. I am a cautious driver, but I drive often and therefore witness a lot of crazy people on the road. Some day one of those crazy drivers is going to get too close to me, and when they do, my dash cam going to make my insurance agent very happy! If you're looking for a nice-quality, reliable dash cam in a tiny, unobtrusive package, I highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUFRZW8L85636/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK8B47W#wasThisHelpful","RUFRZW8L85636","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What this book does so well is explain how polka music came about, flourished, and how it exists today in its various styles. A lot of history is covered, yet the book is not too wordy or lengthy. The book concentrates on the more influential bands over the decades, and discusses a few of the other bands that have come after and them and still play to this day. It probably would have been easy to overload the book with band and musician data, but in my opinion, Rick March did a perfect job of condensing all of his research into a superb read.The average person on the street doesn't know polka music comes in very specific, different styles. They think it's all tubas and accordions, and it's either Polish or German depending on who you talk to. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Therefore, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge of polka music.Dick Blau's professional photography is second to none. His photos don't just compliment the reading; they invoke emotion.The main reading of the book is interspersed with interludes that focus on specific people, places, and things that are uniquely relevant to Midwest polka music.Whether they were Iowa farmers or Chicago foundry workers, your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents kicked up their heels to polka music. Though the polka's heyday is long gone, the music is likely still in your blood, waiting to be tapped and enjoyed. Reading this book will take you all around the heartland of America and teach you about the music of your ancestors, and share with you the joy it brought to them and still brings to so many people today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SF67LRBAYS1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870207229#wasThisHelpful","R3SF67LRBAYS1H","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've played with several different racquets over the years, but this is my first made of graphene.Right off the bat, I didn't care for it. I wasn't getting a nice-sounding ""ping"" and I was having trouble adjusting to the racquet's sweet spot. But after using the racquet several times over the last couple weeks, I've adjusted to it rather quickly. Now I love it, and have raised my review to five stars. I especially like the weight distribution and swing action. It's a fantastic racquet to swing hard with, and also deliver quick-spinning drop shots. Hard hits on the sweet spot will zero in on their target.In my opinion, at the recreational level, graphene doesn't seem to provide any kind of noticeable advantage over your typical carbon/titanium/graphite composites. If you're a 3.0 or a modest 3.5 player, graphene is probably not going to improve your game. It could even hurt it a little bit if you're used to racquets with a larger sweet spot. But if you're a hard baseline hitter or like to play the net in competitive doubles, I think you'll enjoy the weight and balance of this racquet.In general, while I am impressed by the scientific breakthrough of graphene, I haven't yet experienced the material to be a significant advancement in technology as it pertains to tennis racquets. I give this racquet five stars for simply being a really good racquet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JQP2HDKBLM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYZZ862#wasThisHelpful","R11JQP2HDKBLM9","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this low-profile heater to custom-mount underneath a music stand. Overall, I'm very pleased with it. It's a just a basic heater with three settings: fan, low, and high. No thermostat.

"I recently purchased and installed a $225 Rigid Industries 50481 D-Series SAE Fog Light Set on my minivan. They're top-of-the-line LED lights. I quickly discovered a problem with those lights, though. When mounted low and properly aimed, the wash of light they lay onto the road directly in front of your car is so bright, it causes your pupils to constrict and reflects a hazy glare onto your windshield, making it literally harder to see into the darkness with the lights on.I once owned a sport wagon that had PIAA Plasma Ion bulbs in the fog light housings, and they worked beautifully, so I decided to go back to halogen lighting and try out these PIAA 2011 fog lights on my minivan. Would they give me the same results?Yep! These lights work great! The Rigid LED lights did a great job of pouring intense, white light onto the road, but that light seemed to die when it hit the darker foliage along the sides, and it didn't help much to illuminate distant objects except for reflective road signs. The light from the halogen PIAAs, however, scatters and diffuses naturally to illuminate everything much more uniformly, from the lighter pavement and shoulders to the darker foliage. And the light carries well, meaning it will help me to spot more important things, like deer. I created and attached an oversimplified graphic to show the visible difference between the Rigid Industries LED lights and the PIAA 2011 lights when driving.When it comes to quality construction, nothing beats Rigid Industries' LED light housings, mounting brackets, connectors, and hardware. They are the most durable auxiliary vehicle lights I've ever come across. The PIAA 2011 light housings are lightweight plastic with glass lenses. They're good enough, and I don't anticipate any problems, but they're not in the same league as the Rigid lights.I have to admit, though, I don't understand why these PIAA fog lights, which run about $185 for a pair, are so much more expensive than other halogen fog lights. I don't know why the price difference is so exorbitant. I'm led to believe most of the money we're paying out for these lights is just for the PIAA name. But I'm not here to rate their price. I'm just here to rate how well they work, and for that, I have to give them an uncontested five stars. If you're simply looking for the best lighting regardless of price, you won't go wrong with these PIAA fog lights.A few things to note:1. This is just one light. If you need a two-light kit with a switch and wiring, order a PIAA 2091 2000i Yellow Plasma Ion Fog Lamp Kit2. Each light comes with about 6"" of wiring that terminates in a plastic PIAA connector. Unless you have existing PIAA wiring, you're going to need to snip off the plastic connector and then either hard-wire or crimp the light to your own, supplied wiring. So make sure you first test the lights before you begin installing them.3. The beam is wide and relatively flat, and the color of the beam is white in the middle and yellow toward the outer edges.4. When the lights are off, they don't look the slightest bit yellow as the product photos show. Up close, you can tell they have yellow bulbs in them, but otherwise they look like regular, white driving lights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M183G37NS53B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GBQ420#wasThisHelpful","R2M183G37NS53B","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I'd like to say about these fog lights is that they are extremely well-built. The housing is tough, and the wire boots/gaskets show that nothing was left to chance in the construction of these lights. The ingeniously-designed mounting brackets allow for both flexible light placement and beam adjustment. I've owned a lot of universal fog/driving lights over the years, and these are, by far, the most durable of them all.The only practical place I could mount these lights on my minivan was in the lower section of the front bumper, inside the air dam. I mounted them upside-down to the bottom of the bumper's metal frame. This put them at the same height as the factory fog/driving lights that come on most cars and minivans. But then I discovered a problem...When the lights are mounted low on a vehicle and properly aimed, they dispense a very intense wash of light onto the road right in front of the vehicle. The wash is so bright that it has two negative effects: 1. It reflects a glare onto your entire windshield, which is amplified by the slightest haze or dirt on the windshield. 2. If you're driving on a completely dark roadway such as a rural interstate, the wash of light on the road is so bright that it constricts your pupils enough to make it more difficult to see out into the darkness and spot potential dangers, such as deer.The light wash is so overwhelming that it's literally easier to see, and therefore safer to drive, with the fog lights off rather than on. Being able to see better without auxiliary lighting sounds counter-intuitive, but the reasoning is no different than why you don't go star-gazing during a full moon.In order for these lights to be effective, they'd no doubt need to be mounted higher on a vehicle so that the beam of light contacts the road further in front of vehicle. This is not a problem for vehicles like trucks or jeeps, but it's not an option for the average car or minivan.Unfortunately, after less than a half-hour of use, I ended up uninstalling the fog lights and selling them on eBay.I give these lights the highest marks for brightness, durability, and craftsmanship, but an average rating of three stars overall due to their limited vehicle applicability.Sidenote: I ended up buying a couple of PIAA 2011 2000i Yellow Plasma Ion Fog Lamps. The difference was remarkable. Even though the PIAAs have a flat, wide beam like the Rigid LED's, there's something about the way halogen light spreads and scatters, uniformly lighting up everything from light pavement to dark foliage. LED lighting just doesn't have that property. I don't have a degree in physics to know why. All I know is that reverting to halogen fog lights was the right choice for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19E889HOKCBL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1RS83M#wasThisHelpful","R19E889HOKCBL6","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been using Westone UM Pro10s, but they kept failing under warranty. For that reason, I was given special permission to return them to the retailer in exchange for another brand, and I chose the Shure SE215s.It was not one of my better decisions.The first thing I noticed is that the default earpads were unusually big. It took some wrangling, but I eventually got them off and replaced them with smaller ones. That helped quite a bit, but the monitors themselves aren't nearly as ergonomic as the Westones. The Westones felt as if they were molded to the curvatures of my ears, and could be popped in and out in a second. The Shures, on the other hand, seem bulkier and don't sit well. I really have to cram them into my ears to get them to stay, and even then they occasionally twist themselves out of a tight seal. I never once had that problem with the Westones.The wires coming from the Westones are light and flexible, allowing you to quickly rest them behind your ears. But the wires coming from the Shures are rigid, and therefore not friendly to people who wear glasses. Even though they can be bent somewhat like a coat hanger, I can't inconspicuously tuck them behind my ears.I have no complaints as far as the clarity of the audio is concerned, but the Shures sounded significantly brighter than the Westones... almost bordering on unpleasant. But they also put out more low end than the Westones. Personally, I prefer the flatter response of the Westones.In hindsight, even though my Westones were dying under warranty after about every 15-20 hours of use, I would have been happier if I had purchased a second set of Westones as a backup pair, and took turns sending them back for warranty repair as needed. But now that I'm stuck with the Shures, I've decided to re-purchase a pair of Westone UM Pro10s, and will be using the Shures only as a backup when my Westones are away for repair.POSITIVES:* Cost $50 less* Slightly longer cord* Brighter and deeper response (if that's what you prefer)NEGATIVES:* Don't fit as well* Wiring too rigid to make inconspicuous* Too bright for my taste","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9EQNW8RVOZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PO10E2#wasThisHelpful","R1P9EQNW8RVOZD","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to come right out and describe what these light shakes taste like: Let's say you just ate a bowl of Frosted Flakes or some other sugary cereal. Now take the little bit of milk left over in the bowl, add a few packets of Splenda, and add a few drops of paint thinner.  Yeah, it's kind of like that.So why four stars?  Because there is a significant dietary benefit to drinking this shake: The artificial sweetener is sweet enough to curb any further craving for sweets or chocolate. So instead of drinking a 190-calorie, sugary protein shake like Special K or Slim Fast, you can gulp this down, save 120 calories, and feel exactly the same a few minutes afterward.

"My only complaint is that it seems like On Stage designed and built this product without testing it first.  If they had attempted, for example, to mount a couple of Shure SM-81s in an X/Y position, they would have discovered that they needed to make the bar at least an inch wider.  The bar is so short that you have to push the heads of the SM-81s partially into the clips.It might not be easy to gauge by the product photo alone, but picture two mic clips mounted on the bar at a 90-degree angle.  There's plenty of room for the clips, but as soon as you mount the microphones, you realize there's not enough room between the clips (uness you're using mics with very small heads.)Other than that, you get what you pay for, which is a mic bar that's prone to swiveling loose upon contact.  If you're willing to tinker and fidget with it, the MY500 will get the job done, but my recommendation would be to save yourself a small headache by spending a little more money for a better mic bar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYVGXHCSP0S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ZO3LU#wasThisHelpful","R2CYVGXHCSP0S1","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The stability and versatility of this mic stand just can't be compared to a regular boom stand.  My Studio Projects C-1 large diaphragm condenser mic and metal pop filter are now standing rock solid on my studio's heavily carpeted floor.  Within the first thirty seconds after setting up this stand in my recording studio, I decided to buy a second one.In the isolation booth, the counterweight on this stand allows me to position the stand off to the side, raise the mic high and extend the mic down and over to the singer via the long boom.  This frees up all the space in front of the performer beneath the mic, leaving plenty of room for a music stand.  It also reduces the risk of a performer accidentally knocking the mic stand over.  That's an expected occurrence when you use regular boom stands, but these stands offer significant resistance to tipping.The construction of the stand is very solid.  Its sturdiness meets all my expectations.  My second stand will be arriving in a few days, and I can't wait.  I wish I had these stands in my studio a long time ago!UPDATE: I ordered both of my stands from Amazon, and each time, they arrived in a box that was literally torn open in several places.

"If you Google for images of this patch bay, you'll never see a photo of its underside.  Well, that's because it literally doesn't have one.  Nor does it have any sides.  This patch bay is not a solid box.  It's basically an L-shaped, open metal frame to which 24 1/4"" modules attach.  The modules' circuit boards are completely exposed.Each of the 24 4-jack modules is secured to the patch bay frame with only a single plastic nut that screws onto plastic threading.  (Um, are you kidding me?!?)I installed this patch bay in my studio today, and even though it's functioning, I've already begun shopping for its future replacement because I can't imagine this patch bay will last more than a year before the jacks crack or strip, or the modules are permeated by dust.  I also racked my patch bay upside down so that the labeling strips were on top, and to give each module a little firmer seating in case its single, plastic mounting nut ever loosened.  Then I used a black Sharpie marker to draw division lines through the label strips between the modules.Removing a module to flip (de-normalize) it requires unscrewing its threaded nut.  Unfortunately the modules are too close together to seat a metric socket onto the nut, so you either have to fumble with a half-seated socket or try to grasp it with a needle-nose pliers.  It took me over a half-hour to de-normalize all 24 modules.In summary, for a hundred bucks, I'd at least like my patch bay to have... you know... all six sides.  And I'd like to have more than one screw holding in the modules.  And those screws should be... you know... metal.  Given it's lackluster design and the most corner-cutting construction I've ever seen in a piece of studio gear, in no way would I value this product anywhere near $100.

"Long before I started using a Grace 101, I had been relying on consumer-grade preamps, such as the kind built into my Mackie 8-Bus mixer.  They're good preamps, but it wasn't until I started using the Grace 101 that I heard the difference between a consumer-grade preamp and a pro-grade preamp.  With the 101, instruments and vocals started sparkling with a clarity they've never had before.  Higher-frequency sounds like vocal sibilants and drum cymbals began to shimmer.  Microphones started shining with their true colors.  (It is absolutely amazing what a hundred-dollar Shure SM58 sounds like through a Grace 101.)The Grace 101 gives you exceptionally clear, uncolored sound.  In some recording situations, you want colored sound, but when you want your recorded source to be as true as possible to what the human ear hears, the Grace preamp can't be beat.

"The A-grade of Taiyo Yuden CD-Rs is exclusively what I use at my studio due to their proven reliability.  Since I started using them a couple years ago, I've literally not had one single coaster.  That's an impressive statistic for any CD-R!  None of the typical CD-R brands sold in stores (HP, Memorex, Verbatim, etc.) can compete with A-grade Taiyo Yuden.The overprint is actually a handsome, lightly-textured, glossy, steel-blue coating that adds a pleasing aesthetic to the disc.  You can write on it or label it without any problems.Although this review is for the product itself, hence the five stars, I do want to alert you that the careless packaging might leave you a few CD-Rs short.  Mine were shipped in a cello/shrinkwrap-like covering that had busted open on the bottom, and the CD-Rs were beginning to slide out into the mailer.  The CD-R on the very bottom was visibly damaged so I simply threw it out.  A couple others on the bottom look iffy -- we'll just have to wait and see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Y97OTH0RYUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AB8ZE0#wasThisHelpful","R24Y97OTH0RYUR","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past couple years, I've worn Barricade Team 2's and Barricade 7's.  From my experience, I knew that Adidas made Barricades on the small side, so I always ordered a full size larger and got a perfect fit.  (Please note that a ""perfect fit"" for tennis is a shoe that is a touch roomy to help avoid ""turf toe"" and other problems.) So this year, I ordered Barricade 8's one full size larger as usual, but now the 8's are actually too large, especially in the heel area.The shoes' durability and grip is right in line with previous versions of Barricades, and I give them kudos for being a little bit lighter as well (the 7's were heavy.)  But if you're going to order these shoes, do not order them a full size larger as I've always suggested for Barricades in the past.  Order the 8's a half-size larger at most.  Better yet, try them on at a local sporting goods store first, if you have that opportunity.  There's nothing more aggravating than buying shoes online from a manufacturer that tinkers with sizing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20M9S3G7WUJ68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H966444#wasThisHelpful","R20M9S3G7WUJ68","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Harmony-M that I ordered arrived in the mail, I set it up in my home studio to try it out and hear how it sounds.As far as quality goes, the harmony voices and effects are excellent. I also like the flexibility of being able to save your own presets.  It has a rugged chassis and seems to be well-built.But I found two negative issues that have me returning the unit and looking for something better.The first issue is that the volume of the third harmony voice is too low in volume.  The second harmony voice completely overpowers it.  In fact, if I set the third harmony higher in pitch than the second harmony, I literally can't hear the third harmony (and I am a veteran studio engineer by trade.)  Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the volume of the individual harmony voices relative to each other.The other negative issue I discovered is that the unit's sensitivity is automatically set all the way open.  I kept hearing this annoying swirling/swishing noise coming through, and it turned out to be the Harmony-M trying to generate harmony voices from the faint hum of my furnace on the other side of the wall.  There's no reason for a harmony voice generator to be THAT sensitive.I suppose it's possible the Harmony-M I received may have been defective, but regardless, I'm going to have to send it back.  It would make a great second harmony generator for studio use, but it's definitely not going to work for my live applications.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ERG7FEWA72F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7F7F4#wasThisHelpful","R11ERG7FEWA72F","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes with adapters like these, after you insert your 1/4"" speaker cable, you then have to gingerly back it out a fraction of an inch at a time until you get a connection -- a rather unstable connection.  Fortunately, that's not the case with these Hosa speaker adapters.  My 1/4"" speaker cables plug in all the way and give me solid, reliable connections.  Hosa is not exactly known as being the Cadillac of cable manufacturers, but this is one product of theirs that seems to be as well-built as any speaker adapter could be.

"Some people show up to the courts ready to play with nothing but a racquet in one hand and a water bottle in the other.  That is definitely not me!  Besides having a primary racquet and a spare, I bring two large water bottles, two Tennis Saver ball storage cylinders, a couple cans of new balls, two mobile phones, keys & wallet, three sets of sports goggles, lens cleaner, sun screen, a towel, headbands and wristbands, mosquito repellent, band-aids.... well, you get the picture.In past years, I've always used a duffel bag to tote all my gear.  It's worked okay, but a fully-loaded duffel bag is awkward and cumbersome to carry around, plus it really digs into and wears down your shoulder on the walk from the parking lot to the courts.  And there's no practical way to carry a racquet in a duffel bag.  I've always wanted a backpack for hands-free, easier toting of my tennis racquets and gear, but it had to be one that was not only large enough, but also have extra pockets to give me some ability to organize my gear.This Wilson backpack fits the bill.  It's large enough to carry everything you could possibly need to take to the tennis courts, and it has many pockets for organizing.  The backpack even has a thoughtful divider that separates the top-accessible main compartment from a bottom-accessible clothing/shoe compartment.There are two downsides to the backpack:1. Only one of the four side pockets (the one that was designed to carry a water bottle) is the only pocket large enough to carry anything of significance, because the inside wall of the pocket extends into the interior of the backpack.  The other three pockets are little more than just shallow exterior pouches, and can't hold much more than a slim mobile phone.  Because gear sitting in the bottom of the backpack naturally pushes outward against the interior lining, it would have been more practical for Wilson to give the added depth to the upper pockets instead of a bottom pocket.2. A significant portion of the silver finish on my black/silver backpack has mysteriously faded after only a few months of tennis.  I don't know what may have caused that to happen.  I tried rubbing the silver off, but it doesn't rub off, so I'm left to believe that the silver finish fades in sunlight.In summary, though this is not the most practically-designed backpack, it does the job.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who lugs a lot of gear to the tennis courts.  It's large enough and versatile enough for just about anything you could think of bringing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IWMG5YJXPIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZDNBK4#wasThisHelpful","R16IWMG5YJXPIS","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Protege's driver's side seat belt receptacle had been problematic for years, and one day it finally fell apart.  I tried to rebuild it, but some of the plastic was too worn, so I had to replace it with a new one.Although you're supposed to take out the front seat to replace the seat belt receptacle, my Protege is no longer in the best cosmetic shape, so I installed it (albeit a little more ""destructively"") with the seat in place.  To do that, I notched out the top of the plastic guard that covers the bolt, and then removed the bolt with a plain ol' wrench.The installation went fine, and the seat belt receptacle is working good as new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EH127UOY0R93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6R5VQW#wasThisHelpful","R2EH127UOY0R93","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the wimpy, stock horn in my compact hatchback stopped working, I decided to replace it with something a little more ballsy. The Superior Bass Horn by PIAA is a good horn, and definitely an upgrade to what I had, but it's nothing to write home about. There's really nothing ""superior"" or ""bassy"" about it. It's a typical car horn, but just a little lower in pitch. It reminds me of some of the cars I owned back in the 1980's.Realistically, I'd value the product at around $30-$35. But, since there doesn't seem to be any competition in the 300-400Hz car horn marketplace, PIAA can charge whatever they want.In summary, if your main concern is apparent loudness, almost any universal, aftermarket replacement horn will work just as well as this one.

"I bought this Mobitron stand because I have a 12.1"" Asus Eee Slate B121 tablet PC, and just about every tablet holder on the market is designed for smaller tablets, like iPads.The first thing I noticed is the heavy weight of the product. When I saw the big locking teeth on the solid metal joints, it gave me peace of mind that I didn't spend over a hundred dollars on something cheap.  This is a durable product.The installation of the stand went rather smoothly.  At first, I installed it using the included extender plate that connects the stand's mounting lug to the seat bolt, but noticed a fair amount of wiggle, in fact, a little more than what I would consider acceptable for a $100+ stand.  It seemed that the use of the extender plate might have been the cause, so I took the plate off and attached the hollow mounting lug directly onto the seat rail via the seat bolt, which is the number one installation option they suggest.  Voila!  That cut down the wiggling so much, it's literally not even an issue anymore.  (I would highly recommend that if you were thinking about buying a support arm brace, BEFORE YOU DO, first check to see if you can attach the stand's mounting lug directly to the seat bolt without the use of the extender plate.  That alone may reduce the wiggling by more than 50%.)The cradle was very accommodating.  With all the height, width, and depth adjustments it has, I knew I'd have no problem getting it to hold my large tablet securely, which it does very well.  I did, however, have to make one modification to one of the four adjustable stops: the upper left corner of my tablet is where the power supply plugs in and where the volume controls are.  The stop in that corner blocked those things, so I used a bench vise to flatten out the 90 angle and make a new 90 degree angle about an inch further down.  Problem solved.The stand mounted to my car just fine, and my tablet mounted to the cradle just fine, but I ran into a problem adjusting my tablet for the best viewing angle.  Even though the Mobitron has a LOT of positioning and tilt adjustment flexibility, the cradle cannot be rotated (picture grabbing the cradle with both hands and trying to turn it like a steering wheel) and it really needs this capability.  The more I adjust my tablet into position for an optimum viewing angle, the more the screen tilts to the left, and there is no way to correct for that.A slip of paper inside the box offered me a free USB LED light if I left a five-star review, but my integrity won't allow me to leave a five-star review for a product that is very good, but not perfect.  It's an excellent product in almost every way, but I seriously did consider returning it due to not being able to rotate the cradle.  I am able to adjust my tablet to an angle that is acceptable, but to put it where I really want it would leave it more slanted to the left than a keynote speaker at an Obamacare rally.  If the cradle had a rotation adjustment, I'd easily give this product a full five stars.By the way, since the product description does not specifically say, I would like to point out that this stand DOES have a quick-release lever.  You can remove it from your car in seconds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7NEFUL4GLME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q287M6#wasThisHelpful","RA7NEFUL4GLME","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is now the fourth cat-sitting DVD I've purchased.  Overall, this video is very well done.  Both the videography and resolution are excellent.  The scenes change a little more quickly than in other cat sitting DVDs, which your cats may enjoy.The product description states it was shot in ""full HD"" which may be true, but there's something funky about the videography, noticeable during action scenes, that leads me to believe either they didn't use a very expensive camera, or the video was downgraded during the editing or mastering processes.  But that's a minor detail that will not be an issue with your cats.  My only real complaint is about the dubbed background sounds -- as with the Cat Sitter DVD, they don't fit with the video.  Seeing birds frolicking in a birdbath without hearing water splashing is annoying.  And if you own their original Cat Sitter DVD, that horribly incessant, infamous bird chirping is back.  Fortunately, they didn't use it nearly as much in this video.In summary, this is one of the better cat sitting videos, and my cat (I have two, but only one responds to videos) is absolutely enthralled by it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXP0SWY9HZE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYHJ6UI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXP0SWY9HZE8","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this were a video for human entertainment, I'd give it no more than two stars. The footage looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder set to ""Auto-Adjust."" The coloration is dull, the lighting is washed out, and the original resolution seems to be 480. It's about as ""hi-def"" as the video of your middle school band concert from 1985. The ""mastered in hi-def"" description can be misleading, because you can start with 480 resolution video and master it in 1080 or even 1920, but it's still going to look like 480.But the video isn't for me. It's for my cats. Only one of my cats responds to video, and he does respond to this one... especially the bird segments which he loves. He doesn't care for the fish or anything that is too large because the camera zoomed in too far, though. If he could rate this video, I think he'd give it three stars.One thing they did right, though, is that they didn't dub over the entire DVD with canned sounds, like annoying bird chirps. In segments where they showed birds and squirrels feeding, you can hear the action as it takes place. I don't know why the other cat sitting DVDs don't do that.Summary: It will entertain your cats, but there are better alternatives out there.A side note about cat-sitting DVDs: Some people will leave a one-star review for a cat-sitting video because their cat ignores the video. The fact is that some cats are wired to respond to videos, and others are not. If your cat responds to one cat-sitting video, he'll respond to all cat-sitting videos. Likewise, if your cat totally ignores a cat-sitting video, he'll ignore them all. If your cat ignores a video, please don't punish the video manufacturer by leaving a one-star review. It's not a fault of the product.

"If you don't care for longer reviews, I've summed everything up in this first paragraph:I work with many high-end software programs, such as Steinberg Cubase and Adobe Photoshop, and I can say without a doubt that MS Street & Trips is the most needlessly counter-intuitive software program I've ever used.  It's not hard to use -- rather it just doesn't function the way anyone would want or expect a GPS software program to function.  If you use it every day, you can get used to the backwards interface, but for someone like me who uses the software every now and then, it's so frustrating it would drive a person mad.The details:I want to point out right away that I don't use GPS for planning long trips with rest stops, calculating mileage, points of interest, etc. My only purpose for MS Streets & Trips is to simply know where I am at all times, and to occasionally plan routes to gigs and back since I am a weekend warrior musician. Once you tell the software to start tracking, it does a great job of it. (I use a GlobalSat BU-353 receiver.) You always know where you are. The additional map configurations (political, terrain, and especially nighttime) are very handy, the speedometer is dead-on accurate, and installation onto my ASUS tablet running Win 7 Pro was a breeze.But that's pretty much where the accolades end.The automatic route planner has major issues. It can choose some pretty weird paths.  If the software chooses a funky route and you want to change it, you can't fix it just by moving or dragging it. (Why, that would make too much sense!) Instead, you have to set up ""stops"" so that the software follows along the path of the stops. Editing your route this way is a pain in the butt, because the software can be stubborn and want to send you on unnecessary 'round-the-block goose chases.  (And to set up stops, you have to exit the mode that you had to enable for the software to plan a route in the first place.  What???)  So, anytime you use this program to create a route, even though it will get you from A to B, plan on spending time going over the entire route and manually inserting stops to correct all of the route's ""mistakes"". Otherwise you'll be listening to an incessant, mechanical voice blaring ""Off route!"".The maps themselves are not great, but they're acceptable. There's no font smoothing to speak of, which is sorely needed, but at least you can enlarge the text for easier reading. Microsoft seems to have adopted Google's senseless ""white streets on an off-white background"" color scheme, but the product offers optional maps: terrain, political, and nighttime map. In my opinion, the terrain map is perfect for daytime driving, and the nighttime map is great for night driving.The construction update information seems useless. MS Streets and Trips kept insisting on connecting me to the freeway via a ramp that had been closed for construction for almost a year.But it's the counter-intuitiveness of this software that is most annoying. For example, I entered a destination and wanted the software to tell me how to get there, but the ""Plan Route"" button was disabled. I had to exit the route planning sidebar and call up another sidebar which had a button for creating a route from my current location, or ""press F3"". And when the route was created, I was unable to move the map around to preview the route it gave me! And when I wanted to fix the routes mistakes by setting up stops, I had to exit the mode the software used to plan the route in the first place.  Arrrrgh! This is one annoying program!In summary, this program does a great job of tracking your whereabouts, and it's loaded with features. The map quality could be improved, but it's acceptable. Unfortunately, MS Streets and Trips' reliability as a route planner is questionable, and its interface is outdated and unintuitive. This product is years overdue for a complete redesign from the ground up.  I get the feeling Microsoft made a decision years ago that it was not going to bother competing with Garmin or any other GPS services, so their investment of resources into this program was minimal at best, and it shows.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T39E9ZKFQ9HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YLQLHW#wasThisHelpful","R3T39E9ZKFQ9HR","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some people say the poles are a bit wobbly.  I've noticed the same problem.  On a windy day, I wouldn't be surprised to see my speakers swaying a bit.  It's my experience, though, that the looseness is a universal trait of almost all subwoofer pole mounts.  Everyone I know who uses subwoofer mounts puts tape on their speaker poles for tightness.  If these speaker poles were any wider, or if subwoofer mounts were any smaller, any direct heat source (the sun, stage lighting, propane stage heater, etc.) could expand the metal of the poles and make them impossible to remove.The first thing I noticed is that one of these poles is just as heavy, if not heavier, than an entire Ultimate Support tripod speaker stand.  I was hoping to save weight, but it's actually no big deal, because the trade-off is that these poles are obviously constructed very well.In fact here's proof of just how well they are constructed:A couple weekends ago, right before my gig was about to start, I looked over to one of my mains (original JBL EON 15's) and saw that it was leaning forward 45 degrees.  The 40-pound EON, a front-heavy speaker by design, had tipped forward, literally ripping the pole mount almost all the way out of the top of the subwoofer cabinet.  The On Stage speaker pole, however, didn't bend the tiniest bit.  It held the speaker firmly... at 45 degrees!  (It turns out that the pole mount was cheaply secured to the subwoofer cabinet with 3/8"" wood screws.  I've since replaced the screws with nuts and bolts.)These are excellent-quality speaker poles and I fully expect them to last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUQV6GW1QKT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXNBGSI#wasThisHelpful","R3LUQV6GW1QKT4","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I play 150+ gigs a year, weight and portability have always been major factors in determining what stage gear I purchase. I play multiple instruments, but as a bassist, I've been using Walter Woods amps over the years. I happened to stumble upon this bass amp, and was intrigued by the specifications. I was worried that using Walter Woods over the years may have spoiled me and that nothing smaller and lighter could compare, but decided to give the MB200 a try.Wow! What a great amp! I plugged my bass guitar into it to try it out, and the amp really boomed. It's very impressive for something that is literally the size and weight of a few sticks of butter. The tone controls sound great, and the knobs even have a pleasing, upscale feeling of resistance to them.The contour switch does exactly what I hoped it would: it mellows out the ""boxy"" midrange and boosts the bass and treble, much like running everything through a smiley-faced graphic EQ. When you engage the contour switch, you can then continue to use the EQ controls for additional tonal adjustment.An interesting thing to note is that the MB200 is not just limited to bass. I was recently hired to play keys on a gig, and brought this amp along just to see how it would fare as a keyboard amp. I predicted it would probably sound frequency-deficient or gritty on the higher frequencies like my Walter Woods bass amps, but it didn't at all. It sounded great! Out of curiosity, I contacted GK to ask them about the frequency response of the amp, since the documentation only gives the frequencies of the EQ controls. Their answer was 20Hz-20kHz. Interesting! So I did a side-by-side comparison with a PA amplifier and found that if you leave the contour off and set the treble and bass EQ knobs to approximately nine o' clock, you get nice, flat, full-range amplification. Bass... keyboard... PA... the MB200 works great on everything. I ended up buying four of these amps.Drawbacks: I contacted GK to ask if they make rack ears for their MB200 bass amplifiers, and they do not, so I ended up making my own out of sheet metal. GK claims this amp is only intended to be carried around in gig bags, but I think they're selling their product short. An amp this good is worth rack ears, because one way or another, a lot of these amps are going to end up in musicians' racks for the sake of convenience. I'm certain of it. I also would have preferred to see a 1/4"" speaker output, but a speakon connector is nothing much to complain about.Summary: Walter Woods pioneered ultra-light, portable bass amplification back in the 70's, and now the other major manufacturers are catching on like never before. I think the MB200 is a solid performer and a testament to the evolution of compact amps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAPWIFNWQRTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BLPCA8#wasThisHelpful","R1DAPWIFNWQRTZ","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the tennis court, I play hard. On the hottest days I'll sweat out six to seven pounds. I also wear prescription glasses/sports goggles. The insides of my lenses can fog up terribly, especially on cool nights. What I've found is that with Jaws Quick Spit, instead of water vapor condensing into microscopic droplets (fog) as normal, it builds up by coalescing into a single clear, runny layer of condensation. Basically it's trading one problem for another. Instead of playing tennis in a cloud bank, I'm playing tennis underwater. Either way, the goggles are rendered completely useless.This product does work, but only to a limited degree.  I would not recommend it for anyone who plays competitive sports at a high aerobic intensity level (i.e. sweats a lot and produces a lot of heat).","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG4EPB0IVIGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012Q2S4W#wasThisHelpful","R2CG4EPB0IVIGJ","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this cabinet for the first time yesterday, on a gig at a rather large, historic banquet hall. I was skeptical at first, but this little beast filled the hall with bass. I could have pushed it louder, but didn't need to since the hall is rather echoey. I normally use a 15"" cabinet for this venue, but from now on I'm taking the Ashdown MI-10 because it literally sounded no smaller than the 15"".I bought this cabinet to replace my Ampeg PB110H Portabass 10"" cabinet which quit working earlier this year. The Ashdown cabinet is a big improvement over the Ampeg. It sounds larger and louder, again very similar to my 15"" cabinet.The only reason for four stars instead of five is for the corner-mounted carrying handle, which makes toting and setting the cabinet down needlessly awkward. A couple times I inadvertently set the cabinet down on its front instead of its bottom.  A balanced, top-mounted handle would have been preferred.  But as far as sound is concerned... five stars.UPDATE August 2014: The more I use this cabinet, the more I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7VZY4YONFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2NZH7O#wasThisHelpful","RT7VZY4YONFP","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally, I wrote a two-star review for this amp, because when I did a side-by-side subwoofer listening test between the iNuke 6000 (1,500w/side into 8 ohms) and my Alesis Matica 900 (270w/side into 8 ohms) I heard no difference in volume.  Both amps clipped at the same apparent loudness.  I was disappointed.But the disappointment didn't last very long...The other day, I used the iNuke 6000 as a subwoofer amp at an Oktoberfest gig, and it sounded like an entirely different amp than what I had tested against the Matica.  It was loud.  Really loud.  It pushed my 21"" downward-firing subs like they've never been pushed before.  The kick drum was producing a solid, deep ""whump!"" while only the first signal indicator light on the iNuke was lighting up.  I didn't have my Matica along to do a comparison, but I KNOW my Matica could not have reached that volume.  At half that volume, my Matica's clip light would have been sputtering like a fluorescent hospital light in a low-budget horror movie.So why did I get all that volume with the iNuke on the gig and no difference in volume when comparing it with the Matica amp at home? I honestly have no idea.  I'm guessing there might have been a difference in line voltage between my house the Oktoberfest venue, and maybe Class D amplification requires clean voltage?  I just don't know.  All I can tell you is that I was impressed with how well the iNuke worked on the gig.  My subwoofers filled the tent much better than I had expected.  I am not a fan of Behringer in general, but I believe in giving credit where it is due, and Behringer really came through on this amp.Originally I was going to dump my iNuke after testing it against the Matica, but after hearing how it performed on the Oktoberfest gig, I've decided to keep it.  I'm going to try it next year to see how it performs at various other venues.  Even if it doesn't give me full volume in all venues, I'll still keep the iNuke as a spare amp, especially because it's literally one-fourth the weight of my back-breaking Matica.In conclusion, the iNuke 6000 is definitely worth looking into.  Based on my experience so far, I think it's an excellent deal at $400.  So why four stars instead of five?  Because my experiment has shown that it may not give me 100% volume in all venues for some inexplicable reason, and because it's literally the ugliest amplifier I've ever seen.  (Screw the warranty, I'm painting mine black!)UPDATE 2014: I've used the iNuke 6000 at a couple of venues this summer, and it's been consistently and reliably cranking out at full volume.  Therefore I've changed my review from four stars to five.  This amp is definitely a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QS9D72079NM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EHINFI#wasThisHelpful","R2QS9D72079NM1","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only thing I don't like about this tuner is that it could use a few more independent buttons rather than rely on partially-labeled multi-function buttons.  For example, to start and stop the metronome, you have to press the button labeled ""Input Select"".  To set the BPM rate, you have to press and hold the Sound/Metronome button for two seconds.  I'm sorry, but one should not have to consult an owners manual to operate a tuner!  Since I don't have a lot of tolerance for pro audio product designs which needlessly hinder workflow, I cannot give this rack tuner five stars.  Despite the design drawback, it does the job.  It tunes instruments well and has some handy, flexible options for tuning, such as a reference tone generator and a built-in mic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XM7V7DWDY5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KUBOBE#wasThisHelpful","R39XM7V7DWDY5Z","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed is that one of these poles is just as heavy, if not heavier, than an entire Ultimate Support tripod speaker stand.  I was hoping to save weight, but it's actually no big deal, because the trade-off is that these poles are obviously constructed very well.  In fact here's proof of just how well they are constructed:A couple weekends ago, right before my gig was about to start, I looked over to one of my mains (original JBL EON 15's) and saw that it was leaning forward 45 degrees.  The 40-pound EON, a front-heavy speaker by design, had tipped forward, literally ripping the pole mount almost all the way out of the top of the subwoofer cabinet.  The On Stage speaker pole, however, didn't bend the tiniest bit.  (It turns out that the pole mount was cheaply secured to the subwoofer cabinet with 3/8"" wood screws.  I've since replaced the screws with nuts and bolts.)Some people said the poles are a bit wobbly.  I noticed the same problem.  On a windy day, I wouldn't be surprised to see my speakers swaying a bit.  Applying some tape to the poles seems to tighten everything up.  However, I believe that the wobbliness is not due to a shortcoming in the pole design, but rather it's a universal trait of most subwoofer pole mounts.In summary, these are excellent-quality speaker poles and I fully expect them to last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU9MME2EPEG09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M8GBT2#wasThisHelpful","RU9MME2EPEG09","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many of the jobs I play as a musician are with a two-piece or three-piece band.  The main reason I bought this mixer (I bought two, actually, in case one breaks) is because I needed a very compact mixer to mount into a custom-built, half-rack PA system, yet the mixer could not skimp on features.I needed six channels, and all six needed to have three-band EQ and a monitor send.  Too many compact mixers today focus on features for two or four channels, and pretty much disregard the rest of the inputs.  And some mixers use volume faders instead of knobs, which requires making the mixer needlessly larger.  The Alesis MultiMix is uniquely compact because of how it uses every square inch of space.I wouldn't call the effects top-grade, but in a live setting they do the job just fine.I have used this mixer on a weekly basis for about seven or eight years now, and it's still working great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKC2FD3G96TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00076SCXE#wasThisHelpful","R1MKC2FD3G96TL","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you can't afford a high-end orchestra VST library, and you can get this one for around $100 or less, go for it.  Like most less-expensive VST instrument libraries, you get what you pay for, which usually means a balance of good and bad.  But Miroslav Philharmonik Orchestra has more good than bad, which means you'll be able to go quite far with its sounds.The graphical user interface is simple and intuitive, yet allows you to get in-depth where needed.  My only complaint about the interface is that it must have been designed for antiquated 800x600 monitors, because the miniscule controls and the tiny arrows used to expand and collapse the sounds menu are very hard to see on high-resolution monitors.  I hope IK Multimedia will consider updating their interface for monitors built in this century.Some of the sounds, with their cringe-worthy sample split points, sound like they were ripped from 25-year-old sound modules.  But overall, this product sounds very nice and even possesses some real gems.  One of my favorites is Orchestra Performance 6 under Dynamic Performance Elements.  The ensemble libraries, in particular, are absolute ear candy.  The string ensembles are incredibly lush, just like you'd expect to hear in a film score, and have a definite edge over the strings in the Garritan libraries.The staccato patches have completely different sounds than the other patch libraries, which is great for authenticity, except some of the staccato sounds are so beautiful, THEY should be offered in the full range of patches and articulations.  The staccato tuba, for example, is the very best sampled tuba sound I have ever worked with.  If only I could sustain THAT sound!  The same goes for the other brass.  They attack with a crisp, brassy BLAT! but they are staccato-only sounds which means, of course, they can't be sustained. If only!  But then I must remind myself that this is an orchestra, not a concert band.  This product's sound libraries definitely make no mistake about that.Negative issues to point out: The strings have annoying release noises that are most noticeable when moving from chord to chord.  It's not all that noticeable when you fully release chords before playing new ones -- it's only when you move legato between chords that they stand out, almost like singers catching quick breaths.  It drives my ears nuts.  It will severely limit how and where I can use the string patches on my recordings.  Also, there is a robotic-sounding glitch with some notes in the Female Choir Ah Stch patch that somehow made it past quality control.  A few other sustained patches have annoyingly audible sample loop points.  Then again, this is a rather inexpensive product, so flaws such as these are not all that unexpected.I'm satisfied with my purchase of the Miroslav Philharmonik Orchestra, especially since I got it as part of sweet deal on a bundle at a reduced price.  Would I pay $200 for it?  I personally would not unless I needed to score a B-movie quickly on a limited budget.  My recommendation would be to buy this product at a lower price and enjoy the treasures it has, and then save up more money and go for a higher-end, glitch-free product for when you're recording music for discerning listeners.  Either way, you will certainly find plenty of uses for this product in your composing and recording.  Miroslav Philharmonik probably won't cover 100% of the bases to your liking, but if you can get it for a hundred bucks or get it in a bundle, its usefulness will make a very welcome addition to your VSTi arsenal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VW3YENSUHJH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BWI79I#wasThisHelpful","R3VW3YENSUHJH9","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And patience it takes, because this is not a very intuitive program. You'll be playing a guitar sound on your keyboard, and suddenly every note changes to a muted sound.  Well, you just accidentally hit one of the non-momentary key switches, and it can take a while to figure out how to get back to where you were.  Because of the way Electri6ity works, you need skills as a both musician and as a MIDI composer to get the most out of it.I needed to replicate the approximate sound of AC/DC's ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" and used a Strat run through the included effects.  I got the sound I needed, but it wasn't easy because of the way Electri6ity uses velocities to morph palm mutes into sustains.  I had to go into some custom mode and click something (I don't even know what it was) just to be able to play sustained notes at a lower volume.  And then I still couldn't help from hitting key switches and getting utterly lost in the maze of articulations.  Like I said, this is not the most intuitive or user-friendly program.  The graphical user interface seems more convoluted than it needs to be, and could use some redesigning to appeal more toward musicians rather than VSTi engineers.The libraries of sounds, noises, and articulations are extensive. Electri6ity also gives you deep editing controls that allow you to adjust every possible parameter of playing style and sound.  Some of the controls are so obscure, I can't hear any difference when I adjust them, but perhaps a professional guitarist could.  Given all of this, the sky is the limit with what you can achieve.Electri6ity sounds great right out of the box, but to get the most out of this VSTi, you will want to study it like a college course, and you will want to be quite proficient at MIDI composing (sequencing, editing controller information, etc.)  So if you have the patience and are as much of a programming musician as a performing musician, this product will deliver stunning results.  (Although, for half the cost, you could hire a guitarist who could cut the tracks you need in a fraction of the time it would take you to get them with Electri6ity.)One sound I could not get from this VSTi, even after experimenting for a couple hours using Guitar Rig 5, were chunky, Metallica-like palm mutes.  All I could get were staccato mutes/notes without any sustain.  But I'm not a guitarist, so I can't say whether it was Electri6ity's capability or my knowledge that fell short.I rate the product at an average of four stars... three stars for not being as intuitive as it could be, and five stars for having the best sampled guitars you'll ever find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TC4X3QEFLHEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MBV5EY#wasThisHelpful","R3TC4X3QEFLHEG","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You would think every filter would be manufactured exactly the same, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  Sometimes I can put in a new filter and it will last for a few weeks, doing its job perfectly.  But other times I will put in a new filter, and within a day or two, water will be flowing over the top of it instead of through it.  The water doesn't get dirty or slimy, nor does the filter.

"I recently bought a Presonus Faderport, but had to return it because the recording punch-in mode didn't work with Cubase 7 64-bit.  Since having punching capability was vital to my recording process, I bit the bullet and bought the Steinberg CC121 to ensure I wouldn't run into similar incompatibility problems, even though the CC121 was more advanced of a controller than what I needed.  But then I started working with the CC121, and realized it was not too advanced at all.  In fact, it was exactly what I needed.To have instant rotary control over a channel strip's EQ section is a real boon to the mixing process in Cubase.  In the mixer window, as you turn the knobs, you'll see your adjustments represented graphically in real time across all four bands.  Very nice.  (Please note that in order for the EQ knobs to function on the CC121, don't bother installing the Tools from the enclosed CD-ROM. Download the latest Tools from Steinberg's website instead.)Nearly all of the functions of the CC121 work perfectly, including punching with a foot pedal, which was my main concern.  The only problem I encounter is that the fader can be fussy at times.  I'll select a track, and instead of the fader instantly controlling that track's volume, it offers resistance and must be ""worked loose"" for a couple seconds before it starts working properly.  The fader also feels rather flimsy.So what's the design flaw to which I alluded in the subject?  You can probably figure it out for yourself just by looking at the photo.  The center of the CC121 is painted black.  It may look cool from a design perspective, but it makes the EQ knobs and transport buttons nearly impossible to see at arm's length under typical control room lighting conditions.  The channel strip buttons on the left (mute, solo, effects, etc) are easy to see, but the transport controls are dark buttons with black icons on a black background.  Who's the genius that came up with that design?  Louis Braille?  Of the eight transport buttons, only three of them have backlighting, and are lit only when in use.  The other five buttons remain dark.  C'mon Steinberg, what were you thinking?!?  This blunder is such a senseless hindrance to workflow, I cannot rate the CC121 five stars until Steinberg redesigns it with some common sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RVQU5YI142HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EJD882#wasThisHelpful","R3RVQU5YI142HG","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this product mainly because I need a way to do punch-ins with a foot switch.  As it turns out, when you're working with Cubase 7 64-bit, everything on the Faderport seems to work EXCEPT for the punch-in capability.The documentation that came with the Faderport was outdated by several years.  I installed the Faderport per the directions, but it didn't work.  I Googled my problem to find out from another Faderport user that I had to use the Faderport in Mackie HUI mode.  I did get it working after a few more installation hiccups, and the features that worked did work well, but again, no punching capability.I contacted Presonus support, and they said to make sure I had the right type of pedal.  I checked, and even tried two different pedal types, and neither worked.  I replied with a request to let me know whether or not the punch-in feature will work with my software, because if it didn't, I'd have to buy another brand of DAW controller, and that the window to return the Faderport was closing soon.Presonus replied a few days later and said they didn't know if the punching worked in Mackie HUI mode, would check into it, and get back to me.  For crying out loud, how can they not already know this?  They manufacture a product to work with the world's leading software recording programs, but don't test it with those programs to identify and publish specific incompatibilities?  Who do they think they are... Microsoft?I could not afford the time to wait for their reply as I have recording sessions coming up, so I returned the Faderport and bought a Steinberg CC121.  I will still rate the product at three stars, however, because tech support was very understanding, and also because my Faderport problems were apparently specific to my recording software.I also want to add that Presonus got it right when it came to the design of the product, using white, backlit buttons with black icons.  The Steinberg CC121's transport buttons are dark with black icons on a black background, and only three of the eight buttons light up.  They are nearly impossible to see under typical control room lighting conditions.  So kudos to Presonus for getting it right.If you're thinking about buying this product, BEFORE YOU DO, I strongly suggest you go to Presonus' website.  Select Products > Faderport > Tech Specs, and check to see if your recording software is approved to work with the Faderport.  If it is and you buy the Faderport, set aside the installation documentation that comes with it (or donate it to the Smithsonian) and instead go to Support > Knowledge Base > Faderport > and select the ""How do set up my Faderport in..."" for your particular recording software.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BNPWFZU7XFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H28LB6#wasThisHelpful","R9BNPWFZU7XFL","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most appropriate word I can think of to describe RealGuitar V3 is ""fun"" because it blow you away as you start playing it for the first time, and you don't have to be a Jeff Abbott.  Unlike some VST instruments that practically require a college course to learn, RealGuitar is intuitive enough that a musician can tinker with it for a while and figure most of it out.  MusicLab has made it easy to get an authentic acoustic guitar from a keyboard controller, and that's what a musician like me (who prefers performing over programming) needs.Play a chord on your keyboard, and RealGuitar not only strums the chord, but knows how a guitarist would finger the chord on the fret board, and automatically plays it that way.  You can set RealGuitar so that as you play higher on the keyboard, the ""guitarist"" follows by playing higher on the fretboard.  RealGuitar V3 also knows where to automatically add in fret noise and string squeaks.  In my opinion, RealGuitar V3 has found a nearly perfect marriage of authenticity of sound and ease of playability.RealGuitar V3 is not a library of instruments where you can choose from a particular Martin or Taylor.  You get ONE acoustic guitar, your choice of steel or nylon strings, and your choice of fingered or picked.  You also get ONE acoustic twelve-string guitar.  That's it.  So don't buy this product if you're looking for a specific guitar model.  I have no idea what acoustic guitars were sampled for RealGuitar V3, but the samples are beautiful and can be used universally across many styles of music.  You can use RealGuitar V3 for everything from Funk to Rock, but I'll be using it mainly for Country and, believe it or not, Oberkrainer.RealGuitar V3 comes loaded to the rafters with a huge library of rhythm pattern presets for all types of music.  The pattern library doesn't cover everything, but it comes close.  Unfortunately, the one type of pattern I need most, it doesn't have, which is a slow, very basic, classic country waltz.RealGuitar V3 allows you to flexibility with many parameters, such as noises, strum timing, slides, equalization, etc. and there are many articulations available that you can assign to controllers or key switches.  You can choose if you want to play single notes or chords, and there are other playing modes that I have not yet needed to use.No VST can compare to having a professional guitar player in your studio, but when it comes to an acoustic guitar, this product is absolutely phenomenal.  There is no comparison between using this product and trying to play an acoustic guitar out of a standalone sound module.  Depending on how you use it, everyone will believe your tracks were recorded with a real acoustic guitar (except, of course, for the professional guitar players who are losing more and more studio gigs!)RealGuitar V3 is awesome, but there are two things I'd like to point out:  It's a two-hundred-dollar ""one size fits all"" VST instrument, and may not have enough tonal variation where you wish you had it.  I'd like to see MusicLab broaden RealGuitar's palette by adding two or three different guitar makes and models, and maybe two different mic distances, even though it would mean increasing the price tag.  Also, I feel as though the softest velocity sample of the guitars is still a bit too loud.  You know that little shimmer of sound you get when the string is lightly grazed?  You won't find it here, and that will limit how intimate you can make your guitar tracks.Vir2 just came out with a new acoustic guitar VST instrument called Acou6tics.  If you need the cat's meow of sonic dimension that RealGuitar can't give you, Acou6tics would probably be the route to go (although at twice the cost.)  But RealGuitar V3 can hold its own as a virtual instrument.  I own Vir2's Electri6ity software, and it is incredible, but it's also just plain too complex and convoluted to fully enjoy.  For that reason, I'm sticking with MusicLab for my acoustic guitar tracks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NT701WY6QZ4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3XPZ5E#wasThisHelpful","R1NT701WY6QZ4M","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They are stylish and comfortable to wear, but have serious design flaws.The first and most obvious flaw is that there is no ventilation. None. Nada. As a result, these glasses can fog up very, very badly.  I play tennis, and on a cool night, even after applying an expensive anti-fog treatment, condensation can build up every five to ten minutes of playing, rendering my prescription Rec-Specs completely useless.  I paid about $400 for my prescription Rec-Specs, but some nights they fog up so badly I simply have to play without them.The next design flaw is that the glasses fit so closely your eyes, your eyelashes can make contact with the lenses, smudging any condensation on them.The final design flaw is that the frames block too much peripheral vision.  (Shouldn't eyewear designed for playing sports, you know, NOT hinder vision?)If Liberty simply offered an alternative nose bridge piece with a deeper offset, I think that would solve most of these problems.  I wrote to them last year and inquired about it, but they never bothered to reply.I would not recommend Rec-Specs to anyone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8IRCZ2W32LBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M7BY3E#wasThisHelpful","R8IRCZ2W32LBQ","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, let me explain what this device does NOT do.  It does not keep a tennis ball as fully pressurized as a brand new ball, nor does it restore lost pressure to an older ball.  The only thing this device does, and does well, is slow the rate at which pressure escapes from the tennis ball, thereby extending the ball's playable life.League players will still want to use new cans of balls since nothing plays like a new ball, but avid recreational players may be able to keep balls in playable condition for up to two or three additional weeks when storing them in the Saver between matches.  For this reason, it's a good idea to use extra-duty balls for hard court play, because balls stored in the saver can literally lose too much felt before losing too much pressure.As both a league and recreational player, I use new balls for league play, and then store them in the Saver to use recreationally between league matches.  I play tennis four to five days a week from Spring to Fall, and estimate that the Tennis Ball Saver saves me at least forty dollars a year in tennis balls.  I like the product so much, I recently bought a second one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OD9F2RR44J42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FJ7CFC#wasThisHelpful","R3OD9F2RR44J42","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like most about this mirror is its rock-solid stability, even in high winds and over bumps.  Month after month, it stays put.  The mirror also doesn't experience any vibration problems which can hamper viewing.  Also on the plus side is the mirror's adjustability, which allows you to mount it in any position and still achieve the viewing angle you need.What I dislike about this mirror is that its small size and convex surface can be a safety compromise in street riding situations. Everything on the road appears to be so small.  When you glance at the mirror, moving cars are indistinguishable from parked cars, houses, mailboxes, yard signs, etc. A moving car can be one of many specks in the mirror one second, and passing you the next. To make this product safer for street riding, I literally bonded a flat mirror over the convex one.  Due to my bike's bar end grips, my mirror has to extend downward below the bars. Add that to the fact that I am over six feet tall, the mirror is quite far from my face. If you're shorter or have the luxury of being able to mount the mirror upright, that will be an advantage.Summary: This mirror is top quality, yet, I would like to see it offered in a slightly larger, less-convex version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140CKB4XTTCRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009R96YK#wasThisHelpful","R140CKB4XTTCRL","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've been wondering how such a highly-rated product like this can also have one-star reviews stating these earbuds have ""absolutely no bass whatsoever"" and sound ""horribly tinny"", I'd like to offer an explanation.These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like standard earbuds.  If that's how you wear them,  you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies.  It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound absolutely horrendous.Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm quite certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound great.  They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain -- arguably one of the best product bargains I've ever run across on Amazon.  Do they have a lot of bass?  They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ.  Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics.As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.2. These earbuds will amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  The incessant ""tick tick tick"" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to.In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, or for intense workouts due to the amplified heartbeat problem, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MO1407840EVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ELYQGG#wasThisHelpful","R1MO1407840EVJ","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The enclosed plastic pry bar literally broke within the first five seconds of using it; the iPod seam clamped back down and snipped off the edge of the tool.  Fortunately, I had a small flat-head screwdriver nearby, and that got the iPod open quite easily.  The other tools worked fine.  The battery works fine, too.  I cannot believe $3.53 WITH shipping revived my iPod, but it did, and that's why this product easily gets five stars.  I've literally never found a better value anywhere on Amazon.The kit came without instructions, so you'll need to refer to YouTube or another online source for step-by-step directions.  The YouTube videos make the task look easier than it actually is, although it's still not that difficult to do.  There are a few things to note when taking apart your 4th-generation iPod:1. The enclosed pry bar is worthless. Have a small, flat-head screwdriver handy.2. When I opened my iPod, I noticed that one edge of the battery was taped down to the inside of the iPod, so you may need a razor blade or X-Acto knife in order to remove your battery.3. The two halves of the iPod are connected by a thin headphone ribbon cable.  Be VERY, VERY, VERY careful not to pull it out of the headphone jack assembly.  I learned this the hard way.  If it does come out, you'll need a small needle-nose pliers (better yet, a surgical clamp) to insert the ribbon back into the tiny slot from where it came.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVSZHOJ4Z4AU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DSWQ94#wasThisHelpful","R3GVSZHOJ4Z4AU","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who rides almost exclusively at night on deserted bike paths and parkways, I decided to go with the brightest light on the market -- the NiteRider Pro 3000.For the past twenty years, I had been using my trusty four-cell halogen bike light.  For the longest time, that light was always as bright as any other incandescent, halogen, or 1st generation LED light out there.  Before I turned on the Pro 3000 for the first time, I turned on my halogen.  Then I turned on the Pro 3000, and stood there in disbelief while my jaw hit the floor.  The light from the Pro 3000 completely swallowed the light from my halogen a thousand times over.  There is absolutely no comparison to be made.  It's like shining a helicopter's search light at a candle.This led to the realization that I would have been completely satisfied going with a less-bright light.  In hindsight, I would have bought the 1500 instead of the 3000 to save money.  1,500 lumens is plenty bright for a bike light on the darkest of trails.  The extra 1,500 lumens the Pro 3000 has will make you go ""wow"", but they are of little practical use.There are two negatives that need to be addressed... one minor and one rather significant:The minor thing I wish NiteRider did was provide a better system of attaching the battery pack to the bike -- they rely on Velcro strapping.  Velcro is functional and will easily mount the battery pack to any size tubing, but it's not completely stable.  The battery pack will shift around on your ride.  Some sort of a clamping system would have been nice.The more significant problem with the light is that there is no beam cut-off horizon to prevent blinding oncoming traffic.  Having a uniform beam spread is a big plus when you're riding on deserted, wooded trails and need to see overhanging branches and moths before they whack you in the face, but on the road, it does nothing but blind oncoming traffic.  Even with the light at it's lowest power setting and pointed downward onto the road, oncoming cars WILL flash their brights at you.  I am surprised NiteRider never addressed this problem.  I modified my Pro 3000 by designing and installing a flip-down light dimming filter.  For the rest of you, expect to partially cover your light with your hand EVERY SINGLE TIME you pass an oncoming car, bicyclist, or pedestrian.  It's a major inconvenience, and for this reason alone, I cannot give the Pro 3000 five stars.If you want the brightest light available, you found it!  Just be sure that before you go for a night ride, you call your local airport to inform them that you are not a low-flying aircraft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMUWKLUMOLT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GTP3FW#wasThisHelpful","RYMUWKLUMOLT5","A1HWJ67HTSHUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HWJ67HTSHUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a tennis player who wears prescription Rec-Specs sport goggles.  Rec-Specs offer no ventilation, so fogging and condensation are often a problem.When the temperature is hot or when the air is dry, these wipes will help prevent general fogging.  But when the temperature drops into the 60's or 50's on a humid night, these wipes are useless.  Within minutes of playing tennis, my Rec-Specs will go from clear to foggy and dripping with condensation.  I partially blame the Rec-Specs for not having any ventilation, but I've run into the same, exact problem using these wipes on my regular prescription glasses on the tennis court.I give this product two stars because it works only under limited conditions, doesn't last long, and is far too expensive to be practical.  The wipes dry up and lose their effectiveness once they're out of their sealed packets.  To help me get through the fall tennis season, what I really need is a stockpile of these wipes, but there's no way I could afford that at $4/wipe.

"This printer has been working flawlessly for me for at least seven or eight years now.  Yes, it's a bit noisy, but the noise is not excessive for a printer of its size.  The output is extremely consistent, and that's a big plus.The major drawback to the printer is that it will disable itself when it feels the toner is too low.  At first, like a dummy, I would replace the toner cartridges.  But then I found out you can put the printer in a diagnostic mode which allows the printer to keep printing even when it's telling you to replace the cartridge.  Then I found out you can go into the printer's setup menu and completely override the printer's settings, allowing you to print until a toner cartridge literally runs out.  Do this, and you will be blown away by how much more printing you can get out of your toner cartridges!

The 1080p resolution was just a little to low when opening many windows at once. 1080p also had visible pixels. 4K resolution works much better and allows multi side by side windows, and the pixels are not visible from computer viewing distances.Of course you need to make sure your video card is capable of outputting 4k for it to work, and you MUST use HDMI port 1 on the TV for 4K input.I am using a EVGA GeForce GT 740 video card set to 3840 x 2160 and it is working flawlessly in Windows 8 and Windows 10.Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWBZ1AJKSU54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TL88ELO#wasThisHelpful","R3MWBZ1AJKSU54","A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have written hundreds of reviews, and I have never been as impressed by a product!I was very very skeptical that a small package like this could ever start a car, especially a high compression V8. Some of my much larger heaver jumper boxes have trouble with most high compression engines.When I received it I was even more skeptical, small and very light weight. Fits in a glove box.So to test it, I gave it the worst scenario. I disconnected the lead acid battery from my high compression small block Chevy V8, and clipped this jump-starter to the disconnected cables.Much to my surprise, not only did it crank over the engine, but it cranked it at a higher RPM than my $120 dollar 800 CCA lead acid battery!Very impressive!There is a down side though that you must be aware of. This and similar boxes are designed for convenience. They do not have large gauge cables, and as such the cables will overheat if you crank the motor excessively, or if you start multiple dead cars back to back without letting the cables cool down. But for normal use to start your car with a dead/low battery, it is stellar.Very highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZ5CB13ZBZ5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBINF7G#wasThisHelpful","R2GZ5CB13ZBZ5T","A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I unfortunately have a treatment resistant form of sleep apnea. I have a difficult time with CPAP, and am not a candidate for surgery. My snoring has been described as horrendous with frequent non-breathing episodes nightly.The concept of anti-snore oral appliances is to pull the bottom jaw out slightly to make the throat opening larger for better air flow and breathing. With better air flow and less breathing disruption, snoring and apnea are reduced or eliminated. Dental appliances are usually designed by a dental professional at a high cost, and work for some, not for others. So I was leery to spend the big money for a 50/50 proposition.This Night Guard Mouthpiece was a much less expensive way to try one out and see if the concept worked for me. This model is adjustable, as different people tolerate there bottom jaw being moved out different lengths.I followed the easy to follow molding instructions and it was ready to wear in 10 minutes. I had read many reviews about how big it was, so I figured I needed to get used to it. I set the adjustment to zero (no jaw adjustment), then wore it around the house on a Saturday morning. Obviously at first it felt very unnatural, but over the course of he morning I forgot I was wearing it. Then I started to adjust the device for more and more lower jaw extension. This to was slightly uncomfortable, but the more I wore it, the less I noticed. I kept adjusting until I got to the point that it was uncomfortable continuously, then I backed off one setting. At this point I decided to not use the device Saturday night, but to let my jaw relax one night. My jaw was a little sore the next morning, but it was fine by noon.So Sunday night was the test. I placed my cell phone app on record and attempted to sleep. I was a little uncomfortable for a few minutes, but then fell asleep. I woke up at 4am with a slightly sore mouth/teeth/jaw and checked the recording. No Snoring!! This was a time to celebrate for me after years of failed treatments.With this good result I continued to use the mouthpiece. The first couple nights were a little uncomfortable, but now I don't even notice it, and my sleep quality and general feeling has improved tremendously.Because of the moldable nature of this mouthpiece, the plastic is soft. At the present rate I think it may last about 6 months before needing to be replaced. But now that I know this treatment works on me, I have made an appointment to have my dentist custom design a smaller lighter version using my mouthpiece settings as a guide. Now the expensive custom dentist created model is money well spent.RecommendedNote: The first mouthpiece I received must have been exposed to high temperatures because the moldable plastic was melted on one side. I returned it and got a perfect replacement in a couple days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2YIVI9NDE68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4AO8GI#wasThisHelpful","R2S2YIVI9NDE68","A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The reviews state that this is a sloppy fit, but there are no other choices I could find with a keyboard w/ track pad.So I took the chance and purchased one.

"Inexpensive LED bulbs use approximately 80% to 95% less electricity than standard bulbs. But they do have limitations...LED bulbs are much more sensitive to voltage. You must check your power supply with a voltmeter to make sure it is outputting between 10.5 and 13.5 volts. Many halogen power supplies produce much more voltage (I have measured 20 volts on some ""12 volt"" supplies). Too much voltage will cause a drastically shorter bulb life.LED bulbs don't always have the same physical dimensions as their regular bulb counterparts. Always measure the fixture to make sure the bulb fits. With this bulb the measurements are listed in one of the pictures, and also in the ""product details"" section.Many LEDs produce a brighter whiter harsher colored light. This one is color corrected to a warmer color, but at the expense of slightly less brightness.LED bulbs are more sensitive to lack of ventilation. They shouldn't be used in small enclosed fixtures (such as fixtures with glass lenses) or they will sometimes overheat and fail. (A quick fix is to remove the fixture's glass lens).If your environment is outside these limitations, then you may have to go with the much more expensive brand names that are more tolerant.But if you follow these guidelines, these are good LED lights that pay for themselves in no time with substantial electric bill savings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3080SD10VXAOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YVLD9W#wasThisHelpful","R3080SD10VXAOZ","A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VNAGUP6GD6ZW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item from Pomarks for an unbiased review, and I must say - When I first opened it, I was wondering when in the world I would ever use such a device. You might be asking yourself the same thing, but I've discovered the practical uses for this thing will be endless, especially when it gets nicer here in Michigan and I can get back to my outdoor sports. I'd have to say, if you're frequently taking photos with your phone, this will be the best 20$ you've ever spent on phone accessories.CONNECTINGIt has bluetooth connectivity so that you don't have to worry about connecting cables, and the bluetooth connectivity is instant and easy. No need for pairing codes, simply switch the device to 'on' and look for it in your phone. It showed up as a keyboard device in android, because of the way it sends input to your phone similarly to a keyboard. Pairing was excellent, and I did mess around a bit with the range - You can still take pictures from over 30 feet away (not that you'd ever really need to do this, but it's an option if you're considering it for a remote). I'd imagine you will have no problem connecting to and using this camera with any bluetooth-enabled smartphone or smart camera.CONTROLSThere aren't many controls on this - on/off, and shutter. The shutter button is well-built and rubberized. It feels as if it's likely also water/sweat proof (in case you plan on taking this kayaking/cycling, like myself). The button is still clicky and responsive. When I snap a shot, it works just as fast as if I had just pressed the shutter button on my Galaxy S5. I really like the on/off switch vs a button that has to be held down to turn off/on. Also, the charging port is easily accessible on the bottom, rather than on a side. The port is always open and very easy to plug into. I have yet to charge it though, and have used the device on many occasions.BUILD QUALITYFor 20.00 retail price, I was extremely impressed with the build quality of this device, although, I didn't expect any less from Pomarks. I've always been happy with their engineering in the past. The telescoping rod works very well - it holds securely as you extend it, yet, it's not too difficult to sheath back to compact size. I really appreciated the clamping style for the phone, and it's very nice that they include an extra clip. I've tried products that 'clamp' onto my phone in the past, and have been very displeased. This device does not disappoint - it holds my rather big Galaxy S5 just fine with, or without its massive protective case. I have for it yet to even allow the phone to slip in the slightest. I put the device up to 10 feet above the ground, without fear of my phone falling and I think you will too. The rubberized and textured handle aids in making your phone feel secure - no real risk of dropping or the rod slipping out of your hand. While I don't think the arms are big enough to hold a Phablet (phone/tablet) or an iPad, it should fit all but the biggest of smartphones. It does have pads on the side that actually makes contact with the smartphone, and it's soft yet secure. Very well thought out design.Overall, I love this device. I can't wait to use it for taking kayaking pictures of my fiance and I. These were very hard photos to take ourselves before, but should be easily doable now. I also plan to make some clips so that I can mount it to my road bike for easy photos while we're on the move. To say that someone like me, who is overcautious about all of his expensive toys, smartphone included, will take this and hold it over cement on a moving bike or over the water, says a lot about the way it holds the phone. Highly recommended, I've looked around and I don't see anything better on the market for taking group pictures or activity selfies. I would include some pictures I've taken with it, but almost all of them are with family (it's so great for group pictures) that might not appreciate my doing so. Some of the other reviews do have great sample pictures, though. I may upload some of activities in the summer once it gets a bit nicer out, but this will be a hit for holiday photos!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A21FVKBGTOCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CX3ERO#wasThisHelpful","R3A21FVKBGTOCY","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did receive this item for review from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for providing a 5-star or even a positive review. RAVPower was releasing this new gadget and wanted critical, honest feedback for their customers. This review is written without bias as if I had purchased this item for myself at full retail price.That being said, this wireless 'all in one' deserves a definite 5-stars. I have used and reviewed many of these types of units in the past, and while the opportunities and features for which you can use this item for are overwhelming, they all work exceptionally well.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality of the WD03 is as good as any of the other RAVPower units - Built very well and with the user in mind. This is one of my favorite form factors as it can easily fit in my back pocket or in many different pockets of my backpack. Built with high quality materials to last a long time.FILE BACKUPThe main intended use for this device (although there are many others) is for backing up files and photos from mobile or wireless-only devices that you want to free up space on. The reason this is wireless is for convenience - It's not like you can just plug a standard external hard drive or SD card into your phone, but the WD03 can provide the medium to do so! Just connect to it over the wireless network that it provides and transfer away! After you've moved all of your files to the SD or drive plugged into the RAVPower, you can delete them from your phone if you wish as they are already stored on the other unit. This is a convenient way to transfer, store, and save file space.SHARINGThis unit is also great for sharing files. Say you are having a company meeting where most users are using mobile tablets. These don't make file sharing very easily done if you just want to keep things local and private (without putting the files on the Internet). So you can send all of the files to the WD03 (think of it like a local NAS), and others can view and collaborate with the files on the WD03 after connecting.CHARGE OTHER UNITSLastly, on top of all of its networking features, this unit can also charge a phone or mobile USB device in a pinch! It's not meant for charging other units as a primary function, but if you're on a plane and your battery is running low, you can always use the WD03 to charge it up in a pinch. The 6000 MAH battery is actually enough to charge my S5 from empty to full twice! I'd imagine it will charge most smartphones from empty to full at least once, and probably twice under normal conditions. Quite the added benefit of carrying along this little guy!Excellent product overall - Many features - You just have to know what you want it for! RAVpower makes quality items and I know you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCC5CN98WE760/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ZWS9ZE#wasThisHelpful","RCC5CN98WE760","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this sleeping bag for review during the last month or so (November) and boy was I glad I did. I was planning a bikepacking trip on my new fat bike, but only had one sleeping bag (was going with the wife). It was only a 50 mile round-trip expedition with one night of tent/hammock sleeping, but we don't do this sort of thing so it was a big deal to us.We rode the 25 miles to where we planned to setup camp. My bike was very difficult to pack because my sleeping bag was HUGE, meanwhile, my wife's EGOZ Easy to Carry Blue Sleeping bag was easily strapped to her handlebars with some lashing straps, while it was inside its carrying case. It is somewhat bulky, but takes up less than half the space of my old sleeping bag.We were quite cold when we were setting up camp, as the sun had set. Immediately after we got the tent up, we took cover and got into our sleeping bags. I noticed how much softer and warmer her bag was right away.I woke up with the sniffles and a cold. She woke up sweating. I'd imagine this sleeping bag could keep you cozy on down to 0 degrees based on that. The EGOZ bag was very warm, easy to pack and carry, and while not a minimalistic/hiking design, worked very great for this trip. I'd highly recommend it for how low the cost is, how well-made it is, and how toasty it can keep you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KABJCEJP1JHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZDMCOA#wasThisHelpful","R2KABJCEJP1JHU","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have several cases for my S5, but I mostly bought this case because it was cheap and looked much different than my current case - I wanted to mix it up some.With no other reviews on the case, I took the leap, but it wasn't that expensive so I wasn't too concerned. The other reviewer stated that it didn't fit, but I'm convinced that he must have purchased the wrong case for his model phone, because this case works great on my Stock Galaxy S5.It's very similar to a few other 'brand name' cases - It's thin, protective, and made up of two pieces. The buttons and controls work flawlessly - I actually prefer the feedback feeling of the case to my much more expensive Otterbox and Ballistic cases. They're 'clicky' and very easy to press, yet they also don't activate all the time in my pocket.Another great feature is that the case is semi-slick, so it slides into and out of my pocket with ease. The rubbery cases tend to be a major inconvenience when trying to pocket/unpocket my phone as they stick to the sides and attract all kinds of lint and debris.I have yet to drop the phone with this case on it, but I'm quite sure it will fare a lot of falls very well with this case along with a tempered glass screen protector, as it covers all sides and angles of the phone that it could fall onto a flat surface on.This case looks, fits, and feels great. I'd recommend it to anyone who is considering the cases that are very similar, yet double to quadruple the cost. Excellent value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9EYPKAFFVK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NFU84O#wasThisHelpful","R2S9EYPKAFFVK6","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this phone holster because I wanted an easy, secure way to hold my Galaxy S5 in my car. I had tried a few universal sets from local department stores, but they use a different clamp style, and they simply do not hold the phone securely. Not only did the other brands fail to hold the phone properly vertically, but the wheels on the back of the holster allowed it to tip around too easily. It was just too hard to use.I must say I'm very happy that I bought the Etekcity model. It takes care of all of those problems and makes mounting my phone much easier. I have this mounted to the dash in my Toyota Corolla, as the dash material is smooth enough for this to work. I prefer it there to the windshield, but it should work just fine on the windshield of any vehicle.The great thing is that this doesn't block the airflow like the air vent models, and stays nice and secure regardless of the cars motion (in my case). The form factor is excellent and it can clip in my Galaxy S5 (5.5"" phone) even WITH my slim UAG case on it. It's really nice not to have to take the case off to get a good fit in the holster, as I can just grab my phone and go once I'm done in the car.Overall I'm very happy with the build quality and functionality of this phone holster. It holds my phone securely and reliable, is very easy to position, and it has made it much easier to use hands-free functionality of my phone while driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6X0MSBHR2YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG8MLOA#wasThisHelpful","R2L6X0MSBHR2YP","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this digital scale after having some issues with the built-in scale on my luggage that ended up causing me to get an overweight fee, when the indicator on the bag itself clearly said that the load was less than 50 lbs.I have used Etekcity scales and kitchen appliances in the past and have always had great luck with their accuracy and reliability, so I decided to go that route again and I'm glad that I did!This unit is very portable, lightweight, and easy to use. I can trust it to accurately state the weight of any piece of luggage I take to the airport, and it doubles as a scale for weighing packages that I mail out. I don't mail a whole lot of products - there may be more ideal scales for this - but it does the trick for me!

"I decided to get this screen protector after breaking the screen on my Edge already. After having it replaced, I knew I needed to get some better protection for it. Most of the cases on the market do well for protecting the bezzels and back of the phone, but do not protect the face/screen from impact nor scratches.The LaoHe Premium Tempered Glass screen protector is the perfect solution. I have tried several other screen protectors that are made of film or other plastic/adhesive... And let me tell you - They are all junk. They make the phone's display feel awkward, get smudged up, and make the display appear to be lower resolution/clarity. It's not worth the minimal protection that these protectors offer.The LaoHe tempered glass screen protectors are completely different.EASY INSTALLATIONGlass screen protectors are even easier to install than the film ones. They don't bubble up, and they appear crystal clear once applied. To install, I simply cleaned the glass off (insure that there is no dust or other particles on the display), and lay the protector down flat - pressing in the middle and working my way to the edges. I have heard that if you mess up the installation and get some grit between the protector and the display that you can lift it up, remove the dust, and try again - However I never had that issue.SCRATCH PROOFBeing that this item was only a few dollars, I wasn't that concerned about ruining it. I attempted to scratch the screen protector with the edge of my car keys - No luck! It's at LEAST harder than steel (or whatever composite a car key may be made from). Highly impressed with its ability to protect against scratches. I've had it a few months now and the surface is still flawless.LOOK & FEELNot only does this glass keep the factory display quality of my Edge, but I feel that it actually *improves* the 'feel' of the phone's surface. That is, I prefer the way that the LaoHe makes my finger glide across the phone's touchscreen. Much better than stock, and far from that of the adhesive plastic screen protectors. No worries about this hindering the ability to see or use your phone as it was intended to be used - It will only improve it!SHOCK RESISTANCEThe main reason I bought this was to protect the glass of my display from shattering again if I drop it on its face. Of course, I use a slim protective case, but this wasn't enough last time. I have already dropped my phone once on its face (clumsy me - getting out of the car and it was in my lap) where it landed on concrete - Not even a scratch!

"I bought this bag to carry camping supplies with the occasional need to move around or pack up camp. I've also found it to be very handy for my fishing trips down to the local lake, where I can pack up everything into the bag and be quite mobile while not limiting myself to only part of my supplies, as it has quite a massive capacity while maintaining a convenient form factor that distributes the weight over your back, shoulders, and chest in a comfortable manner.Upon receiving I was very impressed with the quality of the backpack for the price. The materials appear to be very strong and well-built. The zippers do not snag, and the pockets hold tight. The bag has some 'structure' to it, so that it doesn't wilt even if you don't fill it in its entire massive capacity.I must say, that for being so spacious and so capable of carrying a lot of weight, it still remains comfortable. I think part of this is due to the rather slender design that helps to distribute the load weight across your entire back rather than creating hot spots like many other packs do. I think the slimmer, longer form factor also covers less of a portion of my back and therefore helps more airflow to circulate and makes the pack feel a little more comfortable to carry.I'm able to carry several tackle boxes, 2 collapsible fishing poles, several extra reels, live bait, a blanket, a collapsible tripod chair, and 2 water bottles into this backpack without much struggle. I could probably fit even more if I needed to. This is perfect as I can pack this up, drive down to within half a mile of the lake, and hike to the lake with the pack on. No more multiple trips and no more struggling to carry all of the gear in both hands. It also makes it a breeze to pick up and move to another section of the lake when I'm not having much luck.All in all I couldn't ask for a better backpack, especially for the price. I personally made this into a fishing backpack, but it would be great for day backpacking/hiking trips, camping, and various other uses. Built with quality, I figure this bag will last me several years if not indefinitely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257BAZW6YY062/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012NG059O#wasThisHelpful","R257BAZW6YY062","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think the slimmer, longer form factor also covers less of a portion of my back and therefore helps more airflow to circulate and makes the pack feel a little more comfortable to carry.I'm able to carry several tackle boxes, 2 collapsible fishing poles, several extra reels, live bait, a blanket, a collapsible tripod chair, and 2 water bottles into this backpack without much struggle. I could probably fit even more if I needed to. This is perfect as I can pack this up, drive down to within half a mile of the lake, and hike to the lake with the pack on. No more multiple trips and no more struggling to carry all of the gear in both hands. It also makes it a breeze to pick up and move to another section of the lake when I'm not having much luck.Being that I'm not a backpacker, I'm not sure that I'll ever fill this bag to its maximum capacity! I do enjoy using it for fishing, cycling, and walks, but I will plan to keep it around in the event I ever plan to do bikepacking (backpacking long distances by fat bike or mountain bike), as that has been a long time dream of mine and the G4Free bag may make it possible to carry more gear than I'd ever thought possible. The other nice thing about having a massive 70L capacity bag on your back is that you don't necessarily have to have expensive, ultra lightweight, ultra compact backpacking-specific gear, as not everyone can afford stuff like that. Excellent thinking on G4Free's end.All in all I couldn't ask for a better backpack, especially for the price. I personally made this into a fishing backpack, but it would be great for day backpacking/hiking trips, camping, and various other uses. Built with quality, I figure this bag will last me several years if not indefinitely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7P3V9N9VQNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ZEKKG2#wasThisHelpful","R1D7P3V9N9VQNR","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this bag because I have a big love for my G4Free 40L bag for taking items fishing, camping or hiking, but it just doesn't make sense to take my huge backpack when all I want to carry are a few gadgets or devices. I bought this with the intention of carrying essentials on long walks/hikes.Some items that I have began to carry regularly in this handy little pack: Smart phone, spare batteries, flash light, wallet, keys, first aid items, bug spray, sunblock, and a few other odds and ends. While maintaining a small form factor, it can still hold quite a few of these smaller items with ease.Because of the form factor and the way the strap is setup, the bag is nearly weightless (seemingly) even when packed tight. This may be due to being used to much larger G4Free backpacks for carrying massive quantities of gear, but they did this bag right, too!What's also nice is that you can easily carry this leg pack whilst carrying a much heavier, larger backpack, and keep the additional weight off your back. You can carry small, heavy items in the leg pouch and help save your back from carrying the weight.Best of all is that the material is quality and durable. I'd imagine this bag will outlast my enthusiasm for the nature sports - even if it takes decades! I'm very happy with the build quality of this bag just like I have been with all of the G4Free bags that I have either purchased or received for review purposes.Many other reviewers are using this for carrying camera equipment, food, fishing tackle, emergency supplies, and more... What will YOU use it for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAU0S9S5HRY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YZE1OY#wasThisHelpful","R3BAU0S9S5HRY9","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did, in fact, receive this item from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest, critical review. I was not required nor given incentive for providing a 5-star review - The manufacturer was releasing this new item and wanted to get quality consumer feedback for potential shoppers on Amazon. This review is written as if I have purchased the item for full retail price myself, and is not bias.That being said, this case is worth a definite 5-stars. I love the build quality and design of the product, and was quite surprised how low the retail price of the item is despite how great of quality it's made with.Being that you're probably on the market looking for several other cases for your iPad or tablet otherwise and are reading several reviews for several different cases, I will shorten this up and let you know what I liked best about the K&F Concept case.LIGHTWEIGHTThis case is very minimal and lightweight but still gets the job done. No excessive bulk or weight to carry around like many other cases may offer.ATTRACTIVE DESIGNLooks great, stays clean, and isn't going to attract attention to your device.SNUG FITI'm personally using this for my iPad Air and it fits it quite well, but I'd imagine it will fit most tablets up to 10 inches without any issues.EXCELLENT BUILD QUALITYThe stitching and zipper, as well as overall thickness of this product are good indicators that this item was made with care and will not only protect your iPad/tablet well, but will also likely last a lifetime.Overall this is a great case that I'd recommend to anyone who would like a soft, universal tablet case that protects without adding excessive bulk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PAZRQJSPAS62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJTJ0U6#wasThisHelpful","R1PAZRQJSPAS62","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these primarily to replace an older pair of cloth gloves that we use for removing pans from the oven when they're obviously much too hot to grab. In the few weeks we have owned these, we've found many more uses for them than just grabbing hot pans and cookie sheets!They've also been great for grabbing eggs from boiling water (as pictured - no need to dump out the water and hope you don't break the shells), and the included tools have made grilling far easier. When the grill gets really full of meat or whatever else you're cooking, it can get hard to maneuver and handle the food using just tongs or a spatula. The addition of these gloves not only makes it far easier, but allows for more control!These are built very well and I have not had any issues with them melting or breaking down, despite subjecting to some pretty extreme direct and indirect heat. I feel like they will hold up for a very long time. I wish they came in other colors, but for now we'll still with these ones! We'll definitely buy a second or third pair if they come out with variations :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MNEOOOSWH307/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q6IUMC#wasThisHelpful","R1MNEOOOSWH307","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did in fact receive this item from iClever for review purposes. I was not instructed nor given incentive to provide a 5-star or even a positive review. iClever was launching this new product and wanted my critical feedback so that it could be given to other potential consumers. I am writing this review as if I had purchased this unit at the full retail price, and is my honest opinion.That being said, this is a definite 5-star item. It's excellent for all of the functions that I wanted it for. I wanted this unit because all of the other bluetooth receivers I had tried in my car either wouldn't stay in the jack, had an abnormally large form factor, didn't have great controls, or just plain sounded terrible! For that reason, I'm going to lay out for you plain and simple all of the best features and functions of this device and why it is my new favorite (the one that stays in the Aux jack in my car!)AUDIO QUALITYAudio quality is not sacrificed when switching to bluetooth receiving in this device. It still sounds as if I have a wired connection to my vehicle's aux port! The impedence is also very low, so the volume gets just as high as if I had connected my phone via a wired connection.EASE OF INSTALLATIONSome bluetooth devices out there really make it a pain to connect and stay connected. With the iClever, the first time I plugged it in and started my car up, it entered pairing mode. I saw it and paired to it with my phone in just about 10 seconds. From there, every time I turn on my car (so long as my phone is in range and in bluetooth) it automatically pairs and is ready to stream audio or phone calls.BUILD QUALITY / FORM FACTORThis is my absolute favorite thing about this item. Many other receivers are bulky and don't like to stay plugged in, or otherwise get in the way all the time. Not with the iClever unit! I just plug it in, automatically connect (Bluetooth will find it after you pair once) and drive away! Once the unit is already plugged in, all I have to do is turn my car on and my phone will automatically connect and begin streaming any sound to my vehicle (granted, my phone's Bluetooth radio is on). Awesome!HANDS FREE CALLSMost bluetooth receivers on the market today do have microphones in them so that you can make and take calls as well, but the iClever unit really does it right. It seems to really eliminate road noise and background sounds in the car and still pick up my voice, even when I'm only talking at a tone like I'm speaking to the person next to me (not intentionally speaking louder right at the receiver). This makes taking calls easy and preferred to picking up the phone or using a bluetooth receiver. Take note also, that the on-board controls also work for picking up / hanging up and muting the call!Overall this is a great little bluetooth receiver that I'd recommend to anyone who is trying to add bluetooth functionality to a vehicle WITH AUX! If you do not have aux in your car, this little guy won't work and you'll probably want to get a bluetooth>FM transmitter so that you can tune in with your radio.Please 'helpful' this review if it has assisted you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35CB9XJV4GB2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011NR0BY8#wasThisHelpful","R35CB9XJV4GB2Q","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did, in fact, receive this item for free from the manufacturer for review purposes. I was not required nor given incentive to provide a 5-star review. YOPO, the manufacturer, was just looking for critical, honest feedback for this new item they were releasing to inform potential shoppers on Amazon. This review is written as if I have paid full retail price for the item and is not bias.That being said, I feel that for the price and quality of this item, it deserves a definite 5-stars. I didn't have a whole lot of space to place this chalkboard in my own house for testing, so I gave it to my little brother (Who is 5 and LOVES things like these) and we hung it up in his bedroom. He already had a small chalkboard easel but this was so much better because it gave him more space and was available easily on the wall without creating a mess everywhere else.Installation was very easy and straight-forward. Very easy to press onto the wall and I had no issues with bubbles, despite the wall behind it not being perfectly even. Within minutes, Matt was away to writing his alphabet and coloring in random objects he's learned to draw at daycare!I attempted to peel back the chalkboard from the wall, just curious if it would be difficult to remove or leave behind a lot of residue. Much to my surprise, while it's secure enough to not come off by accident, it comes off quite easily - All in one piece and without leaving behind a sticky mess! We will leave it up of course, but it's great to know this isn't going to ruin the paint or finish on the wall behind it!Overall this is a great product. I'd recommend it for far more uses than we have found for it - I love the idea of dedicating the side of a cupboard for it (as indicated in the pictures). I'd imagine a use like that would work fine!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCDPBW3GU3Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRPCEEQ#wasThisHelpful","RSCDPBW3GU3Y5","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This review is written as if I have paid full retail price for the item myself.That being said, I'm very happy with the quality of this brush set and it is fully deserving of a 5-star review! While this item is relatively inexpensive and simple, I still think it is better than the competition. I gave this set to my wife and she's very happy with it. Here are some key points that she loves:EXCELLENT FOR TRAVELThis product was really designed with portability and travel in mind. All of the brushes stow away into a container hardly bigger than a tampon, and are extremely easy to carry around with your makeup or travel bag. My wife even tosses it into her gym bag for in between the gym and going to work.BUILD QUALITYThese items are built with excellent quality. The brushes are thick and durable, and the container is heavy-duty for the price. It feels like these brushes will hold up far longer than the competing products we have tried, which remind me of some 'Fisher Price' paint brushes or something that will likely snap and already flex a lot.Overall I'm very happy with this item.

"I bought this phone holster because I wanted an easy, secure way to hold my Galaxy S5 in my car. I had tried a few universal sets from local department stores, but they use a different clamp style, and they simply do not hold the phone securely. Not only did the other brands fail to hold the phone properly vertically, but the wheels on the back of the holster allowed it to tip around too easily. It was just too hard to use.I must say I'm very happy that I bought the Gaoyi model. It takes care of all of those problems and makes mounting my phone much easier. I have this mounted to the air vent in my 2012 Toyota Corolla, and it works great. It may not mount to all air vents, however, especially the round ones like in my wife's 2007 Pontiac G6. I would take note if you have that kind of air vents that this still may work in other locations, but probably will not mount properly to that type of air vent.The great thing is that this doesn't block the airflow and it stays nice and secure to the vent even if I move it around to redirect airflow. The form factor is excellent and it can clip in my Galaxy S5 (5.5"" phone) even WITH my slim UAG case on it. It's really nice not to have to take the case off to get a good fit in the holster, as I can just grab my phone and go once I'm done in the car.Overall I'm very happy with the build quality and functionality of this phone holster. It holds my phone securely and reliable, is very easy to position, and it has made it much easier to use hands-free functionality of my phone while driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A76JGGGLPK4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ZGGKAQ#wasThisHelpful","R3A76JGGGLPK4Y","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They wanted to get some garden lights, but for such a short path, and on a limited budget, these heavy duty solar lights were not required. I instead opted for this set from Ecandy because it was far easier to setup, included fewer parts, and was far less expensive.I couldnt be happier with the results! It turned out so well (across a 10 foot or so path from the driveway to the stairs, with some lights along the railing of the stairs), that I wish I had taken pictures. Unfortunately, they live a bit of a distance from me so it may be some time before I am able to.These are built well, shine bright with minimal solar charge throughout the day, and are an extremely cost effective way for me to show their guests the path and stairway at night.

"I'd like to state up front that I did receive these headphones for review purposes from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for writing a 5-star or even a positive review. Aukey was releasing a new pair of headphones and wanted my honest, critical feedback to be provided to other customers on the market deciding if these are the headphones for them. This review is written as if I have paid full price for this item and is not bias.That being said, these are some great headphones and you won't notice much difference in quality with these being wireless, and especially not for the very low price. Like other reviewers have stated, these have some great volume, are easy to connect to, and have some decent sound output for the price. There are many other builds on the market that you'll see that are very similar to these, but Aukey makes a quality product and I've been very happy with it.These have become my 'daily drivers' for exercising: Trips to the gym for lifting, running, and cycling outdoors have been made much more pleasant with these. They get plenty loud enough even in a noisy gym or with lots of wind on the bike. They have plenty enough battery life to last me even the longest of bike rides.Fit has also been excellent. A problem for me with many pairs of earbuds is that they just can't seem to fit properly. If you have any fit issues with these out of the box, I'd advise trying bigger ear tips. Most people try to use tips that are too small since they're easier to insert, but you generally get a better 'seal' if you use the bigger size.While on topic of 'seal', these do provide an excellent seal for me once I found the combination that works best for my ear shape & size. With the included tips, most external sound is isolated even when playing music through the ear buds on very low volume. It also gives incredibly deep, powerful bass - So I can't advise enough to make sure you that you have the optimal fit before coming to a conclusion on the sound quality of these buds!Overall these are a great unit.

"I'd like to state up front that I did, in fact, receive this item for review purposes from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive to provide a 5-star review for this item. AKDY was releasing this new showerhead and wanted honest, critical feedback whether it was positive or negative.That being said, I do believe this item is worth a definite 5-stars. Not only because it's a great showerhead that has performed at or above expectations, but because I'm also baffled that they're able to sell it for a measly 9.99. A similar item would go for over double at any of my local department or hardware stores.This showerhead is made of a soft yet durable ABS material, and is of excellent build quality. It was very easy to install and does not leak or have gaps in the fitting. It looks elegant and expensive, in my opinion - Not like some cheap showerhead I got on Amazon that was made in Japan.Once I actually used the showerhead, I was even more impressed. It has two output options - either your standard 'shower' stream where the water jets from the various small holes over the head, or, the 'waterfall' mode where the water jets from the slit at the edge of the showerhead. This mode feels and looks great! It has even gotten a few 'WOW's from guests that stayed overnight and used the shower downstairs.It's very easy to switch between the two options, with the responsive buttons at the 'bottom' of the head (depending on orientation) but they're very easy to find and work quickly as they are likely just physical buttons that block off waterflow as you press them.Overall this is a great unit and I'd recommend it for its build quality, price, and multiple options for a shower!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKUQD0SV79DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDFULM0#wasThisHelpful","R1VKUQD0SV79DU","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this light for use inside my closet, which is kind of a small walk-in closet, but is positioned in a way in the room that almost no natural light or light from the ceiling bulbs really enters. It's very difficult to see in there, especially at night. I really wanted this light so that I could mount it in the back with ease, and it would come on only as I needed it.I must say, I've been quite happy with it and it was well worth the small price tag. The build quality is even better than I expected. Ecandy normally does a great job in crafting quality items for such a low price. It looks like a premium product that I'd pay 40+$ for.The best feature of this is that it's battery operated and motion-detecting. There's no need to run cords, punch holes in the wall, etc. Very easy to mount and use - Just mount it up and put batteries in it. From there, each time I open my closet door, the light turns on. It emits a yellowish, very bright, non-harsh light that makes it quite easy to see everything in my closet. The light disperses quite well and is definitely designed for adding light to tight spaces.The fact that the light is constructed with 80,000 hour LED's is even better! LED's are much more power efficient and tend to put off a brighter, longer lasting light. I have not yet worn out a pair of batteries in the unit and I've been using it every day for about a month. I'd imagine that, since these are LED's, they'll last a few months without needing to change the batteries, based on my use.Overall this is a great item and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to add some light quickly and easily, in an attractive form factor, to any part of their home - inside or outside!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6C8R7PAUA1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CLD98Y#wasThisHelpful","RX6C8R7PAUA1H","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I instead opted for this set from Ecandy because it was far easier to setup, included fewer parts, and was far less expensive.I couldnt be happier with the results! It turned out so well (across a 10 foot or so path from the driveway to the stairs, with some lights along the railing of the stairs), that I wish I had taken pictures. Unfortunately, they live a bit of a distance from me so it may be some time before I am able to.These are built well, shine bright with minimal solar charge throughout the day, and are an extremely cost effective way for me to show their guests the path and stairway at night. No more stumbling over the stairs/lawn carrying in groceries or other items late at night!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315ANPER42MEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116HS95I#wasThisHelpful","R315ANPER42MEQ","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this unit as a gift for my little brother, who loves to have sound and light as he goes to sleep. He has a similar item but it's growing old and this seemed to be of a much better design and quality than the unit that we paid almost triple the price for locally.So far he's very happy with it! Setup was a breeze and the lights are much more colorful and bright than the previous unit. You can hook up your own music device to it as well but we have not done this yet. What a nice extra feature that they added iPod/Mp3 input and a speaker...I was really surprised with the build quality of the projector - I didn't expect a cheap 20.00 light to be built so well and durable.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone interested in it. It's definitely worth its value and is a great addition to any room at night!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317S6032DALZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMVQTKI#wasThisHelpful","R317S6032DALZ4","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this engine diagnostic tool to figure out why in the world my 2012 Corolla check engine light kept coming on, even when there were no issues detectable anywhere! Everything seemed to be in tip-top shape with no issues anywhere - ride smooth and no clunks or clinks!After receiving this diagnostic device (shipped fast - Thanks!), I hooked up to my Android phone (Galaxy S5 but it seems that it'd be compatible with far more devices due to wireless connectivity), and within just a few minutes I was hooked up to the car and I had a code, which I was able to define as 'Check Gas Cap'!As it turns out, my gas cap was on loose. Not sure how I managed to do that for two tanks of gas in a row, but surely enough, re-tightening the gas cap and clearing the check engine light made this device not able to find the code anymore and the light never came back on.Saved me quite a bit of time and potentially a trip to the mechanic where they may have tried to sell me something more I didn't need! I also saw it gave other useful information about my vehicle through the application - Like Tire Pressure, Fuel Level, and a few other odds and ends. Of course, this would vary based on the sensors of your vehicle as this device does no magic.Overall it has already paid for itself in the first week of ownership. Very easy to install and use, and I can't wait to help others with their vehicle diagnostics!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XAK8Z5UXH16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJPHEBO#wasThisHelpful","R12XAK8Z5UXH16","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd like to state up front that I did receive this item for review from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for providing a 5-star or even a positive review. RAVPower was releasing this new gadget and wanted critical, honest feedback for their customers. This review is written without bias as if I had purchased this item for myself at full retail price.That being said, this wireless 'all in one' deserves a definite 5-stars. I have used and reviewed many of these types of units in the past, and while the opportunities and features for which you can use this item for are overwhelming, they all work exceptionally well.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality of the WD01 is as good as any of the other RAVPower units - Built very well and with the user in mind. This is one of my favorite form factors as it can easily fit in my back pocket or in many different pockets of my backpack. Built  with high quality materials to last a long time.FILE BACKUPThe main intended use for this device (although there are many others) is for backing up files and photos from mobile or wireless-only devices that you want to free up space on. The reason this is wireless is for convenience - It's not like you can just plug a standard external hard drive or SD card into your phone, but the WD01 can provide the medium to do so! Just connect to it over the wireless network that it provides and transfer away! After you've moved all of your files to the SD or drive plugged into the RAVPower, you can delete them from your phone if you wish as they are already stored on the other unit. This is a convenient way to transfer, store, and save file space.SHARINGThis unit is also great for sharing files. Say you are having a company meeting where most users are using mobile tablets. These don't make file sharing very easily done if you just want to keep things local and private (without putting the files on the Internet). So you can send all of the files to the WD01 (think of it like a local NAS), and others can view and collaborate with the files on the WD01 after connecting.CHARGE OTHER UNITSLastly, on top of all of its networking features, this unit can also charge a phone or mobile USB device in a pinch! It's not meant for charging other units as a primary function, but if you're on a plane and your battery is running low, you can always use the WD01 to charge it up in a pinch.Excellent product overall - Many features - You just have to know what you want it for! RAVpower makes quality items and I know you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHNPA8932KTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUMZRA#wasThisHelpful","R1DHNPA8932KTR","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did receive this charger for review purposes from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for writing a 5-star or even a positive review. ZeroLemon was releasing a charger and wanted my honest, critical feedback to be provided to other customers on the market deciding if this charger is for them. This review is written as if I have paid full price for this item and is not bias.That being said, this item definitely deserves a full 5 stars. There isn't a whole lot to say about a charger, but I'd like to let you know a few of the key points that make this an excellent value:FORM FACTORThe form factor of this charger is one of my favorite features. It looks much better than all of the cheap Chinese knockoff versions of OEM chargers. It looks great, fits into the wall with ease, and feels like it is of great quality that will outlast any phone you charge it with.SPEEDIt charges as fast as my OEM charger! I am using this with a Galaxy S5. Take note that even if you're charging a USB 3.0 phone with the included 2.0 cable, charging speed will not be reduced from using the OEM cable as 3.0 only affects data transfer speeds when plugged into a computer. However, you can always use a USB 3.0 cable with this charger, as they are detachable - It just isn't included.EFFICIENCYWhile this not play a major role to most, I love how efficient this charger is. I know it's more efficient than the other brands I was testing because it doesn't get hot when charging for long periods of time, and also doesn't make that high-frequency noise when in use. These are signs of a cheap charger and the ZeroLemon does none of it!Overall, this is a great charger that has become my go-to charger for the bedroom due to its reliability and design. I would recommend this charger to anyone in need of a replacement or alternative/secondary charger for any phone that can be charged via a USB wall charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XP0TVVRS1S82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WM93M9S#wasThisHelpful","R2XP0TVVRS1S82","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was not required nor given incentive to provide a 5-star or even a positive review. I was asked to provide critical, honest feedback on a new item for potential customers on Amazon. This review is written as if I have purchased the item at full retail price for myself.That being said, this case deserves a full 5-stars, especially given the price point.

It should fit most of the cameras! I personally use it with my GoPro 4 and the fit is snug and secure. I really feel like my camera is secure in this case and can carry several accessories as well.Build Quality: The build quality of this case is impressive for the cost. The outer shell is soft, but durable enough to protect against drops and bruises. I'd also like to add that the case is extremely lightweight, so you'll really only feel the weight of the camera and whatever other accessories you like to keep with it (spare batteries, lenses, stands, straps, etc.)Room for accessories: As mentioned above, there are plenty of slots for lenses, straps, stands, spare batteries, and many other items that you can easily fit in the slots near the camera. I also like to carry a microfiber cloth and some disposable lens cleaner wipes in the mesh pocket above the camera.Overall this is a great case for the GoPro line and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to carry their camera & accessories in style with protection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JZMED4ZV2EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111QCHRA#wasThisHelpful","R10JZMED4ZV2EH","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did receive these headphones for review purposes from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for writing a 5-star or even a positive review. AngLink was releasing a new pair of headphones and wanted my honest, critical feedback to be provided to other customers on the market deciding if these are the headphones for them. This review is written as if I have paid full price for this item and is not bias.That being said, these are some great headphones and you won't notice much difference in quality with these being wireless, and especially not for the very low price. Like other reviewers have stated, these have some great volume, are easy to connect to, and have some decent sound output for the price. There are many other builds on the market that you'll see that are very similar to these, but AngLink makes a quality product and I've been very happy with it.These have become my 'daily drivers' for exercising: Trips to the gym for lifting, running, and cycling outdoors have been made much more pleasant with these. They get plenty loud enough even in a noisy gym or with lots of wind on the bike. They have plenty enough battery life to last me even the longest of bike rides.Fit has also been excellent. A problem for me with many pairs of earbuds is that they just can't seem to fit properly. If you have any fit issues with these out of the box, I'd advise trying bigger ear tips. Most people try to use tips that are too small since they're easier to insert, but you generally get a better 'seal' if you use the bigger size.While on topic of 'seal', these do provide an excellent seal for me once I found the combination that works best for my ear shape & size. With the included tips, most external sound is isolated even when playing music through the ear buds on very low volume. It also gives incredibly deep, powerful bass - So I can't advise enough to make sure you that you have the optimal fit before coming to a conclusion on the sound quality of these buds!Overall these are a great unit.

"I bought this product because, as others have stated, the factory cradle for the Fit Bit Flex can sometimes, for whatever reason, be very hard to fit in. The one that I received with my Flex *worked* but it took some force to get it into the cradle. Couple that with the fact that the flex doesn't come with (at least mine didn't) the AC wall adapter, and you have yourself a winner with the Arrela charging cable cradle with AC adapter.While you could probably use another AC adapter for USB output that you have just lying around, you never know the correct voltage/amperage and you don't want to risk damaging the FitBit. That and USB slots on a computer aren't always available, so the Arrela combination works out really well for me as I typically just leave the AC plugged into the wall in the bathroom with the cradle hanging from it. I never forget to grab my Fitbit from it as I leave the house because I see it immediately in the bathroom as I leave.The Arrela cradle also resolves the issue of poor fit. Strangely enough, this unit is actually built to spec better than the OEM equivalent. Charging works reliably and quickly both with the AC adapter or by plugging the Arrela cradle into a PC or Mac. I've had no issues with it since purchasing and it has replaced the one that the Flex came with!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M72OZ0R50LD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPWKT6S#wasThisHelpful","R3M72OZ0R50LD2","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did receive these headphones for review purposes from the manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for writing a 5-star or even a positive review. Axgio was releasing a new pair of headphones and wanted my honest, critical feedback to be provided to other customers on the market deciding if these are the headphones for them. This review is written as if I have paid full price for this item and is not bias.That being said, I do find that these headphones are worth a definite 5 stars. I have used and reviewed MANY pairs of bluetooth headphones (we're talking 20+). Honestly, the headphones that these best compare to on the market are the Blue Buds X by Jay Bird. These are 150+$ headphones that are known for being top-end. The Axgio actually compare and in some cases, improve upon many of the features of the Blue Buds X.SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality of these headphones is exceptional. If you get a great seal (using the correct tips and proper insertion), bass is excellent as well as sound isolation. These are 'sound isolating' in that they dampen all external sounds when you have them in. If you have these sealed well in your ear with some light music playing, you are unlikely to be able to be able to hear someone talking to you right next to you. I've found it also does a great job of blocking out treadmill noise and other sound at the gym.FORM FACTORThe form factor and fit of these headphones has made them my primary 'active' headphones (the ones I use for cycling, lifting, running, etc.) This is because not only do they fit nice and comfortably, but they're also water/sweat proof to some degree, and also stay in very well. One of the biggest problems with my other headphones would be that even if they stayed in my ear decently, if the cable moves around (running) or gets snagged or my head moves (sit ups) the buds would pull out from my ears. With the form factor of the Axgio Sprint, the cable wraps around your ear. All cable pulls are absorbed by your ear and do not yank the buds from your ears! This makes them highly effective for exercise, while still remaining quite comfortable and great-fitting.CONTROLSIn-line controls are where it's at. The bluetooth earbuds that place the controls on the earbuds themselves are terrible by design. Imagine having to press the buds into your ears with difficult-to-press buttons each and every time you want to change the song. Annoying! Axgio did it right by moving the control panel to a spot in the line itself. This is easy to reach whether you have the cable behind your head or running down your chest/neck area. They're very responsive, intuitive, and easy to use.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITYI haven't had this issue with many, but with some cheap BT headphones you'll have issues either with pairing or with staying connected. Neither were an issue with the Sprint - Simply turn on, connect once, and then each and every time you turn them on they'll automatically connect to your phone if it is nearby. I've never had any issue with the headphones disconnecting while in use.BATTERY LIFEIn terms of listening to music (my primary use) the battery life is, as advertised, about 6-8 hours on average for me. If listening at full volume, the battery life may be closer to 6-7 hours, but it is very close to 8 if listening at a reasonable level with your phone placed not too far from the headphones. This is more than enough for me, as I never listen even close to that much in a day. I generally recharge the headphones about once a week on average.Overall these are a great pair of bluetooth buds, especially if you plan to use them for sports/exercise. They have a great form factor, are secure in the ear, and have excellent audio quality to top it all off!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7DQFCF3RV7RQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123KN5TC#wasThisHelpful","R7DQFCF3RV7RQ","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this stand primarily to make charging my Apple watch easier while making the face more accessible while it is charging. For the price, I couldn't have asked for more. It's sturdy, cosmetically appealing, and the cable was very easy to run through it. The cable remains snug and in-place even after moving it around on my night stand.The best feature is that I'm able to look at charging status and other items on the display of the watch while it's charging in the upright position rather than just sitting on my nightstand. It will likely prevent scratches and damage in the long run, and makes charging much less of a hassle.There's not much more I have to say about such a simple item - other than I'd recommend it for the reasons above!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0MXDFSQQCQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H7XCN2#wasThisHelpful","R1W0MXDFSQQCQW","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this selfie stick because I was looking for an affordable secondary unit to keep in my Camelbak backpack that I use for cycling. While I liked the selfie stick that I already had, I was always forgetting to bring it on my group cycling trips because it was packed away in my camping gear. I wanted this unit because it was affordable and wouldn't require a charger, since it wasn't wireless, and would therefore always be ready for use without any maintenance or charging.What I found was that this stick was even better than my other unit which cost twice as much! Since it isn't wireless, not only does it not require charging, but that also means no fuss of dealing with bluetooth pairing and connectivity. A lot of the time when I'm riding my bike, I am paired to either my bluetooth speaker or bluetooth headphones. There is the hassle of disconnecting or turning off all of the other devices before being able to use the selfie stick that requires bluetooth connection. With the wired Foxnovo selfie stick, I can leave all of my other wireless devices connected and simply attach the AUX cable to the phone. No hassle of dealing with connecting, pairing, disconnecting, or charging!I couldn't be happier with the build quality for the price. It holds my phone securely, is easy to hold onto, and has a lanyard attachment for any accidental drops. The connection is reliable and snappy - The photo is taken as soon as I hit the button as there is no delay for wireless connectivity.I must say I also appreciate how collapsible/portable this unit is. My other unit does not fold down to nearly such a small item. It's also lightweight since it doesn't need to carry a battery, and makes no noticeable difference to the weight of the gear on my back.Lastly, the clamp mechanism is very easy to use, yet still holds the phone securely. I much prefer it to those that use the 'X' pattern to clamp the phone. Overall this is a great unit. Built very well, easy to use, and for a highly affordable pricepoint. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DWA8VE0GERTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HDLBJS#wasThisHelpful","R1DWA8VE0GERTQ","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd like to state that I received these headphones for review purposes from the manufacturer upfront. Upon accepting this item for review, I was not instructed to provide a 5-star or even a positive review - nor given any incentive for doing so. Ecandy was looking for honest, critical feedback of their new product so that consumers could get some input on a product that was new to the market. This review is written as if I paid full retail price for this item.That being said, I do believe these items deserve a full 5-star review. I have sampled and reviewed at least 30 bluetooth headsets. Thus far, my favorite pair is the LG Tones. These headphones have a very similar form factor and build quality to these Ecandy headphones, however, they cost 3-4 times as much. The Ecandy headphones, while costing about 20% as much as the more expensive LG headphones, are still about 80% as good as the big brand!SOUND QUALITYSound quality is decent. They get loud enough for my cycling rides, even when I have a lot of wind going through the wires and over my ears. Most headphones without a great seal are very hard to hear down these same hills but I haven't had many issues with the Ecandy. I'd say that these headphones have 'OK' sound quality across all ranges.BATTERY LIFEBattery life seems to be very close to the LG unit, but probably a bit less. It seems on average, the batteries in the Ecandy set last around 4-6 hours of heavy use (very loud music). They charge relatively quickly.BUILD QUALITYThis is the real major difference between the two sets. There is a distinct (lacking) difference in the build quality of the Ecandy set, but functionality wise, they are very close to same. For the price, I don't feel that this is worth deducting a star, as Ecandy had to save the consumer some money somewhere.EASE OF USE / CONNECTIVITYI had no issues getting these to turn on or connect to my Galaxy S5. Every time I turn these headphones on when in range of my cellphone (with BT radio turned on) they connect automatically and are ready for playing music. This is extremely convenient for exercise. I use them a lot at the gym, and cycling. I recently took them on a cycling ride in the sweltering heat (90-95 degrees) where I rode over 60 miles in one sitting. Needless to say, I sweated on them a lot and they continued to work throughout the day without issue. When I got home, I wiped them off, and they still worked fine! Very durable and somewhat waterproof, it seems!Overall these are a great headset if you're on a budget. For 1/4 the price of the LG unit, I think they're definitely worth getting and are a quality item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NLQAQ0MITDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8T546O#wasThisHelpful","R23NLQAQ0MITDI","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this selfie stick to replace one that I got wet by accident. Apparently, they are not all waterproof!Anyways, I am very happy with this stick as it has many features that are greatly improved over the previous brand.Connecting and reconnecting was a breeze - I wonder if the other reviewers had some issues that are related to their phone's bluetooth or got units that were new in production? I just turned mine on and my phone picked it up - I hit connect, and it stays connected. It turns off after about 5 minutes of inactivity. When I turn it back on, it connects to my phone right away (granted my phone is in range and has the BT radio on).I love the clamping mechanism on this selfie stick. It's very easy to use (fool-proof installation and operation) yet grips almost any phone on the market safely and securely. The photos of someone using it sky diving may be a bit far fetched, but I'd think that the wind would rip the entire selfie stick from your hands before the phone comes out, as it is held pretty snugly. But not to worry, there is also a lanyard to really step up the safety!Another issue with my other selfie stick is that the grooves that extended were not very laterally stable (that is, the entire pole was able to twist and the phone would follow) this one uses much more precise tracks on the rails and the stick itself is not able to twist much at all. This makes taking photos and just generally using the stick much more solid feeling and easier.Lastly, I can really appreciate how well this unit folds down. My old unit extended to about 6 feet but only collapsed down to about 1 foot. This one extends quite far, but also collapses down into 6-8"" that I can easily stow away in my back pocket.Overall a great unit that I'd easily recommend to anyone looking for a very portable, easy to use selfie stick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5OLZI48075S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010USN9Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5OLZI48075S","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these Lightning cables for charging my iPhone and iPad as I really liked my other BAXIA products and thought the design of these was much nicer than the stock Apple and other brands. Not only that, but the cables are far less expensive (no idea why lightning cables cost so much).Best yet, they are APPLE MFi Certified, which means that they are not just some cheap knockoff and are up to par with speed and performance of the original Apple cable. Each cable has a smart chip that communicates with the device directly to provide the proper power supply and communication. If a cable isn't Apple MFi Certified, you can't be sure that it won't damage your phone as it is just a 'dumb' cable and will provide whatever specifications to ALL phones and will not adapt to each phone or accessory.I have had an awesome experience in testing - these cables are able to charge my iPhone and iPad just as fast as the OEM cable, and they look better as well as are cheaper! They're a great length and are durable and tangle-proof.Not much else to say - These are quality cables at an excellent price. I'd recommend them and have purchased a second set as a gift for a buddy at work that has been wanting mine ever since I started using them for my company iPhone at work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9XN48NNH7QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFLEXC4#wasThisHelpful","R2J9XN48NNH7QB","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these headphones because I was tired of all of my various other headphones. I am a big fan of bluetooth headphones and wireless technology in general. If I can cut the cord without sacrificing any quality realistically, then I will always do it!That being said, these are some great headphones and you won't notice much difference in quality with these being wireless, and especially not for the very low price. Like other reviewers have stated, these have some great volume, are easy to connect to, and have some decent sound output for the price. There are many other builds on the market that you'll see that are very similar to these, but Syllable makes a quality product and I've been very happy with it.These have become my 'daily drivers' for exercising: Trips to the gym for lifting, running, and cycling outdoors have been made much more pleasant with these. They get plenty loud enough even in a noisy gym or with lots of wind on the bike. They have plenty enough battery life to last me even the longest of bike rides.My favorite feature about these versus many of my other wireless bluetooth pairs is that they have in-line controls rather than controls on the earbuds. This is much more pleasant, as pushing buttons that drive the buds into your ears when you want to change a song is not pleasant. The ability to press them right on the wire between the earbuds (on your neck if setup like I prefer) is not only easier, but far more comfortable and responsive.Fit has also been excellent. A problem for me with many pairs of earbuds is that they just can't seem to fit properly. If you have any fit issues with these out of the box, I'd advise trying bigger ear tips. Most people try to use tips that are too small since they're easier to insert, but you generally get a better 'seal' if you use the bigger size. The included ear cages make them extremely secure even in sports that require a lot of motion and where you can become sweaty.While on topic of 'seal', these do provide an excellent seal for me once I found the combination that works best for my ear shape & size. With the included tips, most external sound is isolated even when playing music through the ear buds on very low volume. It also gives incredibly deep, powerful bass - So I can't advise enough to make sure you that you have the optimal fit before coming to a conclusion on the sound quality of these buds!Overall these are a great unit. You can't go wrong for the value and functionality at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMBP0D6DE80I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWM3J62#wasThisHelpful","RZMBP0D6DE80I","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the latest MPOW Swift headphones having already owned several other pairs of MPOW headphones. I love bluetooth headphones and trying the latest products. I have established a relationship with MPOW's marketing team just because of how impressed with their products I am. I could have gotten these headphones for free but decided to purchase them anyways.My absolute favorite pair of bluetooth headphones under 50.00 is the original MPOW Swift (they used to only come in Black & Green). You'll see that several other sellers out there use a very similar hardware build to the MPOW Swift, but MPOW does it best. I have tried very similar products from several competing brands, but there always seems to be something lacking. Either they include some cheap rubber ear tips that aren't comfortable, they don't get loud enough, or there are issues with the bluetooth constantly disconnecting. NONE of those issues apply to these latest MPOW Swift headphones.VOLUME:Plenty loud enough, I can even hear over my lawnmower. I generally only have to keep these tuned to 75% at MOST even while cycling into the wind. The seal with the included buds is more than enough for me. The better the seal you can get, the deeper the bass will be and the less volume is required, so a good fit is imperative.FIT:The included tips in the MPOW branded headphones are just always so perfect for me. In one of my MPOW headphone reviews, you will even see me hanging a hammer from the headphone cord with the buds still firmly in my ears (extreme). I never have any issues with these coming out of my ears nor being uncomfortable. That being said, many people like to use buds that are entirely too small because they go into the ear easier and deeper. If you have any issues I'd recommend trying to go up at least one size in the ear buds as the seal is generally better, and once you get used to them they fit better as well.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:No issues connecting nor staying connected to these headphones. All around easy - just connect once and then every time you turn them on in proximity of your phone (with your phone's BT radio on), you will be all set and they'll connect automatically!BATTERY LIFE:Battery life is very consistent - about 5-6 hours almost every time for me. I generally just charge them twice a week if I am doing a lot of cycling, but these have a great battery life for how lightweight they are. Don't let other brands that advertise 10+ hours fool you - those are often either way off, or you will only get those numbers if the phone is very close to the buds and you're playing at minimal volume. MPOW's specifications are realistic and accurate.Overall these are great headphones and I recommend them to all of my friends that are seeking some quality bluetooth headphones at a great price. Most of my friends that run and cycle always come back to me telling me that these are some of the best headphones they've ever owned!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQUTLU541AYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129X0IRK#wasThisHelpful","R1CQUTLU541AYW","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this mirror because I was sick of peeking over my shoulder to see where other riders were behind me, or to check for cars when I was riding in traffic. It's often more dangerous to look for traffic behind you than it is to just ignore them and hug the curb. This is because when you look over your left shoulder, you often accidentally lose your line of pace and veer out into traffic. If you look over your shoulder and notice a car is there, you may end up hitting it!That is why I bought this mirror. I wanted to eliminate the need to keep doing those hard shoulder checks, but didn't care for many of the bike-mounted mirrors available as they seem a bit tacky and require you to take your eyes off the road to look at them.This mirror attached to my glasses easily and securely, and now I don't have to take my eyes off the road to see what's behind me, nor do I have to turn my shoulders/body and put myself at risk of riding into potholes/traffic. Best of all, I don't have to make my bike look super goofy with mirrors sticking out of it! If I'm just trail riding, I don't have to bring this mirror with me as it easily detaches from my glasses, but I've found that I've become so used to it that I want to always ride with it. It makes rides with the wife easier as I don't have to keep seeing how far she is behind me. It makes spotting cyclists that are gaining on me on the trail easier, even, and allows me to attack sooner!Overall this is a great product with easy installation and excellent quality that makes my riding not only easier, but safer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLQT8CEV7EHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXQXNF2#wasThisHelpful","RJLQT8CEV7EHT","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to state up front that I did, in fact, receive this item for review purposes from G4Free, The manufacturer. I was not required nor given incentive for providing a 5-star or even a positive review. I was asked to provide critical feedback that may benefit their consumers, as it was a new product and consumers like to hear honest feedback.That being said, this review is written from the perception that I have paid full retail myself. I can honestly attest that this is a 5-star item! It's so good, in fact, that while I didn't think it would be great, it has replaced my on-frame bike pump on my road bike! I had an aluminum misc brand pump that I stumbled upon after looking at several in stores. I had always liked it, but the G4Free mini bike pump is better!BUILD QUALITYThe build quality is top notch. The pictures do it no justice. This is not a cheap plastic pump that breaks after a few uses. I have been using it a while and I can already tell it's a device that's built strong to last long. Excellent seals, smooth pump action, easy to use.EASE OF USEVery easy to install on my bike (you attach it via the water bottle brazes - you can still have a water bottle on the same slots!). In a matter of minutes it's mounted, and it only takes about a second to securely clip it on or clip it off. The included shrader/presta valve stem adapter makes it very easy to switch between the two and you can inflate virtually any bike tire with it.PRESSUREI had to make a separate sub category for this - So many bike pumps you buy will only go up to 70-100 PSI, which is not enough for many road bike tires (100 PSI may be, but you'd be pushing the upper limits of the pump each and every time). With the G4Free mini bike pump going up to 130 maximum PSI, you can inflate just about any tire out there! Unfortunately, there is no gauge (would not expect in this price range), but this also helps cut down on weight, and generally it's quite easy to tell where you're at pressure wise by the resistance of pushing in the air, and by physically checking the tire. It's definitely enough to inflate a tire after a flat.Appearance is also great. It goes great with the bare aluminum/black/red setup on my Cannondale, but I'd imagine it would go well with most color schemes as they are pretty neutral colors and design.This is a great pump. Like I said it has replaced a pump that I shopped heavily for and was for years my favorite. Excellent product from a great company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQTYWJR00E93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHFDFRU#wasThisHelpful","R1BQTYWJR00E93","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this bag to carry camping supplies with the occasional need to move around or pack up camp. I've also found it to be very handy for my fishing trips down to the local lake, where I can pack up everything into the bag and be quite mobile while not limiting myself to only part of my supplies, as 40L is a massive capacity!Upon receiving I was very impressed with the quality of the backpack for the price. The materials appear to be very strong and well-built. The zippers do not snag, and the pockets hold tight. The bag has some 'structure' to it, so that it doesn't wilt even if you don't fill it in its entire massive 40L capacity.I'm able to carry several tackle boxes, 2 collapsible fishing poles, several extra reels, live bait, a blanket, a collapsible tripod chair, and 2 water bottles into this backpack without much struggle. I could probably fit even more if I needed to. This is perfect as I can pack this up, drive down to within half a mile of the lake, and hike to the lake with the pack on. No more multiple trips and no more struggling to carry all of the gear in both hands. It also makes it a breeze to pick up and move to another section of the lake when I'm not having much luck.All in all I couldn't ask for a better backpack, especially for the price. I personally made this into a fishing backpack, but it would be great for day backpacking/hiking trips, camping, and various other uses. Built with quality, I figure this bag will last me several years if not indefinitely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AW8YQEJKW39Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113NTVTS#wasThisHelpful","R1AW8YQEJKW39Z","A203D1OS77Q9HV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203D1OS77Q9HV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first experience with a shapewear garment.  The Flexees brand is familiar because of the panties, so thought this would be interesting to try as a camisole for the cooler weather, with the added bonus of smoothing out those pesky back bulges around my midsection.  It fits snug, but not super tight.  The fabric is really weird, feels rubbery, but not uncomfortable.  The Smoother, as it is called, is finished around the armholes and neckline with the fabric folded over, and the bottom is unfinished.  I like that it can be worn either scoop neck or V-neck. There is some flattening of the breasts, but personally I don't mind, as it is comfortable to wear.  It does ride up a little around the hips but that was expected because my waist is smaller and this type of fabric would naturally want to return to it's original size!  All in all, I like this Smoother and will plan to wear it under a blouse or shirt for extra warmth when needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1YXZ82TGSYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZBPX3I#wasThisHelpful","RR1YXZ82TGSYE","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cross-cut shredder that has the unique feature of compacting!  So when this thing is getting full of shred, which is a lot of ""fluff"", you simply unlock the clips at either end of the motor unit.  The motor unit becomes the compactor, you simply push it down, as it rests on four spring loaded supports.  No mess no fuss----It will hold at least twice the volume before it is full.We do a moderate amount of shredding, mostly old bank statements, invoices and credit card statements.  Anything with account numbers and any personal information.  The Sentinel is very well built, handles several sheets at one time with no strain at all.  I did run an old back-up CD through the machine, with no strain it chunked it up very well.  Has many features like overheat warning light, reverse switch and, naturally, an on-off switch.  For our household use this is just perfect, completely satisfied with the performance, the ability to pack it around with the handle and the ability to compact----it holds a lot!

"This is the first butter bell that we have ever used that is actually the shape of a cube of butter.  The one that this will replace is an Emile Henry that we bought long ago, you must really soften the butter and smooch it up into the bell....the Butter Bay is so much more convenient---no smooching required.  It keeps the butter soft enough to use anytime, yet not too soft.  We keep it where we spend most of our meal time, so for morning toast, the mashed potatoes at dinner it is ready!  This is a high quality product, have not seen one better; even the Emile Henry which was quite expensive, made in France and has been around for years!  Butter Bay I think you have outdone the French at their own game!For those who have never used a butter keeper or butter-bell this is the one I would recommend!

"After using this product I find that it is not quite up to the hype!What I do like is that it is very quiet and that it has an amply long power cord.  The filters are washable and very easy to get to.  Emptying the dirt is a simple push of a button over the trash can.For me to use this as a hand vac is a stretch---it is much more heavy and bulky, than say a Dustbuster.  I think for an older person it would be out of the question.  Using it on the carpet is not quite as convenient as a regular upright!----Remember the bulk of the weight rests in your hand as the entire unit is at the top at the handle.  It will not stand up on its own, either you have to lean it up against something or just lay it on the floor---so when the phone rings it becomes just a tad of inconvenience.  Bissell does include a mountable hanger that must be screwed into a wall----and I just am very cautious about putting holes in the wall. It is not cyclonic, the very fine dirt clogs the final filter not even making it to the dirt cup.  Picking up cat litter would be course enough not to do the clogging thing.The power brush head has its own motor and is has plenty of power, that's a good thing! but it cannot be turned on and off.  There is a hard floor head that has a dust pad attached, something like a dry Swifter head; that works fine.  Also comes with the usual crevice tool, a dusting attachment, as well as the two large floor heads etc.  Changing the vacuum heads, from the power bristle to the hard floor is a bit challenging.  The whole unit must be lifted to a counter top or you will have to do it on the floor....I suppose that's not a big deal.  I can see removing the extension to use this say as an upholstery vac on the couch and chairs would be helpful, but most uprights with a hose would do the same thing, without having to remove the extension tube and change the configuration of the whole thing.  So here we have this unit with a lot of stuff to store in the closet, the two large cleaning heads, the extension wand and all of the other attachments and then having to lean it up against the wall--- it's a tad much for me!  As you can see I just am not too enthusiastic, but that's just me.  I know a lot of others will find this product to be very helpful doing routine house cleaning---we are all a bit different.UPDATE:Forgot to mention several other things that I did like.  The floor heads are articulating, really easy to get around furniture.  Easy to get it really low, like for under the bed.  Now, I think I'm done!  Just want to be fair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33UWEZ21YI1F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142VVAPQ#wasThisHelpful","R33UWEZ21YI1F6","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fuji Apples, Raspberries, Fruit Pectin and Apple Juice Concentrate are the only ingredients in Fruit Clusters.  No sugar or preservatives!  These are a very unusual snack as they are very light, something like eating a cheese ball----the texture is about the same, and they munch down to almost nothing.  The product is freeze dried, that is why they are so light.  I notice a slight sour taste, but not bad at all.

"First, I think it is important to state that contrary to past reviews the one tablespoon measures exactly one tablespoon.  Possibly a batch of inaccurate ones got on the boat!  Whatever the problem some experienced it has been corrected.These are heavy duty, probably the last set you will ever buy!

"I had my first experience with Nori (seaweed) while on a stay in Japan.  An unusual experience for my taste buds.  I found it to be rather interesting and unusual as I had never had it before.  First came across Annie Chun's at a local market where I was able to buy Seaweed Crisps.  I really enjoy these as a snack and the crispy texture pushes these over the edge.  I think for a lot of us Westerners Nori is a bit of an acquired taste as we are unfamiliar with it---unless at a Sushi bar.  I have offered this snack to friends.  a few liked them as several we're not too enthusiastic.  Taste is rather subjective and these are different from our usual snacks.  The Nori itself is just a very thin layer over the crisp cracker.  Everyone should try it at least just once!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEBLIV8I4FNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBGKJV6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEBLIV8I4FNT","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Replacing an old el-cheapo kitchen faucet with was nothing less than pure pleasure!  This unit is a very heavy high quality product that is solid and looks great on the sink.  My sink has four holes, the old faucet took one for the water valve handle one for the dishwasher anti-syphon, one for the faucet and the last for a soap dispenser.....so now I have an extra hole, decided to use a plug but rather a lotion dispenser that looks the same as the soap dispenser....perfect!My frustration was getting under the sink and removing the old unit which had been there since day one.  After a bit of patience and persistence I got it out.  The Moen was a cupcake to install.  The water hoses are plenty long to reach the water valves, the spray hose simply snaps into place and attaches to the sprayer with a nut, allowing for easy removal to replace the screen filter which is behind the sprayer.  Everything is solid metal except for the sprayer end which is made of a high-quality plastic......that makes the sprayer lighter weight and very comfortable to use.  The rise of the faucet is plenty high for rinsing dishes and larger items.  A push control on the underside of the sprayer allows for either stream or spray, rinse dishes or get a pot of water---perfect.There is great satisfaction for me when a do it yourself project turns out so well, no plumber required for this one.  This thing looks great and the quality is beyond my expectations----that is Moen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222W5CYON015K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPVJY8M#wasThisHelpful","R222W5CYON015K","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a combination of carpet and ceramic tile floors an upright just doesn't hack it all the time.  This is the first non-upright we have owned in a long time.  The last was a monster that was a real pain till we just gave up.  This vacuum is very compact, light weight with ample attachments for any use.  It comes with an upholstery brush, a crevice tool, a hard floor head along with a carpet head with rotating brushes.  One big advantage this has over an upright is in the articulating wand, it goes almost flat against the floor,  allowing easy peazy  cleaning under the bed and other close to the floor furniture.  The suction is superior!  I did notice that on carpet it is a tad hard to push the head back and forth because of the suction strength---I find that to be a good thing.Emptying the canister is rather straight forward and simple, and it will pick up more that I would imagine, doing a great job on both carpet and the hard surface floors.  Another great feature is the self retracting cord, just one push of the button and away it goes!  The footprint is rather small compared to other units I have seen, allowing for easy storage.  A handle at the user end of the wand is very comfortable during use.  This is a well made sturdy unit, the wand is solid, easy to extend and retract.  It would be hard to expect more from a vacuum than this!  Extremely pleased, I would recommend the Bissell Hard Floor Expert to anyone!NOTE:  In my review I noted that it was a tad difficult to push the head on the carpet.  There was a reason, I was using the rotating brush head----that was designed for use on the bare floors not carpet.  I replaced with the correct head and the thing pushes smooth as silk-----oh, dumb me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204KEFIJ1OTO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OORUCW#wasThisHelpful","R204KEFIJ1OTO8","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looks great in the yard and certainly adds a splash of color.  Putting this together is a tad problematic, it almost takes the hands of two people.  The hub assembly which holds the spin rod is in two pieces, and must be snapped together over the rod---not exactly an easy job.  We did get the thing put together after a few unkind words.  It would have been much more user friendly if the manufacturer had pre-bent the blades---that takes quite a bit of time!  The hub assembly is quite flimsy, there is a notch on the shaft that the hub assembly will fit only one way. no mention in the instructions.  Assembly is doable but a rather convoluted process.

"This arrived at a perfect time!  I was taking a break from doing a bit of work under the hood of my car in the garage.  Anyone who does such work knows that a good light is required.  Thinking this would be a perfect time to try out the Oasity Lamp I inserted the included batteries and headed back to my project.  It has a very substantial clamp to hold it in place. Looking for a place to attach and getting a tad frustrated, I saw that has two built in magnets!  What could be better for under the hold, it's mountable anywhere!  The lamp is amply bright, the twelve inch goose neck makes it possible to focus the light exactly where it is needed.....I love it.  I know this was designed primarily for the Bar B Que, but what the heck, it's so perfect for the garage.  Beings as this was new to us,  we had the perfect excuse to fire up the Q in the evening,  We had been using the patio lights, which are indirect fixtures and have good spread but not that bright.  I clamped this to a handle and fired off for a dinner steak.  Again, the gooseneck is handy, put the light exactly where it works best.  This makes the BBQ so much easier to see what is happening!  Yes, it is bright.  I do appreciate the quality too---very impressive.

"This is replacing a KitchenAid blender that we have had for quite some time.  It cost quite a bit more than the Black & Decker and has served us well.  Blenders are quite the hot thing now with the Ninja, those $500 machines that will turn out hot soup---we've all seen the infomercials.  Anyway I can honestly compare this to what we previously used.  KA 4.8 amps, B&D 9.4 amps....the Black and Decker has a much larger blending container along with a Personal Blending jar which is great for a single smoothie.  We put both on the kitchen counter filled each with the same amount of ice and water and let them rip!  No contest, the B&D tore the KA a new one. Much, much faster, pulverized the ice (the KA still had chunks), the B&D was more quiet, you would enjoy the show!Auto function is handy, simply press ""auto"" all lights flash, press the number of the function you want. Soup is no.1, smoothies no.5 It stops at just the right time.There is one recipe from the included booklet that we made last night using the Auto function.  It is delicious and great for very warm summer evening here in AZ.  Chilled Spicy Gazpacho Soup, simply put all of the ingredients in the blender use Auto 1 setting, and watch out!  The texture perfect, and one of the best tasting I have had in a long time, just toss on a few croutons. If you buy this thing be sure to try it.Everybody loves a good smoothie, using their own favorite ingredients.  This makes a great one, if ice is an ingredient for yours, you will find not one chunk like my KA.  A real smooth smoothie!  I gave this product five stars because of the major improvement over what we had, the comparative quiet, and how fast it does the job----by the way, another feature that's handy, built in cord storage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLAB2S60JG9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLNO#wasThisHelpful","R1DLAB2S60JG9A","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an older lady with very fair skin, who needs all the help she can get!  The idea of a ""healthy glow"" sounded very appealing!  So, I was thrilled to receive the Neutrogena Blush #10 Rosy (Rose is my usual color, different brand).  Included in the package: 2 other colors to try: #40 Bronzed, & #50 Luminous.  Of course, for my complexion, Rosy is just right!  I have tried the other shades, and my consensus is: I like the Luminous better that the darker Bronzed.  All three glide easily over my face and leave a silky feeling...I like that!  I think the Luminous may be used for highlighting purposes at the brow bone area above my eyes.  The Bronzed may be used when I require a slight darker blush under my cheekbones.  Anyway, I'm having FUN with the different colors!

"The gardeners call it ""caliche""---that is a soil condition that makes the dirt so hard you would think it's concrete.  At the time we first planted I could not get a shovel in the ground, I soaked and tried--nothing worked.  Finally we had to get some help, they used electric jack hammers to get into the soil.  Dig a large hold used plenty of planter mix and finally were able to get some vegetation.  Growing veggies is near impossible.  That is when we did our first raised bed garden, and it worked! We were extremely happy to get the Spacemaker Raised Bed.We assembled it yesterday without a hitch.  A rather simple job and with the two of us it took no time at all.  Went to a store and bought enough planter mix to fill this thing to the top, it took about 21 cu. feet.  We hooked it up to the watering system with flex spaghetti line and installed seven or eight adjustable drippers.We purchased the book ""Square Foot Gardener"", quite some time ago and find the contents most useful for maximizing a small space for gardening, in fact, I think Amazon carries the book.We have had great success with tomatoes, spinach, broccoli and swiss chard.

The fiber is 100% polyester and is very, very soft to the touch.  I realize that the fabric is not cotton and does not wash or dry like cotton---naturally polyester is much more reactive to heat.

"I just finished installing this showerhead a few hours ago.  It is very large 12X8"", the instillation was simple, plumbers tape included in packaging.  Solid build, rather on the heavy side and made of stainless steel.  Looks great, has a mirror finish and thankfully rubber nozzles---they are so easy to clean.

"Let me tell you why I find five stars appropriate for this item.  We live in Arizona where the Summer temps. often exceed 110 degrees and the winters can be a tad chilly.  The Summer electric bill, because of air conditioning, can be a bit on the high side or more than that.  My bill consistently has been more than I thought it should be and even compared with the neighbors (same size house).  After spending a bit of time figuring out the operation of the C2 and allowing it to charge, (had a bit of a problem getting the appropriate male plug adaptor to fit properly)---I went about checking different sources.  Easily locating appliances and lights etc., and just having a bit of fun getting used to the operation.  Scanning our living area I found a section of an outside wall that appeared different from the rest of the outside walls.  It was showing a higher temperature!  Later I found myself in the attic checking for leaks in the AC ductwork, and I did find one, where two sections of ductwork come together the sealing tape had come loose.  We were loosing a bit of AC to the attic, not that it was keeping it cool but still-----Was able to fix that myself!Now about the wall in the living area.  I called a local insulation company, they came out the next day and found the insulation between two studs completely missing!  They drilled several holes in the outside plaster and did the repair with some kind of foam and relieved me of a few bucks.  If I only had found that when we bought this place, would have saved a bunch.  Anyway, repair is done I'm a happy camper and hope my experience may be of some benefit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLOTQ77DPCER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9RANUC#wasThisHelpful","R2FLOTQ77DPCER","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Creative products since the late 90s when I first replaced my onboard audio with a Soundblaster Live. The sound difference was a night and day difference, and I couldn't believe what I had been missing.Here we are, more than 15 years later, and Creative is repeating history yet again. The Sound Blaster Roar 2 is my 4th bluetooth speaker - and trust me, I'm getting sick of these things piling up - but I have not been this impressed in quite awhile.Pairing the Bluetooth is simple, and only took a few seconds. Exactly how it should be. I don't understand how recent products always have such a hard time pairing with my phone, whether it be a car, tv, or other speakers. I almost always have problems.Once the Bluetooth is connected, the sound quality is phenomenal. You'll get a great mix of mids, highs and lows with zero distortion at the highest volume settings. Of course you'll likely not go near the highest volume settings (unless you're throwing a poolside party) because this little box is LOUD. I made the wise decision of testing the volume about 2 feet from my face.. my poor ears.If you're an audio purist, you'll want to connect via aux or a micro SD card for the extra fidelity. I personally think Bluetooth is fine, but we all know that one guy who is way into audiophilia.One of my favorite features, that has been absent in my other Bluetooth speakers, is the bass boost setting. Once you hit the Tera Bass, you can feel the Roar start shaking in your hands immediately. The sides of the Roar have plastic plates where the woofers are, and it's really cool to watch them. I'd imagine this may hurt the battery life a little bit, but you should be fine for the day.As expected, call quality is great when used as a speakerphone. I brought the Roar on a car trip, and didn't have any problems hearing or being heard over the road noise. I haven't had much of an opportunity to use the voice recorder, but the 10 second call I did happen to record sounded great. You'll want to have an SD card handy if that's a prominent feature for you.The Roar 2 is a great little speaker that I can't recommend enough. It has great battery life, terrific sound quality, and it looks flat-out cool (those moving woofer flaps - yum!). I'm starting to wonder where Bluetooth speakers can go from here... perhaps adding a small screen with Netflix support is the next step!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MSQLQHZGVX4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8O6MJO#wasThisHelpful","R1MSQLQHZGVX4J","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mat is being used for our two dogs that share a water bowl and kibble bowl, and it is just what I needed to keep things tidy.  I had been using a folded paper towel to catch the slopped water.  We have two mini schnauzers about 20 lbs each that sometimes make a watery mess or toss dry kibbles around the area. These bowls are for their ""anytime"" drinking or snacking.)  I was looking for something that would be slightly larger than the frame that holds the metal bowls. The Bone Dry mat is a nice size at 18x20"", and made of a soft, cushy material.  It actually is microfiber, just like the one I use when setting pots and pans on the counter after washing.  Same thing: does an excellent job soaking up excess water, is cushy for keeping the bowls in their place, and it also has a non skid backing.  Have not needed to wash the mat yet, but will probably just hand wash and line dry...it's not that big.  The mat has a cute embroidered dog bone in one corner, probably for dogs, but I think this mat would be perfect also for cats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVM4IE4EBWXEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXPGYCU#wasThisHelpful","RVM4IE4EBWXEO","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On long flights, like ours, 15 hrs. from LAX to Melbourne, Australia our Dr. recommended compression legwear to prevent blood clotting.  We are up there in age so we rather take such things seriously.  These fit the bill perfectly, they come as a pair rather than some that only provide one at nearly the same price as these.  Rather easy to get on and off they fit the bill perfectly.  Very comfortable to wear and you can feel the excellent support.  They are not a fashion statement but do provide that which is necessary for us.  Excellent quality, and stretch ability.  Have been thinking it truly would be fun if they came in some hot colors---but, that is not why we got them.

"Okay, 5 Stars = I love it  My Mini Schnauzer Kaiser, absolutely LOVES his new blanket!  As soon as the box was opened he claimed it as his own!  He is like the cartoon character Linus, very attached to his blanket.  It is so very soft and plush, and for him, just the right size...36""x48"".  This was going to be placed on top of his bed for comfort, but he decided that he would drag it around, suck on it, and cozy up to it when needed.  The blanket is 100% Polyester, so it will be a breeze to wash.  The color is a pale bluish grey with a nice overall dog bone design in a navy/charcoal color.

"These are really good!  We got this box of 5 cheesecake bars today and tore into them right away.  Our favorite, caramel flavor was just to irresistible to let sit there for too long.  We decided to split the first one to do a ""taste test"", and we both came to the same conclusion....Yummy!  Now, these are supposed to be like a cheesecake in texture but we felt it was more a drier cake-y texture.  I guess it depends on whose cheesecake is the most familiar to you. The bars are soft and delicate.  Anyway, the graham cracker taste/texture was the most noticeable, then cheesecake flavor, following with the gooey caramel and salt.  Each bar has 10g of sugar, and 130mg of salt/sodium...hoping for a lesser amount.  There is not a lot of Fiber in these - 5g, but every little bit helps.  We would buy these for a tasty and filling snack,... and a delicious substitute for real cheesecake that has a lot more calories!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSA2T7XASXDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLSZAYG#wasThisHelpful","R1DSA2T7XASXDC","A3IR834T7AROBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IR834T7AROBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Spicy Chili led me to think this would really be spicy and hot----they are not.  Rather, there is just a slight hint of chili which adds a very nice layer of flavor to the bars.  We live in Arizona, it was 110 yesterday when they arrived in our mailbox, needless to say they were a tad gooey.  Put them in the fridge for a short period of time and all is well.  Naturally I couldn't wait to try one, it was very good and left a smear of dark chocolate on my face.These are a great snack item when you feel the need for something in the stomach!  Much more rewarding than a candy bar---has lots of good stuff that gives instant gratification.  I have had my fair share of junk food snacks, I seem to get the same satisfaction with these knowing they are just a lot better.

"We live on a street that is lined with Sissoo Trees, it has a very invasive root system.  New growth will come up from the roots and it is very hard to control.  The best method is to dig up the roots, which is a royal pain! I let a patch of these ""new"" Sissoo come up to try Ortho Max on.  I did a very generous spray, the next day I saw nothing that would indicate the product was working, thought I would at least there would be some indication.....not until three days later did I notice that the product was working.  So, it's not quite as fast as other products that I have used but seems to be working very well.  Wish that I could give a long term report as to how this works over the months, for now, it seems to be quite a good product for removing woody plants.  My experience indicates that along with the spray a tad of patience is required.Updated:Now that several more days have passed I can say the Sissoo is toast!----The product that I was using would knock everything down, it would turn brown, but at the same time new growth would appear.

"Used these for the first time yesterday.  Took a bit of time to get used to the feel, didn't take long to realize how good they felt.  No seams is one reason the other is the compression.  They are snug, but really feel good.  Very light, made of nylon and spandex with moisture wicking and an anti-order property.  So, I took a few laps around the neighborhood only to realize that I wish I had a pair sooner.  The no-slip cuff fits well over the ankle and does hold the socks in place very well.  I wear an 11 1/2 shoe and the size large did it for me.

"For years I have been using a trimmer with a fifty foot extension cord, which time after time has proven to be a real pain.  The extension cord itself makes me nuts!  Yesterday I was able to try this for the first time!---What a difference.  Started out by mounting the charger in the garage, plugged it in and waited for a full charge, there is an indicator showing how ""full"" the battery is.  The mount allows for hanging the whole unit while charging or just the battery.  Handy to have a place to store the trimmer.The head rotates for vertical or horizontal trimming, just like my old electric, this is a tad easier as you don't have to mess with a cord.  Anyway, I went to work, nailed the grass under several plants and around a tree then did the edging at the sidewalk....it did a great job.  Not having to deal with an extension cord made the job so much faster and with no frustration.I had it in the back of my head that cordless trimmers were wimpy and would need to be charged before the job was done-----wrong!  This thing has plenty of juice to do my yard, and it seems just as or more powerful than my old one---all without that nasty cord.  So impressed that I really want to try the Scotts blower that uses the same Lithium-Ion battery.  Yes, my blower uses the same unwieldy fifty foot orange cord that forever gets tangled up etc., etc.!  I am so pleased with this thing and the job that it does I'll never use my old one again!

"This being my first rechargeable toothbrush, I find it quite impressive.  Seems to do an excellent job at brushing using sonic pulses, hard to reach places behind the teeth are no problem at all.  I especially like the size, not much larger than a regular toothbrush it is very comfortable to use.  The charging base  has a very small footprint, takes up very little space on the countertop.  With the color rings and the two included brush heads it would work well for two people.  I did the full charge thing before using have seen no loss of power at all.  Says it can go two weeks between charging, that seems generous. It lets you know when you have completed two minute brushing time, which is recommended!----have never timed before, so I find that very useful.  Right now I'm thinking that I will not go back to a regular toothbrush---ever!  My mouth really has a clean feeling when I am done, and that I do like.

"Jasper Scott's Dark Space has logically progressed from a thoughtful, far future space opera into a metaphysical sci-fi must read with this book 6.  The best sci-fi for me explores the meaning of man in the universe. Scott charts a stunningly complex long read in the domain of Heinlein and Clarke.  It's a massive scale story. At several points the reader is challenged to grasp moral right and wrong in an engrossing way. This 6th book might easily conclude the epic but the reader is left to wonder. Opportunities for prequels and sequels abound. It will be fun reading where ever Scott takes Dark Space.I give the whole a 5 star rating and this installment a 5+.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ONGBXIXJ8BGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PCBG9U#wasThisHelpful","R3ONGBXIXJ8BGV","A1JXRXYVSUAW6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JXRXYVSUAW6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This replaced a 7 year old same-as iteration that disintegrated to SoCal sunrot of the plastic tube. It was a great feeder with adjustable feeds for dispensing various sized seed lots.This version is substantially cost reduced. The feeding cups are stamped sheet metal vice the older aluminum castings. One of the stamped cups fell out (or the smart birds/squirrels figured it out) on the second refill  and dumping the seed load. Fortunately happening before the old cast cups went to the dump. Safety tip - make sure the cups have a solid top and bottom mating to the tube before use. The old cast cups are interchangeable and far more robust then the stamped cups.Could be a 5-star except for cost reduction engineers. It's been cost reduced for less value for money.This has been an excellent feeder design. The risk to its future will be determined by hyperactive cost reduction engineers. I believe the price is unchanged after 7 years but you are now getting a less robust feeder with material changes  lighter gauge plastic, lighter gauge metal, loosened tolerances.

"McGinnis ventures out of his genre in this one. It's a sort of ""Man From Uncle"" meets ""X-files"".

I mean everybodys walked into a Days Inn mote room  readers get it. You just dont need a 2 page of narrative replaying a couple times  especially when nothing is going on in the room. Am I to be surprised or shocked by a queen size bed? The story wraps up like a crash to meet wordcount.McGinnis asks for feedback at the end to seek reader interest for another installment. Heres mine. The premise and characters are good. Decide if a series is comedic satire or plot twisting mystery thriller. Tune down narrating the irrelevant mundane.

"There's not much ostentatious technical speculation here. FTL, no matter how its derived from theory simply transports folks a long way and very quickly. Ultimately, the reader just has to accept it to get any fun out of the telling. The storytellers skill is the central element here. The audience is young adults. The situations evolve in psychologically naive ways easily recalled by the reader. This recollection makes the story entertaining to any age reader.Some reviewers have related a lack of hard science backing the fiction. To a degree, the author sacrifices technical detail for a smooth narrative. However, the books basic premise is technically driven by technical speculation.

"An entertaining trilogy completesOh yes, there are interesting characters for Joe Abercrombie to build more sequels around and circumstances of  interest to build new adventures upon, but the action and premise of the Shattered Sea trilogy is wrapped up quite well in the now complete Shattered Sea Trilogy. Abercrombie succeeds with this 5-star trilogy.For those new to the Shattered Sea, this genre-type is now a straight through action entertainment read without the months long wait between installments  thats likely a special treat. Abercrombie develops the key characters, plot, subplots and theme across sagas installments. Those readers who have waited between installments begin with his typical Abercrombie story telling.Half a War begins with the introduction of new and compelling protagonist characters and thoroughly nasty antagonists. It takes about 50 pages or so for the time delayed installment reader to re-establish continuity with the whole. A complete trilogy reader will likely not note the confusion of injecting new characters and their subplots to the whole.At this pre-release point  At least one speculative notion about the whole is revealed and at least one of your favorite characters will get whacked. But, there are surprises aplenty along the way.The Shattered Sea, Half a War is a hit.

"Im always looking for a new BBQ sauce for the grilling season.Brand name, OTC BBQ sauces have been in a state stagnation for some seasons. I usually fast scan the ever growing BBQ sauce shelf at the grocery store and can recognize them from taste memory  spicy enough for me but nobody else, generic emulsified stuff that provides the appearance of BBQ sauce, combos that yield mediocrity, no more Teriyaki please! The more BBQ sauces that appear on the ever expanding BBQ grocery shelf  the greater the central tendency toward blando.This Minors Bourbon BBQ is an upgrade. First, its a new tasting light/sweet sauce out of the bottle. Second, it tastes more like a restaurant grade, specialty sauce. Third, its an excellent base for creating interesting combos with wasabi, peppers, juices, mayo, sour cream, etc. Fourth, the flavor balances and transitions from first sweet, then the bourbon barrel, that fades into an interesting BBQ sauce sensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NIT9FQLVKQVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFO7H2#wasThisHelpful","R3NIT9FQLVKQVW","A1JXRXYVSUAW6I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JXRXYVSUAW6I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product confuses me.  It's marketed as a nail biting and thumb sucking deterrent but the box says Base Coat as well.  The ingredients are supposedly horse chestnut(?) and marine algae.  There is little to no information other than that included on or in in the product box.  The Probelle website lists the ingredients as: butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, mek, isopropyl alcohol, adipic acid/neopentyl glycol/trimellitic anhydride copolymer, silica, denatonium benzoate, tocopheryl acetate, benzophenone-3, propylene glycol, helianthus annuus seed oil, aqua, ascophyllum nodosum extract, yellow 5 lake ci 19140, calcium pantothenate, retinyl palmitate, urtica dioica extract, aesculus hippocastanum seed extract (horse extract), magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ferric ammonium ferrocyanide, tocopherolI am not sure which of the above ingredients are the marine algae without looking up every single ingredient.  The hippocastanum is the horse chestnut and I only know that because I looked up horse chestnut.As you can see, the first two ingredients are alcohol based so even if there are no DBP, Toluene, and Formaldehydes the odor is pretty chemically overpowering.  I suggest you use in well-ventilated room or even outside.This is a base coat essentially but because you would be buying it to serve as a nail biting deterrent, you should use it as a top coat to be applied twice a week.  Fully dried the taste is disgusting so it is gonna work for me everytime I go to bite a part of my nail. The ingredient list alone is enough to keep my nails out of my mouth even if the product didn't taste so gross.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXU9GM0ZTD626/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N14I4Y6#wasThisHelpful","RXU9GM0ZTD626","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great alternative to a backyard pool.  Works on flat lawn surface or a sloped one.  Blows up easily with an air pump (not supplied).I think some people don't understand how to fill these things with air properly and they don't understand the way to get the water flowing in it.  There is a trick to it and the first trick is to just not overfill with air or too much of a water flow.  Also, don't let the kids jump on it or body slam it!At 18' long this really isn't going to appeal to anyone older than a 5 year old.  The dual sides aren't really wide enough to accommodate a true 2 person race.  The water pool at the end doesn't really collect much water, it serves as more of a bumper/stopper.I like this for my 2 year old grandson and his little friends.

"This baby play mat is one of the best designs of this kind I have seen.  The flexibility of use alone is impressive.The mat itself is a little thin but the other features make up for that.  You can use it as just a plain mat to lay baby on to keep the little one off of carpet fibers or fold up the sides with velcro and attach the toy crosspiece for visual stimulation and/or play activity.There are plenty of loops on that mat and crosspiece to attach the included toys and add your own.  I like that fact that the music provider is an elephant that can attach where you want it instead of being built into a stationary place on the crosspiece like on some play mats.The mat itself is machine washable (I suggest non-agitator machine wash only) and the crosspiece is easily damp cloth wipeable.The mat folds in half and the crosspiece dissambles easily for quick storage/transport in the plastic velcro closed bag.This mat takes 3 AA batteries not included.Again, this is one of the most verstatile play mats I have seen and any new parent would be thrilled to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E65D80ZONT2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAUF0PK#wasThisHelpful","R1E65D80ZONT2F","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My grandson is always grabbing our phones to play with.  I got him his own play cellphone a few months ago but he is always losing it under my furniture, etc.  I figure this larger ""tablet"" might be easier to keep track of as well as be more interactive.The tablet measures 5"" x 7.5"".  It is fairly lightweight.  I think it should have some side handles to make it easier for little hands to hold. There is an on/off button located on the back of the tablet.  Batteries come installed.There are 3 learning levels with 2 different songs on each level that are accessed by pushing the musical note button in each level.  The songs are fairly short to match fairly short attention spans (mine, LOL).  This might just be the case with the one I received, but the play level switch is hard to move into the level one position.To me, the level 1 and level 2 activities are backwards.  Level one play consists of pushing the letter buttons to hear the word of the featured picture starting with each respective letter.  The S picture is a dog and confused me at first because it sounds like ""fish"" but I figured out that it was saying ""sis"" for the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn dog's sister.  What little toddler is going to know this?  Level two says the letter pushed and a second push says the word for the featured picture.  If you press the A once it says ""a"" and push it a second time it says ""apple"".  The next letter you push will say either the letter first or the picture depending on what was pushed last on the last letter.  I feel like level one should do what level 2 does and vice a versa.Level 3 sounds depicted are the actions the pictures would make when being used.  Like ""B"" has a ball picture and the sound is ""boing"" for a bouncing ball.  Some letter's pictures don't really make sense in level three.

"I don't know where to begin to express how much I detested this book.  I will try.  First of all, I am in my mid forties and I read quite a bit of literature for YR's.  Some of it is written really well and some of it is just crap like this offering by Neil Smith.  I found the entire book from the premise, to the characters, to the overall message to be so disturbing as an adult I can't believe it is being marketed to teens!  There is no way I would have let my daughter read this as a teenager and I never did censor what she read.This is a depressing tale about a 13 year old boy who dies suddenly at his school from a heart defect.  After his death he wakes up in a strange place called ""Town"" where he learns everyone who is there comes from America and died at 13 and stays 13 no matter how long you hang out in ""town"".  First of all, America?  Americans who die go to a place where ONLY other Americans are?  That was my very first problem with the story.  The overall premise is this boy telling the story of his experience in ""Town"" via correspondence he writes to his still living Agnostic parents.  I have no problem with the fact that his parents were Agnostic and raised their son the same way but I had a problem with during his correspondence to his parents he renames God as Zig so as to not offend his parents.  Well, if the boy was really trying to convey what it is like in his heavenly ""Town"" he would have just said ""God is here and he provides for us"".There is nothing exciting or funny about the story as suggested on the Amazon product page and the back of the book.  I couldn't wait to get through it so I could throw it in the trash.  The happenings in the story are depressing and to me seem dangerous for any teen that has depression issues to read as it might glorify heaven to them.I hope school libraries ban this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YO9CXQRXIPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417136X#wasThisHelpful","R22YO9CXQRXIPB","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can understand the appeal of this product to use as a rinse in lieu of brushing.  It is a little more expensive than some of its competitors and contains a lot more ingredients than the rinse I use on a regular basis (CloSys).  Yes, the ingredients are natural but I don't really like any product I am possibly ingesting to list ""proprietary blend of"" on its ingredient list because I don't know what that blend contains.  The natural ingredients are also a bit suspect because I really never see them used in a mouthwash.  The ingredients as listed on the bottle label in order are as follows:Purified water, Sorbitol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, PVP, OXYD-8 (proprietary blend of C102), Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Avena Sativa (oat) Kernel Extract, Allantoin, Glycerin (from vegetable sources), Sodum Citrate, Xylitol, Polysorbate 20, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA-Copper, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Menthol, Citric Acid, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Benzoate.I am not sure why the Chamomile is highlighted on the front label when the product contains more Aloe than Chamomile.  Those allergic to Chamomile should be aware however that there is a good amount of that.The sorbitol and xylitol give this a funky aftertaste and I really don't know why the product has to be blue.  The rinse I regularly use has not sugar or sugar substitutes and is flavorless.  I add my own mint extract from time to time to that one.While I was happy to try this rinse, I think I am going to stick with CloSys.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1256S1C2I13GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN04SY0#wasThisHelpful","R1256S1C2I13GJ","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never liked the alcohol burning sensation of more mainstream mouthwashes.  I am a regular user of CloSys which uses Chlorine Dioxide as its main active ingredient (the one that serves as bacteria control).  I was happy to use and review Therabreath Plus as it too doesn't use alcohol but its main ingredient is Oxyd 8 (a proprietary blend of sodium chlorite) along with a pretty extensive list of other ingredients.  The ingredients listed on TheraBreath's Amazon product page does not include all the ingredients in this mouthwash.  Here is the list of ingredients found on the actual TheraBreath Plus bottle:Aqua, Sorbitol, PEG-12, OXYD-8, Zinc Gluconate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Xylitol, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Camillia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree Oil), Menthol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Citrate, Polysorbate 20.The inclusion of sorbitol and xylitol give this mouthwash a funky aftertaste.  One or more of the ingredients leave an undesirable coating on the tongue.  It does seem to leave your mouth clean however.The Therabreath costs a little more than some of its competitors.

"I eat flour tortillas exclusively over corn tortillas.  These are perfect for a family dinner or as a vehicle for a taco (or any kind of salad) for lunch.

For regular tacos I like them soft out of the package.  These can be used also as one would use pita (pocket) bread.  My daughter looked at the shape and suggested they would be good for desserts like a banana split or ice cream sundae.  I agreed so I made a sugar and cinnamon sprinkle mix (I use the raw sugar), brushed some butter on the inside and outside of the tortilla shell, sprinkled on the sugar mix and baked in my toaster oven.

"I am a big fan of the Fisher-Price baby swings over any of the other brands.  I find they are the easiest to assemble, are the most sturdy and have the most useful features.  I had this one but with the monkey theme and I used it as long as I could with my grandson.  When he grew out of it my daughter and SIL swore they weren't going to have any more kids so I sold it.  You guessed ittwo months later daughter announced she was pregnant again.  So, of course I was thrilled to get another one.  I like this one even better because it comes with a cradling insert for the newborns or small babies.There is nothing bad I can say about this swing except something I wished it had after experience with the last one I owned.  It would be great if they came with a remote control.  There were many times with my first one grandson swinging that I would have liked to control the song volume and swing intensity without having to get up and possibly make noise.  He always seemed to sense whenever I was a foot away no matter how quiet I was!The color and patterns are gender neutral and will blend with any home decor.  Keep in mind that the swing base IS rather large and will take up quite a bit of landscape.  It's worth it though.

"I have hardwood flooring throughout my house and I used to have a few throw rugs here and there.  After a year of having to vigorously vacuum those rugs on a daily basis due to the two furry dogs and cat, I had it and threw them away.  Since then I haven't felt like my furniture asthetic was really tied together and I also miss the rugs since my grandson has started walking and consequently falling.I know the Stainmaster name from regular carpeting but I had not realized they made area rugs as well.  The 5x8 size is perfect for so many room situations.  I am using this one in the center of my living room seating arrangement to once again tie it all together.The Navy background color is neutral and goes with the beige sofa set and the chain pattern is more of a light cream instead of a true white.  I haven't noticed any color discrepancies in either the navy coloring or the pattern color.  The edges of the rug are serged well and evenly.  The built in ""no slip"" backing is great because when the animals get wild and chase each other the rug isn't getting moved around like the other rugs I had.I had the rug down for three days before evaluating in order to allow pet fur to accumulate.  Since the pile on the rug is pretty tight, the fur didn't get all entwined in it and vacuuming was very easy.  Cat throw up also cleaned up easily.  This is definitely a pet and kid friendly area rug.  If I had known about this brand of rug earlier I certainly would have bought several for the home.

"This set is another version of many of T.S. Shure's magnetic doll and clothing sets.  Made in China like the others, it has the same fairly weak magnet backings on the body pieces and clothing.As far as being anatomically correct, they sort of are.  There are male and female genitalia pieces included but I honestly don't think any young child is going to know what they are looking at.  This is definitely a play set that needs to be played with adult supervision so the adult can explain the different internal and external parts.There are some pieces of clothing that represent a doctor's coat so I guess the one doll can play doctor and examine the patient doll.  LOL.The set comes in the same thin plastic bag with plastic snaps as many of the T.S. Shure sets.This isn't a bad idea for a toy but I just doubt the validity of it really being a learning tool.

"This girl doll and clothing set is a good size for little hands.  They are thick enough that the kiddos would have a hard time bending and breaking them.  Like the other T.S. Shure play sets, this one is made in China.  I, like other parents and grandparents, do have concerns regarding the paints and magnets used in China but honestly, it is just so difficult finding toys that aren't made in China.I have a toddler table that features a magnetic chalk paint board so I was disappointed that the backs of the dolls aren't magnetized.  The dolls don't come with stands either like another popular brand.  The magnet strength is a little on the weak side so if the dolls are played with in hand and shaken, etc, the clothing will fall off.  If you kids are impatient and you know they are going to get frustrated by that then look for the play sets that have clothes that velcro on (or modify this set with velcro) instead.I like the handy storage/carry bag that makes it easy to pack up the set and take to grandma's or to a friend sleepover although I don't see it lasting more than a month or so before tearing.Overall, this is a reasonably priced set for all the pieces you get.

My one complaint is that the plastic slide-on lid already cracked and broke on the corner while sliding it on so just perhaps be sure to assist the little ones when they are putting it back on.I think this set would be fine for a boy to play with since they are bears (I don't believe in limiting toy play to gender specific toys though).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYG6UXB088E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I64DYU#wasThisHelpful","RQYG6UXB088E5","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Older lady living alone.  I have felt secure in my house for the past 16 years but the neighborhood is changing regarding car and home break-ins.  I am on a fixed income and can't afford to have a security system installed and pay for monthly service.  These door and window alarms from Sabre seemed like the perfect solution.This is a very small alarm.  It is smaller than the dimensions the Amazon specs provide.

I really wouldn't call the one sound a ""chime"" because there is nothing pleasant about it.  There is no volume control on this alarm.The door and window alarm requires 4 LR44 batteries (included).  I hope they last awhile because those batteries can be expensive to replace.I am very happy with this alarm so far.

"I have always been a Crest girl and have used pretty much all varieties (except for the one that had those little plastic beads in it).  I use the Crest Whitening strips twice a week but really like the idea of a daily maintenance routine.Step one is your basic toothpaste.  The consistency of Step 1 is nice and smooth.  I don't care for ""grainy"" pastes.  Step 2 is the whitening agent which is mainly hydrogen peroxide and carbomer.  Step 2 definitely leaves a polished feel, especially with using my rotary electric toothbrush.Some folks might not have the time (or want to take the time) to brush their teeth in two separate steps.

"I haven't been a big fan of canned olives and still am not.  They just taste like the can to me.  I don't understand why, if Kalamata olives can be packed in glass jars then why can't black olives?The Mario brand is the only brand I could find a Low Sodium version.  Amazon is the only place I could find them (I tried 4 different national supermarket chains).  They are fine to cook with or add to salads but one of my previous food guilty pleasures was to just eat them out of the can.  I can't do that with this low sodium version unless I soak them in a vinager herb brine (no salt of course).The olives themselves are uniform in size, color and texture so that is good.  I would give them 5 stars if they didn't have that aluminum can taste that is more obvious without the salt.  I don't understand why the manufacturers can't impart SOME kind of low sodum flavor though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GL6KYJC5IVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CC9I35Q#wasThisHelpful","R26GL6KYJC5IVI","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchasaed the Gund Peek-a-Boo Elmo for my grandson a few months ago and he loves it so I knew he would like this one.  He became fascinated with Elmo at 6 months old (he is now 13 months) and I think I have purchased every Elmo made since then.This Elmo is the same compact size as the Gund Peek-a-Boo one but this one feels plushier to me. His on switch is on the bottom of his foot and is fairly easy to push without effort. He reads 5 different nursery rhymes from his ""book"" and follows along with head movements.  Like any of the animatronic doll toys, if your baby likes to grab the mouth and pull on it he can break the mechanics of it.The recommended minimum age for this toy is 18 months but if your child is more mature like my grandson then I think it would be fine.If your child is an Elmo fanatic this Gund version is a must have.  He would make a good companion to the Gund Peek-a-Boo Elmo as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQTIK7Q3SAV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOSSXDG#wasThisHelpful","R1KQTIK7Q3SAV0","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is the perfect set to get your family away from all those ""virtual"" family games!  As the name of the product suggests, this set is for game playing first and foremost.  The fact that they convert to regular tables for me is just an added convenience.Our family loves cornhole (bean bag toss) and we had one for over 15 years that my father-in-law made for us one Christmas.  That finally fell apart from being left out in the elements.  It will be interesting to see how this poly one holds up.  As soon as they arrived we pulled them out of the box and carried them outside.  We didn't care that it was a brisk 39 degrees out, we wanted to play!  Set up is super easy.  We played the cornhole first and it was a bit different from the wooden one we had due to the slick poly surface.  Figuring out the learning curve (so to speak) made it more fun though.  Next we played the ladder golf game.  I have never seen a commercial version of this before.  I first saw this game on Jimmy Fallon's Late Night show and I thought the show had made it up and built one specially!  This game takes some practice!  I would suggest that the minimum age to play this should be 8-10 depending on how reckless your child is.After playing the games we turned them over to use the table functions.  There isn't really a large surface area for major crafting but I can see 3 or 4 little kids sitting around them doing outside crafts and then hosing down the tables after!  My daughter and son-in-law looked at the circles and the table height and said ""Hey,we could play Quarters or Beer Pong!""  So they got the Solo cups and arranged them in each circle instead of the tradtional cup positions for those games and had a great time in freezing weather (those crazy kids).Folded up, the tables are very easy to carry--the handle straps look pretty sturdy but I can see those wearing out first if left out in the elements.I am very happy with this game set and look forward to the backyard get togethers this Summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QOJ2F4LD1T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQC0NGS#wasThisHelpful","R4QOJ2F4LD1T1","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pulling the Frigidaire Aroma Fresh-50 out of the box, I was relieved to see that it wasn't overly huge. Standing at about 10"" H x 6.5"" W, it is smaller than the average personal humidifier so you won't need to clear much space for it.  With its black, glossy finish it does appear a bit utilitarian.  I would prefer a brown or faux woodgrain finish.Getting started is easy.  The Frigidaire Aroma Fresh-50 has a little compartment in the front that holds a 2"" wide scent pad.  This pad comes clean so that you can choose your own essential oil scent.  I tried to find here at Amazon as well as Frigidaire's website (as suggested in the manual) the replacement pads and filters, to no avail.  I guess one would have to call the 800 customer service number to get that exact information.  As an alternative to replacing the scent pad, I plan on using pieces of felt fabric I have lying around to change out my scents (I don't see why makeup remover cotton pads cut to size wouldn't work as well).  I also plan on vacuuming the filters themselves often to extend their life.Before plugging in and starting the air cleaner, lay the cleaner on its side and push down on the little tabs to remove the bottom panel.  This took me a bit of effort.  Remove the plastic wrap on the filter.  Snap the bottom back on.  Place the air cleaner on a stable area that allows good air circulation around the sides and front of cleaner.The fan operates with a simple dial that features a soft green operation light.  To turn off the fan just turn the dial back to on til it clicks off.  The fan is very quiet.  I guess noise level is subjective but I find it really quiet and wouldn't even mind it louder because I am one of those people who sleep better with some white noise going on.The scent (I used lavendar oil from Bath & Body Works) lasted quite awhile throughout the night (only used one small drop).I have two furry Papillons who sleep with me and I really felt like I needed something to freshen and clean the air I try to breathe at night!  This small tabletop unit just might be what I need.  Although the Frigidaire Aroma Fresh-50 only cleans about 50 feet of surrounding air that is really all I needed it to clean at night.  It would be a good choice for an office cubicle setting where your cubicle neighbors are not always considerate of the odors they exude with their cologne, nail polish or weird lunches they eat at their desks.I would give it 5 stars but it only gets 4 because of the fact that I have to work to find the information regarding obtaining replacement filters.  That information should be included in the manual (other than the part number they provided) and I should easily find it on the Frigidaire or Electrolux (Electrolux has owned Frigidaire since 1986) website(s).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8XCYZU4HR6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBJ8PB8#wasThisHelpful","R3D8XCYZU4HR6A","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tried these on my grandson (1 year old) because the poor kid has some eczema issues.  We don't use the wipes on him if we are just changing a urine diaper because we don't think extra moisture needs to be on his skin and then covered up with a diaper.  These wipes are just the right amount of moisture for those who DO choose to use on all diaper changes as well as for messy ones.  I personally think this shorter size is fine as I often only use half of the longer competitor brands so I feel like there is less way waste here.They don't come in their own plastic pop out container but I managed to stuff 2 packs into an extra deep Pampers brand box I had leftover.I don't flush them and I don't put them in my compost pile.  Their claim of being compostable makes me feel a little bit better about putting them in the landfill along with the diapers that are NOT compostable.  There is a slight fragrance which smells completely natural.  It smells like the Chamomile to me.I am not sure where these are actually manufactured.

It smoothed my facial skin nicely so I didn't need to use a foundation primer like I usually do.This is the first time I have heard of the Scalisi line.

"After trying Passport to Organics' Charcoal Magic Cleanser, I was thrilled to try the Turmeric Cleanser.  I recenty have been diagnosed with a medical condition that causes external and internal inflammation.  I have done a lot of research for natural remedies to reduce the inflammation.  Cherries, Ginger, Lemon, and various other natural foods are all good but the most promising was Turmeric!  So, I have been drinking a Turmeric Lemon Ginger tea I make myself for over a month now and the inflammation has been greatly reduced.The idea of Turmeric in a facial cleanser just makes sense for me.  Like Passport to Organics' other fine products in their line, the Turmeric cleanser comes in an attractive bottle with the same easy pump dispenser.I start by removing my eye makeup with coconut oil (I don't like petrolatum products).  Then thoroughly wet my face and neck (don't forget your necks ladies!) with warm water.  I then apply the Turmeric cleanser with my fingers and gently massage face in circular motions.  Word of Caution:  Avoid your eye area.  This product does have quite a bit of Turmeric in it and it is powerful.  Don't burn your eyes.  Rinse thoroughly and pat area dry.  Be sure to wash your hands with regular soap afterwards.I love the tingly feeling it leaves on my skin.  Tingly without a dry feeling.  I use this cleanser primarily in the morning because it acts as a stimulant and wakes me up even before that first cup of coffee.I am very impressed with not only this Turmeric Cleanser but with the entire Passport to Organics line.

"I have been going through erratic post menopausal face breakouts that are taking me back emotionally to my teen years.  I have tried normal drug store brands that claim that the salicylic acid ingredient in them is the way to go.  The results of those ranged from giving me dry, leathery skin to no result at all.So, having the opportunity to try Charcoal Magic by Passport to Organics I was intrigued.  Reading the ingredients list (Aloe is the very first ingredient instead of water in most cleansers), I felt like I could eat this stuff in addition to cleaning my face with it.  All the ingredients are natural and organic.The cleanser comes in an attractive bottle with an easy push down pump spout.  The cleanser consistency is a little more liquidy than I would have guessed but that allows it to be applied nice and smoothly on your pre-moistened skin.  I just rub the cleanser gently in a circular motion all around my face (but I have used my spin exfoliating brush with it as well with good results) and then rinse.  There was a hint of tingling after drying but that made me feel like my pores all got nice and cleaned out of the acne causing junk.  There IS a different ""herby, earthy kind of fragrance that I kind of like but others might find it offensive.  I prefer that over some over perfumed, chemical fragrance.I normally always HAVE to use a moisturizer at night with most other cleansers.  After pat drying my face, I couldn't believe how smooth it felt.  I had no need to use a moisturizer before bed!  The next morning I expected to awaken with some dryness but there wasn't any.  Within two days of using this cleanser night and morning, my blemish areas were almost gone.I am pretty picky about what I use on my skin.  If I can't recognize the ingredients then I tend to shy away.  I am also one to state in reviews if I don't care for the product and why, even if I get to try the products out at no cost to me.

"This is by far the most interesting coffee maker I have ever owned.  It has quite the unique look with its beaker type carafe, its rain shower water distribution and the sleekness and height of the machine itself.  At about 14 1/2"" tall, it fits fine under my cabinets.Before you buy, you really want to consider your coffee making needs.  If you are an ""I need hot coffee now"" kind of person, then this isn't for you.  I am a person who likes to make iced coffee in the Spring and Summer so brewing a carafe of this ""concentrate"" lasts me all day.  I simply add ice and creamer to make my own (less expensive!) Starbuck versions of iced coffee.  Making hot coffee is simple enough if you are patient.  You will need to heat water using a different source and then mix that water with the amount of concentrate to achieve the coffee strength you prefer.  I suppose one could drink the coffee straight out of the carafe without diluting with water, but that would be more of a Turkish coffee and would probably put hair on your chest.I like to use this cold brew maker for iced tea.  I buy the large family size tea bags and brew the same way as the coffee.  If tastes even better than brewing the tea in a Sun Tea Jar (and much quicker!).The only thing I am not so crazy about is the cleanup.  Since there is no paper filter holding the coffee grounds, dumping them out in the trash and rinsing the coffee chamber mesh filter and filter cup can be a little messy.All in all I like this brew system very much.  I am not sure I would make it the ONLY coffee maker I have in the house and I would like to see a lid top over the Rainmaker in order to keep dust etc, out of it between uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWGXYHEUCMB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVSVM36#wasThisHelpful","RGWGXYHEUCMB1","A27Q1X75QCWTID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27Q1X75QCWTID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I was widowed a couple of years ago, I have really been paring down the tool/equipment collection in my late husband's work area in our garage.  I have been keeping the tools I deemed basic and necessary in a medium sized toolbox but I am getting tired of digging through the toolbox looking for just the right tool.These baskets are just the thing to get my stuff organized.  They attach easily to the pegboard back of my workbench.  If you have installed your pegboard correctly, with the proper spacing between it and the wall, you should have no problem attaching.  If not, then the wire pegs can be bent easily to accommodate your board placement.I am using the large basket for tape measure, stud finder, staple gun, drill bit case, etc.  I attached little ""s"" rings to the bottom of basket to hold bags of nails, screws, bolts and staples.  The medium basket is holding a variety of tapes and gorilla glue.  The smallest basket fits screw drivers and punches (placed face down with handle up inside basket).I love now being able to go into the garage when I need something and can see exactly what it is I am looking for without any effort.

"Nope...not the same pens we all knew and loved years ago. Sad, but true. However, the ink is similar. The big plus is the fantastic array of colors these are now available in. As a self-described writing instrument freak, I love this box of 36 Tropical Vacation Colors. Just like the ones of old, these lay down color in a neat, thin line. They are like a thin version of the best markers you can think of. My handwriting tends to be on the larger side and I love to add doodles and flourishes to my notes. Whether those notes are a To Do list, a permission slip for the kids, or a page in my journal...it doesn't matter. Doodles and tiny drawings just kind of show up on things - and thanks to Flair pens, the doodles, writing, whatever, always turn out colorful and cute.With their smooth ink, these write beautifully. There is no drag, no scratching, no pen ""pooping"". The colors are bright and vivid, making it fun to read whatever is written with them. I use them for everything from grocery lists to art projects and scrapbooking. They are acid free, which is important in art. Most of the pens I buy are acid free - I don't want to find pens I love to use and then have to remember to keep them far away from my studio. The water based ink dries quickly. So quickly it's highly unlikely you will smear the ink just by writing or drawing with it. I appreciate that this set includes every Flair color there is - and I LOVE that there are 26 medium tips and 8 ultra fine tips. This is especially helpful when you use these as a sort of letter highlighter, which is one of my favorite ways to use these. Rather than using a thick highlighter to draw attention to an entire word, if you are creating decorative lettering these are impressive to add color to ""plain"" (or one-color) letters, for example. Their thin line is perfect to make each letter stroke stand out in an interesting, uncommon way.Whether you use these to create the base of your letters or sketch - or you prefer to use these to add detail and decorative embellishments to your writing, I'm confident you will adore these. Although I know there are some differences between this version and the ""original"" version from years ago, I'm just as happy with these little color monsters as I was with their predecessors. I don't plan on switching over to a totally different pen any time soon. I like these little guys and will keep using them for as long as they produce fine points in so many colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30I4M7TIMKIWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJBUJE#wasThisHelpful","R30I4M7TIMKIWA","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I accidentally purchased 1/2"" tape the first time, not realizing that little 1/4"" makes a difference, but that tiny bit makes an enormous difference! I love this tape width - it's nice and wide and works really well for everything from hanging notes on the door to wrapping presents. I've used countless other clear tapes and they just don't compare to Scotch. I'm guessing that's where the catch-all term ""Scotch Tape"" comes from. This disappears magically on the surface - just another guess, but I'm thinking that's why it's called ""Magic Tape"". ;) The tape is clear once adhered, but it becomes difficult to detect once you quickly rub a finger over it. It also doesn't show when copied with one of those excitin' newfangled copy machines. The adhesive is nice and sticky - and can even be gently peeled from some papers and surfaces to be re-stuck to something else! It is the exact opposite of those cheap, cellophane-like, shiny, slippery, skinny tapes. You can also write on this tape. How could it get any better??This is my very favorite tape...EVER.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3JB5KZSI9S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DH8HT#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3JB5KZSI9S3","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Colorful Thumb Gel Ink Pens. Basically there are six tall pens constructed from rubber. At one end is the pen, the other end has a cartoonish hand - all in different positions. Each hand has a little black face located on the palm or on the fingers. There is a cap that fits onto the pen over the writing tip.You can see most of my review in the picture I attached, which was written with the pens. It will give you an idea of how the pens write - they aren't bad, but they do skip and ""poop"". I cannot stand pens that poop. That is THE quickest way for a pen to land in my ""crappy pen basket"". (Haha Altho unintentional, that's kind of funny that the ""poopy"" pens go in the ""crappy"" basket. Sorry.) The other issue I have a hard time getting over is the thickness of the pen barrel where I hold it to write. The length of the pen is basically soft and rubbery...except for the part where the ink must go up in the arm (?) of the pen. Right above the writing tip is a hard, thick, plastic piece - and it's very uncomfortable to write with. Yes, I understand these pens aren't for extended daily writing - I view them as more of a novelty. That said, if a pen is going to make it around here, even as a novelty item, it must be somewhat useful. Would I write an essay with this pen? No. Address holiday cards? No. Write a quick message in a birthday card to someone? Probably not. Sign for a package? Yeah, probably - if the pen was handy.The blue pen was DOA. Also, once you remove the caps from the pens, they never quite go back on correctly. (See photos.)These kind of remind me of pens a doctor's office would keep at the front desk for people to use to sign it...but that's about the extent of their function. If this was the pen I was handed to fill out paperwork, I would request a different pen. (That plastic part digs into the top knuckle of my middle finger, making it sore pretty quickly.) It was momentarily fun to twist the pen into different shapes - I can see how it would be easy to absent mindedly play with them while on the phone. The top half is easy to bend, and just as easy to straighten back out. The lower half of the pen, although not filled with ink, won't bend. (That is why only the tops of the pens are bent in my photo.) The photo of the red pen shows where the pen becomes hard and unyielding.It is due to those reasons that I gave the stars 4 stars. If it was solely based on writing performance and ink, I would rate these a 2.5.I am a total pen and marker FANATIC. I own more pens than is probably legal in most states. Most likely more than many countries have within their borders. I can't help it. It's an illness. I've had it my entire life - it's chronic, but thankfully not terminal. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SKUJLO0RMML5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSFE5JC#wasThisHelpful","R2SKUJLO0RMML5","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've fed my dogs Blue Buffalo for years. There has been some rhetoric about Blue Buffalo in general - some of which has caused me to seek out other foods for my little guys - but we always wind up returning to it. It's the only food I know they will eat. This Adult Small Breed is no exception. The dogs usually don't like the LifeSource Bits - I find them scattered on the floor around their food dish. Until this flavor. I don't know what's up with these LifeSource Bits versus the LifeSource Bits in the other flavors, but these VANISH. I think I have found one - and that was because it had rolled under the water bowl and they probably couldn't reach it.My teacup Chihuahua had Parvo as a pup. When I adopted her from the shelter no one mentioned she required a high protein diet because of this - and I had no idea. I found out, after feeding her a regular diet for awhile - that if she doesn't have the high protein, she vomits blood. Over and over - usually until we wind up at the animal ER. Some fluids and medications calm her system, but the high protein food seems to quell the problem altogether. Blue Buffalo is the brand the 3 of them like best of all the high protein foods we've tried...except the home-cooked high protein food. (Of course!) My vet has warned me about the nutritional deficiencies home-cooked food has long term, even if you are adding egg shell, etc for calcium and following other little tricks. I feel better about feeding them a good food that has been scientifically proven to be nutritionally sound.The small kibble is easy for tiny breeds to chew and I haven't seen any negative effects from this food. As long as their is a need for high protein food - they like the taste of this - and it keeps them healthy, this is our dog food of choice. If anything changes, I will update this review, but this will be in my little one's bowls until then. I don't mind spending the extra to know that they aren't eating ""crap"".

"I'm a Venus fan. I prefer the Venus razor much more than any other razor on the market. I've been using the razor since it's public release in 2001 - my favorites are the Original Venus, Venus Divine and the Venus Embrace. I remember raving about it to my friends way back then, describing it like ""shaving with a pillow attached to the razor"" - it's that comfortable. I would know - my legs are sensitive, my bikini area is beyond sensitive, and I hate to shave. HATE IT. I have been known to do just about anything to avoid shaving, including trying the old EpiLady in 1990. (I shudder when thinking about that horrific experience!) Barring that one experience, I prefer just about any hair removal method short of shaving - waxing, buffing (which doesn't really work - but I still prefer treating my legs like a piece of wood to shaving!), even laser hair removal. The Venus razor toned down my razor despise...well, more than anything else has.I bought this version liking the small size - it seemed easy to travel with, especially with the included blue, transparent, hard, plastic case. And it is. However - I don't care for how the razor feels in my hand. Especially when shaving my pits. The way it sits in my hand is awkward and I usually wind up with at least one cut from it. (This from someone who has been shaving for about 30 years and could easily navigate a razor in the dark.) It's better when I use it on my legs...but who is going to use two razors?? Not this gal! Since it is interchangeable with other Venus and Mach3 blades, it's easy to replace the blade with whatever Venus blade you prefer. (Or to share the small size with your man and his Mach3 blades, but I don't know a man alive who would choose this over a full sized razor. The traveling convenience is just not worth the handling discomfort.) I am giving it to my daughter to see if she prefers this compact hair slicer. I'll stick to the full size Venus handle, thanks.PS - If you have trouble with razor burn or folliculitis, I have had great success with Venus razors and the pink Skintimate Shave GEL. I don't know why, but I know it's kept razor burn at bay for me, since I started using the two together. Changing razors (or blades, to be more specific) results in the painful folliculitis bumps coming back. Changing shaving gel brings back the same problems. I had folliculitis for years - it was so bad I had a prescription for topical erythromycin ever since I began shaving at 13. It was painful and probably ""at the root"" (haha) of why I detest shaving. However, those issues disappear when I use a Venus razor and the pink Skintimate Gel. I don't know what it is about the gel, but it works better than the cream. I'm serious. If you struggle with stuff like that, try it!On a tangent...Shaving just seems like a waste of time - I have long legs and it takes me a good 10-15 min to shave them. For what? So they can be stubbly the very next day and I can repeat the time-wasting, painful experience?? Ugh! I had gone with Dollar Shave Club once...BAD idea! Their stuff doesn't even remotely compare to the awesomeness of the Venus. It was like shaving with my grand dad's razor from the '70s! (Yes, like using his razor from the 1970s. A 40-ish year old razor blade. Unfortunately.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJGFWSEEI7AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5H5Z1O#wasThisHelpful","R3JJGFWSEEI7AH","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great little button batteries - they fit the flameless candles I bought them for. Mine arrived in the blister pack. I have used 3 of these - they don't seem to last quite as long as the original batteries that came with the candles, but they aren't bad. I get about 17 days of use out of them, using the candles on a 4 hour timer at night. They were inserted into the battery compartments in the candles when it snowed one night - and I forgot to grab the candles to bring them in. The next day I noticed the batteries did leave a little rust on the candles, but once they were dry the batteries worked just fine again. I was pretty impressed! (The rust wasn't bad at all - I say that as more of an informational piece for you to have, than as a complaint. I can't see it on my votive candles when they are displayed, so no harm, no foul.)At the rate of almost 2 batteries per month, per candle, I can tell I'm going to become very good friends with this seller. Since the batteries arrived quickly, are individually packaged, and are a decent price in comparison to similar batteries, I guess there are worse things that could happen.

"I like using this much better than vellum or other tracing papers I've tried - it has a surface that is much better to work on. At least with ink. I find I have issues with the ink skipping on vellum, and pencil lead smears terribly by the time I'm done with other tracing paper, but that is not the case with this. The Huion Tracing Paper accepts Pigma Micron ink writes like a dream! This is also cheaper - it's almost like getting double for your money. At about $0.08/sheet, it's a pretty good deal, as most tracing paper comes in pads of 50 sheets for a similar price. It fits the L4S light box perfectly and the clear plastic envelope it comes in works perfectly to keep the paper clean. I slid a piece of cardboard in the back of the sleeve for a little more support - just to make sure it doesn't bend or curl. So easy to see through - with or without the light box. I will definitely order more when this package runs out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XU315T9EWS9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KZJTAK#wasThisHelpful","R2XU315T9EWS9P","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very cute towel! It dries my dog quickly - and the towel itself dries pretty fast.

"It's quite possible I live under a rock, but I don't know who Karim Rashid is, so that obviously didn't influence my decision to purchase this tape dispenser. What did? The little ""hood"" portion. I've had several regular tape dispensers over the years, but before I get to the end of the tape roll, I always wind up with dog hair and dust all over the tape. It seems to happen every single time. I thought this design may help to prevent that issue - and it does! I am totally thrilled with this dispenser - it looks nice, it's sleek and compact, you can pull and cut the tape with one hand, and even though the bottom is weighted, the dispenser itself is pretty lightweight. It should last forever, which is good - since I don't plan on parting with my furry roommates (and can't get away from dust).

"I have thick hair and have always had to use conditioner after shampoo if I wanted to be able to get a brush through my hair. It's gotten better as I've cut my hair shorter, but without conditioner my hair has no shine or luster. And so it's been for 35ish years - whether I use cheap shampoo (Pantene, Herbal Essences, Aussie) or salon brands (Redkin, Biolage, Matrix). I've chosen to stick predominantly with cheap shampoos - if I'm going to get results so similar the gal who has cut my hair for about six years can't tell which one I'm using, why shell out the extra funds?Enter Bed Head. Ok - well, not all Bed Head - some haven't played well with my hair. (Short, color treated over graying, from stick straight my entire life to curly/frizzy over the last two or so years.

Leaves my hair soft and shiny, but not ""too"" soft - it has body. It's easy to brush. I like running my hands through it (until I add all the product.) It smells pretty good.

Few things irritate me more than sellers misrepresenting their products. I will continue to use this shampoo, but I won't buy it from this seller again. The ""free shipping"" and the speed at which this conditioner arrived is nice. I always struggle with whether to deduct stars - or how many - if the seller screws up, versus the actual product. It isn't fair to ding the product for a seller's mistake - but all they need to do was put a photo of the actual bottle they are selling on there, and not make it appear to buyers that they would get more for their money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLACDUYZL0T6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450LEX8#wasThisHelpful","R2CLACDUYZL0T6","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sharpie is synonymous with rockin' markers. The wide variety of tips, combined with Sharpies amazing ink, produces some of the best loved markers ever invented. From metal to glass, fabric to paper, Sharpies are the go-to marker many people reach for when they need permanent ink. This has become especially true since Sharpie expanded their color line around 2002 - so there are now approximately 67 colors, 5 neon colors, and 3 metallics. That is a pretty enormous color expansion since the inception of the plain black in 1964. Sharpie has done their best to make sure they offer just about every pen style one could want - the regular thin barrel (ultra fine), the fine tip that has a slightly thicker (but very smooth) barrel, retractable, twin tip, super, mini, and the list goes on. There are also several different tips you can choose, depending on the width of the line desired...ultra fine, chisel, fine, and now BRUSH! (Please note that I will not touch on all the various ""types"" of markers offered by Sharpie in this review, but it is helpful to keep in mind that Sharpie is available in tons of forms - highlighters, markers, wax pencils, pens, paint pens and markers, industrial....and the list goes on. There is even a stainless steel version!)As a self-proclaimed pen freak, I was anxious to try Sharpies brush tip markers - I have a range of brush tip-type pens or markers, whatever term you want to use. Prismacolor, Marvy Uchida, Sargent Art, Tombow, Posca, Faber-Castell...the list goes on. And on. And on some more. Brush tips are not my favorite tips to use, but I do find they hold an important place in my art. For example, I would much rather use a brush marker (on most projects) than to drag out the paint and a paintbrush - many times it's possible to get similar results from a brush marker. I also like the interesting strokes you can get from brush tips, so I occasionally use them in my writing. Of course, some are better for writing purposes than others. The tips that don't spring back are a pain, as are the brush nibs that have a single stray hair, and the ones that release way too much ink.I haven't found Sharpie markers to have the issues that other markers have, no matter what tip I'm using. Their brush-tip is nice and tight - none of the sections of the nib hang loose or stick out, leaving stray marks. When writing, the tip ""bounces"" back to its original shape (after pushing it on paper to write) - and I found this to be true no matter how long I wrote with each one. I have noticed that if I color with pretty good pressure (so I'm utilizing the wider part of the tip), the tip does slightly degrade over time. I also enjoyed the resistance these offer - sorry, I can't think of another name for it. I like how they stay nice and thin at the tip, making it perfect for getting into small, detailed spaces. The beauty of brush tips - especially Sharpies - is that with a small pressure change of the hand, the overall look is completely different. I love that one marker can go from a thin tip, to a much thicker tip - all depending on how hard you press. I have noticed that many ""cheap"" brushes don't bounce back very well or very quickly once you've used them for a little while. Although the Sharpie brand falls into an affordable category, it performs much better than some higher priced markers - totally slays most brush tips (dare I say markers in general?) that fall into similar - and lower - price points.The ink these brush tips lay down is just as luscious and bold as it is with other Sharpie markers. This ink is fadeproof and ""water-resistant"", although in my brain I tend to think of them as ""waterproof"", since something like rain (or other small, quick exposures to water) hasn't ever affected my Sharpie-created projects. I'm not suggesting you dunk your newly created, favorite Sharpie masterpiece in a bathtub of water, but it's good to know that if you have to run to the car in a downpour - and you have your Sharpie creation in hand - it won't be ruined. I can't promise the same for the paper you used (wrinkles and buckles), but the ink should be alright.With the twelve pack you get a nice variety of colors, from the original basic colors to a few of the brighter colors - you will be hard pressed to notice you need a color that isn't included. (""Where's the Techno Blue color?"" isn't likely to cross your mind. That said, including a lighter/brighter purple - in line with the lime and turquoise hues - would have significantly increased my color-love for this set.) The only thing I don't care for about the ink? The tips of lighter colors can sometimes pick up the darker colors used first. The ink in these brush-tips dries just as fast as the ink in the other Sharpie pen/marker varieties, but that doesn't always stop the color-pick-up I referenced a sentence ago. (This seems to be more of an issue on plastics than it does on paper, but I have encountered this issue on paper, as well.) When the tip picks up another color everything gets muddy - and many times you don't realize the other color has attached itself until you've placed the tip back on your project, and the muddy color makes a sudden streak - which causes me to shriek! That's never a good feeling, so it's one thing I watch out for when changing colors. (Checking becomes habit once you've ruined something you've spent hours creating.)I have noticed these seem to feather, or bleed, more than some of the more expensive brands do. (For example, compared to Prismacolor brush tips, I find the Sharpie brush tips bleeds noticeably more.) Very absorbent papers make this issue worse, so I would use a paper that contains a sizable amount of sizing. (Haha) These brush tips work awesomely well with the ""Color Me"" line of coloring books. They also work well on the mixed media paper I use (Strathmore) and a joy to use on watercolor paper, although depending on the fibers of the paper will, again, dictate the amount of feathering.Overall, I like these brush tip markers. They maintain the same level of quality we've all come to expect from Sharpie. HOWEVER, I believe it's important to remember the limitations of Sharpies - they are not created to be fine art markers. Without even thinking about it, I tend to abuse my Sharpies more than my fine brush tip markers. It totally isn't a conscious thing - I guess I'm just used to grabbing a Sharpie for so many different applications that these are no different. Using a light pressure, these are acceptable to write with and can create some awesome details, lines, flourishes, etc on the letters you draw. There are so many applications for these, bbbuuuutttt I won't be getting rid of my other Sharpie pens - with any nib - in favor of these. These have an important place in my art repertoire, but they won't/don't replace either my fine brush tip markers, or my other Sharpies. I will use these a lot while creating things I normally use Sharpies for (which is just about anything!) - they provide a totally different line than is possible with any of the other Sharpie tips.Are these as great as Sharpies typically are? Yes. The ink is just as bright, bold, and brilliant. It's fun (and useful) to use one pen to make fine and wide lines just by varying your hand pressure - which is something you just can't do with a fine marker. Even a chisel tip won't produce similar results. If you like Sharpies and appreciate brush tip markers, you will undoubtedly love these. If you are looking for a brush nib to create fine art, I would most likely skip these and head for a ""fine art"" marker. For everyday use? These ROCK! For drawing interesting designs on fabric? These are a WINNER! For creating detailed compositions on paper intended for fine art? I'd definitely do a test first to check feathering. I'm glad I have these and think the price I paid was very fair - 12 markers for around $13 is hard to beat, especially when free shipping is included.I didn't mean for this to be so long, but I told you...I am a pen/marker FIEND! If there is anything I didn't cover, or you have any additional questions, I am happy to answer them. Just leave a comment and I will respond quickly. Thanks for reading - I hope this helped you make an informed decision about the Sharpie Brush-Tip Permanent Markers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKTJ8VJN7YRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006W0HQ54#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKTJ8VJN7YRP","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great idea! I'm so sick of trying to leave notes for myself all over the place, but constantly losing them and never remembering what the note said in the first place. Yes, I can put stuff in my phone - but I'm one of the ""old schoolers"". Since I grew up with pen and paper, then spent my early adulthood writing everything down in Day Planners...so writing reminders, notes, and To Do lists is just much more natural for me. It's faster for me to just write it - and actually seeing the reminder sitting in front of me (rather than being hidden on my phone in some app) reminds me that I need to do/get/buy/pick up/etc whatever it is.This is such a great idea - it's one of those ""why didn't I think of that"" kind of things. These make infinite more sense than trying to use sticky notes on your purse or car. Now I can loop one of these around my steering wheel to remind me to give the kids lunch money - instead of writing it on a Post-It, which falls down on the floor, I don't see it, forget to give the kids lunch money, the school calls - mad (for the second time that week!) and I worry that I'm a horrible mother because I send my children off to school so they can starve. So in a round-about way, these nifty new Post-It Reminder Tags are making me a better parent, which will allow my children to grow up and be more productive, responsible, nutritionally balanced citizens. WOW - who knew these were awesome enough to (possibly) change our world's future??So you better buy yours now, before everyone finds out about these and the rush hits. If you don't, you'll be one of ""those"" parents, who has one of ""those"" kids (""those"" kids always spring forth from ""those"" parents, ya know)...and just imagine what people will be saying about your grandchildren! <gasp> OR YOUR GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN!! Please...stop the horror altogether...just buy the Post-It Reminder Tags already! Oh - just so you know, they took FOREVER to get here...twelve days.

"I had never worked with this stuff before, but it's really easy and fun to use while decorating for Halloween. You don't need much - a little goes a long way. That said, I purposely purchased this one because the title says ""Glow in the Dark Spider Webs"" - and this does NOT glow in the dark. At all. That was disappointing - had I known this wasn't glow in the dark I would have used the coupon I had to buy this at 50% off locally.

"This is just what I was looking for to wrap around a fat 6"" candle. The candle is ivory and looks pretty plain. I bought it to go in the largest of a three lantern set I bought. The candle is nice in the lantern, but I want beautiful. Especially since I'm thinking about/starting to decorate for the holidays. I purchased this ivory vanilla pip berry garland, and I purchased the burgundy version as well. I am going to intertwine them and then wrap them around the base of the candle. I am also going to add a few rusted jingle bells (in different sizes) to some thin wire, then wrap that around the ivory/burgundy pip berry bunch. It should create a beautiful holiday piece for the steps of my front porch - and with the LED (remote controlled!) candle I was able to find here on Amazon, I can set it each night - and forget it. (Just the kind of thing I like!)The pip berries on this garland are the perfect size for a project like this - and they are close enough together that there won't be gaping spaces of wrapped wire (that kind of resembles grapevine from a foot away) that is ""berry naked"". (That just totally cracked me up!) This arrives in a neat bundle, which definitely makes it easier to work with. One of my favorite things about this garland is the double berry design. Having two pips placed close together (instead of just one) makes an enormous difference in the perceived fullness of the garland. It is pretty lightweight - I can't imagine it would weigh anything down. The wire is thin enough to easily work with your fingers - no tools necessary. At the same time, it's thick enough to stay in the shape you bend it, and it has some depth to it. Please note that I doubt this will hold some intricate unsupported shape...but it's excellent for draping over a shelf, a curtain rod, wreath, around bottles or candles, as part of a centerpiece, etc. This could also be used as a regular home decoration (not just for holidays), and I am sure I will use it for my spring/Easter table. 18' is a good amount to work with, also.

"Very cute idea...not very good pens. I used to purchase pens like this, with the marbled ink, from Zebra. They weren't 100% perfect - occasionally the ink would skip and the pens required that you hold them in a specific way - but they were more than decent. They were good enough for me to purchase by the box, which I did on multiple occasions. When I saw these, I was stoked - finding the marbled ink again was like running into an old friend, I loved the diamond-shaped tip, and the faux diamond gem on the cap was cute. They arrived in great time and were in a fantastic package - the way I wish more pens were shipped. Not only was the plastic container great for shipping, but it would also work as a stand to store the pens. (I don't use things like that. As a pen freak, I store all my pens horizontally after checking to make sure they write upon arrival.) The first pen I tried was great from the first mark - the ink flowed well and the pen was easy to write with. It is vital to note that these pens aren't juicy at all - it has something to do with the ink. I've never had a juicy marbled-ink pen...unless it was bubbling out and leaking. Yuck! (Very rare.)These pens - and the ones from Zebra I used to purchase - have a significant drag. They are not very smooth to write with. They aren't really intended to be daily use pens - these are geared more for decorative writing, scrapbooking, art, etc. The ink is not very dark, but does show on light and dark paper. I've always gotten better results on dark paper - the yellow doesn't show well at all on white paper, and some colors appear gray at times. (It's the way the ink mixes - there is no gray ink in the pens.) The amount of muddy, or gray, ink you get in your writing really depends on the pen...it's kind of a ""luck of the draw"" thing. (Or ""UNluck of the draw"", depending on the results you're trying to achieve.)The cap fits these pens well - on the writing end of the pen and when you place the cap on the other end (to ""store"" it while you write). The gems seem to be secured well - I don't anticipate losing them. Wouldn't that be embarrassing...""Oh, excuse me - I think my diamond just fell off in my _____."" Best to avoid that - and I believe you will with these pens.I believe the rest of my review is best handled by the photos I've added. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have questions...as my life revolves around pens (not really, but I wish it did!), I'm happy to provide any comparisons or further information.

"I've had several different squeegees for my showers over the years. While having my master bathroom remodeled recently, I chose clear glass doors for the shower. In an effort to cut down on the look of water drops and soap scum - and trying to increase the amount of time I can get away with between shower cleanings - I wanted a new squeegee for this shower. I wanted a small squeegee without compromising quality - and I wanted to be able to hang it in the shower. (Leaving it on the floor = gross!) After considering several different models, I came across this one. I liked how short the handle is, but that the actual squeegee part is the normal size. This also came with a large suction cup to hang the squeegee on - it isn't a suction cup with a hook to hang it on, the squeegee actually fits into the suction cup. I have horrible luck with getting suction cups to stick for very long, so this seemed like a good option. Having the squeegee actually on the suction cup seems like it puts less stress on the suction cup than hanging the squeegee from an attached hook does. I also like the black and stainless steel look - it's more attractive than the white plastic one I used to have. I believe the stainless steel is better quality than plastic - it will hold up better over time. Since it's stainless steel, I don't have to worry about it rusting or doing other funky things that metal can do when it is often exposed to water.I'm really glad I got this - I love it! It met all the criteria I was searching for, the rubber squeegee part does an amazing job of wiping down the water drops (or whatever) and keeping my shower sparkling clean. I use it every time I finish showering and it takes less than a minute - but saves me a lot of scrubbing work when I actually scrub the shower. It also makes the doors much nicer to look at on a daily basis - the whole bathroom just looks cleaner when the doors don't have dried water droplets on them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38T6GE81ER7M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NZKHKU#wasThisHelpful","R38T6GE81ER7M6","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard all sorts of commotion about UD eye primer so I was anxious to try it. The first tube I ordered arrived without the sponge doe foot applicator, so I didn't get to try it. The seller was out of the anti-aging eye primer (so politely refunded my money) and I decided to order this from a different seller. (At my age, you just don't buy stuff unless it's ""anti-aging"", ""anti-wrinkle"", or ""dear-God, just-please-turn-back-the-clock""!) The price was very close to the cost of the first tube I bought (within $2), so I grabbed this and checked out, then anxiously awaited the arrival of my new eye primer, sure it was going to be just the life-altering product I've always wanted.WRONG.I probably should have started this review by saying that although I've very into skincare, I'm not a big makeup person. I have to go to my teenage daughter to ask about the latest trends (winged eyeliner) and products. She almost fell over when I began asking about UD eye primer - although she was decidedly less excited about the anti-aging properties than I was. (Who knows why.) She was so excited about acquiring Urban Decay anything, she immediately went and cleaned her room (an herculean task!) before returning and promising to love me ""forever"" if I would buy this eye primer. (Maybe that was my out?? Ha) Anyway, I ordered it. Again. Based on the honkin' photo the seller has chosen to represent the primer in this listing, I thought I was buying the exact same thing I had just purchased...with a working applicator. I was pretty bummed when a tube 2.5 times SMALLER showed up. (Yeah, now I see this is advertised as the 0.13 oz Mini Travel Size, instead of the 0.33 full size I had purchased the first time.) In my defense, the large photo is of the 0.33 size. Since I'm not familiar with this product, I was kind of dependent on the photo depicting what I would receive. (And 0.13 is pretty similar to 0.33 when you are comparing between pages.)I was taken aback with the silver pointy top - I was expecting the pretty prismatic top that had adorned the first tube I purchased. You know, like the lid this seller shows in their large product photo above. I was in a rush to get ready that day, so I unscrewed the lid to apply the primer...and was really shocked that there was no spongy doe foot applicator on this one, either. After noting the differences between the item I held in my hand versus the photo staring back at me from the picture, it dawned on me that I was holding an entirely different size.I'm a big one for reading descriptions and knowing what you are buying - and this item was no exception. However, based on the advertised photo I can understand how the size difference could be confusing to a new user. There is no applicator with the size I received, although there is one in the picture. Well, I take that back - your finger is the applicator. It was a big bummer.UD Primer Eyeshadow Primer Potion Anti-Aging alleges it will instantly wake up tired eyes, minimizes crepiness and red, ruddy issues and imperfections. It contains special optical-blurring (light diffusing) pigments that are supposed to create a subtle, soft-focus effect around your eyes by obscuring flaws - and it asserts ""new, advanced ingredients"" will prevent future age-related damage. If I remember correctly, Bare Minerals purports similar facial results by using their Mineral Veil.This primer claims it has ""high-tech wrinkle fighting ingredients"", ""improves tone and texture"", and ""measurably improves the signs of aging over time"". The active ingredients are Dermaxyl (helps with wrinkles) and Kalpariane (hydrates, firms, and plumps). Kalpariane is also supposed to help with skin suppleness. I'm not familiar with those ingredients, but their results sounded pretty good! ;) I like the primer, although I can't tell any effect from the anti-aging properties. I don't wear this everyday, though. In fact, I probably wear it once-a-week or once every ten days. That's about how frequently I wear eye makeup - but I know my daughter has used it almost daily since it arrived. We both agree we love how it feels - it makes your eyelids kind of velvety...and how it looks, or rather, doesn't look - eye shadow stays in place much better, for much longer, and doesn't get sucked into the lid crease halfway through the day. I don't wear heavy, dark makeup - mostly browns and creams, neutral tones - but I feel like it's hard to see any of my makeup by lunch. I'm not real sure where it slides off to, but when I figure it out I'll be looking at one massive mound of eye shadow! This primer kept the eye makeup on longer, as well as keeping the appearance fresh. My make up doesn't move when I apply a base layer of this primer before doing my eye makeup - and my daughter reports similar results.Even though this little tube isn't going to last very long, I think I'm hooked enough to order more when this is gone. I'm glad we decided to try it. I wish the picture would have been more representative of the product we were actually getting, but I learned a lesson. I will be much more careful comparing listings when I am unfamiliar with the product I'm considering.

"Mmmmmk...not the best product, and I'm an office product freak! I got these to go inside the hardcover book I am using as my new planner/art journal. I got these as small holders for little notes, memorabilia, business cards, etc. I chose the medium size because the small doesn't seem like it would hold much. (Not that I'm planning on loading these babies down, but I'd like to be able to get a couple of pieces of paper in them before they are full!) I really had to really think about whether to get these - they are a little costly and there are much prettier/cuter/different options in the scrapbooking realm. After deciding I wanted something clear, I got these. I am apparently blind because I didn't see the white dotted pattern on the body of these. They are still somewhat see-through, I just don't know how I missed that.I ended up having to add my own adhesive to these in order to secure them to the inside of my book. The front of the packaging says ""sticks securely"" - which I was not blind enough to miss. However, whoever put that on the packaging isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, either. The adhesive on these is awful! The adhesive isn't very big and ""strong"" is about the last adjective I'd choose to describe it. It sticks to the inside cover, true...but a sudden breeze would dislodge the whole envelope. There is no way they would stick to any surface while you tried to open the flap and put something inside. I wound up using double stick tape all around the perimeter of the back, which has made a world of difference. I can still remove the envelopes if I want, but they are much more secure now than they were with 3Ms version of adhesive. I'm surprised by that, since 3M manufactures so many great adhesives. They missed the boat on this one - especially for the price of these.On the positive side, the Velcro closure that holds the flap closed works really well. These also seem to be sturdy and well made. The perfect size for holding all sorts of little pieces of awesome! They'll fit in a wide assortment of books.

"This hat is hysterical - it fits my lion statue perfectly. Oh - that isn't the reason you are considering buying it? Well, in that case, it's a little snug on my head, but fits my teenage daughter's head perfectly. The way the legs flop around keeps cracking me up. It's really hard to have a serious conversation with someone wearing this - especially when the wearer keeps bobbing up and down, saying ""Gobble! Gobble!"".

I can't wait to wear this to our formal Thanksgiving family dinner. Until then, it will keep the lion's head warm...and will keep the cow statue - that is wearing a drumstick headband - from feeling lonely.It isn't the best made hat...but it's definitely worth the price!

"Wonderful Halloween decorations! The bat feels very...spooky! It's a gross texture, perfect for Halloween. The spider moves nicely - it kind of wobbles - when hung by the clear plastic loop that it's attached to. (It's more of a price tag loop than a hanging loop so it's a little short, but it worked for my purposes!) The rat is hard plastic and it squeaks when squeezed, like a dog toy. The bird was fantastic attached to the zombie Styrofoam head we made. We draped some of the fake spider web on the wig of the head, then buried the feet of the bird in her hair - it was awesome! The owl...well, the owl is why I deducted a star. That's a piece of junk! I don't mind if decorations like this arrive and I need to do some bending/altering to make them fit my purposes, especially for $2 each. There was nothing I could do to fix that poor lil guy. He was kind of an egg shape with some black feathers stuck to him. His nose wouldn't stay on so I finally glued it to his face. Owls usually have incredible eyesight - unfortunately, my guy is legally blind. I'm not even sure if both eyes are there - the feathers are so sloppily glued on that it's impossible to tell this is supposed to be an owl - which is why I left a star off.If not for the owl I would say this is a pretty great set of decorations at a fantastic price. I would buy them again - with the understanding that the owl won't be usable. That way, if your package arrives differently, you'll be pleasantly surprised. (The owl was really bad.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXM9DNTASOULZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014TQWB9S#wasThisHelpful","RXM9DNTASOULZ","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terrific leash! I have three small dogs - a 4 lb Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound puppy, a 6 lb Chihuahua, and a 12 lb Chorgi (Chihuahua/Corgi mix) - and use this leash for all 3 of them. (Well, not the same leash - I bought 3.)*The ribbon-type lead is wonderful:~ It doesn't cut or burn you like the thin string type can~ Multiple leads are easy to untangle when the dogs get all wound together (infinitely easier than the thin string type!)~ I don't worry the lead will burn or cut the pup's skin if it somehow gets wrapped around them~ The ribbon is fantastically bright, very easy to see (even in the dark)~ The leash itself doesn't weigh much - it's very light~ The lock is easy to operate and the locking mechanism is sturdy~ The retraction apparatus is smooth, strong, and doesn't get tangled while winding/unwinding~ The handle is large enough to comfortably fit an adult hand~ There is enough room at the bottom of the handle to clip on a bag dispenser (or tie on three bags with no problem) and a used poop bag holder~ Very confident the lead won't break (like the thin string type can) or suddenly snap away from the handleWhile looking at leashes, I found one that is extremely similar in features and aesthetics, but costs a few dollars more. I originally purchased one of those and one of these - so I could compare. The only difference I noted is that other brand has a light blue, textured ""panel"" on the sides. The only purpose for the panels is decorative, and definitely not worth the extra money.Bottom Line: Attractive, no frills leash for female or male dogs. If this leash can properly contain a totally spastic puppy just learning to walk on a leash, who pulls constantly while trying to chase rabbits and squirrels, changes direction at full force, and oddly seems to enjoy the bouncing jerk she experiences when, running as fast possible, she suddenly reaches the end of the lead...this leash will work for your dog(s). Awesome price for a reliable leash!* I had different leashes for them, but was recently notified there is a 10 ft leash law in my city. Although my dogs had always been on leashes very similar to this one, the lead was 16 ft. According to Animal Control, ""one cannot properly control their dog from a distance of more than 10 feet"". Yep, I know I've always struggled to control my mini dogs when they were 16 ft away. Anyway, if your location has a similar ridiculous law - which, by the way, carries the exact same ticket (and fine) as not using a leash at all, or allowing your dog to ""run at large"" - this leash fits the 10 ft distance perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVBCN7318GWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y4KDV44#wasThisHelpful","RFVBCN7318GWG","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful blue, heavy, thick glass. I was hesitant to purchase a glass spray bottle, after having always used plastic bottles and knowing how clumsy I am, I was worried I would drop and break this soon after delivery. Nope! The sprayer works really well - with two OFF spots, a MISTER spot, and a STREAM spot - your needs are covered. The stream is pretty powerful, much better than the plastic bottle I bought this to replace. My favorite part? It doesn't drip. At all! Dripping dispensers are one of my biggest pet peeves - so I'm thrilled to report that isn't an issue with this beautiful spray bottle. And at 16 oz, it doesn't require frequent filling.  ~ Schwing!! ~A couple of days ago, I grabbed the bottle with wet hands. (I use the bottle as a bark deterrent to train our new puppy - a Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound mix. Chihuahuas have a hard time understanding that barking is not the way to make friends and influence people...so it's getting quite a bit of use.) I went to spray it and it slid out of my hand, falling about four feet to the carpeted floor. It didn't break, chip, or crack. I also accidentally kicked it down the wood stairs - not a single problem. Even the plastic sprayer is sturdy - it's heavier duty than my old sprayer. Neither fall damaged the sprayer at all. (I told you I'm clumsy!) I love this spray bottle - and if it can survive here, it will do a great job at your place!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEOEQJ2TJCWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01314J23M#wasThisHelpful","RIEOEQJ2TJCWR","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tired of finding cotton buds at the bottom of the alcohol bottles, I decided to try this. For probably twenty years I've had my nail polish remover in a similar dispenser - and have loved how easy it is to use. That was my thought about this - no more yucky cotton buds hanging out at the bottom of the bottle, a couple of pumps and you've got just the right amount for your cotton ball or ""swab on a stick"", and not likely to spill. This has easy, one-hand operation. During research I was doing regarding the best ways to store household chemicals so they don't lose their effectiveness, many ""experts"" (professionals) assert that amber glass keeps most oils, vitamins, chemicals, etc, more effective, longer. The amber glass helps to maintain the potency of many products. This bottle is made of nice, thick glass - it's unlikely to break if accidentally knocked over. The white ALCOHOL is very easy to read and distinguish from other products. It is also easy to see through the bottle to determine when it needs to be refilled.Although I like this dispenser, I did deduct a star because I don't feel like the pumps deliver enough alcohol. I was hoping a few extra pumps would saturate my cotton ball more fully - but that doesn't happen. Whether I pump the top three times, or eight times, the cotton ball winds up with the same amount of alcohol on it. That's fine - for the most part...however, when I want my cotton ball to be pretty saturated with alcohol so I can use it as an astringent on my face, the small amount (that doesn't even closely saturate even the smallest cotton ball) is frustrating. It's a small annoyance in the scheme of life, but an annoyance nonetheless. Other than that issue I really like this dispenser - it looks nice and is convenient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOM5ENU367OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AVXDOK#wasThisHelpful","R2UOM5ENU367OW","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The queen of the Gelatos Fan Club is here to leave another review for these fascinating, versatile pigments. This box contains twelve different pastel colors that are, frankly, DELICIOUS! The colors in this line are modeled after French macaroons and include Coconut, Buttercream, Aqua Dolce, Watermelon, Guava, Peach, Earl Grey, Caramel, Kiwi, Fig, Elderberry, Strawberry. Just like with the other sets, I find it impossible to choose one favorite. I have several I use more often - some, MUCH more often - but I wouldn't want to give up any of these precious pastels. Design Memory Craft just keeps outdoing themselves with these amazing magical sticks!The consistency is like a velvety lipstick - you control whether they saturate the substrate, leaving a slick, smooth, powerfully colorful surface...or more of a light hint that produces a washed out/faded look...or anything in between! It doesn't take much to create a piece that really rocks - especially when water is added. Using the included paintbrush with some water will allow you to move these yummy creams around your project with incredible ease. Adding a little water will just turn these into succulent watercolors - adding more water will allow you to achieve the ""washed out"" look that is so popular right now. (See the photo of the house I made with the Brights set. This is the same unfinished project I keep adding to my reviews, but I can't seem to remember to take pictures of other projects. Thanks, aging! Grrr)I absolutely love the paintbrush Faber Castell has chosen to include with the 15 piece sets. I think it's perfect - which is oddly fantastic, since I usually find the free brushes included with art supplies to be total junk. Surprisingly, this is my VERY favorite brush and I'm using it for everything - not just Gelatos. The clear handle looks cool, fits in my hand like it was custom made, is shorter than the gajillion brushes I already own (easier to control), and the white bristles are...ohhh, those white bristles! They pick up the perfect amount of water for Gelatos. They lay down the Gelatos with amazing awesomeness. (That's my official technical term.) Since the Gelatos are creamy, it would be easy to understand if the medium got all gunked up at the top of the brush (by the ferrule), but miraculously it doesn't. The hairs don't fall out...the bristles aren't too soft or too hard, and it doesn't pick up too much - or too little - water. Goldilocks would definitely approve...This. Brush. Rocks!Wood, canvas, paper...Gelatos will work on many substrates. Metal and glass are the only two things I can think of that wouldn't work - yet, even excluding those two things, do you have any idea how many substrate choices that leaves you with?!? You also have tons of options when it comes to putting them on the substrate...slice off just a little, put it and some water in a spray bottle, and mist it on your project. Apply directly from the applicator. Use a paintbrush. Use a wet paintbrush. Use a cotton bud. A tissue. Your finger. A palette knife. Dauber. Sponge. I'm sure you get the idea. Oh - and these also come with two sponge wedges (like make up applicators) - one soft and one hard. I am so in love!Workable fixative seems to hold these in place, although I have to say that I haven't noticed any color change when adding another wet medium AFTER these have THOROUGHLY DRIED. I also like to use a combination of clear gesso and clear varnish (in a thin coat) to make sure everything stays the same on a prior layer, while adding some tooth for a new layer.Did I mention Gelatos are also acid-free? Portable? Wonderful to mix or overlay? Ohh, yeah! They are my new favorite supply - which says a lot. (My house is like a mix of Hobby Lobby, Michael's, and Dick Blick combined....but only because I would need the square footage of all three of those stores to properly store all my supplies!) Whether you are new to arts and crafts, or you've been around long enough to see all sorts of products come and go, you will easily find a use for these. The effects you can create are truly endless, especially when you begin to bring water into the equation. Easy to control, deposits rich color on the paper, wood, canvas, etc you're using (the house is on a birch wood panel), countless ways to apply...ooh! Gives me goosebumps just thinking about all the creamy, colorful fun crammed into this box of velvety sticks!Gelatos are available in a wide range of combinations - a couple of colors are available in sets of 2, there are many different color combinations available in four packs (each comes with a brush), sets of 15 that have a theme (Pastel, Metallics, Brights, etc), a collection of 23 Double Scoops (Double Scoops are about twice the size of these regular sticks), and a few additional gift sets. You can get a good idea of their awesomeness in the 4 packs - they are more than enough to play with (quantity-wise), and fairly priced at around $10. Plus, you'll get a ""free"" paintbrush - although the brushes vary, many of the newer 4 packs contain one of the magnificent brushes I spoke about earlier. Wahoo!

"As I've commented in my other reviews of other Gelatos (I'm a little obsessed with these), THESE ARE PERFECTION! I love the wide range of colors Faber Castell provides in this pack. It's like some color fairy went on a mission to find all the colors you could possibly need, then threw in a few more you'll use time and time again, but didn't realize it. I create a lot with these and I can always find the color I need in this 33 piece set. (28 Gelatos, 3 stamps, 1 palette knife, 1 paintbrush.) From the bright colors you want to get lost in, to the regular colors everyone uses frequently, and even a couple of metallics - this is one set they absolutely nailed. It's kind of expensive, but if you think about it, you get a lot for your money. For just over $2/Gelato - plus a few tools - you get a wide range of delicious creamy pigments that will last forever. Even though I reach for these constantly, they barely look used. The pigments are so rich and deep that it doesn't take much to create something as bright - or subdued - as you want.The photo I've included was one I added to my review of the Bright set which has 12 colors. (That's my favorite set!) Although the house was created with the Brights, it provides an idea of what Gelatos can look like when you work to knock down the colors a bit and want a more subdued look. It's easy to make something brilliantly bold - or to get the washed out look that's so popular. That's one of the things I adore about these creamy sticks of magic - you decide the effect you get by the method you use. There are quite a few YouTube videos that can give you some ideas and I encourage you to check them out if this is a supply you are interested in, but haven't worked with before (or don't know what to do with). I included a few of my favorite tips in my review of the Brights - and always struggle with whether to point people to another review or just repeat the information in my current review. In this case, I'll leave those tips under that other review, but I will say that these work equally well on light or dark surfaces. You choose whether the effect is opaque, full coverage, slick, solid, and appears to lay on the surface of your substrate - or - the color appears to be a part of your substrate, like it's integrated into the paper weave.Whether you are new to arts and crafts, or you've been around long enough to see all sorts of products come and go, you will easily find a use for these.

"Let's just get it out of the way...My name is Katherine and I am OBSESSED with Original Pink Box tools. It started with their hammer and quickly moved on to power tools. Before I knew it, I was clamoring for their metal toolbox - just having the pink tool bag isn't sufficient, am I right?! I've had my eye on this saw for awhile now, but kept talking myself out of it. I went back and forth between this reciprocating saw and the circular saw. I spent months telling myself I could just live with the old, ugly, NOT PINK handsaw that I've had for years. I tried to convince myself that saw was enough - I really did. In the end, I chucked that awful idea...and grabbed this OPB beauty. I'm so glad I did!This is one energetic power tool! My handyman made fun of me for getting a pink reciprocating saw (he should have learned when he made fun of my drill...and it totally annihilated his piece of junk) - before we go any further, why do I have a handyman if I'm such a pink tool girl? There are some things that are just too heavy for a girl to carry...and like any of you are going to fault me for employing a younger guy to flex his muscles while he sweats...ANYWAY...(Haha I totally kid). (Or do I?) ;)I've never understood why someone would purchase a corded saw, but thankfully that wasn't anything I had to think about too deeply since OPB's reciprocating saw only comes in the sporty cordless version. This saw does NOT come with the necessary 18 volt lithium ion battery, so you'll want to grab one of those when you're purchasing the saw. I also got an extra charger while I was throwing things in my Amazon cart. (If you already have the drill then you have a battery that will work...but where's the fun in that? Don't you want to have a fully charged battery for your power toys? A lady needs to be ready to ""git down"" at a moment's notice - so get the extra charger. You'll thank me later, when you're finishing up the work your man's saw just couldn't handle.) You may also want to grab a pair of OPB's fashionable PINK safety glasses, too. One tends to lose a bit of their sexy power when having to wear a Dixie cup taped to their eye because they didn't wear safety glasses, and therefore had to spend an afternoon in the ER with a nurse fishing small shards out of their eye. Just sayin'.The battery takes about 4-5 hours to fully charge the first time. You'll know the battery is charging when the red light comes on...and you'll know it's fully charged when both the green and red lights are lit. Putting the battery in/taking the battery out of the saw is self-explanatory and easy. I should mention that this does comes with two saw blades - a coarse tooth blade (I use these for wood and plastic) and a fine tooth blade (I use these for cutting metal). It also arrives with an average size hex key (or Allen wrench) to tighten/loosen saw blades. (It's really easy to see where the hex key fits - it's at the top end of the saw in the area of the blade shoe.) I love that it's an average/popular size - if it's misplaced (which mine most likely will be soon), it's super easy to replace it. Oh - and about the blades...it's really important to buy the correct length and type. A blade designed for cutting wood works much better when you cut wood with it - and surprisingly, a blade intended for metal use seems to excel at cutting metal. The blades need to be at least 3.5"" for this saw, and depending on your project, possibly longer. It's also good to know one thing about TPI (teeth per inch), too - the lower the number, the faster and rougher it is designed to cut. Higher numbers are better for slower, smoother cuts. So 6 TPI is great for ripping through some wood that doesn't need to be cut smooth & precise...while 20 TPI indicate you should go much slower and your result will be a smoother, ""prettier"" cut. (If I could just make myself follow this now...)One other quick note - depending on how you plan on storing your reciprocating saw, you may want to hold onto the little bags that the original blades come in. At least while you are still using the blades. Saw blades are covered in oil and can make a big ol' mess - and there is definitely a ""smell"" to them. When I keep my saw in my tool bag I take the blades out and put them in a little hard plastic sleeve thingy I have. If it's just going in my toolbox, I don't bother removing the blade - it won't be bouncing around in a bag, so the oil won't come off on everything around it.I also want to mention the other thing I love about this saw - the handle. It's softer than other saws I've used - and it's the perfect size for my hand. I don't think it's any smaller than other saw handles, I just like how it's made. It fits my hand well and it's easy to control. And like the other fine machinery made by OPB, this has a 12 month warranty. Amazon also lists this saw for about $12 less than you can get it on OPB's site. So...WHY are you STILL reading this? I can't believe you haven't gotten one yet. The warranty, the company reputation, the price, the variable speed, the comfortable fit in your hand, and hello - it's PINK!! You won't find a better saw - especially that will make the boys jealous. It's such a great reciprocating saw that I doubt the bright pink color would even both most men. You may have to drag out the Bedazzler if you really want to make sure they keep their hands off. ;)(Wow. Power tools - in general - must just make one act like a chauvinist!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGPFA5KD8BKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSA8WNI#wasThisHelpful","RUGPFA5KD8BKS","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is exactly as described - it arrived quickly and it charges the extra battery I purchased for my saw. The drill comes with a battery, but the saw doesn't. Now that I have two batteries, it's only a matter of time before I lose the charger...right?!...so I went ahead and purchased this charger when buying the reciprocal saw and additional battery through Amazon. I love the quality of everything I've purchased from Original Pink Box and this charger is no exception. It's nice having a charger in my pink metal toolbox (in the garage) - and one in my pink tool bag (more portable). These are so small they don't take up much room. I can't get enough of these pink tools and should become their tool model soon. ;) Nah - I would put Rose Riveter in some pink overalls (or maybe give her a pink bandanna?) and make HER the OPB spokeswoman!Having multiple batteries and chargers means I always have a full battery ready to go.

"Another cute-as-can-be little detail that added some spooky fun to the Halloween decorations in my fairy garden! This is sitting on a little leaf table in one of the corners - next to a dripping taper candle...the table is kind of covered by trees and sits across from the main table the fairies like to gather around. That table has a little Spell Book I got this year - so it appears the resident fairies are up to all kinds of mischief this time of year! This is the perfect size at just under an inch. Superior Dollhouse Miniatures always has darling miniatures - the quality is reflected in their prices, but I know the little treasures I purchase will last for years.

"Perfect little book to put in my (ever-growing) fairy garden. I purchased it when I got some miniature jack-o-lanterns and I just love how this adorable book adds so much festive detail to the main table the fairies like to gather around. I placed a few of the jack-o-lanterns on the ground by the bottom of the table - like they may have been knocked over, and placed a small camping lantern next to this book on the table. It looks like the mischievous little fairies were busy looking up spells before something scared them off. It's about an inch long - and makes a spooky sweet addition to any fairy garden or dollhouse.

"The hat arrived quickly in a plastic retail bag. Every time I look at it I crack up - it is perfect for the cow statue we keep out front and dress up every holiday. I love the braids! The hat is big enough to fit an adult head, with the braids hanging down below the shoulders. The braids are very soft and bright white - but they are made out of some sort of wool, so it tends to snag when touching anything (even dry skin) and the fibers break, leaving portions of braid ""fuzzy"". (That's why I deducted a star.) I'm going to replace the little red ribbons on the ends of the braids with some ribbon of cows singing Christmas carols. It's going to be lovely with her oversized ornament necklace. This hat is so fun, I can't promise my kids won't be trying to steal it so they can wear it to school during the holiday season!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL1W0YJBT0LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D34MVA#wasThisHelpful","R2CL1W0YJBT0LY","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own several self-healing cutting mats. One is so big it nearly covers my entire desk - I think it's 24"" x 36"". I love being able to create on it without having to worry about cutting the table, or accidentally getting paint/ink/glue/etc on my desk - and I love the smooth writing surface a good self-healing mat creates. The only problem? The ugly green one I have (which is black on the other side) doesn't cover my whole desk, so I'm constantly either writing off the edge or getting some supply on my table. (Tangent: Does that mean I've actually gone over the edge? More than once?!) I have been looking for another self-healing cutting mat for awhile, in order to fill the rest of the desk, but I didn't want another green/black one. Since I adore anything pink, this was like winning twice!The perfect pink hue, this mat takes cuts easily and immediately self-heals. It also provides that comfortingly familiar writing surface excelencia! The white grid lines really stand out, which makes measuring things and drawing straight lines incredibly easy. (I am awful at drawing straight lines - even with a ruler.) This arrives with a sticker attached to the top that folds over and also attaches to the other side. It is pretty easy to remove the adhesive, but you will probably find a minimal amount of Goo Gone or Sticky Stuff Remover to be helpful in removing the slightly sticky film that remains. It's hard to describe - I didn't have any trouble removing the large tag, it removed cleanly, but it left behind an oddly tacky film. Not problematic enough to ruin your day (or even prompt second thoughts about purchasing this mat), just something to be aware of.Working on a self-healing mat just makes everything so much easier. Your handwriting will improve dramatically when you write on this - pens you didn't care for (or refused to work) previously, will suddenly become your favorites. The very best thing about this self-healing mat - well, besides the fact that it's pink? Is that the material heals well and you have two sides to work on. So you can make one side the side you use when doing messy activities (painting, gluing, etc) - then flip it over when you are going to use it as desk protector, so that stays clean and pretty. I've used self-healing mats for so long that I can't remember life without them! I am also very fond of Vyco, which is an amazingly smooth and cool self-healing mat/protector you can apply to your work surface. I actually prefer Vyco, but it's kind of permanent - and one thing I love about these mats is their portability. Vyco just attaches to the surface with a special double-stick adhesive, and can easily be cut with scissors or an Xacto to perfectly fit the contours of your table or desk. There is nothing like that flat, smooth surface - the expense is greater, though. Then again, the Vyco lasts a really long time before you replace it. It comes in gray/cream and green/cream - your choice which color to have face up. If you're interested, you can find it here: Alvin Home Indoor Office Craft Art Draft VYCO Green/Cream Board Cover, 31 x 42 Inches Sheet (VBC44-5). Whether I decide to install Vyco on my table or desk again remains to be seen...but everybody better keep their hands off my pink mat! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAH95QA6OCA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRT87G8#wasThisHelpful","R2EAH95QA6OCA2","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gobble gobble! These are absolutely adorable! Yes, they arrive a bit...wonky. However, it isn't difficult to bend them a bit - using only your fingers - to make them stand a little straighter. If your fingers don't work, a small pair of needle nose pliers does a great job! If you choose to use a tool to perform a little surgery on your gaggle of waddles, be very careful. The teeth on the pliers can mar the paint, and too much pressure can detach the less-than-optimal welding. I also used my fingers and the pliers to lightly bend the feathers, so each one has a little additional character. Doing that isn't necessary at all, but I think it made them even cuter than they were when they arrived.There are two each of three different turkeys. All have yellow, orange, brown, and green paint, but the placement varies on the three pairs. A small tea light fits perfectly in them, although a couple required a bit of a struggle before the turkeys would cooperate. When I adjusted their wings and legs, I also used my fingers to bow out their heads and turn their beaks up just a little (that appears to be what a few of them in the photo have had done). The heads arrived pretty flat, so they appeared to be looking down. A very simple thing to fix - had I chosen not to adjust anything on them, they truly would have been fine...and very cute. I put remote controlled tea lights in them. The ones I had on hand change colors randomly, which adds even more fun to these little guys. I mention that because I don't know if the heat from an actual candle will make these metal turkeys hot - so if you use a regular tea light candle you may want to keep an eye on their warmth. (Between a meat thermometer for your edible turkey, and feeling for the heat level of these turkeys...I never knew I could be so concerned about turkey temperatures!)These should last for years, but the paint feels like it will scratch easily. I am going to place mine on our front porch on a piece of natural wood. Using Glue Dots to keep them grounded in the wind, I'm going to place raffia, small pine cones, Putka pods (mini pumpkins), silk leaves, and acorns around the feet of my little gobblers. Before I put them in the elements, however, I am going to give them a quick spray of acrylic shellac. I would be more concerned about their flammability if I wasn't using LED candles. The spray acrylic will increase the durability of the paint, but can *potentially* make them more attractive to flame - which is important to keep in mind. (I've switched almost all the regular candles in my home over to LED candles.)These would be adorable in a table centerpiece or other display around your home. There are enough of them to spread out, or you could give a few as gifts - and their colors make them perfect for any sort of fall decorating. If you are careful and have the tiniest bit of talent with pliers, it would be so cute to bend their legs and change their positions - maybe bend one knee so one of their little leaf feet can rest on a miniature bale of hay? (Just a suggestion.) As another reviewer pointed out, some of these turkeys experience difficulty standing when they first arrive - jet lag? - however, I don't find it to be as big of an issue as the other reviewer found it to be. And with the popularity of LED candles, there is absolutely no safety concern. Based on my experience, you will most likely have to spend less than five minutes barely bending their legs - it seems like their weight distribution is easily thrown out of whack...but what a small issue in order to have the cutest little rafter of turkeys around!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283W8BKDJ3DS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQSTEPU#wasThisHelpful","R283W8BKDJ3DS0","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So...I really like these! I needed a way to create light up eyes in the Styrofoam heads I was making for Halloween. I couldn't find any sort of eyes that would either light up, or glow-in-the-dark, around the size I needed. (And I was very flexible on sizing options.) These popped up as one of the options under ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" list. As soon as I saw them I knew they would be perfect!I only received nine of the ten pair I was supposed to receive, but it wasn't that big of a deal since I only needed eight pairs. (The reason for the star deduction.) The fact they are different colors is just awesome! I wedged the earrings into a small hole I made in each Styrofoam head, where the eyes should be. These were bright enough they could be seen from the street - at least 50 yards! They really added character to the spooky faces. AND they lasted without any issues - 16 nights at 3-4 hours/night. That's excellent - and way more than I expected! They also arrived very quickly.Now that Halloween is over, I put them on my art desk. I wasn't sure what I was going to do with them at this point - since you can replace the batteries I thought about just hanging onto them until next Halloween. When my daughter and her friends saw them sitting on my desk, that was it. She asked if those were the earrings I had used as the head eyes, and when I replied yes, they all squealed. She asked (begged?) to have some of them for her and her friends...when I said yes they all squealed again. Apparently they've been wearing them at school and they've been a big hit. From what I heard, the bowling alley almost CLOSED DOWN because they were so cool. lol ;)A few of the earrings have stopped working, a few are pretty dim, but several are still going strong - which is hard to believe. The girls have asked if I can find replacement batteries, so I'm off to do that as soon as I post this review. The batteries are really, really small, so we'll see how many actually make it into the earrings...and how many wind up lost on the floor. I will also be ordering another set of these for next Halloween - and probably another set for New Year's. These are fun and unique, seem to last forever, and the price is terrific. Had I gotten all ten pairs then this would have easily been a resounding five star purchase!I've attached two photos of how they looked the way I used them.

"I purchased a ""Set of 3 Indoor or Outdoor Metal and Glass Lanterns"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G2SKCJS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) without realizing how large the largest lantern really is. All of the candles I already owned looked ridiculously sad in this lantern - even placing a couple of the candles in that lantern didn't work. I began the hunt for a 6"" candle. When I came across this I knew I'd hit pay dirt - I have purchased Gerson LED candles previously and knew they are beautiful, high quality, flameless candles. The one I purchased arrived quickly and in perfect condition. There is no way you could find a traditional candle of this size for the same price, so I feel I got a great deal.This requires 3 ""C"" batteries to operate, which the seller includes! <gasp> This looks exactly like a traditional candle - due to the real wax they use, it's impossible to tell the difference...in the daytime. The story changes at night - the candle is still beautiful, but the ""triple wick flame"" sits about halfway down the candle. I don't care for LED candles made like that - most of the light drowns in the space before it ever reaches the top. The thickness of the sides - which is good for every reason except lighting - suffocates a good portion of the light, too. Placing the flame much closer to the top would allow more of the light to spill over the edges. The flame would be quite a bit brighter and it would look more natural. There isn't anything particularly ""wrong"" with this style, I just prefer the other one. I normally have candles around to produce a flickering, ambient light in low light conditions (or power outages) - having the ""flame"" so far inside the candle kind of defeats my purpose.The fact remains that this candle fits my lantern very well and it is a beautiful, large candle. It doesn't seem to drain the batteries very fast - I have used this for three hours a night, for twelve nights - and it's still going. It is easily operated by the On/Off switch on the bottom. Although I haven't had to do it yet, the batteries appear easy to change. The bisque color matches every decor. I am going to wrap a pip berry garland around the bottom of the candle to create a little more interest, although adding anything really isn't necessary. This was a fantastic purchase that I am genuinely happy with. If you are looking for a large candle that doesn't pose all the dangers of a ""real"" candle, your search is over...you won't find a better deal on such a sizable, high quality LED candle. What are you waiting for?

"Pretty pods that will be great with the Thanksgiving centerpiece I'm making. Although I like the pods, I am really disappointed with the seller. I thought the pods would arrive in a bag similar to the photo. Or some sort of bag, as stated in the description:  Features 4 cups in one Bag. There was no bag. They were simply thrown in a small box and mailed. What a MESS when I opened them! I had tiny pieces of Putka pods e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e!! It was like mini pumpkin confetti...that I didn't expect. Or want.The second problem is that I received a little over 2 cups - not the 4 cups advertised. I am highly annoyed with Vintage Designs Store and will never purchase from them again. Most of the pods arrived broken, many in tiny pieces. Had I known this is what I would end up with, I would have gone with another seller. ANY other seller. If you are going to purchase these, please be aware you will not receive anything like the photo - you will get a small box of about half the amount you pay for. I would send these back, but probably a third of them are now in my vacuum. When I said I received a little over two cups, that estimate includes the dust/pieces that ""exploded"" when I opened the box. The amount I can measure is just over 1.5 cups. With a natural dried product like this, it's understandable - even expected - that some will arrive broken. However, I believe that should be the minority - not the majority.(Please Note: The last photo belongs to the seller - it is NOT my picture. I am including it with my photos so you can compare what is advertised vs what I received. The photo of the pods in the box is how they arrived - the other two photos are of the pods in a glass dish, so they are easier to see.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDBX4SXGE864/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY9S2JA#wasThisHelpful","R2LDBX4SXGE864","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great tombstones to write on for Halloween, an old milestone birthday, etc. I bought one to put in my yard, along with some zombie hands that I strung spider webbing on, then placed the hands about two feet from the tombstone. It was AWESOME! I had written ""Here Lies Myra Mains"" and ""April 15, 2014 - October 31, 2014"" on the black space with chalk markers. I can't tell you how fabulous it looked! It looked like the chalk writing was glowing at night. The space to write on is nice and big - you can see the writing from a good distance - and it just begs to have spooky names written on it. My kids and I kept changing the names - but I decided we needed a few more to properly express the temporary cemetery, so I returned and bought five more. ""Bea A Fraid"", ""Ira Gret"", ""Yule B Sorree"", ""Gladys Nottmie"", ""Upton O'Good"", ""Lon Gawn"", and ""Pastor Prime"", were just a few of the names we had in our cemetery during the Halloween season this year. For an Over the Hill party it would be great to put the ""old"" person's name on the tombstone.It can be difficult to write on these - the chalkboard coating is VERY thin and it's super easy to accidentally push too deep and kind of poke a hole when you write. A damp cloth removes the chalk marker, but even being really gentle and careful, some of the chalkboard coating comes off. The more you erase/change the writing, the more evident it is. The tombstone itself is sturdy enough to last for several years - so I plan to quickly re-paint the chalkboard part with new chalkboard paint next year. Only the black part of the tombstone is meant to have writing on it - there is no chalkboard coating on the gray parts. The paint and details on the gray perimeter of the tombstones makes them more realistic than I expected.One star was deducted for the flimsy chalkboard surface - at about $17 each, I don't think it's asking too much to have a chalkboard surface that lasts more than one time - erasing on the current chalk surface leaves muddied areas where the chalkboard surface has come off, so no matter how gentle you are, using a damp cloth to remove some writing (even a mistake) will leave a marred, matte, unattractive spot. This doesn't happen all over, but just in (some) large spots. I only took one star for that because with chalkboard paint so readily available, this is easy to fix myself. (You could even use black acrylic paint and write on it with paint pens, repainting it when you want to change the wording.) The other star was taken due to the very poor quality of the plastic ""stakes"" included with the tombstone. They are a total joke. It's a waste of money on the company's part to even both having these included with the item. I wound up breaking bamboo skewers in half and using those instead. The skewers worked MUCH better. I wouldn't even waste time trying to get the included ""plastic cocktail straws"" to work...unless, you know, you dig fiddling with frustratingly impossible, ridiculously unusable, total time wasters.The little complaints aside, I would (and did!) buy these again. The price is a little steep, but they'll last for several years - especially if you don't mind repainting them a bit. Really fun decorations!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NUN0NZOD8LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DQMUWG#wasThisHelpful","R33NUN0NZOD8LC","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two of these soap dispensers in the same order, but from different sellers. This one is nice and heavy - it doesn't slide around when your wet hand is pressing the pump. The glass is clear, without any bubbles or flaws. The sturdy thickness helps to prevent chips and cracks - and means the glass is not likely to break easily if it's knocked over or dropped. (Obviously the results will probably vary with a 10 ft drop versus, say, a 2 ft drop. I'm guessing.) At 16 oz, it holds quite a bit of soap. I bought two of these dispensers - one from Sally's Organics that is blue glass and has the ""modern"" pump Refillable Liquid Soap Dispenser - Designer Cobalt Blue Bottle / Mirror Polished Silver Hand Pump with Stainless Steel Spring Mechanism - Decorative in the Kitchen or Bathroom , and this one from Industrial Rewind that is clear glass and has the ""traditional"" metal pump - and I am SO much happier with this pump.I use both of these dispensers with the generic version of Dial hand soap, not dish soap. I noticed a pretty bad dripping issue with the other dispenser by the end of the first day, but was kind of trapped by that point. (You have to fill the dispenser in order to check the drippiness factor...however, filling it means it's gonna be a LOT of work to return it!) This dispenser, on the other hand, hasn't dripped once. Not even a little dribble. It's been wonderful! The amount of soap it dispenses is perfect for hand washing, too. The bronze metal pump matches my kitchen perfectly. As a whole, the dispenser is a classy, beautiful addition to have near my kitchen sink. In fact, I'm ordering three more of these (for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash), and I already ordered another one of these pumps as a replacement pump for the drippy (defective) dispenser. This style matches many different decors, but I love how it enhances my antique farmhouse/shabby chic theme.Soap dispensers take quite a bit of abuse in my house because they get a lot of use. This one has held up perfectly for the short time we've been using it, and I have confidence it will continue to perform flawlessly. If there is some sort of change - the pump begins to drip or stops working, the glass suddenly develops a crack - I will definitely update this review. If there is no update then it's safe to believe the dispenser is still successfully pumping out handfuls of soap...left and right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIZRV6U3YPL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLV7NM8#wasThisHelpful","R3EIZRV6U3YPL3","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful handmade journal full of flower-infused paper. The pink colored cover is lovely and the tooling appears professional. As these are all handmade by different artists, the actual tooling design varies, although the overall design is classic and will appeal to women who like a variety of styles - this would appeal to a wide variety of different tastes and would be an excellent gift. I can't imagine someone not liking this!Due to the handmade nature, no two are exactly alike. For example, the one I received has a completely different design on it than the one in the photo. It is still a beautiful, bright pink journal, but the front has flowers all over it, with a sort of basket weave, or lattice border. The back has the same border, but the tooled design inside the border is completely different - still highly attractive. The sides of the journal are smooth and plain, with only the boarder pattern at the top and bottom. The left spine has black strings binding it in an X pattern. (Double needle binding?) There are a few errant holes from the awl used to pierce the leather, which I'm afraid will cause the thread to tear through over time. That isn't a big enough issue for me to dislike the journal, just an observation. The leather is very stiff - obviously not the highest quality leather - I'm confident it will soften up with use. (A question/thought...doesn't the Indian culture revere bovines? Does working with leather conflict with those deeply held beliefs? I don't know, just wondering. An Indian artist working with leather would seem to cause some inner strife. Maybe I'm wrong?)The closure is fantastically awesome! I can easily imagine it on a vintage box of some sort - but used as a closure on this book? Brilliant! I love the way it slides closed, securely locking itself. I don't believe there is any way to attach an actual lock to this journal or closure. If you are searching for a journal that locks to avoid prying eyes, this probably isn't the one you want.There are five signatures bound in this book. The description states there are ""80 pages"", but there looks to be more. I haven't counted all the pages (I don't want to take all the fun!), however there are 20 pages in the first signature. (Ten sheets folded/bound in half.) The paper has a very organic feel - there are little yellow flowers and green grasses made into the paper. This does add a slight additional texture to the (already) somewhat naturally textured paper. The paper has a nice feel to it. It accepts ink very well - ball point, roller ball, and pencil have been fantastic. Felt and fountain pens tend to bleed unless you're quick. My guess is that this is internally slack-sized paper. I definitely would not create my finest work on this paper! It is good for sketching and writing, but like most handmade paper, is too absorbent to hold crisp or fine details. As a mixed media artist, I strongly believe this paper would successfully accept adhesives, dry painting techniques, pastels, Gelatos, and graphite - and possibly watercolor, as long as it's on the drier side. I wouldn't attempt anything real wet with this paper - it's going to tear and degrade too quickly. As an art journal this is terrific as long as you keep those constraints in mind. If you are looking for paper to handle a larger range of media, try one of the journals available specifically for that purpose. (I have this Strathmore Mixed Media Art Journal, 5.5 by 8.5-Inch, 64 Pages and absolutely love it, along with this one Strathmore Visual Journal Spiral Bound 5.5""X8""-Mixed Media Vellum. Both are great depending on the type of binding, and overall look, you prefer.) Keep in mind the limitations of handmade paper - it has certain strengths, but it also tears and disintegrates relatively easy.I am very pleased with this journal and am looking forward to using it a lot. I will mainly use this for my thoughts, quotes and phrases I want to remember, sketching...kind of an overall ""Book of Me"". ;) There are much better journals on the market for art processes - as an overall catch-all to jot down everything from appointments to notes, and memories to pictures/sketches made with relatively dry media, this is perfect! (I don't want to discourage anyone from using ""wetter"" or ""heavier"" media in this journal - by all means, use whatever you want! You could probably get some beautifully dramatic backgrounds if you used alcohol inks, Hydrus Inks, etc. Using really wet supplies like that, combined with the flowers and leaves already buried in the paper, would create some truly magnificent background pages!)I would totally buy more of these for gifts, whether the recipient is creative or not. A wonderful size that's large enough to give you the space you need to actually write (or draw) something - the signatures are easily laid flat, giving you the option of writing (creating) all the way to the inner ""hinge"". (Probably the wrong term.) Unlike books like Moleskin journals, where you never can really get to the spot where the pages meet (that ""hinge"" part), this binding makes this easy. You can create a double-page spread without any difficulty. The size is also perfect for taking with you - whether you carry it or stick it in your bag.

"Ummmmm NO. These are NOT glow-in-the-dark. AT ALL. (I just noticed the headline states they are - which is completely false. I had totally forgotten they were supposed to glow-in-the-dark! They aren't...not even a little. I wrote the following review based on my experience BEFORE I saw they supposedly phosphoresce. I can't believe I forgot they were supposed to do that - if they glowed at all, I wouldn't have suggested adding glow-in-the-dark spray paint!)  ~  (I had originally given these four stars, but after seeing the false advertising, I'm changing my rating to three stars. These are not for you if it's important they glow-in-the-dark out of the package - I can't stress this enough.) Would I buy these again? Yes - but I'm truly annoyed at the misleading information. Such a blatant misrepresentation would normally produce a 0 star rating from me. Anyway, onto the review...I looked all over for skeletons like this, but couldn't find them locally. The price of these thin-plastic little guys seems a bit high to me for what you get. That said, these are so versatile and gravely cute, my regret was not purchasing more. They are made out of that thin, bendable plastic that is full of air (sorry - I forget what it's called, but it's the opposite of hard, extruded plastic) so they are easy to change or manipulate with minimal effort. It would be really fun to hang a bunch from the ceiling...and even more fun to remove the gauze and lightly spray the only the skeletons (or just the gauze) with glow-in-the-dark spray paint. These will definitely last for many seasons. Whether you choose to hang several, or just one, these skeletons will add tons of spooky flair to your Halloween decor.I changed mine quite a bit, removing the gauze wrap and cutting off the thin plastic loop (used for hanging) on top of the heads. With a few art supplies I had around, I ""dirtied"" up the gauze (mummified skeletons can't have clean gauze!), added a little hair, painted the nails black, and made tiny nooses for their necks. (The idea was to make them look like some people I know, but only a slight resemblance.) I re-wrapped each one in their gauze and hung them outside. Even though they got stuck in a pretty good rain, they stood up very well to the elements. I look forward to pulling them out again next year, but will have to purchase a few more to make the family complete. ;)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGUPUHUV01QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DJ56L0#wasThisHelpful","R1MGUPUHUV01QU","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adorable miniature pumpkins! All the jack-o-lanterns in my bunch are painted just as well as they are in the product photo - it's clear they are good quality. These are the perfect size for a fairy garden, but also have many uses as Halloween/fall home decor. The perfect addition to so many of my little scenes - next to tiny houses, on infinitesimal hay bales, sitting around the base of a tree, in the cemetery...the list goes on and on. My only problem - I should have ordered a second set! When purchasing online, it's always a crapshoot whether miniature items will actually match the photos provided, so as a sort of trial I only order one item/set at first. (I've spent too much hard-earned money on horribly painted, poor quality miniatures in the past.) These jack-o-lanterns are made of resin, so they'll last - and are truly just as cute as can be. Get some and see - BUT save yourself some shipping costs. If you think you may need more than six for your purposes, order multiple sets. You won't regret it!Tip: I can't remember being disappointed by anything I've ever purchased from Dollhouses and More LLC, although I try to wait and purchase a couple of things at once so the shipping charges don't seem so excessive. They offer an incredible selection of cute items so the problem isn't finding something you ""have"" to have - the difficulty is narrowing your order enough that delivery won't require multiple mail trucks showing up in front of your house!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QA649CFJMV7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCE7AXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QA649CFJMV7U","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to admit, I bought this more of a curiosity than anything else. I was looking at adhesives and it showed up in my search results. I was intrigued so I ordered it...along with the normal adhesive I use. (I didn't want to be left with some novel idea that didn't work and no adhesive!)The package arrived quickly, packed well for shipping - and included everything in the photo. When I first opened the little tin that holds the adhesive-filled little pen and light combo, I was truly surprised how flexible the pen-like part is. It makes sense, as squeezing the adhesive medium out of a slightly soft tube is much easier than a rigid cylinder - this adhesive is compromised of a kind of runny, gelatinous formula. It isn't overly liquidy (nice word!), but rather staying where I placed it. I love that a strong bond is achieved with small amounts of Bondic. I was worried when I tried to adhere objects I couldn't see through - after all, how is the little UV light supposed to penetrate solidly opaque surfaces and cure the adhesive? I finally came to the conclusion that I don't need to know HOW...as much as I need to know it WORKS. And it definitely works!I had used a glue gun to adhere a couple of Neodymium magnets to the backs of wood clothes pins. That method worked for about six months, but then I found the clothes pins laying on the kitchen floor after they'd fallen off the magnets. After scraping most of the glue gun residue off the clothes pins, I squeezed out two small dollops onto the clothes pins, placed the little round magnets over the dollops of wet Bondic. I began to apply the light, sure this wasn't going to work because the light couldn't really filter into the necessary spots. WRONG! After just a couple of seconds, I removed the light and carefully (gently!) tried moving one of the magnets. I was shocked when it didn't move at all!!I don't know the specifics of how this stuff works and frankly, I don't really care. My focus is how well the product works...and work it does! I am stoked at the seemingly unending list of items I can stick together with this. And let's be honest...holding the light on the curing glue is just FUN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R561L30GQK3K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU5M4L2#wasThisHelpful","R561L30GQK3K5","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is so much better than anything I had imagined!! First of all, it arrived much faster than anticipated - which I really appreciate. I ordered it late on a Wed, was due to arrive ten days later on Fri, but actually got here Mon. Not bad when something arrives four days early!I had no idea that this is as freaky as it is. It's almost...just...wrong. Unless you're twisted and looking to freak people out - then this is the perfect decoration for you! It is not motion activated, but rather it must be moved. I hung it on my back fence and every time the gate would shut (on its own - I didn't push or slam it), the motha' would go off. Ghostly, kind-of muffled nursery rhymes emanate from this 24"" thang. (Approximately 24"".) The baby is tucked safely in the old lady's arms, which may or may not be good. (No one will be grabbing this baby away from her!) The eyes light up and flash - they are the bright white LEDs. It is AWESOME!I bought several decorations this year - and made quite a few - this and the skeleton dog I bought (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KRLEG3Y?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) are tied as my favorites. This mother/baby combo is just plain CREEPY. There really isn't another word that fits as well. I think the front door would be the perfect place to hang this - it seems small to put on the ground. (Maybe a stake that would prop her up above something else in front of her to hide the stake?)She does require two AA batteries, which she does NOT come with. They are easily placed in the battery compartment, which is also where the ON/OFF switch is. Just a note: I would most likely not have purchased this when my kids were little. (Now that they are teenagers, all bets are off. I want to scare them silly! Haha) I think this would seriously scare most kids - and not in a fun way. You may want to consider that prior to purchasing...and perhaps before deciding on her location. She will definitely cause a stir, and people will certainly ask about her. She wickedly creeps you out. All that for less than $30? A delightfully good deal. Dare I say it's dead on?? A morbidly good deal? Of corpse it is!Seriously...I'm so glad I bought this. You should be dying to get one. If you get one, you will most likely want morgue. If you can't afford one, maybe your mummy could help you? Ahh, come on, don't be a baby - this mother really sings! Should I put a mort-atorium on this already? Well, that would just be rotten. I'm so sorry for this disgustion...please don't lose your decomposure. (I'm dying!) Oh this has become a grave situation...it's tomb much! This review has obviously turned into a malignant tomber. I will wrap this up <cough> by saying that this item is quite lively - and you will dig it.Now admit it.

"This is one of the good cases that I love. Sometimes it's hard to tell online what you're getting, especially if you aren't familiar with all the terms of cell phone cases. This has the rubbery top and bottom, which really protects your phone when you drop it. The gold is a pretty brushed gold and stands out with the black. The openings line up perfectly with all the buttons and charger port, and the buttons have the same rubbery feel that the top and bottom have.

"Black soap? Yes - and it's awesome! The shape is fantastic for holding in wet hands - it doesn't slip and slide out of your grip. It is very easy to lather up due to the shape, also. Just rubbing the bar between wet hands produces a great lather - the bar has these large gritty things embedded in it, which really help to make your skin feel clean. I love to gently rub the gritty bar directly onto my face, but I have to be really gentle and careful. It's too powerful for me to rub anywhere but on my cheeks, forehead and the bridge of my nose - but even just lathering the bar between my hands and then rubbing the lather onto my face produces skin so clean it literally squeaks, and so soft it's tough to keep your hands off of it.I use this bar at night and the pump in my morning shower. (http://www.amazon.com/Biore-Deep-Charcoal-Cleanser-Ounce/dp/B00NO2466K/ref=pd_sim_194_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=12GSJG3YPDA6SPVY59VM&dpID=41jkfx%2B14EL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_) Both have a slight minty scent, which surprised me - but I love. (The pump has little beads, which pop as you rub them in.) The scent isn't overpowering, it's just right. The bar leaves your skin fresh, brisk, and rejuvenated. You know the scrubbing bubbles that clean your bathroom? Every time I wash my face with this delicious bar, I visualize little scrubbing bubbles cleaning each individual pore...setting up the scaffolding, jumping into the pores and scrubbing like crazy, then using a tiny squeegee to make sure everything is nice, clean, and shiny...before packing up and moving onto the next pore.I'm so glad I found this - it has replaced the daily face wash I had used for years.

"Quite possibly the biggest piece of junk blanket I've ever purchased - whether it's for me or the dogs. I ordered several dog blankets this week as we just adopted (yet another) dog from the local shelter. Considered a small dog (Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound mix) anyway, she is very malnourished. The vet told me to make sure she's dressed as it gets colder (Denver winters can get downright cold!) and provide her with several blankets she can lay on. This was, by far, the worst of the blankets I purchased. It is the worst blanket I've ever bought - for anyone - at any price point.The fabric is thin. Big ""flakes"" of lint are coming off EVERYWHERE. The blanket is shedding worse than all three of my dogs put together. The edges are turned over and stitched pretty straight, but it's tough to use a blanket that leaves pieces of itself all over the place. It isn't very soft and definitely not real warm. The fleece is low quality. No one lays on this blanket, even though all 4 of the blankets were put in similar high traffic areas. For an additional $5, the dogs and I are infinitely happier with the DII Bone Dry Warm, Soft, Plush, Microfiber Pet Blanket for Couch, Car, Trunk, Cage, Kennel, Dog House, 36""x48"". (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KXX545A?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01) The other blanket may be smaller and cost more, but it's sooo much softer, warmer, and better than this one. They both shipped and arrived quickly.I would never put this in my car - I can't imagine trying to get the ""fleece flakes"" out of the carpet. It's a low quality piece of fabric that collects static electricity - and lint! - like crazy. If the choice is nothing but a cold floor and this, I would have to think about it. There isn't much heat generated from this and the blanket lacks fluff - it's just flat. I can't recommend this blanket.Photos: First and third photos show the ""fleece flakes"" left behind on my sheets after the blanket was had just been set on the bed for a minute. The second photo is the tag. Third photo shows how nicely the blanket is sown around the edges...the only positive quality I found in this blanket.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBSZU4D7S86C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJW2LRO#wasThisHelpful","R1HBSZU4D7S86C","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 6', 150 lbs daughter wears these and not only looks fabulous, but she loves the tops, too! Anyone who shops for a teenage girl knows the impossibility of finding something the mother and daughter can agree on. Although I'm pretty liberal (my daughter has had every color of the rainbow in her hair - six times each! ha), we still argue over what is appropriate. She's into dance and gymnastics, so I'm used to her wanting to wear yoga pants and tank tops...to the gym. When she began wanting to wear them as a sophomore in high school, I get a little, er, bent out of shape.I finally got over myself and we agreed that she can wear yoga pants/leggings in public (rather than just to the gym) as long as her hind end is covered. That's a tall order (ha) since she's beginning to pass the 6' mark. (My son is 6'9"", so who knows where she'll end up!) These shirts actually work - they are amazingly just long enough to cover her rear. The burnout pattern is cute without revealing too much. The colors are pretty and the pack of three is a nice selection. She's worn these shirts a lot - and they are a fair price. The sizing seems to run just a little large, but not enough to change ordering your normal size. I would definitely order these again - they're great for going to dance/gymnastics, the gym, and for wearing when you're out running errands.At most you are paying just under $10/shirt. These are a nice quality for that price and she wants me to order more...which I will do as soon as I finish writing this review. There are fun color combinations available - and it's very hard to beat the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LKBC0GN1VA1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8J8OGA#wasThisHelpful","R2LKBC0GN1VA1W","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For someone into mixed media art, these are exceptional! I could not be happier with these. I had a set of watercolor brush pens before, but they leaked all over and were just, frankly, a total pain in the butt. That hasn't been the case with these. I purchased these a few weeks ago and made sure I played with them quite a bit before posting a review. These lay down gorgeous color, which just gets darker and more intense the longer you keep the brush pen in one spot. Normally, when I use watercolors on top of modeling paste or spackle, the colors are very muted and soft. I have a hard time building up the color intensity over these other mediums - and it gets frustrating. The only way I can seem to get a good, solid color is to apply some clear gesso over the texture paste...but that hasn't been my experience with these.I am not a painter - and especially don't consider myself a watercolor expert. I just like to play...mixing paints and other mediums into strange soups and concoctions. I don't really pay attention to what I'm doing - I feel like adding something, or playing with some supply, and I go for it. If I don't like it I can always scrape it off, sop it up, or paint over it. This no-fear method has been working exceptionally well for me - and these are among the supplies I reach for the most. This will sound really odd (not if you knew me lol), but last night I used these to make gray male hair for a Styrofoam mannequin male head I'm making. (It's part of an all-out Halloween display I'm making for my back deck.) I unrolled a bunch of cotton balls (all I had on hand), put them in a little cup like the ones you get when you order take out and get a sauce. I painted the top of this cotton pile with the gray watercolor brush pen...then dumped water into the little cup. I began using my pan watercolors and a brush to add more gray and black to the cotton-filled water...but I wasn't getting the dark color I really wanted. Back to coloring the wet cotton with these brush pens.I left the cotton sitting in the blackish water for awhile, then carefully wrung out the excess water, spread out the cotton again, then left it sitting on parchment paper overnight so it could dry. It turned out wonderfully, thanks to these Akashiya Sai Watercolor Brush Pens. I just started adding the hair to the head, but it really looks like my neighbor, which is who I'm modeling this guy after. Yes, my use is conventional - but I LOVE these, no matter the purpose!!(I used the watercolor pens to add color to the textured flowers - done on a birch panel - in the first photo.

"This and the Layered Wildflower Stencil are my FAVORITES! I love how they look when used alone - and I love them when they are both used in one project. Suh-WEET! I will cop to owning WAY too many stencils...ok, art supplies in general. (I don't have a husband who tells me to stop buying these things...haha) This is the same quality Time Holtz, Stampers Anonymous, and Ranger are known for. The mylar stencil material is the perfect thickness - the stencil is firm, the design is fully cut out, and it's thick enough to make applying modeling paste (or other texture) very easy. It is sturdy, well as sturdy as a stencil can be that has more negative space than positive. I always have problems with the stencils made from cheap mylar - the little parts of the design (pieces that hang or stick out) always bend or allow whatever media you're working with to travel under the stencil. That doesn't happen with the Tim Holtz stencils I've used - and hasn't been an issue at all with this stencil in particular. You'll want to be much more patient and careful than I am when you clean your stencils...lest yours wind up with little bent pieces like tend to. (Which is totally my fault - using a toothbrush, especially an electric one - on this IS a little overkill. Little bit.)Easy and quick to clean. Holds up well - the image is as clean the 92nd time as it is the first time - the plastic mylar doesn't degrade. I haven't found an art supply yet that doesn't work well with these - besides using this to add texture, I like using watercolors on the texture paste I've used (I really love Faber-Castell's Whipped Spackle - a new-to-me supply that just ROCKS!), then wicking the color away from the edges with a paper towel, so the design kind of looks like it's melting into the board. I can't imagine the stencil trend will slow down any time soon, making these a terrific investment with truly countless uses.

"So this arrived without the spongy doe foot applicator. It was just the plastic stick - making it impossible to try. The primer won't adhere to the stick, so it's tough to even get enough out to try. Which is a big bummer since I was really stoked to try this after reading all the positive reviews. When I first saw the price I thought ""no way!""...but it kept calling to me, like the cookie jar your mom told you not to touch when you were 5. So I would come back and look at it, re-reading the reviews. Sooner-than-I-knew-what-was-happening-I-put-it-in-my-cart-and-checked-out-before-I-could-change-my-mind. It arrived quickly and I set it aside, dying to use it, but not willing to waste my new ""potion"" until I actually put on a full face of make up. (I don't wear make up everyday.)I had just the right occasion picked out...and as I began to apply my make up, the anticipation toward using this was building. Like a tidal wave. I reached for it...I had held the tube in my hands several times before, so it was a combination of the familiar and something new and exciting...I twisted open the very cool top...and...what the heck is this? This is weird - hadn't I read there was a spongy doe foot applicator? This was just a plastic stick with a minuscule blob of product on the end. I was torn for a minute...maybe I was mistaken and there wasn't a spongy doe foot applicator...maybe this is how women are applying it? So I raise the stick to my eye...and proceed to gash myself in my sensitive eyelid. OUCH! That was much sharper than I anticipated...""why do women put up with this crap??"" I wondered - aloud. I put it aside and applied the rest of my make up, kind of deflated that my new best friend let me down. (Wasn't this supposed to be life-changing??)I looked at the reviews and description again later that day - and sure enough, I had received a defective product. So...so...sooo (lip quivering) HEARTBREAKING! I contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller...who got in touch with me and requested photos. I took some and sent them back to the seller (the same ones I'm placing here) and the seller was very nice to refund my money.

After telling you about my experience, I kind of left it at that. In my brain, I figured I had left a review for the item I received and used...but I should have discussed the product here, too. I apologize for not doing that and instead, being a little lame in the brain. Below is the review portion of the response I sent to the commenter. It is still available in the comments - but I pasted this part up in the review so it's all together. I hope this is helpful! -KBThis seller did right by me, by refunding my money after I discovered the applicator was broken. I wanted to just exchange the broken one for a new one from this seller, but unfortunately they were sold out. I went to another seller and was able to buy the primer from them. I didn't post this review until I tried the primer. After reviewing my review (that sounds funny), I realize I didn't say much about the product. I found the product to be good, even though I don't know a whole lot about primers. It did keep my eye makeup on all day - and my eye shadow didn't crease. (It usually does.) I like how it makes my skin feel almost ""velvety"" when I put it on. I don't wear makeup often, but after using this I have reevaluated that habit and am wearing it more often. I think I quit wearing makeup because I was sick of spending time applying it in the morning, but by lunch I either needed to reapply - or spend the rest of the day looking like I'd never really put makeup on in the first place. Ok, I take that back - it looked like I put eye makeup on in my eyelid creases, and a some black stuff smudged under my eyes. This primer has totally fixed that - I can put on my makeup at 6 in the morning, and it stays until I take it off at 10:30 or 11 that night. I would say that's pretty good!Ironically, the second seller I purchased from shows an applicator in their product photo - but they sent me the wrong size. The smaller size they sent me does not come with an applicator, nor does it have the cool little prismatic top this one has. So I still haven't seen or tried the applicator! ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHRHRBVNAL8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01486C41O#wasThisHelpful","RYHRHRBVNAL8A","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I've ordered Faber-Castell's Whipped Spackle - I've always used modeling paste and been quite happy with it. I decided to try this because I'm always on the hunt for new products, and with Faber-Castell's home-run-hit with Gelatos has prompted me to try some of their new stuff. I've always liked Faber-Castell, but never really thought of them as being at the forefront of new art/craft trends. They've blown that incorrect ideation to smithereens with Gelatos. I can't get enough of those colorful, sumptuous sticks of goodness.I'm glad I gave this a try. I love how lightweight it is - the container weighs next to nothing! Getting the Whipped Spackle on my palette knife was easy and took no time at all. It was a light, creamy consistency. I know that with molding paste I sometimes have to stir is all up, then do a balancing dance from the modeling paste container to my project. One tiny little misstep and BLAM! I've made a mess where I've dropped the blob of modeling paste. That wasn't my experience with this stuff - it was very easy to scoop an appropriate amount onto the palette knife (even the really skinny, plastic palette knife!) and the product is so lightweight that it didn't cause the palette knife to tilt off-balance.I wanted to try it with a new stencil I had just received from Tim Holtz, Layered Wildflowers. The whipped consistency made it so easy to spread the spackle - and it fit into all the little stencil crevices in the most amazing way! I kept looking at all the thin little stems on the stencil, checking to see what areas I would have to go over again. Umm...NONE! This dreamy paste fully filled even the tiniest of spaces. That is something I can rarely say about modeling paste, since it is usually my experience that modeling paste can be difficult to get into small crevices - without it traveling under the stencil and making an awful mess. This was so much easier to control - to me it was like frosting a cake with peanut butter (modeling paste) for years, then frosting a cake with thinned frosting or softened butter. The consistency is that easy - and there is that much difference between the two.Don't let the ease of application fool you - this stuff is SUPER strong once it has cured. It dries pretty quickly, doesn't lift or peel, and dries hard enough to sand it. I haven't tried to carve it when it's dry as I find it is easier to quickly draw designs in it while it is still wet. I wouldn't think twice about using my Dremel on this. It is also really easy to color - on the photos I've included I didn't add color until it was dry, but then I quickly (sloppily) painted the raised areas with watercolors. Gelatos, acrylic paints, tints, Perfect Pearls, etc - I can't think of anything that wouldn't color this stuff. If you are looking for a fun new supply to play with, while wanting something that has strength and durability, you've stumbled across an awesome item that I would absolutely recommend. I like this so much that I don't believe I will return to regular modeling paste once this container of Whipped Spackle is finished. This would be great for experienced artists as well as those new to the arts and crafts arena.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDD2MJNUCKFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBKWBLC#wasThisHelpful","R2DDD2MJNUCKFX","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs LOVE these. I have say that upon opening the bag, the smell does seem enticing - the aroma of fresh beef jerky wafts from the bag. If I wasn't paying attention, I would probably eat one of these by mistake, just based on their smell. Yep - it's that good! (Even the back of the package says ""These treats smell so good you might want to eat one, but they are not for human consumption"". Haha!)The sticks are about 8"" and are packaged in a resealable foil pouch. Even keeping these resealed in the pouch does not keep them from getting a little hard over time, though. (My dogs gobble them up so fast that I'm not even sure they notice!) About every 3/4"" of an inch there are lines in the meaty stick, making it very easy for the person to tear them up into bite-sized treats - and there are approximately 10 bite-sized chunks to a stick. This also makes these so easy to carry in my pocket to use a potty training and barking-cessation incentives.The pouch proudly proclaims ""Made in the USA"" and it lists an address of Provo, Utah, USA. I think they are right on to be proud of that fact as I know the country of manufacturing is one thing I look for when purchasing items for my dogs. (I have three small dogs - a teacup Chihuahua, a Chorgi (Chihuahua + Corgi), and a Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound mix that we acquired only about a week ago.)IngredientsBeef, Rice Protein, Spices, Salt, Sugar, Garlic Powder, Sorbic Acid. The package also states ""No wheat, soy, corn, or gluten"". All of that sounds great to me!I am unable to find the serving information anywhere on the package, but I give my pups a few of the .75"" chunks I tear up when we go on our walks and they do something great...and I give them any leftovers when we return home. The real bonus is that you can get these $10 cheaper here, on Amazon, than you can get them on the company's website. What's not to love about these??","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W3GGTRF2X185/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2ZS5VM#wasThisHelpful","R2W3GGTRF2X185","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter and I have the same size feet, so even though I bought these for her, we both wear them. I think they are so comfortable! There is not much support, but since I've worn Keds for years, that doesn't really bother me. Converse are the only brand that don't rub the top of my big toe (around the nail) wrong - I can wear these for hours and not have my big toe hurt from the pressure of the top of the shoe. These are really cute - they are easily grunged down or can be dressed up with jeans and a cute shirt.Bottom Line: There are few things that a 15 year old girl and her mom agree on - but we both like these shoes. We now have 3 pairs - light pink, black, and these ""optical white"" ones - and there are days when we argue over who gets to wear these. The only complaint I have is that every pair we own makes a cardboard popping sound when you walk. It's toward the ball of the foot - and when the shoe creases, there is an audible sound coming from the shoe. It's weird! I don't have any other shoes that do this, but all three pairs on the Converse do. It isn't bad enough that I'll stop wearing these - I love them! - but it's just something weird I've noticed and thought I would pass on, in case someone else has the same issue. I usually prefer going barefoot or just wearing socks - but I don't mind wearing these cool shoes. I can honestly say they are like wearing nothing - and my daughter says she agrees. I will be buying more colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM867OIBUECQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DU3YE0#wasThisHelpful","RM867OIBUECQC","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or leopards.I have never sat in a tree, pondering small things I could not see.I have lived my entire life, without ever wanting to play a fife.I have traveled both near and far - and never missed owning binocular(s).As you can see from my well-written prose, I've been fine with glasses held up by my nose.I don't recall aching for close up views - I've never felt slighted or gotten the blues.I thought I was looking at things just fine, but with these you'll see a balding man's hairline.The binoculars, strap, and cleaning cloth are all brand new - thank you for reading this lame ol' review!I deducted half a star because I have a difficult time seeing out of them - they don't seem to fit my face very well. I am so not a binoculars expert, but I like how well these magnify distant objects. The price was perfect for someone who doesn't need or want ""top of the line"", but wants to utilize the benefits of binoculars on an occasional basis. I like the bigger front lens and 12x magnification is awesome for my viewing needs. I haven't tried the waterproof feature, however I can see surprisingly well with these at night. I would recommend these - especially for first-time buyers and those who will use them for fun. I'm guessing a sniper might need something a little better...but I'm not sniping anything, so I think these are great.

"Hangs securely from the wall, freeing up the drawer I normally throw the hair dryer in. I also don't have to deal with leaving that drawer partially open anymore - without having cords poking out from the drawer my knees are saved from smacking them on the side of the drawer. (We all know how comfortable that is!) This saves a ton of space and doesn't look goofy on the wall. My hair dryer fits perfectly in it - and I would think many sizes of dryers would comfortably fit. That's the genius of this design - the dryer can sit further in (or further back) the holder depending on the width of the nozzle.

"This fine little contraption has remedied the problems related to my inability to remember to turn off our back porch light during the day. I use the GE 90w halogen bulb (I get them in two packs at Wally World) and they work perfectly with this adapter. The shipping is extremely quick and the item is ready to go right out of the box. There is a way to fine tune the sensor if you need to tweak it, but it worked just as it arrived. I didn't have to even mess with it. I like how this is saving the bulb so it only runs at night - and I don't have to remember to turn it on and off. It causes the light to come on when it is nearly totally dark outside - about the same time my car would activate the headlights. Since it faces east, it flips off in the morning before I even notice it's on.This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long while!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDKWDLWVCEZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQWOHA#wasThisHelpful","RFDKWDLWVCEZA","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love, love, LOVE. Go buy some! It would be very easy to stop my review right there, but that doesn't really tell you why this stuff is so great.All of the stupendous properties of gesso, in a clear medium. No chalky, thick white stuff anymore - you can't see this when it dries. Much like gel medium, it goes on with a whitish tint - but dries crystal clear. How do they get all the goodness of gesso in this stuff - and keep it clear? My favorite bonus of this stuff is the ability to draw or paint - then mix this with clear varnish (also by Liquitex) in equal parts and apply it to my piece before going onto the next layer. The varnish seals in the previous layer and the clear gesso provides a perfect surface for the next layer. It leaves the perfect amount of tooth on your surface to really grab onto whatever you add next. And you can see the layer under it! No longer are you torn between adding more gesso while obliterating the work you've already done, or living with a less than ideal surface so you can see what's under the gesso. This opens up a whole new world of beautiful surfaces you can paint on. It's awesome - and the price on Amazon is...WOW! Less than half what HL charges - on the rare occasion I can locate it there.Liquitex Professional Clear Fesso Surface Prep Medium makes me swoon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TFUNV9JOYAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UNPDCG#wasThisHelpful","R11TFUNV9JOYAK","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the look of these lights - they come nicely wound on a piece of cardboard, making them very easy to put on a project. (No tangled mess right out of the box...but, if you're like me, the tangled mess is just waiting for YOU to get your hands on them!) They also put off a very pleasing amount of light. I really like how they make my old train lantern look - with glass on both sides, the lanterns almost seem to glow. Beautiful! However...the problem I have isn't with the beauty of the lights - it has more to do with the honkin' size of the solar panels.I thought I would be able to hide the panels inside the lanterns - if they were placed in the back of the lantern there should be enough sunlight traveling through the glass to allow the lights to recharge. Maybe that's true...but the panels are so huge that there is NO WAY they are fitting in the lantern. The solar panels do come with stakes so you can firmly plant them in the ground, which would be awesome if I were placing these lights on a bush or something. Trying to wrap the wire from the panels to the actual light string was somewhat comical - I didn't want to wind them too tightly or the light wouldn't swing on the shepherd's hook like it's supposed to. Wrapping them more loosely meant I didn't have enough unlit wire to reach from the lantern to the ground. (The lantern is hanging about 4' above the ground.) Winding the wire down the shaft of the shepherd's hook is the only way I can try to hide the massive panels.These are just not right for my project. The panels are easily moved to face any direction thanks to the brilliant hinged design, so it is easy to make sure they get enough sun to charge the lights all night. My lights kick on about 7pm and start to fizzle around 3am - I'm very happy with that length of time. I would order these again if I had a place to hide the panels - just be aware they are really big. (They are 3.5""x5"", and that's just the panel part - not including the hinged back or the stake.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRXORFV1GZ9BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123L8ON8#wasThisHelpful","RRXORFV1GZ9BL","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fantastic for erasing in tight spaces. I use these so much in my art - I don't know what I would do without them. The awesome pen-like cover keeps the erasers nice and clean, advancing just as much as you need based on how many ""clicks"" you push the eraser out. It's just as easy to retract the eraser back into the housing. The refills are easy to find and the price is awesome. These last forever!

"As a pen and marker freak, I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about with these. It is a nice storage box of 15 brush-like markers. I was in love with the Stamper's Big White Pen and began using it as soon as it was released. It's a great pen, but it's more about the color for me. I have a lot of trouble with white pens and markers, so when I find a good one, I stick with it. My love for that marker pen is what led me to this kit.I am just not real impressed. Being a pen and marker mutant means that I have a lot of markers and pens. A LOT. With all the positive reviews I've seen on these, I guess I thought they were something ""new"" and ""better""...but that hasn't been my experience. They are good markers - don't get me wrong. However, at Amazon's price of $58.50, that's $3.90 each. (I've seen these sets listed at scrapbooking and stamping stores for upwards of $80!) There is a wide range of pens and markers available in the $4 price range. I believe that $4 is a pretty good amount of money to spend on one pen or marker - especially if the writing instrument doesn't offer anything unique or special. I've thought this about the Copics and the Spectrum Noir markers I have. (I realize I'm comparing alcohol markers to India ink.) I like that these are waterproof, but they can smear - it happened on a wood panel I was working on.This is a good set to acquire if you are a stamping maniac - a bit pricey, but good quality. For more experienced artists who ave accumulated tons of pens and markers, I would give some thought as to whether you really need these in your collection. They are redundant for me - I have lots of other markers with various inks, including some with India ink. I also have India inks (in pure ink form) that I can use or put in an empty marker barrel if I need the ink in marker form.Gelatos are a totally different type supply...but I would much rather spend my money on Gelatos than on these. I like them so much more and think they are really versatile and interesting to work with.The colors are strong and pretty. I like using these and I enjoy how smoothly they draw. The color lay down is nice, which I believe is due to the nibs. The nibs are like a nice paintbrush - they spring back after using them and are pretty decent at laying down a fine line. (Not real fine - remember, these are fat markers...but the line can be as thin as the nib. The nib doesn't splay out as soon as it touches paper.) I'm not a big stamper so I'm not sure how these do with stamps...but I can tell you that they are ok for mixed media. Certainly nothing you must have in your collection, but a good start if you are just getting into the creative game. I'm probably going to get nailed for this review, but I can't honestly give them five stars - I don't think they are outstanding enough to deserve that rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZQLPS9T76NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078BNONY#wasThisHelpful","R19ZQLPS9T76NT","A250DNGLGA39FO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A250DNGLGA39FO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom used Bounce when I was growing up and because of that, it has always been included in my laundry adventures. The smell is delicious, but not overpowering. As the price has slowly climbed over the years, I have tried generic brands. Every store brand I've tried has not come anywhere close to the predictable results of Bounce. When I got rid of my ancient washer and dryer a few years ago in favor of new HE machines (big mistake!), I changed over to a well-known, liquid, blue fabric softener based on the recommendation of the salesman. WHOOPS! I wound up throwing over half that bottle away - and returned to Bounce.Bounce makes my clothes soft and they smell good. I will admit to not fully knowing about static cling until I changed brands of fabric softener, but upon crawling back to Bounce, every single time I was quickly reminded how static cling doesn't have to play even the slightest role in your laundry, or life. The price I've found here on Amazon absolutely blows away the prices demanded by local stores - we're talking about paying a THIRD of local prices. If I can buy three of these on Amazon for the cost of one locally - including shipping - I'm sold! I truly don't know why anyone would waste their money on another fabric softener...Bounce is that good. I have a lifetime of experience being surrounded by fabrics dried with it...and that won't change anytime soon.

"Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review.So, I am actually using this as my primary wallet at this point. It has the 6 slots, which I basically use for 3 bank cards, a local store card, my ID, and my insurance card. I also have kept some cash in one of those as well (I'll leave the 3rd bank card at home when I actually have cash to carry).That is basically a full load for this, so if you plan to carry a lot more, you should either invest in something larger, or include this in your daily stuff.It actually looks a little bit like a cigarette case, lol, although smaller. Basically, it's the size of your cards, with about a quarter inch thickness.I've also tested it on some card scanners, and it does block the scanners, so from that standpoint, it does effectively handle its advertised duty.It looks nice and so far has been quite durable. I'll be interested to see how long the clasp holds up (it's a little push clasp that seals it).

"Helldivers is hella fun!Seriously, right now, I cant think of a better co-op experience. The action is tense, the maps look cool, and the enemies are tough without being overwhelming, and even when they roll over you, the game never feels cheap. You can revive yourself as long as you are still able to crawl, a teammate can expedite the process, and if you do die, your teammates can set a beacon that revives you. There are a ton of upgrades to your weapons, special abilities (which take the form of calling in ammo, special equipment, ally revives, etc...), and so on. There are two different vehicles your team can pile into that are also armed. The missions make sense.Anyway, this twin stick squad shooter basically gets everything right.

"Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for a fair and honest reviewSo, overall I think this stand does its job well. The fans do keep the PS4 noticeably cooler. It's also nice that while it takes one of your two USB ports from your PS4, it adds three. Also, being able to use it as a charging hub for your controllers is nice as well. Time will tell how good this really is, but so far I would say it is above average with two noteworthy negatives.One is that it is loud. Much louder than the PS4 itself. That definitely needs to be worked on.Two is that it isnt really secure.

"Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for a fair and honest reviewSo, this little charger has actually been a revelation. For one thing, it actually fits the port in the car perfectly, which is actually pretty rare with these car chargers, meaning that you dont have to keep pushing it in to keep it working. It's in and it's staying in. Additionally, it does charge pretty fast. I can charge my Win 8 phone completely in the time it takes me to get to work (so about 20-25 minutes), which is nice.The little cup that comes with it is nice. The vent bracket that comes with it doesnt fit in my cars vents (Nissan standard), so that is something to consider for future production, but the cup itself is nice and does in fact keep my phone secure and safe from jostling and such. It is also convenient for pens, keys, and such.This product I would definitely buy had I not received a review copy.One note with all of these chargers is that they typically lose some effectiveness after three months or so....so I will monitor that and adjust my review if necessary after three months have elapsed (we're at about three weeks right now since review copies were sent out).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQD8OSKJMZ4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I3Y1ZW#wasThisHelpful","R1IQD8OSKJMZ4W","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest reviewSo, I had the opportunity to test this out over the better part of the last two weeks or so, and my findings are as follows:The bag itself is very nice looking. The product page pic is accurate, so you can get a good sense for its appearance. That yellow box-ish thing on the side of the pic actually goes into the main pouch and essentially serves as the frame for the bag and the compartment for carrying your camera. It has a little zippered mesh pouch on the inside of that top flap, and the flap itself velcro seals. Additionally, the actual main compartment can be zippered shut. The outside pouches arent very large, but big enough to carry small accessories, a cell phone, keys, and so on. There are two in the front and one on each end of the bag. There is also another zippered pouch on the inside. All in all, this bag is definitely ideal for a photographer.It does have one real flaw however which keeps me from giving it five stars, and that is the fact that the bags flap doesnt really stay closed, making using the inside zipper a necessity. It has two button on the flaps straps which close, but they are strong enough to stay closed with even the lightest contact. That definitely needs to be fixed with later production runs of this bag. Also, while you can use the straps on the top flap as a handle if you dont want to use the shoulder strap, there isnt really a top handle like with most messenger/photographer bags I have owned. Now, the fact that the flap doesnt stay closed would render this useless anyway, but assuming they fix the design flaw with the flap, I figure they would also want to add a carrying handle to the top as well.Anyway, in my opinion this is a good bag, solidly built, and with plenty of convenient features. As things stand now, I can still recommend it, but I'd like to see the issues I mentioned worked on as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3075VDZG0FBFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SQ0ERI#wasThisHelpful","R3075VDZG0FBFJ","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received these in exchange for a fair and honest reviewSo, these insoles conceptually are a great design. Because they are 3/4 sized, they dont fill up your shoe, which I have found to be an issue with insoles as there typically isnt enough room for your toes and you insole in most shoes that I wear.They are also truly comfortable when worn. I dont know about massaging per se, but they are soft and feel nice.However, they have a real design flaw in that they slide around, and so what starts as a very comfortable experience soon turns to aggravation. In fact, if you arent in a position to adjust them for whatever reason, they will definitely start to hurt your feet once they start to slide.So, sadly i cant recommend these. If they fix the design to keep them from sliding around, they would easily earn a 5 star rating, but right now, they are only good for an hour or two before they slide, and so arent worthy of your purchase unless you arent on your feet for long periods of time (in which case I would definitely recommend them). Hopefully that aspect is fixed with future production of these insoles.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFLICQ55O9J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZ3DUO2#wasThisHelpful","R1OFLICQ55O9J3","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've had the opportunity to test the charge a reasonable amount now. I cant speak to storage degradation yet, as that typically only reveals itself over a few months based on my experience, but what I can speak to is the fact that this charger/flashlight does hold enough power to charge my Win8 phone twice with a little power left (enough to leave the flashlight on for another half hour or so before it drains completely). It's definitely the perfect size to carry around in your pocket, and the charge cord that came with mine is also short enough to be carried around comfortably as well. It also features a wrist strap, which is an uncommon but very welcome addition. Beyond that, the flashlight itself is pretty bright. Definitely good enough for walking down a dark hallway, looking through packages, checking some stuff out under the hood of your car, and so on.

"Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for a fair and honest reviewSo, this was a cool and unexpected review request that caters to a couple of my interests (music, oriental instruments, Zelda), so I was definitely going to try this out.First off, it's not very large. The Ocarina fits in the palm of my hand. The product page picture is pretty exact as far as its appearance goes, and it comes with a nice travel pouch, a lanyard, and a little booklet that teaches you the basics of playing this instrument. The actual craftsmanship is really top tier as well. Nice finish, gloss, and firing.Obviously, to become truly proficient, you will need to practice this quite a bit, but it was simple enough to pick up the basics as demonstrated in the booklet. The tone is pretty spot on from what I can tell by comparing it to some random ocarina tunes I looked up after receiving this. It sounds quite pleasant. It shares a lot of commonality with a variety of old school flutes produced in the various ancient cultures of the world.All in all, I would say this is a wonderful little instrument that will be fun for kids and adults alike, and may have more uses than imagines (such as taking it with to a Comiccon and such).It's easy to recommend this instrument.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NWRO5TVP4K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OSWG9U#wasThisHelpful","R6NWRO5TVP4K1","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this game a lot. It was a stellar mix of action with an amazing movie tied in. The voice acting was top notch as were the graphics, and the pacing was excellent. Additionally, the level design worked well with this game, and some of the levels were just flat out awesome. Additionally, I loved the new IP created for this with the Knight of the Round Table in a steampunk late 1800's setting. I really have nothing bad to say about this game. To me, much like Ryse, this game was panned unfairly in my opinion. I dont think I would have been stoked to pay $60 for this game, but I purchased it for $20 and felt like I got well more than my money's worth out of it. I hope they continue with the series, as this was designed to be the first in what will probably be a trilogy if they continue with the IP.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMORDR6PQSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBLBMBQ#wasThisHelpful","RAMORDR6PQSE","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fascinating tale of exploration and the retracing of exploration with very real care and attention paid to detail. Mr Grann really does this entire topic justice and honors both the dead and the living as he explores the mysteries surrounding Sir Percy Fawcett's final expedition, and also does a great job of detailing the mans life leading up to that final fateful journey from which he never returned. Plus, Mr Grann happens to basically complete the journey for the long deceased Fawcett through diligent research and perseverance in the face of adversity. I found this to be a compelling and fascinating book that I simply could not put down once I had begun reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KRDUHJKPJNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400078458#wasThisHelpful","R28KRDUHJKPJNN","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very interesting read, if taken as the gathering of ideas and facts found by others and compiled into one book. A lot of good information makes its way into this publication, and it is actually a fairly engaging read. However, there are some glaring issues with some of the dates and such in the book. A lot of things presented as fact are actually wrong (and you can find a decent summation of these things in some of the other reviews, so I wont rehash them here). Also, there is a huge leap from the history of the Templars during the Sinclair and Columbus ages to the assumption that pirates were almost all Templars or influenced by them. Outside of the aforementioned actual errors with timelines and the people involved, the leap of faith in this regard is fairly unacceptable. I actually believe that a lot of the Templar fleet and their crews did in fact become pirates, but there needs to be more research into it rather than simply wanting it to be so, and then making the claim in a book as has happened here. To me, this reads more as a fanciful idea of what was rather than a factual one. The author wanted it to be so, and so represented things from his viewpoint rather than do his due diligence in investigating how the Templar fleet really could have become the Pirates of the Caribbean and such as is claimed within.Now, I did enjoy reading this book, but the intellectual laziness and questionable ethics involved in actually writing it force me to give this only two stars, and if it wasn't such a fun read, I would have given it one star.Also, there are a ton of editing issues as well. Somebody probably should have proofread this book before publishing it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34IR4H7OX786Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931882185#wasThisHelpful","R34IR4H7OX786Z","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably the best controller I have ever owned. It is super comfortable and just the right size, and the addition of the touch pad was nothing short of brilliant. This really is the top tier controller design at this point....except for the battery life. For as much effort as they put into this controllers design, you would think they would have thought through things better when it came to the POS battery they included, and since it's not really removable, you are kind of stuck with what you get, which, given some of the other features of the gamepad such as the cool light, fairly well guarantees that you will get at best between 4 to 6 hours per charge. When you consider that a pair of AA batteries gets me around 30 hours of life for my 360 gamepads AND the fact that I can use rechargeable batteries for them, this was an unacceptable design choice on Sony's part, and as such, I knock a star off the rating to reflect this fact. It really is an amazing controller, but seriously Sony....get your stuff together and remedy the battery situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAZY2A27M20P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9X9W#wasThisHelpful","R1SAZY2A27M20P","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an essential device if you enjoy PC gaming but want to use a wireless controller. It's plug and play and picks up your controller signal from quite a ways away actually (I've tested out to 75 feet and across two stories). People have a tendency to leave this on top of their towers. I would advise against that. The only reason these typically stop working is do to heat exposure (or water damage) from what I've seen.

Visually, it is pretty stunning at times, the action sequences such as they are, look really cool, and all the actors seemed to be having a great time. The kid really steals the show.

"I didnt buy this since it was offered as a Plus freebie, but I have played it almost exclusively for like two weeks now and have all but the 500km and plat trophy as of this posting. Anyway, this game is simply good addictive fun that ends up taking over your life, lol. Soccer played in rocket powered cars/vans. Laughably simple idea executed to perfection. It features offline seasons and exhibitions so you can play by yourself against bots (not sure if there is local co-op or not) as well as a full tutorial broken down into sections to teach the basic mechanics of the game. However, online matches are definitely the way to go. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 (ranked matches dont include the 4v4 chaos though). You have basic mathces and ranked matches. Ranked matches are a little more tricky because when somebody quits (and somebody always ends up quitting at some point), the match doesnt autopopulate with anybody queued to play or with bots, so your teams can end up unbalanced. Of course, the flip side of this is that when you win a 1 or 2 on 3 match, it is especially sweet! Speaking of autopopulating, that's what happens in non ranked matches as people quit. It just fills the void, either with another player or, if another player isnt available for whatever reason, it fills the blanks with bots.So, thems the basics. There is turbo boost, acquired by running over little turbo buffs located at specific spots in the arena (they are always at the same spots, and reset after like 15 seconds), which fills your counter part way (except for 6 100% boost buffs located on the axis points). You can use the boost to literally fly, drive on the walls, and for a little while, even on the ceiling, giving this game a 360 degree 3D aspect to it. Anything can potentially happen at anytime, and the matches are often chaotic as can be. That said, when a team gels, it is something to behold. Which leads me to another aspect.....team building. Via invites, you can make sure that you and up to 3 of your friends can play on the same teams for every match, giving you the ability to develop in game strategies, made even easier if everybody uses headsets.Anyway, that is a quick summation of this game. Once you play, you will likely want to keep on playing for a while. It is just some of the best fun to be had out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8OOGJCTBY9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R8DUFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L8OOGJCTBY9J","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this and one other bottle from the distributor in exchange for a fair and honest review. The results were the same with both (outside of their cosmetic differences), so I will be posting both reviews identically.Anyway, as I sit here typing this review, I am literally sipping from this bottle. So, there is that.The pink top and base are fairly basic, but my wife likes it (and this one is hers, so that works out quite well).The double walled glass (glass inside plastic) does definitely make it more durable as my butter fingers can attest to, having already dropped it a couple times, lol.The cap screws on and feature a nice, wider spout to drink from, which I found to be an unexpected and pleasant surprise. It also features an actual locking system to keep it from just popping open inadvertently (it's a hinge top lid). It's a simple safety switch (basically looks like a slliding light switch). This makes it super reliable and convenient under any number of circumstances. Finally, it has a nice handle on top as well, which is adustable up and down and can be used to carry or hang the bottle as you see fit.It does hold exactly 16 ounces with no overflow.I've also noticed that the double layers insulate my drinks a little better, meaning they stay cold longer.Cleaning it is super easy since it isnt that difficult to take the inside bottle out.The only actual complaint I have is that the info sheet is packaged between the layers making your first time removing the glass a little difficult (and you will need to in order to remove the sleeve).

"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest reviewThis is an ultra beefy charger with a large bank and fast charge times.It's actually pretty lightweight and about the same size as a cell phone except a bit thicker.The charger itself can actually be charged about twice as fast as a comparbly sized power bank, and it actually adjusts to the requirements of the devices you are charging to ensure a fast charge every time. Plus, that 10k bank means you can charge a lot of devices before needing to refill the powerbank, making it perfect for travelling or extended time away from a convenient charging station/computer/etc....It has a power button as well, which is actually a pretty nice feature and has 4 LED indicators for charge levels (each represents 25% of the charge bank).All told, this is actually the single best charger I own.

"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for an honest reviewWe were pretty stoked to be able to test this out as my wife and I were actually in the market for one at the time iHome made this review request to us, so fortuitous timing.As far as this diffuser goes, it's more in the subtle realm of diffusers. It works, and works well, but it will take a while for the scent to reach all the corners of your home. That isnt a negative at all in my opinion. Rather than be overwhelming, it provides a nice background scent, which I personally really appreciate.We didnt have any issues opening the diffuser, which I have read is one of the larger compalints about this one. We thought it was pretty easy to manage. We did find it to be a little resistant or stiff however.It is worth noting that this doesnt really hold 160ml. It does hold 110ml safely, and that is more than adequate, but the basin size was a bit misrepresented. You can probably get 160 ml in it, but I wouldnt recommend it.As far as cleaning it goes, we've really just used warm water, which has been sufficient. You dont add enough essential oil to the water for it to really retain the scent after a simple rinse (at least, we dont).It seems to run for a good 3 or 4 hours before needing to be replenished.Also, the lighting looks really cool. We often turn this on at night, and it definitely is pleasing to the eye. It's also fairly unobtrusive and can be placed almost anywhere easily.All told, a very nice product. I'd like to see the pieces come apart a bit mroe easily and also would like to see the specs clarified a bit better, but all told, it's definitely a worth owning item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1292HP8NQICJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQD8LU8#wasThisHelpful","R1292HP8NQICJP","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I saw these dudes opening for Mastodon and Gojira a year or so ago, and I'm not even sure where to begin. The singer came out with a stuffed owl being worn as a headdress, which I cant say I've ever even contemplated before, much like seen. They then proceeded to rock the house. Clearly I had been missing out on some awesome rock, so I immediately went out and bought this album from a local CD shop. It exceeded my expectations. sometimes, thinking back on a show, you can romanticize somethign so it becomes greater in memory than it is in reality. Not so with this band. This album is raucous, non stop in your face rock. Sometimes it teeters on being metal, sometimes it pulls from older rock and metal influences, and sometimes it is almost stoner rock.

"So, the first I really heard of these guys was seeing them open for Mastodon and Clutch recently, and I was pretty blown away by their catchy old school riffs and the fact that their singer can flat out wail, so I went out and bought this album from a local CD store (GrayWhale). It has exceeded my expectations. I have since read a lot of comparisons to Sabbath, and those are apt, but they dont really tell the whole tale. You really gotta throw in a heavy dose of Clapton/Cream and sprinkle in some Donovan (yes Donovan) to get the whole picture I think. However, these guys arent just regurgitating old riffs. They are bringing it with a fresh look at an older genre of music and recapturing the awe and almost mystical nature that music held back in the day.

"Disclaimer: I received this in exchange for a fair and honest reviewThis dehumidifier works great! We have a swamp cooler in our house, and so this has become a tool of necessity. One clear indication that it is working (outside of the fact that the air feels notably dryer) is that the little water basin fills up in a day or two at most. A cool side effect is that this water is apparently potable (I havent tested this out, lol, but I imagine it could come handy in a pinch). Speaking of....their is a little indicator on it that lets you know when the tank is full and it auto shuts off as well so you dont overflow the basin.It's also completely unobtrusive. It will pretty much fit anywhere, is lightweight, and has a long enough cord to give you options for placement.For us, this has been a stellar product that is actually in use every day.

"Received as part of a Kickstarter reward for backing the game.So....this game was everything I hoped for and more. Obsidian really set the bar for CRPG's. Beyond that, I think Avellone and company really elevated their game further as far as their story writing goes as well. Just flat out superb, seamless, and fairly well flawless IMO.There has been a lot written about this game already, obviously, but I will say that with all the hype and all the funding that went into this, the potential for a let down was great, so to have the game not only deliver, but deliver in such grand fashion was amazing.The character development was deep and fulfilling and the quests actually made sense....rather than just simple fetch and escort quests with no rhyme or reason, everything had an actual reason in this game, and even where they didnt serve to advance the main story, they still had a very real role in filling out the depth of the world itself.The actual story line itself was pretty gripping. The end of Act 1 gave you the sense of a journey really just beginning, the end of Act 2 was a ""holy !"" moment, and the end of Act 3 let you know there was no turning back and that everything was about to get all too real as you approached the end of the game. That doesnt even factor in some of the other, non main quests story lines that develop throughout the game, which are also stellar.The journey itself was filled with pretty much any emotion you can imagine. The moral choices were often difficult due to the realistic consequences that come with every decision.Speaking of decisions, quite a few of them factor into the ending...and speaking of endings, I cant remember another game that had such a well thought out one. There also seems to be potential for a lot of variations to the ending depending on what choices you made at pivotal moments throughout. My ending was a fair mix of incredibly good and depressingly bad consequences to what I had done during my extensive playthrough. I loved that fact.I am thoroughly impressed with this game, and I have to give it the edge over Baldurs Gate 2 as maybe the best CRPG of all time, and a top 5 all time great game from any genre.I have a lot more to say, but so vast was the story and so deep the experience, that I think maybe it's better if I leave the rest unsaid and let you form your own opinion instead.Play this.Can there be a 15 out of 10?

"I didnt love this keyboard at all. For one, it is tiny...much smaller than you really get a sense for. However, and more importantly, the keys not only arent responsive, but when they do register, they often stick, and you truly have to peck hard to get it to respond to begin with. Also, that little touch mouse on the side....picks up indirect motion....meaning you dont have to touch it for it to respond, which is kind of funny in a way since it is hyper sensitive while the keys are the complete opposite. It is possible that I got a defective unit, but I would lean in a different direction if I was looking for a smaller keyboard.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEJ06GIHE92I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKZTMG#wasThisHelpful","R1MEJ06GIHE92I","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really been loving this keyboard. I wasnt certain going in, what with the hilarious typos in the product description due to a shaky grasp of the English language, lol, but actually, it's truly been great. The backlighting is nice as is the ability to change colors. I generally stick with blue, but none of the three are obtrusive and all help out under low light circumstances.The key layout I especially appreciate. It is set up exactly the way I would expect (and having tried out a number of keyboards, I can tell you that a lot of companies dont stick with this tried and true format for some reason). Additionally, while the keys are firm, they never stick and are completely responsive. The keyboard is also the perfect size. None of the keys are too large or too small. This was definitely made with everybody in mind. I have large hands, but my wife has small hands, and both of us use this keyboard without any issues and in fact, it is completely comfortable.I use it for a pretty fair mix of general typing and k/m gaming, so I can definitively affirm its usefulness/comfort/efficiency under both circumstancesIt is also quite durable. It's been knocked around, dropped, stepped on, and generally abused, and is no worse for wear.The only thing I would like to see done differently is the addition of a longer power cord OR a wireless option. Other than that, this keyboard is flawless in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ZMGYQ6ZEGQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWK8UWI#wasThisHelpful","R39ZMGYQ6ZEGQL","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.This lemon squeezer is really the perfect device for juicing a few lemons. Much like a garlic press, this takes the brunt of the work making it easy on you the user. It is actually surprisingly easy to place a half lemon in the squeezer, squeeze, and actually get basically all the juice you possibly can from it. So, minimal effort and maximum payout equals a great device.As far as the durability, I havent had any issues. It isnt as heavy as I would have thought, and it is set up essentially the same as a pair of tongs with a similar spring mechanism at the end. I would expect the life of the squeezer to be about the same as a good pair of tongs based on this.Cleaning it is as simple as rinsing it off, and I have had no issues with washing it in a dishwasher either,.One final note: I have played around with squeezing other citrus with similar results. Limes work fine as do smaller oranges, tangerines, etc...All told, over the month and a half or so that I have been testing this out, it has been a stellar item, and I have no problem recommending it. In fact, I would say it is almost a must own if you cook or make drinks often with fresh squeezed citrus as we do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RREKA7E3GY7M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIC4DF8#wasThisHelpful","RREKA7E3GY7M9","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased on Steam, and mention of pricing/cards reflects its life on Steam.Not terrible. This is basically a physics based puzzle game where rats take out their vengeance on cats in varied and unique ways. The music for the game sounds cool, the animation is good, the contraptions have cool and varied ways of accomplishing your goals, and in general, the game is actually not bad at all. Especially since you probably will own this regardless, either via gag gifts or because it often costs like 19 cents and offers trading cards. Whatever the reason you end up with this game (and you will, lol), you can at least get a little bit of fun out of it while farming for those cards.You already own this (or will), so there isnt really a reason to rate this, but I think I will still give this six shaved cats with a variety of scars and missing limbs from explosions, axes, baseballs, and so on out of ten possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV1KJ3ONJEIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041HZ3JQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KV1KJ3ONJEIS","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, this game is far superior to it's 2014 predecessor in every way. The graphics are better, the animations are better, but most importantly in my opinion, the online play is 100% improved. I cant even begin to tell you how often we had our online league games disrupted by server crashes and freezes. It was highly aggravating, and I know everybody in my league came into this years game with a bit of trepidation. It still does feature the occasional lag, but so far, several games into our season, nobody has experienced any game killing crashes or freezes, whereas last year, it happened almost every week.The other features remain essentially unchanged except that you earn playing cards and in game currency as you play (and in fact you earn a card every time you log on it seems). I havent actually used any of these yet, but it seems like a nice feature nonetheless.Aside from the vastly improved online play, the most notable change is in the realism of pitches. They really look just about the same as real life pitches, with breaking balls actually breaking at the appropriate times, rising fastballs actually rising, and so on. Very cool.The packaging for this is also very nice. The steelbook looks like part of a baseball bat and the free gamepad decal that came with preorders is cool.All told, very pleased with this installment of the game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R161UMAI0WKNV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVYCCT4#wasThisHelpful","R161UMAI0WKNV7","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Everything is pretty seamless, and while it still has stout requirements to play on Ultra settings, you can definitely play on High without any real issues with a middling CPU as long as your GCU is good.Anyway, the story was engaging, the pacing was spectacular, and the tension....OMG the tension.

"Interesting little experiment is this game. A literal fishbowl (or pond as it were) and a self contained ecosystem that you tweak by spawning various critters (some fish, some shellfish, an otter) and by adjusting the oxygen content, which adjusts the toxicity of the water and from what I can tell, the lifespans of the fishies.It's a free title, and an interesting way to spend ten or twenty minutes. After that, the charm sort of wears out and you are left wondering why the otter never needs to come up for air, lol.Interesting enough to be worth your time, but not enough here to hold your interest for long. I'd give it a 6 out of 10 (mostly because it was free, otherwise I would rate this more like 4 out of 10), and hope that the developer explores this genre a bit more and possibly creates something a bit more detailed. It has the potential to be a very cool simulation game with the proper time and dedication. As it is, you will find it relaxing but probably wont ever play it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8FT5MIRU9I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHQSE7S#wasThisHelpful","RL8FT5MIRU9I2","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, there has been a lot of mixed feelings towards this game, and the  reviews reflect this fact.Personally, I thought this game was excellent. It did have its share of problems, mostly centered around the wildly variable specs depending on your system of choice and the lack of effort as it pertained to syncing the audio with the video during the cutscenes (an embarrassing oversight in my opinion).That said, the game was really very interesting, dark and at times sardonic, and just flat out fun. The stealth aspects really shined through, but as can be seen by my achievements, playing a more aggressive Garrett is possible as well. The upgrade system makes sense and really makes you decide how you want to play your Thief. There are numerous side quests to help you learn the game mechanics and earn cash to purchase equipment upgrades. You do have an equipment stash in your hideout, but I never got around to stocking it (however, I recommend you do....you will need as much gear as possible going into the last two chapters).At first, there is a bit of mysticism involved, and in fact, your first mission ends up with you witnessing some crazy ritual which shapes the rest of the story. There are betrayals and such along the way, and the tension just continues to increase as move through the main story. By the time you get to chapter 5, you have already gotten the sense that there is a whole lot going on that you would never have guessed at before, and the story itself turns from being pretty dark and forlorn to being more horror-centric and at some points, even scary. The first 4 chapters were fun, but the last 4 were amazing in my opinion.There was one endgame issue that I thought was pretty cheap and can potentially ruin your experience if you don't plan properly, which I will explain below (however, if you don't want spoilers, just make sure you have enough health packs available to where you can have at least one set aside for the very end of the last battle)....SPOILERSo, the last battle has you trying to gather the three crystals while Erin tries to kill you (and she is able to have several avatars hunting you simultaneously). Each time you grab a crystal, she explodes, burning off her avatars and you in the process (unless you stay in a dark area when that is happening). Plus, her main attack is an explosion as well. So, it is almost inevitable that you will take some damage...and the long road to get to that final encounter almost guarantees you will be low on health and health packs (well, it doesn't guarantee it, but I find it unlikely that most people will arrive at the last encounter unscathed). Anyway, when you grab the final crystal, it goes to a cut scene where she does her power burst one last time, and if you are low on health, you die even though you have technically finished the battle. So, in order to prevent this and be able to see the endgame cutscenes, you need to heal before you grab that last crystal...if you have no health packs (food) and have taken any damage, you will be unable to finish the game and will have to go back several saves most likely to do it over. I had two food left when I started that final encounter, and after trial and error, I was able to figure out a pattern that allowed me to save one food for just before I grabbed the last crystal (I died AFTER grabbing the 3rd crystal several times before figuring it out).Anyway, that could potentially damage our experience, but really, I thought the game was excellent overall and would give i a solid 8 out of 10 (I would have given it 9 were it not for the issues I mentioned).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVPOJN65C1BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPEBG8A#wasThisHelpful","R3QVPOJN65C1BG","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lol. Decisions need to be made here: was this an intentionally or unintentionally bad game? I am leaning in the intentionally bad direction with this one. It's essentially a walking simulator with ridiculous attempts at jump scares (creepy mannequins moving around, random camera jumps to basically mundane items like a piano or a bookshelf, shadowy creatures, and so on). The story itself was 100% predictable, lol. The graphics themselves are fairly typical of Unity engine games. Nothing of note good or bad.You dont actually click on anything. Events are unlocked mostly by question marks that you walk into., which then trigger whatever may or may not happen next lol. The dialogue is obviously ridiculous.The music however was pretty cool such as it is.Also, there are trading cards, and at the time of this review, they are shockingly selling for 20+ cents a piece.hmmm...do I rate this as a positive or a negative.I'm going with a real rating of 2 out of 10, but an intentionally bad rating of 6.5 out of 10. That averages out to what, 4.25? That settles it. Thumbs down. However, for a buck, I'd still recommend buying it just for  and giggles. So, thumbs up?btw...this game has multiplayer.

"Well, Finding Teddy was a cute little game that was included in a bundle I bought a while back and finally got around to trying out. The story itself is cute/quaint, and the sort of tale you could expect to come from the mind of somebody's little daughter (or having been written for somebody's little daughter). That said, the strength of this game was definitely the puzzles, which incorporate music into riddle form fairly brilliantly. Once you realize what is happening, you wont have any real issues solving them, but learning them initially will take most people a bit of time, and you will need to pay attention in order for the final puzzle to become obvious. Outside of that, there are also objects you find that you will need to progress, much like every point and click game, which this is (albeit, done in a refreshingly different fashion).All told, this game probably took me about an hour and a half to finish, and there is replay value for the completonist. In fact, I get the sense that other things are unlocked in NG+ (unconfirmed by me personally).Anyway, I found this game to be a pleasant surprise and can easily recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMO1V1GVBU3S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2VOQQ4#wasThisHelpful","RMO1V1GVBU3S8","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, this is basically Surgeon Simulator, but instead of killing patients, you are killing it making some nice hot tea, sometimes with sugar, sometimes with milk, sometimes with both, sometimes with neither, lol.You lost your arm in battle and so you were given a robotic arm with which you must try to make your aforementioned tea in hopes of calming down after the stress of losing your arm.Physics based all the way. It's pretty challenging, but the learning curve isn't as steep as with Surgeon Simulator.All in all, it's a charming, sometimes frustrating little game that will make you want to do everything. Took me about an hour to get all the achievements except the play 500 times one, but there are scripts available to handle that one in the community hub.Anyway, pretty fun.

"This game is a ton of fun. It doesnt necessarily look the best (Unreal 3 engine I believe), but it more than makes up for it with solid gameplay, ballsy attitude, and well populated servers (32 player matches). It's multi player only, although you can set up private servers and populate with bots if you prefer. Matches are your typical Deathmatch, Objectives (which are basically one team defending and the other attacking with objectives as you go along such as burning down or crashing gates, smashing towers, and so on on route to eventually trying to kill the King), Free For All (everybody vs everybody), etc..., but they are all quite fun. I've played through four different maps so far. I'm not sure how many more there are, but it's a little consequence. The gameplay is more important than the locations with this game.The learning curve can be steep depending on the type of warrior you select as well as their loadout, (which is initially limited, but unlocks more stuff as you keep getting experience), but it is also pretty easy to get into the flow of the game. You WILL die a lot, and often in hilarious ways, such as getting set on fire just before having your head and an arm hacked off. You can also shout battlecries to your hearts content, lol.You do get penalized for hitting your own teammates, which takes the form of longer respawn times, and if you are a repeat offender, everybody on your team gets to vote on whether or not to kick you. You can also switch sides if you like, mid game, and in fact, the game will sometimes rebalance and shift you automatically to even out the teams. Speaking of respawns, while you are waiting, you basically are the ghost of your now dead warrior and can float around and/or above the battlefields checking out the battles while you wait.All told, the game is a ton of fun to play, and I think it is pretty hilarious as well, with the graphic deaths, copious battle cries, and people running around like madmen.Initially, I thought this was about 8/10, but the more I play, the more I lean closer to a full 10/10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M7LTM5C271AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3TT69G#wasThisHelpful","R1M7LTM5C271AH","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Played through Papa & Yo today.Not a bad game. I remember the press on this being highly favorable. The gameplay wasnt really very challenging, but it was engaging enough to convey the story, which was obvious very quickly, so no worries about spoilers really...you (but really the guy who wrote the story) had an abusive alcoholic dad, and the torment of that upbringing haunted him throughout his life until he was finally able to let go of the fear and torment and move on with his life....that is pretty much the story in a nutshell. It is put forward in a very sensitive manner, and serves to explain the writers feelings without necessarily forcing them on you the gamer. So, I can see why people liked the game based on that. I think the gameplay was probably a 6 out of 10, but the story was more like a 7 out of 10, and the presentation was a 9 out of 10.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6ALI9OUS4O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5VJPNU#wasThisHelpful","RI6ALI9OUS4O6","A3V1A3C9DTLPME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1A3C9DTLPME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me make something very clear: this is NOT an Apple iWatch - and (appearances notwithstanding) it does not pretend to be. It is a budget alternative that will help cure the urge to slap down 550$ to buy the overpriced Cupertino product. Yet, quite surprisingly, it delivers what it does promise in spades.As the watch functions go, it will display the time as well as function as a stopwatch and timer. How accurate is it? Frankly, I do not know - but we are not timing the 100m race at the Olympics with it, are we? The only downside of this aspect is that I could not see how to install different watch faces, a major omission for any smartwatch.Controlling your phone music player with this smartwatch is easy and practical, the screen being both responsive and clear.Now, pair it with your phone and you will both receive notifications and be able to read as well as answer to SMS. It can go completely silent with only the vibration on and this works so well, you will never be in doubt if you received anything or not. On top of that, ask your carrier for a second -SIM card and (whenever your phone battery runs out) this little smartwatch can function as your emergency messaging device, even without being paired to a phone. w, THAT is a function even the Apple iWatch cannot do!What I did not appreciate was the (quality? richness? certainly feel) of the materials, especially of the strap and the push-button.At this price, the StarryBay SmartWatch a fair deal, provided one is fully aware what he is purchasing.And a great stocking-stuffer idea for Christmas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BT2SHBX5GJ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017YHFJQG#wasThisHelpful","R2BT2SHBX5GJ0W","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is great budget tablet that is small enough to carry around all day, fast enough to handle everything thrown at it and has the capacity to contain most of the files one would need to have on a tablet.The 7 inch screen is phenomenally bright and sharp. It can accept up to five-point touch and, being of moderate size, it does not drain the battery. The manufacturer claims to have a 5 hour autonomy and my experience confirms the real-life number to be very close to that with reasonable usage. Of course, ""reasonable use"" means surfing the Web and watching videos on WiFi, listening to music or an audio-book and checking your Social Media accounts - it does not mean 5 straight hours of ...Fallout Shelter or Clash of Clans! Playing a graphically demanding game will drain the battery in between 2 to 3 hours. Nevertheless, since it is very light-weight and easy to carry around, it will save your smartphone battery while offering far better visual experience for such tasks.The front-facing camera works fine for Skype; however, even if most people will not use their tablet to take pictures, I would rather have a rear camera with a sensor larger than 2MP, just in case.This is the 16GB model and it can accept Memory Cards which more or less take care of any storage issues, persistent in any Android device. I found 16GB to be more than enough but I made sure to also insert a 64GB. On the same page, I would strongly advise rooting your device to truly make it yours. Ubuntu for tablets works like a charm!At this price range one should not expect the razor-edge manufacturing fitting of Apple products, mind you. Then again, those come at a 5,000%(!) markup since a comparable 16GB iPad Mini retails around $250. No, the iRULU eXpro Mini is a budget product at a price that would be very hard to find another 7 inch tablet that offers so much.A fair product at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80XWNBN2GE6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTQWPW4#wasThisHelpful","R80XWNBN2GE6V","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a backpack of excellent quality I received for reviewing purposes. Because of the colors, I did not use it myself but gifted it to my sister-in-law who could not be happier with it as she uses it as a carryall for their three toddlers' stuff.The backpack has ample of room, with numerous external pockets and internal compartments, including one for a laptop (up to 15-16"" in size). It has sturdy zippers (easy to operate even with gloves on) and it also has very comfortable (padded) back-straps which, in my case, also sported the front decorative pattern. The material is water-resisting canvas, which, unless drenched, will keep everything dry. The covered zipper-drivers also see to this.The one I received was light blue which will not withstand dirt (or little fingers with chocolate on them) for long. Nevertheless, there are plenty of colors to choose from.Like most canvas backpacks, it may not be the best idea to use this to carry a heavy book-load everyday but, other than that, it is perfect for everyone: from iStudents and light-travelers to overworked mother and preschoolers.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5D5AJK8R27C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GVBWQ8#wasThisHelpful","R1C5D5AJK8R27C","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so until the very end of of 7 seasons.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He was a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He had it all. And yet he can never peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away. And more often than not, it succeeds.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes all seasons. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGHPXFYLXZ9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BPR7OC#wasThisHelpful","R2QGHPXFYLXZ9N","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well-made Security Cable for Laptops and Notebooks I accepted for reviewing purposes. And I am glad I did.It is easy to attach, using the built-in standard T-locking bar, reset the combination (to something other than the preset 0-0-0-0), tether the other end to a secure point and that is all. Technology these days has shorter and shorter cycles yet this does not make our hardware any cheaper. And even if many files can be saved in cloud services, loosing a laptop or a notebook is always a hard blow.This RUBAN Universal Security Cable is made from good materials that both look and feel of high quality and the 6.2ft (~1.90m) of steel cable allows for both a peace of mind and convenience.This something traveling professionals and students of all ages should consider for the safety of their laptop or notebook.Overall, a nicely designed and well made product at a fair price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FXHDUX1U37OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3YG93O#wasThisHelpful","R3FXHDUX1U37OY","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Currently, I am trying to ignore the Action Center notification for an nVidia update, that keeps pestering me to install it since las week. The Home edition, however, does not give the user any such option and all updates are forced onto him.

"I received these Compression Calf Sleeves for reviewing purposes and I have to admit that they are working beautifully.I try to make the time to power-walk 5-6 ml (8-10 Km) every weekday afternoon and even with the proper walking shoes, I had to miss a day almost every week for my calves to recover. Wearing these not only allows me to complete my walks faster (lactic acid, the cause of fatigue, gets dispersed more efficiently with the proper compression)  but also allow for faster recovery afterwards.Yet their uses are not limited to power-walking. I have used them while sitting for hours at my office chair as well as while traveling by plane and I realized that there was significant less position fatigue, as the gradual compression of the calves helps the blood circulation up the legs.Not only are they made from very durable material but it will not shrink and it refuses to fray. Just make sure to use the calf-circumference guide to find the proper size because the correct fit is going to make a difference. My only complaint is the arrow-patters coloring: I prefer my athletic gear, if not in total black then, monochromatic. Other that this, an excellent product. If they did such a great job for my calves, I can only imagine how effective their Plantar Fasciitis foot sleeves will be!Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S79SIQ2X67F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVP4DPY#wasThisHelpful","R1S79SIQ2X67F9","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought my WP NOKIA 800 I also bought the original NOKIA CoLoud headphones to be able to listen to music while taking my daily walks. Because they were flat they would not tangle but they did keep falling off my ears. And, contrary to the promise made in their name, they were far from loud. NOKIA sure knew how to make phones; earphones, not so much.So, when I was offered these sport Bluetooth headphones to review, they were something I needed but I tried to keep my expectations low. Did they surpass them though!FIT : it takes some finagling to understand how they are to be inserted and secured in your ears (and make sure to try all the supplied sizes for both ear-canal seal and antihelix-stabilizer); but once you do they stay there! No wind or jogging manages to knock them off. And the safety neck-cable will let you remove them and they will stay around your neck.SOUND : the true test of any headphones and one these MPow SHIFTs pass with flying colors! Crystal clear and crisp sound with volume to spare. The latter was especially appreciated since the NOKIA 800s have a known low volume issue after the later WP 7.8 update. An issue that gets corrected by adjusting the volume of these brilliant headphones up.CONNECTIVITY : turn on the headphones, turn on Bluetooth on my phone and they get immediately recognized and paired in a second. Every single time.PHONE COMPATIBILITY : an incoming phone call can be easily answered without taking my phone out of my pocket as the built-in microphone works exceptionally well, even on windy days.CHARGE : the headphones come with a regular/micro USB cable that will deliver a full charge in less than 20 minutes. It says 2 hours in the boxed instructions but the light turns from red to blue in far less than that.DURATION : for such short a charging time, I manage to get a full week of 1-hour walks, probably 5-6 hours in total.All in all, a great pair of earphones (compatible not only with my Android phone but with NOKIA Lumias as well). Faultless sound, secure fit and no-hassles technology that works.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5XUACSSZ34B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHN54XU#wasThisHelpful","R2E5XUACSSZ34B","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2007 a small Eastern European game developer (CD PROJEKT)...teaches BIOWARE how to use their own Aurora engine. The original Witcher was the game that Neverwinter Nights had promised to be.

And this is all the opening the perfect sequel needed to come in and, once more, steal the show.THIS IS HOW TO MAKE A cRPG SEQUEL!Although there may be Xbox and PS3 versions of this game later on, this is a game designed from start to finish for the PC.

The story is now even deeper; the graphics are several notches higher; character development has been both streamlined and more balanced; equipping Geralt is now more detailed whereas loot is abundant.It is possible (although not necessary) to import your character from the first WITCHER. If, like me, you liked the original game, you will simply love the sequel.LOOK AT THE SKY: IT IS THE WITCHING HOUR - EVERY HOUR!The graphics are simply A-MA-ZING! I like the way the rock formations catch the moving shadows and how the wind stirs up dust. I like the subtle movement of the grass and the exploding colors of the wild flowers. I like the textures of the clothes, the shine of the armor and the glint of the swords. I like the way the sun gets in your eyes and the way rays of light play with the tree foliage.What is also important, these graphics and dynamic lighting are achieved even on medium-built systems (Minimum specs: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz/AMD 2.5GHz, nVidia 8800/ATI 3850, 1GB of RAM for WinXP/ 2GB for WinVISTA&7).Even more impressively, the game is set in a day/night cycle, and this is reflected not only on the levels of ambient light but also on the activities of the surrounding world.THE WORLD AROUND YOU COMES TRULY ALIVERemember how in most RolePlaying games approaching a Non-Playing Character (NPC) usually means he or she would utter any one of a small number of preset phrases? After a while, you have heard them all and it got very predictable. Well, prepare to be surprised. Again and again.This is a world you will truly be immersed into. A world that wakes up, goes to work, gossips, bickers and barters, and unwinds in the tavern. Walk the same streets at night and they are eerily empty. And that is without taking into account the ever changing weather!The immersion is so total for yet two other reasons: not only is the world fully open from the very beginning (no blocked areas or closed bridges!) but there are no loading delays between areas (only between chapters).THE LIFE OF A WITCHER IS NEVER BORINGGeralt is a real warlock, combining a mix of sword fighting with potions and spells. These are the three main character developing trees, Swordmaster, Alchemist or Mage. Sword moves, potion ingredients and spells can be combined - and all choices are meticulously balanced.With the original WITCHER it took me a while to master the timed sword-strokes - but it was really satisfying after that. In the sequel, sword-fighting has been simplified to the classic mod - and that is one of the gripes I have with this game. The other is the short dialogue options. I like my cRPGs wordy.Now, the story is far from being linear. Choices matter and choosing a path will bifurcate the story, most of the times irrevocably. And the story in WITCHER 2 is as important as the fighting.What I also appreciated was the return of consequences. Those of you who have played BALDUR's GATE Saga know that bashing or picking the lock of a chest was a punishable offense if anyone saw you. In contrast, in DA-O you could rob the town blind and (quite unrealistically) the NPCs could not care less. Well, in this game, your character better behave or face the ever vigilant guards.ADJUST TO YOUR ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF BINDINGMost retail versions of the game come with a simple disc-check, implemented by SecuROM. If you own FALLOUT 3, for example, you have experienced the same thing. Compared to the customer-abusing schemes out there (UBISOFT's and 2K GAMES' ears should be burning at this point) this was already benign.However, because there had been problems with the activation of the game, CD PROJEKT patched out the DRM and now the game is (wait for it...) DRM FREE! And it gets even better:  if you rather have a digital rather than a retail version of the game, the developers made sure to also release a GOG version of the game which is also DRM-free. Only the STEAM version has DRM.Just for listening to its customers and doing this CD PROJEKT earned a permanent place of honor in gaming history.A FINAL SPELLI have only praises for this magnificent sequel to a great game. It was one of the rare cases when I pre-ordered a game before I knew anything about it and was rewarded with a game that exceeded my highest expectations.  I do have some advice for the game developers though.First, keep showing the same respect to your customers and you will see that gamers know how to repay this with equal respect and loyalty. And finally, when the mega-publishers show up at your door with their mesmerizing bags of money, try to remember what happened to so many great game developing groups in the past that did not resist to temptation.The game will get a complete overhaul in April when the Enhanced edition will be released. However, because CD PROJEKT is a gamer's company (and not some greedy multinational), as owners of the original edition we will be able to download the Enhanced edition Patch from the official website - for free. As are all the DLCs by the way!WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVT1MJK833DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J35AKO#wasThisHelpful","R3HVT1MJK833DI","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a a very powerful and handy exterior spotlight that I received for reviewing purposes and I am glad I did.You can either use the base extension to plant it in the ground or you could secure it with screws on a wall - and not have to worry about power cables. This makes repositioning a breeze. I has two settings, low for ambient light that lasts for 8 hours and high for the full 200 lumen beam that will drain the stored charge faster. I positioned it so that it illuminates my front door and it delivers beautifully.Just make sure to secure it in a position where it receives as many hours of direct sunlight during the day as possible.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y83Y6D87C2Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T1QC5GQ#wasThisHelpful","R2Y83Y6D87C2Z2","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful and powerful Wireless speaker I received for reviewing purposes and I have been using ever since.DBPower enjoys multiple connectivity options, from WiFi and BlueTooth to USB and MicroSD card and can reproduce your music collection with fidelity and power. And yet this is not a simple connecting speaker. It can double as a cellphone extension (complete with Caller ID and a HD microphone of excellent sound quality) , it has an FM radio of very decent reception (and 30 memory slots) and it can also function as an alarm clock (military/24h format only) that can wake you up to your favorite song. A piece of advice here, rather make it an annoying song if you want to get up on time!I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of materials and workmanship. Everything fits just right and the buttons are solid and convey a clear confirmation of being pressed.I have to add that this is gorgeous item. I like the red details on the sides but what makes this stand out is the total black front perfectly offsetting the blue LED info-screen. Moreover, its size is just perfect to be placed anywhere, including under your computer screen!The DBPower includes everything one might ever need and it holds its own against similar pieces that are much more expensive.

"These are the fire-resistant gloves I had been waiting for! You know why? Fingers you can actually use!Yes, the material (silicone) is both sturdy and pliable and the gloves offer more than adequate protection when handling either cooking pans or BBQ tools. It is even safe to reposition or turn  meat while on the grill. There are others heat-resistant gloves in the market but I doubt one could find a pair with better finger movement and grip.Easy to put on. They work with most sizes of hands. Can use fingers when handling hot objects. Perfect for both the back yard BBQ and the kitchen. They can be easily removed.

"I received this for reviewing purposes so I had to enlist the aid of my sister in law who is going to be using it.The bag/backpack is constructed from real lambskin leather which is soft, supple and sturdy. The size is ideal for a young mother of three, small enough to be practical but large enough to accommodate all the things a woman keeps in her bag and the things a mother knows her kids may need. Yes, it is still an unsolved mystery to us how you ladies pack so much in your bags! Nevertheless, it has four inner pockets for your cellphone and small objects and an ample main compartment for everything else, including a tablet, as it is lined to protect electronic devices form scratching.What needs further mentioning is the secure way it closes at the top, employing a draw cord (also in leather), a top magnetic clasp as well as another magnetic clasp securing the top flap. Unless one drops it in a body of water, your things will be safe from the elements.I think this beautiful leather backpack can cater the needs of most women, from mothers to students, while the black color with the silver details compliment most casual dressing styles.RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28G7I0O96OIVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2UNEGE#wasThisHelpful","R28G7I0O96OIVC","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful and very practical cross between a briefcase and messenger's bag I received for review purposes. And I honestly loved carrying it around.The first thing that strikes you is the beautiful Northern Africa Corps coloring. I guess that is what the DesertWolf name is referring to. And both the color matching and the engraved logo look cool. The materials are cotton canvas and ersatz leather (not real leather, as expected at this price range) on the outside with a soft cotton lining on the inside (perfect for carrying tablets without a case to protect their screen from scratches). The synthetic shoulder strap is fixed, not removable, but it is adjustable to your height. For someone who has been using similar handbags all of my life, I may miss the option of removing the strap - on the other hand, I do not have to worry about fickle shoulder strap clasps that will open without notice.The pockets strike the perfect balance in size, big enough to be useful and small enough not to allow what you are carrying to jiggle - and they are secured with magnetic snaps at the top. I particularly appreciated the practical use of solid snaps under the stylish straps, as someone who had made the mistake of once buying a handbag with functional leather belts - and had to fumble with closing theme every day, especially after a while, when those belts became warped. No such hassles here.The two major compartments are ample enough for most laptops or a number of books, binders and notebooks. They are separated by a thinner (zippered) compartment, lined and ideal for larger tablets or sensitive papers. Keeping your Kindle in the back zippered pocket is a good idea for commuters that like to have access to it without having to open their bag. The bag measures 14.6"" (37cm) in length, 11"" (28cm) in height, and 4.7"" (12cm) in width. For this size the DesertWolf looks great and works even better.I think this is a handbag that would appeal to students and professors, photographers and journalists, day travelers, stylish bike messengers and adventurous businessmen alike.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVMQTKUZ5USL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TL820ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3CVMQTKUZ5USL","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using Timberland leather conditioners for over 20 years, ever since they came in round bottles with caps made out of real wood. Typical with what is wrong with corporate America nowadays, with every new generation of these products, Timberland cheapens the product (but never reduces the price). Recently the company decided to have them replaced with even more watered down sprays(!) so I was trying to stock up on some of the older versions.The one pictured is of the second generation of Leather Conditioners which worked great. They contained the original formula (only in cheaper containers) which came in 50ml tubes: using just a couple of drops of it one could spit polish a pair of Timberland boat-shoes or boots. Unfortunately, what I got instead was the third generation Timberland ""Boot SauceTM Conditioner"" which may come in 100ml tubes but it is so diluted that one needs to use four times the amount with only very limited results.After returning this I will have to keep looking I guess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7XXECH88E3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRGU3XE#wasThisHelpful","R3U7XXECH88E3M","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good idea that was materialized with good materials but also leaves room for improvement.Since my car windows never fog (I keep a silica bag in my door holder) I decided to give this free sample a try in my bathroom mirror which fogs after showers.The wiper works great - as far as it reaches, which is not more than 15in (38cm). It will accommodate most bathroom mirrors but it will also wipe only a small area of the larger mirrors. However, the shortcoming is not its size. It is the suction cap.It is not advisable to leave it on your mirror (as it will drop off after a while) but, instead, attach it when needed.

"When I bought my WP NOKIA 800 I also bought the original NOKIA CoLoud headphones to be able to listen to music while taking my daily walks. Because they were flat they would not tangle but they did keep falling off my ears. And, contrary to the promise made in their name, they were far from loud. NOKIA sure knew how to make phones; earphones, not so much.So, when I was offered these sport Bluetooth headphones to review, they were something I needed but I tried to keep my expectations low. Did they surpass them though!FIT : it takes some finagling to understand how they are to be inserted and secured in your ears (and make sure to try all the supplied sizes for both ear-canal seal and antihelix-stabilizer); but once you do they stay there! No wind or jogging manages to knock them off. And the safety neck-cable will let you remove them and they will stay around your neck.SOUND : the true test of any headphones and one these MPow SHIFTs pass with flying colors! Crystal clear and crisp sound with volume to spare.CONNECTIVITY : turn on the headphones, turn on Bluetooth on my phone and they get immediately recognized and paired in a second. Every single time.PHONE COMPATIBILITY : an incoming phone call can be easily answered without taking my phone out of my pocket as the built-in microphone works exceptionally well, even on windy days.CHARGE : the headphones come with a regular/micro USB cable that will deliver a full charge in less than 20 minutes. It says 2 hours in the boxed instructions but the light turns from red to blue in far less than that.DURATION : for such short a charging time, I manage to get a full week of 1-hour walks, probably 5-6 hours in total.All in all, a great pair of earphones (compatible with NOKIA Lumias as well). Faultless sound, secure fit and no-hassles technology that works.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZ6YQXV4C9VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWYKDOA#wasThisHelpful","RNZ6YQXV4C9VA","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had always been a NOKIA customer so my primary smartphone is a LUMIA. Unfortunately, the WP ecosystem is truly lagging when it comes to apps, something painfully evident when specialized sites or stores offer dedicated apps for their services. Long story short, accepting this great phone for review purposes was to be my first step towards a Android environment. I do not think I will be looking back soon.BOX CONTENTSPhone and battery (2250mAh) come separately in the box. You can also find the USB/micro-USB connector cable and the plug adapter as well as cable earphones (all three in white) and the flimsy booklet of instructions (which I doubt anyone reads anyway).DESIGN & MATERIALSI liked the removable battery and the placement of the back camera and flash. I loved the clear-cut lines and ergonomic placement of controls. This phone sits just right in your palm. I especially appreciated the luxurious and robust feeling of real aluminum side panels.

The phone is a compatible with both GSM Quadband (850/900/1800/1900) and 3G WCDMA (850/1900/2100) networks, it comes unlocked and it runs Android 4.4 (KitKat).It has dual cameras, a 5MP Front Camera for Video Calling and selfies and a 13MP back camera with LED flash and HD recording.PERFORMANCEI found the KATA I3s to be responsive and reliable, with more processing power than needed. Even demanding games run without a problem. The cameras work great in daylight and at the limited flash range of most smartphones in limited light conditions.The battery lasts all day with regular use but being able to replace it (or even having a second one as backup and simple swap them) gives extra peace of mind. As to sound, this KATA has only one speaker on the back - but it is a YAMAHA. That means great sound quality - without the Beats hipsterism.And because this is still a phone, after all, I could not imagine anyone not being happy with the sound quality, both receiving and transmitting.Overall, I doubt there is another phone that offers so much at this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FU72CO5CCROW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PL0OUM8#wasThisHelpful","R3FU72CO5CCROW","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a huge fan of THE OFFICE ever since its first season. And, up to and including the very last episode, I am glad I did. The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.Purists and snobs will try to argue that the precursor British Series was better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE. No spoilers but I will just state that the show does not disappoint to the very end.Now, how many reams of Dunder Mifflin Premium acid-free paper should I you down for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N00XPHA9637Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTO342M#wasThisHelpful","R2N00XPHA9637Q","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 6 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He was a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He had it all. And yet he can never peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away. And more often than not, it succeeds.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes the first part of the ongoing season 7. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMOT8IFWWAGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6X9ZTG#wasThisHelpful","R1KMOT8IFWWAGL","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I bought this knowing full well that I never owned and never will own an AUDI (of all the German cars, AUDI may well be the most pretentious and certainly the most overpriced - you are lucky if the steering wheel is included in the base price). As a key-holder, however, this was a brilliant buy. And, yes, the AUDI tag slips right off.Some years, ago Ralph Lauren must have re-designed what was then the perfect key-ring: braided leather with a secure key-holding loop. Simple, elegant, sturdy and practical. That retails for well over $50. This will cost you less than $10 and it looks even nicer! With its leather straps braided into a tube (instead of a flat braid) and the key-holding ring mounted on a pivoting base, it both looks of better quality and will not have you fumbling for the right key at the door. The loop also stays sturdy so it is very easy to scoop your key ring out of deep pockets. On the minus side, the ending of the leather tends to detach from its metal foundation - but that is nothing s a little crazy-glue will not take care off for ever.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BCP3ZQW25QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWVW6JC#wasThisHelpful","R21BCP3ZQW25QY","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I accepted this review offer for my brother who has an iPhone (I was loyal to NOKIA up to now, after it got destroyed by Microsoft I will have to reassess when time to change my smartphone comes). He used to complain that his battery life kept getting shorter and shorter, not only with the more apps he installed but also over time. I will not go into why Apple does not allow replacement access to your own phone's battery - but it is one of the reasons I never favored iPhones. Nevertheless, my brother does not complain about his battery life anymore as he only has to charge it every second day!This slim Juicer Double layer external battery offers almost double the charge duration of the iPhone 6 and it also doubles as a very effective rubber protector. Surprisingly it is thinner than most protective cases and yet it harbors a 3,100mAh extra batter that will recharge your iPhone with charge to spare (the iPhone 6 has a 1,810mAh battery). Remember that the recharging is not automatic but you have to press the very discreet button in the back to initiate it. All ports are protected, all buttons are accessible, the camera remains unobstructed and only the audio plug requires a longer adapter (provided).A high quality product of great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWWQW1POAEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHSBG26#wasThisHelpful","ROWWQW1POAEN","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, the lighter outlets in my car have found their use!It was not rare the case of me on my way home and my smartphone about to exhaust its battery. Car chargers work but they tend to be large and cumbersome. This, however, fits perfectly (most cars have their lighter connectors sideways) and it is small enough to allow only the USB cable of my phone to show.My car also has a lighter behind the midsection console for the back passengers. And this is where the compact design truly shines: it allows for someone sitting in the back to use it without having to compromise in leg room. Long trips with a restless kid? Just plug in his portable gaming console and never again worry about its batteries running out.I received the blue one to review and its color matches perfectly both the blue LED connection indicator lights and the other blue lights of my car's dashboard. And it is not only a very nicely looking product. It has 3 USB ports, each clearly marked (1A, 2A, and 2.1A) that work without a hassle. It can accommodate iPhones and iPads just fine but I use the 2.0A middle one for my NOKIA Lumia (even if it is marked for Android devices). And the manufacturing feels solid and robust.

"I love how these BRABANTIA canisters look on my kitchen counter-top. And this is a beautiful canister, specially designed to hold biscuits and cookies. Not only is the inside made of hard plastic (easier to wash and not absorbing of odors or oils) but the inside of the lid also contains a dehydrating capsule that absorbs all moisture in order to keep the contains dry. Popping in a warm oven for 10 minutes every six months renews them.The quality of the fingerprint-free steel is unparalleled. It looks and feels sturdy and it will not accumulate fingerprints most brushed steel items do. Not the same can be said about the plastic lid though. Once more the top came with a small molding imperfections.Brabantia keeps offering products of excellent design and made of good materials. That is why I will keep favoring their products.

"This may well be the absolutely worse movie adaptation of any book. Ever. And what adds insult to injury is that the book this let's-call-it-a-movie was based upon was a great action-packed, well thought out covert-assassin/martial arts novel. I can only imagine the agony of Barry Eisler when he first sat through this!Absolutely nothing works. The plot has gaping holes one could drive a bullet-train through. The main cast is barely adequate whereas the supporting cast is absolutely amateurish - including Gary Oldman who phoned in yet another over the top lips pouting and spit-shouting that he tries for years to pass as ""acting"". I have seen middle-school students giving better performances than these. The camera work is often unflattering and almost always obscuring; the writing was utterly uninformed (would it kill them to read a CIA agent manual beforehand?), the dialogue wooden and the story progression generally intolerable.It starts off as a disjointed action film only to end up as a sappy Bollywood love-story. The only thing missing is the happy dance at the end with everyone, dead or alive, joining their voices to sing the praises to John Rain.A movie so bad one cannot even laugh at it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRD9QKPFS625/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ANP8E2#wasThisHelpful","R1WRD9QKPFS625","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought my WP NOKIA 800 I also bought the original NOKIA CoLoud headphones to be able to listen to music while taking my daily walks. Because they were flat they would not tangle but they did keep falling off my ears. And, contrary to the promise made in their name, they were far from loud. NOKIA sure knew how to make phones; earphones, not so much.So, when I was offered these sport Bluetooth headphones to review, they were something I needed but I tried to keep my expectations low. Did they surpass them though!FIT : it takes some finagling to understand how they are to be inserted and secured in your ears (and make sure to try all the supplied sizes for both ear-canal seal and antihelix-stabilizer); but once you do they stay there! No wind or jogging manages to knock them off. And the safety neck-cable will let you remove them and they will stay around your neck.SOUND : the true test of any headphones and one these MPow SHIFTs pass with flying colors! Crystal clear and crisp sound with volume to spare.CONNECTIVITY : turn on the headphones, turn on Bluetooth on my phone and they get immediately recognized and paired in a second. Every single time.PHONE COMPATIBILITY : an incoming phone call can be easily answered without taking my phone out of my pocket as the built-in microphone works exceptionally well, even on windy days.CHARGE : the headphones come with a regular/micro USB cable that will deliver a full charge in less than 20 minutes. It says 2 hours in the boxed instructions but the light turns from red to blue in far less than that.DURATION : for such short a charging time, I manage to get a full week of 1-hour walks, probably 5-6 hours in total.All in all, a great pair of earphones (compatible with NOKIA Lumias as well).

"This is a quality item of great practicality. Nowadays, most homes have a number of portable electronic devices, from smart-phones and media-players to remotely controlled toys and smart-watches - and they all need their daily charging. Instead of taking up five different outlets, this allows you to charge them all in one place. The fact that you keep everything in the same place is also quite handy; no more trying to remember where you are charging what: this creates a central charging hub in your house. It has 3 regular charging USB ports and 2 high speed ones, complete with surge protector you can turn on or off.And yet this is not just a practical item. It is beautifully made! I had given up expecting such high manufacturing quality some time a go so I was very pleasantly surprised. With full-grain wood on top and an aluminum frame over a slip-resistant rubber bottom, this may not be an Apple product but it can sure stand right next to one proudly. I particularly appreciated the care for the details: the distances between the USB ports are enough to accommodate even my widest USB connectors; the markings on top are actually engraved into the wood; whereas the ON/OFF button for the surge protector is of of the same high quality as the rest of the top to keep is discreet.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54X46QHUPK4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2FH49Q#wasThisHelpful","R54X46QHUPK4H","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is very rare that I accept free products to review nowadays but I wanted a waterproof speaker for the shower so I saw a win-win situation. It turned out, this was a good decision.Not only will it stick to the tiles, stay in place and stream music by connecting to your computer via Bluetooth. It will also serve as a handsfree speaker/microphone for your phone while your hands are occupied (iPhone and Android only, unfortunately no WindowsPhones yet). I imagine people who enjoy long baths (not one of them) will especially appreciate this feature as it will keep their phone at a safe distance.The construction is solid, it takes a splash and a tumble (yeah, I...dropped it, from about a 3ft/1m) in stride and keeps on singing. I liked the secure suction cup, the duration of the rechargeable battery and the voice confirmations of connectivity. I especially liked the sound quality, not just in the bathroom but also in the open air, while sitting in my veranda.My advice to the manufacturers: make the physical buttons under the rubber cover larger in order to avoid hitting them at an angle.

"The working relationship between a game designer and his publisher is never a simple one. So I would not know where exactly to place the blame, Sid Meyer or 2K GAMES. But in the end, it does not matter. Because it is simply sad to see a great gaming franchise came to this.THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAMEA great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this ""Civilization For Dummies"" and he is absolutely right.There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as units apparently are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a ""culture bomb"" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).ARMY CASTRATIONSomeone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why Sid, why?YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?UNIT STAMPEDEA major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the ""tactical"" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, TOUGH LUCK! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.You have zero control of both your cities resource distribution and your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.Speaking of the economy, when are going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.The system I am running my copy was top of the line about a year ago and still I had to tweak the video settings with a mix of high and medium to get it running. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.So one can only wonder: why should one need a...Cray to run a Civilization game at full?STEAM OF WARThe game requires OnLine Activation (and rumored perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.Seasoned gamers, we know better than to call this a Civilization game.Sorry Sid, EPIC FAIL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKBS4EHBHBTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067STH9O#wasThisHelpful","RVKBS4EHBHBTN","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love how these BRABANTIA cannisters look on my kitchen counter-top. Obviously, transferring your rice (or lentil) out of its bag and keeping it in a cannister is a good idea only if you are using the same type of rice. These cannisters come with a discreet label on the side that can be color-coded as well.The measuring contraption may be on the small side but you can adjust your scoops. On the other hand, it is convenient to always have a measuring scoop handy and it looks nice.The quality of the fingerprint-free steel is unparalleled. It looks and feels sturdy and it will not accumulate fingerprints most brushed steel items do. Not the same can be said about the plastic lid though. The clear part at the top came with small but quite obvious molding imperfections. The first cannister I received I asked to be replaced but, when the second arrived with exactly the same defect, I realized that this must be a common issue.BRABANTIA keeps offering products of excellent design and made of good materials. That is why I will keep favoring their products. However, they do need to look into bringing their manufacturing back to their old standards.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31VRVTC3RT7TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P2J5B4#wasThisHelpful","R31VRVTC3RT7TA","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's be honest for a moment: until a reliable and accurate speech-to-text App comes along, no electronic device can even come close to the practicality of a paper notebook. And those classic-looking MOLESKINES are a good example of this.I like the hard covers and the stylish elastic band. I like the rounded corners and the perfect size. I like the handy back inner pocket and the British green colour. And I certainly like the looks I get every time I pull it out my briefcase.On the other hand, I would have liked the paper to be somewhat thicker, enough to be able to use both sides of the page without having to suffer ink sipping through. And I certainly would not mind paying more to get real leather covers.It is still quite practical to use but it has to rely on its style to compensate for the manufacturing corners they decided to cut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMDRKABV1962/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8866136301#wasThisHelpful","RNMDRKABV1962","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even if I was a great fan of the original Diablo and D2, I was late in deciding to take D3 on. It was a combination of factors, from the bad reviews the game kept getting, to the constant servers errors I kept hearing about and to me being too busy to take up such a time-eater. However, I came across it at a great discount and, on an impulse, decided to give it a try. Three weeks of (casual) gameplay later this is what I think.DIABOLICALLY GORGEOUSThe game is beautiful to look at and a visual pleasure to play in. The environments are meticulously rendered and yet they loose none of their details when zoomed in or acted upon. Blowing up tree trunks or exploding bodies of enemies is both fun and physically accurate. Sure, some heads or pieces of wood can be seen to spin for too long, but that is part of the game's appeal, right? You are become Death, the destroyer of Worlds!YOUR CHORD SOUNDS FAMILIARThe sounds are better than the music but they are both quite well made. What I found strange was that, at least once, throughout Act I, the background music clearly reminded me of the main theme from Baldur's Gate. Let's chalk this one off as ...tribute.GRINDING BUILDS CHARACTER.The bad news is that it builds exactly the same kind of character for everyone. There are no choices when leveling up. Everything eventually gets unlocked for you and you only get to choose what 4 skills to use and which runes to combine with each one. Your strength, dexterity, intelligence and vitality get automatically increased, depending on your class. No more making a tank out of a ranger I am afraid. And this is where the game looses its first star.The fact that you get to have a sidekick that does practically little more than keep the mobs occupied until you dispense of them, does not help either.CULTURAL PHOBIAS DO NOT A GOOD STORY MAKEYes, the story plot is infantile, disrespectful to the original games (I will refrain from spoiling it) and it offers very little help in immersing into the game world. It is unfortunate because, BLIZZARD has proved in the past that they can produce games with a very good back-story, such as Starcraft II.However, this a game franchise that is heavily invested on the Judeo-Christian culture of the Devil. Just read the name on the box! So, taking away demonic pentagrams and most religious symbols (some crosses can still be found) fools no one. Because once you go down that road and then decide to backup, you should make sure not to step on yourself and trip. As in: if a golden-eyed Fallen Angel (Hello!) is helping you fight Diablo, are you sure who is the Devil and who is not?LOOT. LOOT NEVER CHANGES.Well designed and clearly labeled items make all the difference in the world. I would love for Borderlands 2 items to have such a clear Damager-Per-Second (DPS) number to make comparisons easier. Pair this with an inventory that is big enough and free of the need to play item-Tetris in (all items take up either one or two vertical squares) and you have yourself almost loot haven. Almost because you still get too many unusable items, mostly because of class restrictions.You can stash such items in your common stash to share with your other heroes (on the same BattleNet account) but make sure to find the necessary...700,000 gold to pay for all the extra stash space. Hint: use the Auction House while you still can.The only thing I found missing is the ability to add sockets to magical items and enchant regular ones.THE AUCTION HOUSE: BRILLIANT! (WHEN IT WORKS)I am going to go against the current here but here it is: I found the Auction House a brilliant idea. Well designed and decently executed. I am going to be sad to see it go on March, as announced. I can only hope they change their mind before then.In all honesty, I am currently a Demon Hunter at Nightmare difficulty. And I have heard the complaints that it is impossible to finish Inferno without Real-Money Auction House (which is clearly not how it is supposed to work) but up to Nightmare, using the Auction House is the only way to get enough money to be able to do the enhancements you want, craft or buy the items you covet and unlock the precious extra stash space you need.CHAINS IN NEED OF BREAKINGI withheld the second star because of the always-online requirement. Because it is indeed a hassle and a hindrance (just try pausing in town for longer than half and hour and see what happens). Yes, the game does offer some gameplay features (namely, the Auction-House) to compensate for the inconvenience but they all give way to anger and frustration whenever BlLIZZARD's servers go down  and you are unable to play a Single-player game for days at a time(!). Take away the Auction-House, however, and the always-online requirement becomes a severe and now unjustified hindrance!THE ORIGINAL SINNo, D3 looses its third and final star for being both short and boring at times. There, I said it. Yes, it is a well balanced eye-candie, with tons of loot, problematic character development yet the gameplay feels like at chore at times and it is over before you know it. I even found Act I (the one offered for free as a demo) to be better designed and longer than the rest.It is like that old Woody Allen joke: two old ladies are complaining about their retirement home catering. ""The food was awful, barely edible"", ""I know"", her friend replied, ""and such small portions!"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYKWI753TV1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00178630A#wasThisHelpful","R3OYKWI753TV1M","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I generally do not like expansions. They used to be additions only very successful games got to have. Nowadays they are mostly the...other half of the game the publisher withheld when selling us half the original for $50! C&C:KANE's WRATH is a rare exception that brings new dimensions to an already great game!The original C&C3:TIBERIUM WARS is one of those graphically beautiful and gameplay intelligent games that will keep your interest for months! True, I could do without the wooden acting of Michael Ironside! (Gone are the days of Kari Wuhrer...Lock'n'Load!)Story-wise, the expansion is somewhat of a prequel to C&C3-TIBERIUM WARS, as it is set on the history of NOD, starting off just after the 2nd Tiberium War and continuing well past the 3rd.There is a big campaign comprising of 13 single player missions, new units and upgrades and a new (a la RISE OF NATIONS) Global Conquest mode, that can turn C&C3 into a Turn-Based game! What make this REALLY interesting are the six subfactions, each with its special units, strengths and weaknesses. Not to worry, all GDI, NOD and Scrin get their own off-shooting factions.On the opposite ends of the spectrum, there is Reaper-17 (a Scrin sub-faction): with hard-hitting and powerful offensive options; and then there is Traveler-59 (also a Scrin offshoot): a much more devious faction that relies on mind control of humans (remember how much fun Yuri's Revenge? was). In between, GDI's (retro) Steel Talons and (futuristic) ZoCom and NOD's (mind-benders) Black Hand and (cyborgs galore) Mark of Kane.Production of the new epic-units can tip the battlefield scales dramatically. Most are not only devastating but are pretty hard to take down too. GDI gets the MARV [Mammoth Armed Reclamation Vehicle], a souped-up triple-barreled tank; NOD gets the Redeemer, an augmented killer avatar; whereas, Scrin get the Eradicator Hexapod, a impressive six-legged mech.Revamped units, such as the Shard Walker or the Reaper Tripod, or back-to-the-drawing-board units, such as the Prodigy or the Ravager all add to a renewed experience. Moreover, as a long-time C&C fan, I particularly enjoyed the reappearance of good-ol' units such as Titans and Wolverines on the side of GDI!The graphics are beautiful, the physics detailed and the explosions and beam-weapons spectacular! Don't forget to turn on the volume on those speakers, because this is a total immersion experience.As with the original: it misses the 5th star for fun because one cannot hold a battle formation while moving. As most units move at different paces (and although the AI has improved they keep bumping on each other), this results in the more agile, yet vulnerable, units having to face the enemy first - a short-lived sight... May be the next C&C (say, RED ALERT 3) could have some TOTAL WAR infused into it, with battle formations options.Finally, be advised that for the expansion you do need the original C&C3: TIBERIUM WARS to play it. If you do not have it, take note that this pack is good deal, as it includes both the original game and the expansion. However, the prices of the separate items fluctuate (and some times the cost of buying the separate parts is actually less than buying the bundled pack) so make sure to get the best deal.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA93O8EBWA2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FLGEEE#wasThisHelpful","R1DA93O8EBWA2G","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use. The grip has to be just right, the peeling head has to swivel not too much and not too little and its edges have carry just the right amount of sharpness.

"I have been a loyal NOKIA customer ever since my first cell phone, the legendary 6110 (and what a great phone that was!). Over the years I have upgraded or simply replaced a number of NOKIAs and my loyalty may have been tested at times but it was never scorned.

Why do we even have 16GB phones if such 1990's limitations are to be in place?PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR CUSTOMIZATION STRAIGHT JACKETSmartphones have much larger screens than our old phones. Why can we not choose the size of the font and strain to discern the phone numbers of our contacts? (There is a Big Phonebook App but it has to import all your contacts and it does not auto-update every time it is used).Smartphones have far greater processing power. Why can we no longer switch our contacts between a list and card format? In the much larger screen I can see less information about each of my contacts than I did with my 6500s.Smartphones can now project 16,000,000 colors. Why can we not choose to change the color of each individual tile?Swiping from the right edge will take you to the Apps list. Why is swapping in the opposite direction not allowed? It is not reserved for anything, so why yet another counterintuitive limitation?Finally, where are our easy to use and trusted Profiles!? The movie is about to start, am I to go through the damn menu to silence my phone?The lack of Applications for the N9 made me choose the LUMIA 800. As the days go by, I start to realize that I did not chose the lesser of two evils. And I have now seen the face of Evil. And its number was 7.8.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF5YTVDDUGPVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067M9JBQ#wasThisHelpful","RF5YTVDDUGPVE","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!Having just completed its sixth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired.

Even if her addition opened up some girls-night-out moments, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to ""help"" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny.

Opposites do attract, at least for a while.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution before he blasted into space himself. He also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, until very recently still lived with his mother, insisted on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Howard used to be the show-stealer.

Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by (his now wife) Bernadette, who is cute as a button and very likeable, but also cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated.

"I ordered this set as a Christmas present for my 2-years old nephew: he simply loved it from the very first moment!He liked it so much, he learned to say ""thank you"" (or something very close) to show his appreciation. He liked it so much he wants to keep it by his bed to be able to find it when he wakes up - and this continues for two months now (for toddlers to be interested in the same toy, this is a very long time). He likes it so much my sister-in-law called to thank me again because withdrawing playing privileges suddenly got very effective with her unruly son. She still blames our gene-pool for the later thought (yeah, she is probably right).The material is durable, the design safe, the toddlers love the sound and function of the power-drill and they are taught to discern cross-sectional shapes and sizes. More importantly, it will keep them interested for a long time.

"The working relationship between a game designer and his publisher is never a simple one. So I would not know where exactly to place the blame, Sid Meyer or 2K GAMES. But in the end, it does not matter. Because it is simply sad to see a great gaming franchise came to this.THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAMEA great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this Civilization V, ""Civilization For Dummies"" and he is absolutely right.There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as, apparently, units are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a ""culture bomb"" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).ARMY CASTRATIONSomeone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why, Sid?YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?UNIT STAMPEDEA major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the ""tactical"" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, tough luck! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.You have very little control of your cities resource distribution and zero control of your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.Speaking of the economy, when are we going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.The system I am running my copy consists of a P7 920 on a MSI Eclipse with 3GB of RAM and an ASUS nVIDIA GTX-260. Even with a couple years old PC in a WinXP environment (I refuse to forgo my game collection for the latest Windows OS), apparently I cannot even try the highest DX9 settings (the game crashes at launch) but I managed to optimize them with a mix of high and medium. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.So one can only wonder: why should one need a Cray to run a Civilization game at full?A CIVILIZATION SOLD LIKE A SALAMIIn slices. DLC slices, that is. So far there have been over a dozen DLCs (of which only 9 are included in this GOTY edition of the game). All are sold separately and each one contains a small portion of what was supposed to be an essential part of the game. Were there any Civilization games in the past that did not include the Babylonians or the Persians? No. And when was it that a Civilization game cost over $150 complete? Never.STEAM OF WARThe game requires OnLine Activation (and perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.Seasoned gamers, we know better than to call this a Civilization game.Sorry Sid, EPIC FAIL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GL56TYGW49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005M0KSIM#wasThisHelpful","R21GL56TYGW49","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The end of this decade was a small Golden Age for cRPGs. Oblivion, The Witcher, Fallout 3, Dragon Age, Risen, even the humble Torchlight revived the genre with fresh ideas and renewed vigor. And DIVINITY II: EGO DRACONIS comes as the cherry to this cake.If one remembers the (excellent) Divine Divinity, well gone are the days of isometric gameplay. Larian Studios started with a clean state and the result is a beautiful third-person action cRPG. The graphics are not cutting edge and yet they are gorgeous. Imagine what a cross between Titan Quest and Fable would look like today [by the way, ...""thank you"" Peter Molyneux for snubbing PC gamers with FABLE II!].The trees and flowers move slightly to the wind; the skies change in beautiful colors; the sunlight and shades play tricks to your eyes; the characters and gear are very artfully designed; and the fighting moves are impressive. If only the animation of the NTCs were better I would be talking about one of the best-looking cRPGs ever.Nevertheless, what grabs you from the beginning is not the imagery but the story. The first PC game to introduce flying like a dragon was Drakan: Order of the Flame. But a dragon-slayer who can shape-shift into a Dragon and back? That's some table-turning.What is more, character development runs parallel to your Dragon development, on different skill trees. Diversification may satisfy your curosity but do not specialize at your own risk: as you advance you better have some well honed skills if you wish to survive and fight yet another day.In the best cRPG tradition, there are quick-slots, inventory and life/mana/stamina levels as well as a small local map. Other than that the screen is free of unnecessary clutter.What is more, I particularly appreciated the music, subtle or emphatic where appropriate. The same care was exercised to the sounds of battle, from unsheathing your sword to letting go of an arrow. As to the English dubbing (the original game was in German) it was very nicely done.This DRAGON KNIGHT SAGA edition includes both the (remastered) original Divinity II: Ego Draconis as well as its expansion Divinity II: Ego Draconis - Flames of Vengeance. Patch 1.497 is already out and I heard it to be especially useful for Win7 users (I cannot speak from experience on this one, I am sticking to my reliable WinXP until Win7 SP2 is released). Nevertheless, after (too) many hours of gaming I found no major bugs.Now some more good news. The original game came with SecuROM 7 DRM - but that has been patched out. The game still requires OnLine Activation, mind you. Even if bought through STEAM, it will still ask for Activation when installed and you will have to de-authorize your copy when uninstalling. This may just barely clear my DRM-tolerance threshold, however, it is still much better than most triple-A games today.The graphics are exceptional, the world is vast and beautifully designed, the battles are absorbing and the gameplay immersing. All in all, an excellent game and a major addition to any cRPG collection.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZCHHGK5PRR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H0YOW2#wasThisHelpful","R38ZCHHGK5PRR9","A74TA8X5YQ7NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A74TA8X5YQ7NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"XENOBLADE: CHRONICLES (aka: MONADO: BEGINING OF THE WORLD) is one of those great games that (for some unfathomable reason) Nintendo had initially decided not to market outside Japan. It has been available, fully translated, since August in Europe (where my copy came from). This used not to be true for the US. Luckily, Nintendo North America (at last!) yielded to the pressure of the fans and announced the release of the game.THE MUSIC WILL ENCHANT YOUR SOULThis is the first thing that hits your senses. The music of Xenoblade reminded me of playing Final Fantasy VII years ago and being mesmerized by its music. The Prelude I can still remember. In Xenoblade, the music will range from atmospheric to epic rock, and all the shades and colors in between.It will be a familiar companion while you travel and a strengthening presence when you do battle, greatly enhancing the overall experience. Every map has its own theme (most with day and night variations) and you will catch yourself humming them long after having turned your console off.Sometimes the importance of the music in a game is underestimated and the focus remains on the graphics. Xenoblade is a perfect example of how essential music is in order to achieve a total immersive gaming experience.LIVE AND BREATH IN A GORGEOUS ANIME WORLDNow, all of us who decided to go with the Nintendo Wii, we knew that it was not the most graphically powerful console. Its strengths lie elsewhere. Having said that, Xenoblade is the most beautiful and graphically detailed game on the Wii. Ever.Set on two ancient biomechanical Titans frozen in mid-battle centuries ago, the world is simply enormous. There are about 20 maps, almost every map is huge and it is all open to exploration. Because there are only few and short loading times, you are practically flowing from one into the next as in a continuous world. And exploring the endless and open Xenoblade world is not only fun to do but also very rewarding.The grass moves around your feet, birds sweep over your head, clouds roll by day, the galaxy scintillates at night and the whole world comes alive around you. In the heat of the battle the hits and special moves will be accompanied by impressive anime graphical events. Up close the characters may not be that detailed but the characters, their weapons and the environments have all been designed with great artistry. When the limitations of the Wii are reached you probably will not notice it either. Xenoblade has far better graphics than all the other notable Wii JRPG, such as The Legend of Zelda, Okami or Rune Factory: Frontier. My Wii had never produced such a visually advanced game!THE STORY DRAWS YOU IN AND NEVER LETS GOAs any seasoned RPGer would tell you, the story is equally important to the graphics and the music, if not more so. And Xenoblade excels in this aspect as well. A tad clichd at times, the story advances with beautifully made cinematic sequences and it manages to feel both reassuringly familiar and surprisingly fresh.The human colonists (the Homs) are living on one of the frozen titans, Bionis, and are attacked by mechanical life-forms (the Mechons) who occupy the other. So, after the initial battle, it is up to Shulk, your hero, the young survivor from Colony 6 and the new bearer of Monado, together with (up to 3 of) his companions to save their world.You bond with your companions by the choices you make - and this affects their abilities. Your choices also affect both the conversation options with Non-Playing Characters (NPCs) and the quests becoming available to you. In fact, everyone and their sister seems to have a quest for you. Conveniently, you do not have to go back to them once completed.Xenoblade will enchant you with its sound vistas and ensnare you with its story.WIELD THE BLADE THAT SEES INTO THE FUTUREAs with any true RPG, there is leveling up, looting, crafting, bartering and re-equipping your character as well as his companions. Interestingly, the custom appearance you chose for them will not be lost during the cinematic scenes. If you enjoy earning achievements, Xenoblade has you covered. The game allows you to save almost anywhere but it also autosaves at nicely spaced Landmarks - and dying will only take you back to the last one encountered (without any XP or loot penalties).The battle system is real-time but both the distance to their enemy and your relative position are factored in (hint: for such an oversized sword, backstabbing strangely pays off). Monado has powers that are unleashed after building up normal attacks. The legendary sword also allows you to glimpse into the future in order to avert enemy blows. Moreover, your hero and his companions have special abilities, called Arts (that need to recharge before they can be reused).The enemies, especially the bosses, will focus on the character inflicting the most damage to it - and this allows for flanking maneuvers by the rest of your party. Most battles are not that hard however some of the bosses will tax your understanding of the game mechanics.Equally important is that is not a one-ride-pony. Once the game is completed you can restart the entire story with your high level character to complete and explore everything you missed the previous time around.Xenoblade-Chronicles gives you the option to experience it either dubbed in (in the UK version, British accented and not lip-synched) English or in (partially) subtitled original Japanese.

"Bela Lugosi playing a mad scientist? Check. Bubbling potions? Check. Secret laboratory? Check. Revenge plot to be carried out by scientifically created flying monster? Check. Now all the elements are in place, and you have THE DEVIL BAT, a ridiculous yet enjoyable horror film from 1940 that, in 2015, works pretty well as an unintentional comedy.THE DEVIL BAT is the story of Dr. Paul Carruthers (Lugosi), a brilliant chemist whose formulas made the Heath and Morton families, owners of a cosmetics company, enormously rich. Though Carruthers is beloved by everyone in Heathville, he nurses a murderous grudge against both families, who he feels cheated him of his rightful share of the profits (and never mind that they asked him to invest in the company when they founded it, but he elected a one-time cash payout). The Doc, however, has hatched a fiendish plan to exact vengeance: by treating vampire bats with electricity, he has grown them to enormous size, and at the same time taught it to attack whoever wears a particular scent of his devising. Since he works for a cosmetics firm, none of his intended victims think it odd to be asked to wear this scent, but as the bodies of various Heaths and Mortons pile up, it causes a national sensation: who or what is killing the heirs to the Heath/Morton fortunes? Cue the arrival of ace reporter Johnny Layton (Dave O'Brien), a Chicago reporter, and his bumbling photographer, ""One Shot"" McGuire (Donald Kerr), to investigate the mysterious murders. The local sheriff (Hal Price) is stumped, but Layton quickly begins to suspect a link between the strange odor emanating from the victims and the appearance of the ""devil bat."" He also quickly develops a crush on the surviving Heath, the lovely Mary (Suzanne Kaaren), who is certainly next on the bat's hit list. This puts him on a collision course with Carruthers, who won't rest until his monstrous bats have wiped out both families down to the very last member.THE DEVIL BAT is typical of the low-budget horror movies of the period in question. The script, written by John Thomas Neville from an ""original story"" by George Bricker, is a heap of cliches from beginning to end and often makes no sense. For example, Carruthers is a doctor of medicine, but he's also a chemist, and, evidently, also a zoologist and a research scientist. He must have spent a lot of time in school, yet he's too dumb to simply form his own business! The sheriff, following a long tradition of incompetent local law enforcement in horror movies which has lasted to this day, is unable to grasp that all evidence points to Carruthers almost from the first. Layton is really more of a private eye than a journalist and has no journalistic ethics whatsoever (carries a gun; fakes photographs), and nobody in the Heath or Morton families acts as if the deaths of their loved ones are upsetting in the slightest -- even when the families are practically wiped out, nobody leaves town or acts terrified. Then there's the cinematography (not exactly dynamic), the stock footage (close ups of a real bat that don't jibe with the prop) and the awful special effects (production assistants hurling fake bats at people from off screen).At the same time, however, the movie is undeniably fun to watch. The script, hackneyed as it is, is spiked with humor and a certain cleverness typical of 40s-era movies (for example, whenever one of Carruthers' would-be victims says, ""Good night!"" he always replies quite pointedly, ""Good-bye!""), Lugosi seemed to be enjoying himself with the role, and Dave O'Brien's performance is enjoyably slick and assured. I also enjoyed the palaver between Layton and his long-suffering cliche of an editor, Joe McGinty (Arthur Q. O'Bryan). The women are quite good-looking as well, especially the french maid (Yollande Mallot), who has an absolutely unbelievable flirtation with One Shot. Oh, and when I mentioned the awful special effects, I should have also mentioned that they area great part of the fun. I can only imagine how hard it was for actors to keep a straight face as a huge rubber bat was hurled at them take after take! Production assistants are notoriously underpaid: I wonder if any of them threw it harder just to spite the actors?THE DEVIL BAT is what I call a Mystery Science Theater type of movie. It has long since lost whatever effect the producers intended, but instead of turning to irrelevant dust it survives as a largely unintentional comedy and a sort of time capsule from the completely different, almost alien world of 1940. It's also a reminder never to piss off Bela Lugosi.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL4WCQJAH0D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J21ARU#wasThisHelpful","RKL4WCQJAH0D9","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WESTFRONT 1918 is a well-crafted German antiwar film produced just two years before Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and thus is probably the last of the last antiwar movies made in that country until after WW2. In some ways it represents the essence of Weimar-era film-making, in that it is technically very advanced, very ""earthy,"" and acted at a very high level, but has a ""fractured narrative,"" following many characters, and employs very little character development. It is a bleak, bitter and brutal film whose occasional jabs of humor only serve to heighten the mood of despair, and manages to convey not only what WW1 was like for the German soldier, but also for those they left at home.The film follows four infantrymen through a brief period during the last months of the war: Bayer the Bavarian, Karl, The Lieutenant, and The Student, all of whom serve as front-line soldiers in the trenches of the Western Front. Each man his his own particular cross to bear (the Student, for example, is desperate to sleep with this French peasant girl but the war keeps interfering), but the really important character is Karl, a tough old veteran of the trenches trying to survive long enough to get leave. Karl manages to return home and push through the bread lines full of grumbling, hungry citizenry to discover his wife in bed with someone else. After humiliating the lover at gunpoint he throws the man into the street and proceeds to cold-shoulder his wife, who begs for forgiveness and tries to explain what drove her to seek comfort in the arms of a stranger. Karl can't forgive his wife, however, and returns to the front deeply embittered, just in time to face -- with his friends -- a huge enemy attack on the trenches, complete with tanks, which threatens to overwhelm the outnumbered and exhausted German soldiers.As you can see from this brief description of just one of the four story arcs, WESTFRONT 1918 has nothing that could properly be called a plot. It is simply ""a week in the life"" of four ordinary men trying to cope with circumstances no human being should be expected to cope with. Stuck in the trenches, constantly being shelled (in many cases by their own artillery), homesick and frightened, these soldiers express no political opinions, no understanding of the causes or motivations of the war, not even any hatred of the enemy. They are past all that. The goal is simply to cover for each other and endure -- not until the war ends (nobody talks about that, possibly because nobody believes it will ever end), but until the next opportunity comes along to experience something unwarlike -- be it a bottle, a woman or a comedy show. And yet the shadow of the war, like the shadow of death, looms over even these simple pleasures. As for the civilians, Karl's wife seems to be meant to epitomize a ""home front"" that has long ago forgotten all its slogans and passions and is waging its own battle -- against hunger (the endless bread lines), boredom and loneliness.Technically the movie is extremely sophisticated for 1930, with remarkably smooth tracking shots and excellent sound -- an achievement, considering that this was (I believe) director G.W. Pabst's first ""talkie,"" and the writing, by Ladislaus Vajda and Peter Martin Lampel (adapted from the novel ""Four of the Infantry"" by Ernst Johannsen), is sophisticated as well, albeit in a different meaning of the word. Germans permitted more sexuality and outright swearing in their movies than Americans or British of the same era could dream of, and Pabst makes modest use of this license to heighten the atmosphere of reality. The problems I had with the film, and the reason I gave it the modest rank of three stars, were due mainly to its structure. The fractured, documentary- style of storytelling common to German cinema in the 30s makes it difficult to engage with the characters, and there were times when I felt as if Pabst were trying a bit too hard to grind the ""war is all hell"" message into the audience's brain instead of letting the horror simply speak for itself. Ultimately WESTFRONT has more of a documentary feeling than that of a feature film, and I feel as if it lessened the impact of the movie's final, pathetic scenes in a field hospital at the height of the battle.Having said that, WESTFRONT 1918 is not an easy film to shake. It highlights the terribly impersonal way war crushes human beings -- first spiritually, then psychologically and finally physically, and perhaps ought to be ought to be mandatory viewing for those weaned on one-sided American war movies that to this very day depict ""the Krauts"" as faceless, unfeeling fodder for Brad Pitt's machine gun. Turns out they bleed, sweat, and scare just the same as us.Who knew?","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Q5V4C2INREN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSK490U#wasThisHelpful","R18Q5V4C2INREN","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in college I wrote my history thesis on the popular culture of Nazi Germany. To my great surprise, I discovered that bellicose music, bloodthirsty war movies and aggressive radio programs -- indeed, anything overtly political or warlike at all -- were a rarity under the Hitler regime, either before or during the war. It turned out that his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, believed the best propaganda was pure entertainment: comedy, romance and ""light"" music. ""There must be opinion,"" he told his minions. ""But opinion does not mean tedium."" S.A. MANN BRAND is therefore a rarity. It is an overtly political story of the last stage of the ""Kampfzeit,"" the ""struggle for power"" which the Nazis waged from 1919 until they finally climbed into the governmental saddle in 1932, told through the eyes of ""Fritz Brand,"" a fictional version of the very real Nazi apostle Horst Wessel.When I was doing my research, back in 2004, I couldn't obtain a copy of the film, and had to accept all the one-line reviews I was able to find in history books as fact. They were universally harsh, with one historian claiming the acting was wooden, the script lifeless and the direction like someone placed a camera in a room and then forgot it was there (ouch!). So you can imagine my surprise when I bought the film last year and discovered it surprisingly well-crafted and entertaining, if somewhat corny and ham-fisted, propaganda biopic.Fritz Brand (Heinz Klingenberg) leads a double life. By day he's an ordinary, working-class Berlin truck driver. By night is a member of the S.A., the infamous ""Brownshirts,"" i.e. the private army of the Hitler's National Socialist Party. A totally committed Nazi, Brand is well-regarded by his neighbors, deeply respected by his fellow troopers and worshiped by his little brother, just as he's despised and hated by his opposite numbers in the ""Red Front"" -- the private army of the Communist Party. However, all is not peaches and cream for Brand at home. His girlfriend Anni Baumann (Wera Leissem) is actually a spy for the communists, and his Papa (Otto Wernicke), is an embittered communist sympathizer who detests the Nazis and has no respect for his son's political beliefs. The Reds, worried by Brand's effectiveness as an organized with the general election so close, soon target him specifically, getting him fired from his job and using his conflicted gal-pal to set him up for a hit. The question is, will his girl tip him to the plot, or sell him out? Given the actual fate of Horst Wessel, whose life man this movie loosely depicts, the answers aren't quite as obvious as you might think.S.A. MANN BRAND was released in theaters in 1933, when the paint on the Nazi regime was still wet, and by all accounts, it was not a big hit. Communists and Social Democrats had no desire to see a movie about how they lost the country to their hated rivals, and the Nazis themselves were probably ready for some ""light entertainment"" after years of ""opinion"" during the long, exhausting struggle for power. And of course, after WW2, the film was banned and remains banned in many countries around the world, so I'm fairly certain many of its most vocal critics have never actually seen it. Now that I have, I'm bound to say that it is actually quite a good movie within the obvious limitations imposed by the regime and the genre. There is plenty of action, including some gunfights, and although Brand is portrayed as a half-messianic spear-carrier for the Idea, there is actually very little Nazi ideology in the story. The S.A. are simply shown as men who want to undo the evil done by the Versailles Treaty and restore Germany to greatness: in contrast, the Communists are depicted, not without accuracy, as taking both their ideology and their orders from Moscow. The twin devices of making Brand's father sympathetic to them rather than to Hitler, and to make Brand's love interest a Red of wavering conviction, are also fairly effective, although the father's ultimate ""conversion"" is not very convincing. Similarly, and like many German films of the 30s, the story has an odd tendency to keep its distance from its characters, and also to abandon its main character at the end in favor of depicting the triumph of the Nazis in the general election. In this respect it is not as egregious as a similar movie made around the same time called HANS WESTMAR, but it's not a particularly satisfying way to close the show, either.All in all, if you're interested in old German movies, Nazi cinema, or even just propaganda films from the WW2-era, I'd recommend this to you as a historical snapshot. It's not as bombastic as many movies produced by the Allies in later years meant to stir up ""awareness"" (meaning hatred and fear) of the Nazis, and provides important insight to a question rarely asked nowadays, to wit: How did the Nazis see themselves?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBZ2ZKNP9UXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AO00NO#wasThisHelpful","R3NBZ2ZKNP9UXX","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE DEVIL STRIKES AT NIGHT is an interesting if somewhat flawed West German movie which is easy to watch but hard to categorize. It can't really be called a mystery since the identity of the murderer is established almost immediately. It isn't really a Noir film, either, since the protagonist is not morally ambiguous. If labels are important, then I'd call it a suspense film and leave it at that. The point is that by ""being its own thing"" it avoids some of the trope-traps common to these genres: but because it is ""its own thing,"" it falls into a few traps of its own making.The story begins with local oaf Bruno Luedke (Mario Adorf) having dinner in a cafe in Hamburg. It's 1944 and WW2 is raging, but Bruno is ""Article 51"" -- mildly retarded -- and isn't going to be drafted. Instead he makes a living as a laborer. Bruno, however, has an interesting hobby: he likes to strangle women with his bare hands. His next victim, a waitress, turns out to be the mistress of a local Nazi Party official named Willi Keun (the wonderful Werner Peters, later of BATTLE OF THE BULGE fame). When Keun gets arrested for the murder, however, Hamburg police inspector Axel Kersten (Claus Holm), who has recently returned from the Eastern Front, isn't so sure of Keun's guilt. Seems that Keun was rejected from military service for a deformed thumb; his hands were too weak to crush the throat of the victim. This detail nags at him, and when he's at his would-be girlfriend Helga's apartment (Annemarie Dringer), he sees an old newspaper describing an old murder which precisely  matches the circumstances of the new one, and begins to suspect a serial killer may be at work. Studies of other unsolved murders lead soon lead him to suspect Bruno, and this theory brings him to the attention of SS Gruppenfhrer Rossdorf (Hannes Messemer, of THE GREAT ESCAPE), who believes that if the killer really is a ""mental defective"", it will serve as propaganda for the racial hygiene policies of the Nazi government. Everything proceeds more or less smoothly until Rosssorf realizes that by admitting a serial killer could operate in Germany freely would undermine the public's faith in the infallibility of the regime. He tells Kersten to drop the matter and let things ""take their course"" -- meaning let Keun will go up a rope to protect the reputation of the system. Kersten, however, refuses to do this, a decision which sets the two men on a collision course which threatens his life, the life of his girlfriend and everyone else who gets in between Rossdorf and his particular method of justice.THE DEVIL STRIKES AT NIGHT was shot in 1957, not long after the consecration of the Federal Republic of Germany, and could probably be forgiven if it delivered a heavy-handed indictment of the Nazi regime. Instead, writers Will Berthold and Werner Jrg Lddecke, and director Robert Siodmak give us an even-handed portrayal of how the ideology of the Nazis, as well as the need for the regime to always be right (something it has in common with every dictatorship in history), put unbearable pressures on those who simply wanted to get at the truth. Shades of gray are in plentiful supply all around: Party official Willi Keun is ably portrayed not as a vicious monster but simply a likeable, bumbling opportunist whose main concerns in life are eating and drinking well and pleasing his grumpy mistress, while the child-like Bruno Luedke is more pitiable than loathsome -- a manchild who simply doesn't understand that what he does for fun is wrong. Indeed, the only real evil we see in the film is Rossdorf, superbly portrayed by Messemer as a man both intoxicated with his own power and lacking any scruples whatsoever. The way he plays cat-and-mouse with Kersten is difficult to watch: he can't even offer a man a cigarette without making him feel as if he's about to be shot, and the final confrontation between the two is a masterpiece, with ethics, justice and professionalism exploding against a wall of ideology, fanaticism and smug sadism.DEVIL does have its problems, and I hesitated whether to give the film four stars or only three. The pace is somewhat slow, and the picture never quite decides whose story it wants to tell -- Luedke's or Kersten's, with the result that the storytelling has a disjointed, clumsy feel until the last half-hour or so, when the decision is made. The romance between Kersten and Helga is not brilliantly developed, either, though it does provide an interesting insight into how relationships were formed in a country which, by 1944, there were shortages of everything except slogans nobody wanted to hear. In the end, however, the suspense ramps up hard enough that it rolls over most of the movie's flaws. Throw in an ending with just the right note of ambiguity, and you have a movie which offers the viewer an almost unique look at the idea of justice in a country where the police were often the biggest criminals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGXD4ZK2P1FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078SKN9K#wasThisHelpful","R1KGXD4ZK2P1FF","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the back of my copy of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT there is a blurb which reads; ""This is the dramatic story of Harry Morgan, an honest man who is forced into running contraband between Cuba and Key West as a means of keeping his crumbling family financially afloat.""Well...not exactly, and therein lays some of the problem with this novel, but I'm getting ahead of myself. TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is indeed the story of Harry Morgan, a charter fisherman who, after resisting initial temptations in the criminal direction, is cheated so badly by a customer that he is financially ruined. In the hopes of making fast money he agrees to begin running contraband -- first illegal immigrants, then liquor, and finally revolutionaries, with each successive trip sinking him deeper into a world of criminality, violence, and deceit. In contrast with Morgan is Richard Gordon, a successful writer moving in a set of dissipated yachtsmen and their equally dissipated wives, who is just beginning to examine Key West's seamy underbelly -- a world of embittered war veterans who spend their evenings drinking and fighting. At first this is merely research for a novel, but as his marriage cracks under the strain of an affair, this ""Have"" gets a bloodier taste of how the ""Have-Nots"" live.When I was in college, I remember someone saying this novel is Hemingway's most clumsy in terms of construction. It switches back and forth from first to third person point of view, introduces important characters rather late in the book, and only dubiously succeeds in joining the two disparite story arcs -- that of Morgan, who is supposed to represent the desperate working man forced by circumstance into criminality, and Gordon, who serves as a kind of analogy for the bored, morally decayed rich people who lounge on their yachts drinking and fornicating while the locals scrabble out desperate half-lives in the sand. All of this is true. The book is disjointed, and at the end indulges in one of Hemingway's least attractive pastimes -- endless Joyce-like stream-of-consciousness internal monologues that test the reader's patience if not his sanity (""Oh he is sweet, no he isn't, I'm sweet, yes you are lovely, oh, you're so lovely, and I didn't want to, but I am, now I am really, he is sweet, no he's not, he's not even here, I'm here, I'm the one that's always here, and cannot go away, no never."") Furthermore, I had a great problem with Harry Morgan himself. As I noted above, he's described as ""an honest man,"" but in actuality he's anything but. In fact, from the very first illicit deal he carries out, it's clear he's a liar, double-crosser and murderer who has only refrained from criminality in the past because he didn't need it to make a living. There is never the slightest sense of moral conflict within him (not for breaking the rich man's laws, for which he could be excused, but for the things he does to people, or causes to happen to people, so he can make money, which is harder to swallow). Because of this I found him somewhat unsympathetic, and began only to care about him in context with what his incarceration or death would mean to his pathetic wife, Marie.On the plus side: this is easily one of Hemingway's most readable novels. It lacks the triviality of THE SUN ALSO RISES or the vein of silliness and self-pity that marred A FAREWELL TO ARMS, and while it is not as consistently action-packed as THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, it has plenty of drama and conflict to keep the story moving. It also provides an interesting picture of life in Key West during the Depression, a time when masses of desperate, half-starving people seethed in the background, almost unnoticed by a crowd of ultra-wealthy playboys scooting past them in yachts, and indeed, this sharp contrast is the whole raison d'etre of the novel.  Hemingway seems to have enjoyed using his characters as analogies for whole populations and the spirits of the eras in which they lived, and if this book has anything profound to say about the dilemma of the poor, the way they are perpetually ground between the rich man's laws and the terrible alternative of revolution, it perhaps can be found in the chapters involving Morgan and the Cuban revolutionaries: ""What the hell do I care about his revolution,"" Harry thinks. ""F--- his revolution. To help a working man he robs a bank and kills a working man never did him any harm. That's a working man he kills. He never thinks of that....The hell with their revolutions. All I got to do is make a living and I can't do that.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IC7SYG1M47I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684818981#wasThisHelpful","R3IC7SYG1M47I5","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A frequent knock on Ernest Hemingway is that he was a terrific, even masterful writer of short stories, but a boring novelist. After reading about fifty of his short stories, I tested this theory by tackling A FAREWELL TO ARMS, and discovered I half-agreed with the assessment. Everything to do with the war itself Hemingway captured brilliantly and memorably. Everything to do with the romance between the main characters I found painfully shallow, dull and silly. Nevertheless I read the book on the first attempt. I can't say the same for THE SUN ALSO RISES. Over the course of about 30 years I must have made a half-dozen attempts to read this book through and always gave up out of sheer boredom after a half-dozen chapters. At the tender age of 42, however, I have finally succeeded in finishing it, and came to a small epiphany about Hemingway, to wit: the key to enjoying him as a novelist is to possess some degree of life experience, because not only will that help you grasp what his books are are really about, it will also give you the patience to endure some of his more tedious passages.THE SUN ALSO RISES begins in Paris during the early 1920s. The protagonist and narrator, Jake Barnes, is a writer who works for a cable news service. During the First World War Jake suffered a wound which rendered him impotent, and this places him permenently and uncomfortably in the friendship zone with his great love, Lady Brett Ashley, a beautiful socialite who is just coming off an expensive divorce. Lady Ashley is rather a nasty piece of work. Despite having already found herself a fiance of sorts, she frequently takes lovers, only to discard them casually and then find new ones. This is the fate of Jake's friend Robert Cohn, a Jewish novelist on the cusp of fame who is naive about women and can't let go of the affair. Cohn's inability to do this creates increasing instability amongst the group of dissipate young exparriates with whom Jake runs: their unspoken code is to wallow in pleasure, take nothing seriously and above all, never admit to any genuine emotions. Jake must confront the damage Lady Ashely's selfish antics are doing to his own life and reputation while watching Cohn self-destruct. He must also come to grips with his own unresolved feelings for the woman he loves but can never have.If this description sounds a little vague, that is because the book itself is vague. It has a simple plot, almost no character development, and a meandering structure which, I suppose, reflects its characters' somewhat meaningless lives. Much has been made of the quote at the beginning of the book, uttered by Gertrude Stein to Hemingway in conversation: ""You are all a lost generation."" She was referring, of course, to those who emerged from the First World War, alive but not necessarily physically or morally intact. They had no religious faith, no patriotism, no deep feelings or beliefs, not even much grasp of friendship, and THE SUN ALSO RISES seems to uses the group of Jake, Cohn, Lady Brett, Mike and Bill to serve as an analogy for that mentality. This is a book full of ennui, anomie and nihilism, masquerading as a good time.The flaws of this novel and its strengths are very closely found up. Hemingway understood the expatriate crowd very well, being one of them in real life, and I'm guessing the book is quite accurate in depicting their facetious existentialism.There are a number of subtle and not-so-subtle comments about the dark side of the human condition which make for great if tragic reading: like the Romans in SPARTACUS, these are people so hollow they must contunually fill themselves with distraction -- with food, drink, sex, travel, and the simulacrum of excitement, just to feel even half-alive. Psychologically it's a fascinating picture of human dissipation, tinged with tragedy. It also paints a very interesting picture of Europe, something Hemingway did brilliantly and often subtly, by concentrating on small rather than large details. On the other hand -- well, who cares? The stakes of the novel are very low, because it's hard to give a damn about people this frivolous and blunted. Like the soap opera characters of my youth, those beautiful men and women whose tears were always trickling onto their money, the cast here is very difficult to sympathize with. Barnes is a half-decent sort with some identifiable motives -- frustrated longing, jealousy, and a weak desire to do the right thing, whatever that is -- but Cohn is an awful whiny snot, Lady Ashley is a psychopath, Bill and Mike are drunken, mean-spirited bullies, and sometimes I wished someone would come along with a pistol and put the lot of them out of their misery.Reading THE SUN ALSO RISES at 42, however, made a big difference to me. As a high-schooler or a twentysomething all I could see was the shallowness of the puddle that is this novel; I didn't grasp its reflective aspects. If Hemingway was good at anything, it was making observations about life via his novels, and as we get older and become harder and more cynical, we often see resemblances between ourselves and those we despised when we were younger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2RO2G6YD1LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2RP2AU#wasThisHelpful","R3D2RO2G6YD1LM","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHISTLE STOP is an entertaining but rather dumb 1946 film Noir movie directed by Lonide Moguy and adapted for the screen from the novel of the same name by Maritta M. Wolf. The story begins in the town of Ashbury, which is not much more than a ""whistle stop"" along a Midwestern railway line. Gorgeous hometown girl Mary (Ava Gardner) has returned after two years of living large in Chicago -- ostensibly to arrange the sale of her house, but in reality to see if her ex-flame Kenny Veech (George Raft), a tough guy who refuses to get a job and spends all his time drinking and playing cards. When she sees that Kenny is still small-time, she gravitates to his mortal enemy Lew Lentz (Tom Conway), a suave but shady nightclub owner. This brings to a boil the long-simmering feud between the two, a fact which is not lost on the aptly-named Gitlo (Victor McLagen), a bartender who works for Lentz but despises him. Gitlo proposes that he and Kenny rob and then murder Lentz, and Kenny, eager to score a big payday so he can prove to Mary he's not small-time, readily agrees. Two stark facts interfere with this plan. The first is Mary's discovery of it, which forces her to make a choice between Kenny or Lew. The second, even harder to swallow, is the fact that just because you are plotting someone's downfall, doesn't mean he isn't plotting yours -- or that he may be better at murder than you.THE CHASE is in some ways typical of the Noir films of this period. It is full of morally ambiguous characters,and plenty of cheap whiskey, fist-fights, card-playing, and tough-guy/snarky dame dialogue. There is also an unspoken belief that the audience will naturally side with the toughest man and the most beautiful woman, and will genuinely care whether they get what they want, irrespective of how scummy or deficient they are.The film's assets are Ava Gardner's looks, fairly assured direction, the somewhat unusual take of setting a Noir movie in a small Midwestern town rather than a big city, and a snappy sense of structure (which was lacking from screenwriter Philip Yordan's next movie, THE CHASE). And though predictable at many points, there is an interesting twist about fifty-odd minutes into the picture that had my eyebrows raised because I didn't see it coming as I did nearly everything else. I also particularly enjoyed the smooth, debonair performance of Conway as the bad guy of the piece.On the debit side...well, let's start with the characters. There is literally no important character in this movie who is actually a remotely decent human being. Mary, our heroine, is essentially a prostitute, who, like all hookers, must by nature side with whoever she thinks is the strongest man in the room -- and since she can't decide who that is, she bounced between Lew and Kenny like a ping-pong ball. Kenny is a worthless layabout who spends all of his time drinking, gambling and playing with the affections of local barmaid Fran (Jorja Curtright), who he discards like a condom whenever Mary walks in the room -- with tragic consequences for Fran. He also distrusts his only actual friend in town, Gitlo. Perhaps this is wise: Gitlo's a would-be murderer and thief who betrays his boss for money because he doesn't like him, while his boss, Lew, is supposedly worse than Kenny because...well, I honestly don't know, but you get the picture. Even Kenny's mom, who seems likeable enough, ruins everything by saying, ""They're all jealous of Kenny because he's more of a man than they'll ever be!"" Really? Kenny, who refuses to work, who won't commit to the one woman who loves him and who treats her like garbage, who slaps around anyone he dislikes, who drinks like a sponge and gambles away his mom's money at cards...Kenny is your idea of a real man?The plot suffers from a similar issue. Noir is all about moral ambiguity, but the story really revolves around how a failed robbery leads to a revenge plot, which in turn leads to acts of counter-revenge, and so on: I found that hard to care about, especially since the stakes were fairly low. As for George Raft, a cinderblock would have better acting ability -- there is a scene in which he gets shot in the arm, and I swear he looked as if he were falling asleep during the take.Despite all this, WHISTLE STOP is far from boring. The movie moves at a fairly swift clip, the dialogue is snappy without being memorable, a lot of the acting is good (notwithstanding Raft), and there is just enough unpredictability to make things interesting down the stretch. The idea of exposing the seamy side of small-town America is a fascinating one regardless of genre. I certainly don't regret watching this film, but I do wish a greater effort had been made to make me care whether Kenny and Mary will live happily ever after. Or even live to the end of the movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJUZAYFHUPKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013Z2VBM#wasThisHelpful","R1SJUZAYFHUPKO","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE CHASE is a weird an rather incoherent Noir film from the mid-1940s, directed by Arthur Ripley and adapted for the screen from a novel by Philip Yordan. The story begins with a down-on-his luck war vet named Chuck Scott (Robert Cummings) finding a cash-stuffed wallet on a busy Miami street. He returns the wallet -- and the cash (minus two bucks for lunch and cab fare) to its owner, a big-time gangster named Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran) who is amused and impressed by Scott's honesty. Much to the chagrin of his right-hand man Gino (Peter Lorre), Eddie decides to hire ""Scotty"" as his new chauffeur -- after testing his nerve via a rather unique method which I won't reveal here. Before Scotty has even settled in, however, he's approached by Eddie's miserably trod-upon wife Lorna (Michele Morgan), who is also impressed with his honesty -- enough to ask him to run away with her to Havana. The couple promptly take off by boat, but only once they've escaped do their troubles begin: Scotty is promptly framed for murder, and it's obvious the long reach of Eddie Roman has found its way to Cuba. To make matters worse, the murderous Gino has appeared, just to make sure the case goes the right way. And after that...well, that's as far as I can go in this review without spoiling anything. Suffice to say that Mr. Scott's stay in Cuba won't be appearing on the brochure.THE CHASE is wrongly named. It is not, as I thought, a film about lovers on the run, but rather about a troubled veteran whose grasp of reality is a lot less firm than his grasp on those damned tickets to Havana. And there are many, many problems. There is no character development, only a rudimentary plot, some of the most important events in the movie don't actually happen (or do they?), the structure is clumsy, and the character of Chuck Scott is almost completely enigmatic. How he feels about Roman, or about the grisly murder he knows Roman has just committed, is never revealed to us: nor is it really clear whether he cares for Lorna or merely decides she's a better bet than the gangster. I get that this is Film Noir, where morally ambiguous characters are the order of the night, but there's a difference between morally ambiguous and vague. As for the final act, it turns on a rather unbelievable series of coincidinces that make Miami seem like a town populated by perhaps eleven people, all of whom know each other and go to the name nightclub. And the couple's escape plan -- is there a dumber choice of destination when trying to escape a Miami kingpin than Havana? You'd have about as easy a time hiding there as a Philly gangster would trying to take refuge in Atlantic City.Balancing these problems are fine performances from Lorre as a somewhat long-suffering hitman-henchman (Lorre is much more understated here than in some of his other work) and by Steve Cochran, who excels as the smoothly vicious gangster who slaps around his manicurist and feeds rival businessmen to the dog in his basement when he isn't terrorizing his wife. Amidst the confusion of the plot which occurs around midway through the film as the result of its rather violent twist, there is also some snappy Noir dialogue, such as:LORNA: What was Havana like?SCOTTY: Cheap restaurants, cheap hotels, cheap friends -- every place is the same when you don't have any money.Truth be told, despite its flaws, I found the film enjoyable -- especially the first half. The sequence where shipping magnate Emmerich Johnson (Lloyd Corrigan) is invited to dinner by Roman, only to end up becoming dinner himself, is a memorable example of how to make the audience uncomfortable by toying with a character who doesn't know he's in danger. And the sequences in Cuba are all very well done, with Scott trying desperately to convince a flinty Havana homicide detective that he's an innocent man. Ultimately, though I think this movie had more potential than it did product. If you're a hard-core fan of Noir, you'll probably enjoy every second of THE CHASE, but if you're ambiguous about moral ambiguity, this chase may seem a bump ride.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYTQEQ83FNYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009NH8D#wasThisHelpful","R2FYTQEQ83FNYE","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always a little reluctant to buy clothing online, for the obvious reason that you can't try it on. When my supply of gym clothes began to look increasingly worn-out, however, I decided to take a small chance on this tank top, and I'm glad I did. It met all my expectations. It's good-looking, rugged, fits extremely well (not too loose, not too tight), and has the positive side-effect of making me look like I'm in better shape than I really am. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a t-top that is both cool to look at and rugged enough to stand up to lots of sweat and many washings and dryings. I've also noticed that unlike many shirts and tank tops I've bought over the years, the printed design isn't flaking off or fading yet, despite a lot of sun exposure, heat and so forth. The only possible drawback is that the dark blue color makes it a little hotter to wear in sunny weather, but I knew that when I bought the thing.I'm very happy with this purchase and would buy from this manufacturer again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B2D0L2SB6QUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHRVM9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1B2D0L2SB6QUG","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GUNG HO! is a by-the-numbers propaganda-style war movie shot during WW2. It tells the story of the 2nd Marine Raider battalion -- how it was formed, how it was trained, and its first experience in combat with the Japanese. It is absolutely typical of the films of that period, and labors under a staggering burden of war-movie cliches, some of which have become so anachronistic as to be outright hilarious, but which at the time probably hit close to home; and it remains mildly entertaining and a good example both of American war movies generally, and of wartime propaganda.The film begins just after Pearl Harbor. The Marines are forming a special unit under the gentlemanly Colonel Thorwald (Randolf Scott, taking off his cowboy hat to put on a Marine cover). This all-volunteer outfit will consist of the roughest, toughest, nastiest S.O.B.'s the Corps can produce, and naturally, that includes guys from every walk of life, including an old-school leatherneck nicknamed Transport (Sam Levene), a cool-headed immigrant officer from Greece (J. Carrol Naish), a pair of quarreling half-brothers (David Bruce and Noah Beery, Jr.), a hot-tempered punk kid from Brooklyn (Harold Landon), a big galoot hog farmer known as Rube (Rod Cameron) and an ex-prizefighter called Pig Iron (Robert Mitchum)...among other soldaten right out of Central Casting. After a long, tough period training, during which we get a comedic-romantic sub-plot which pits the two half-brothers against each other for the affections of a Rosie Riveter-type (Grace McDonald), the Raiders deploy via submarine to attack a Japanese radio base in the Pacific, and test their mettle against the hated enemy, who outnumbers them two to one and can be expected to hold the island to the last.As I said, this movie is chock-full-to-bursting with cliches. The Americans are courageous, insolent smart-allecks who rarely miss a shot, while the Japanese are cunning, treacherous and extremely stupid. Officers are depicted as warm, intelligent and caring while the NCO's are loveable old salts (I kept thinking of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in FULL METAL JACKET...not quite so loveable!) The training montages are effectively designed to show the ferocious skills required to be a commando, while the battle sequences are lively and brutal, though ironically the Americans are much better at judo than the Japanese, who invented the art. Oddly realistic moments, such a chilling conversation between Marines about how best to kill a man with a knife (""If you do it like this, he can't scream!""), contrast with Hollywood hokum of the worst sort: guys get fatally wounded and say things like, ""Thy will be done!"" to the tune of the Marine Corps anthem, or, even worse, ""When do we get to Tokyo, sarge?"" Et cetera and so on. Still, the corniness of GUNG HO! is a large part of its charm: it reflected the style of the era, and despite the heavy-handed means by which the message is delivered, there's no doubt that the producers wanted people to understand that this war was not about winning the war but rather winning the peace after it was over -- or, as Thorwald says, ""Constructing a social order based on freedom!"" A bit heavy, but not out of line with what I've been told by veterans of the Big One was their actual motivation for fighting. They wanted to smash tyranny and build a better world, and if that meant 40-mile marches, sweltering temperatures, malarial mosquitos and the very real possibility of dying a horrible death, so be it....and GUNG HO!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HW6769FPMMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HAB4V2#wasThisHelpful","R31HW6769FPMMO","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ghosts were not an unusual phenomenon on THE SHADOW, and what almost every one of them had in common was...homicidal mania. Friendly spirits, of the Caspar variety were not to be found. Even ambiguous ones, a la Hamlet's dad, also need not apply. Anyone coming back from the dead on THE SHADOW, or even claiming to usually had murder on his mind. The Black Abbot was no different.The story begins in an ancient church, somewhere in New England, which is under renovation. Two workmen are going about their business late at night when they are confronted by what appears to be the ghost of a long-dead abbot. When members of the church committee responsible for the restoration attempt to spend the night in the church to allay the fears of the work crew, one of them ends up dead -- hanged from the neck by the bell rope. Enter Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane, who have been brought in by the committee in the hopes of finding who, or what, is responsible for the haunting of the church. Lamont assures everyone that ghosts don't exist, but is soon confronted by the Black Abbot, who may or may not be of the flesh, but is definitely deadly.""The Black Abbot"" was, if memory serves, Bill Johnstone's first episode as THE SHADOW after the departure of Orson Welles, and perhaps it was understandable that the writers and producers of the show wanted to begin with a middle-of-the-road story that was neither too ordinary (the usual bunch of gangsters) or too outrageous (brain-stealing mad scientists bent on world conquest), to allow the audience to warm up to their new invisible avenger. As it happens ""The Black Abbot"" is a respectable listen with an unusually ferocious climax, but it suffers a little from Lamont's overriding certainty that the ghost is, in fact, a murderer with a material motive. Later on the writers were better at exploring Lamont's ambiguity about the supernatural, which added a much-needed element of doubt to the storylines. On the plus side, Johnstone, who was to play The Shadow until drafted in 1943, delivers a smooth performance that became the template of how the character was to be played until it finally went off the air in 1954. Of further note, the character of Margo was still depicted by Agnes Moorehead, who remained in that role until almost the end of 1939.""The Black Abbot"" was originally broadcast on October 2, 1938 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow and Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32C2M805HNNN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ54F8#wasThisHelpful","R32C2M805HNNN6","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's said that popular entertainment takes its cues from the world around it. Thus you get ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" during the McCarthy/Red Scare era, ""Dirty Harry"" during the height of the urban crime wave, ""Rocky IV"" during the Cold War, etc. and so on. Well, ""The Power of the Mind"" very much reflects the atmosphere of the late 1930s, when fear of spies, fifth columnists and foreign dictators stalked the land.The story begins with a conversation between Lamont Cranston and Professor John Hardy, the inventor of a new type of super-powerful explosive whose formula is known only to him. Not realizing he is sitting across from the invisible avenger, Hardy expresses scientific interest in telepathic hypnosis, the secret of The Shadow's power. Shortly thereafter, Hardy disappears; whereupon Cranston begins to get the uneasy feeling that Hardy has been kidnapped and is trying to communicate with his alter ego. He and Margo set out to track down the missing genius, and soon butt heads with a vicious hang of enemy agents who will stop at absolutely nothing -- kidnapping, torture, or murder -- to pry the secret formula from Hardy's brain.THE SHADOW began its run in 1937, when the Spanish Civil War was raging, Japan was swallowing China, Hitler rearming, Mussolini muscling into Africa, and Stalin on the march all over Eastern Europe. Americans felt the storm-clouds gathering, and their natural isolationism was creeping into a dreaded certainty that war was inevitable and that the dictators were already eyeing America as their next target. All these feelings pervade the story, which is quite brutal, features almost unveiled references to Nazism, and leaves no doubt that these guys don't play by Marquis of Queensbury rules. On top of this, there is the added element of Cranston having a sort of psychic bond with Hardy, which adds a wrinkle to an otherwise straight spy story. Of interest to the listener as well: the enemy agent is played by Bill Johnstone, who would end up replacing Orson Welles as The Shadow just a few months after this show aired.""Power of the Mind"" was originally broadcast on April 24th, 1938 and stars Orson Welles as The Shadow and Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGTRBY3H1W47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ53AE#wasThisHelpful","R2XGTRBY3H1W47","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love George Orwell, and over the years I've read almost everything he every set down on paper: novels, books, reportage, opinion, reviews. Having run out of published works, I decided to buy DIARIES, so as to begin the process of cleaning the slate completely. I knew, of course, that Orwell's diaries were not going to be the same time of reading experience as his other works, but I admit now that I wasn't entirely prepared for just how different it would be.DIARIES is, as the name implies, plural. Orwell kept a number of different types of diaries in his life, and those which have survived can be classified into three rough groups: travel diaries, domestic diaries, and events diaries. The editors of this book have woven them together in mostly chronological way, so as to follow G.O. during the crucial years of his life, from the mid-1930s, just before he left for a rest-cure in Marakesh, to his all too premature death in Britain in 1950. There is much in these pages of both personal and historical interest, for Orwell lived during some of the most tumultuous times in European history and saw some of that history firsthand, and as an avid record-keeper he was meticulous about setting down what he saw and reflecting upon it. What's more, the diaries -- particularly the travel diaries -- formed the basis of several of his most famous essays.What I most enjoyed about the book were the events diaries Orwell kept during the darkest years of the Second World War. Some of these are merely daily recordings of the world's happenings with Orwell's comments on the same, while others reflect his personal experiences -- dodging bombs during the Blitz, attending a meeting of British Fascists, drilling with the Home Guard, etc., etc. I found these riveting, for they not only reflect the desperate situation of Britain during the early war years, but form a picture of what it was like for the ordinary person to live through this tumultuous time -- exhausted from air-raid sirens, hungry from rationing, uncertain about the future and clinging to any pleasure or distraction they could find. Orwell's comments on the British military leadership, government, and behavior of the upper classes during this period are utterly scathing and provide a rude counterpoint to the historical image of Churchill as the calm, heroic mastermind behind Allied victory and the British as phlegmatic and ""all in this together."" And I was extremely impressed, as well as touched, by the moral struggle Orwell went through when deciding whether to stay in Britain if it was invaded or become a refugee. The passages on that subject are brief, bitter, defiant, but demonstrate why this main was and is so deeply respected. There's no phony bravado, only a sweaty determination to stay true to his ideals ""even if it means ending up in a concentration camp.""Orwell's travel diaries were quite interesting as well, but some of the North African and ""Wigan Pier"" passages will seem extremely familiar to anyone who read his essays written during these same periods. As I said, Orwell drew heavily on these when writing those essays, as well as THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER, etc. -- down to including many of the same sentences word for word, so Orwell fanatics may find these chapters a little duller than they might otherwise have been, although there is also much unfamiliar material, for example, his encounters with Foreign Legionnaires and his thoughts about them. Of enormous disappointment to me was the fact that none -- none! -- of Orwell's diaries kept during the Spanish Civil War are included, for the simple reason that he lost them all during the war -- some were stolen when he was wounded, and others confiscated by the government. These alone would have justified the price of the book.My main issue with DIARIES is that far too much of it is taken up with the domestic diaries, which were interesting to me in small doses but which became numbingly repetitious in short order. Reason? Though it is only slightly reflected in his published works, Orwell was a dedicated, in fact almost a fanatical, amateur gardener and farmer. Wherever he went he planted vegetables and fruits and kept goats, hens and other fowl, and during his poorest years as a struggling writer made a respectable side-income as a shopkeeper and seller of eggs and produce. Thus, about half the entire book is dedicated to what the weather was like, how the crops were doing, how many eggs had been laid, whether foxes had eaten the rooster, whether the red mites had been exterminated from the hen house, what sort of fertilizer and insecticide were best, etc., etc. Though all of this gave me an insight into Eric Blair -- George Orwell was, after all, only a character Blair played, more than pseudonym but less than an alter ego -- it's just plain boring after awhile.In the end, I'm not at all sorry I bought DIARIES. Orwell was one of the great literary figures of the 20th century, and any glimpse into his mind with its guard down is an honor. Like many honors, however, it is also a bit of a burden. George Orwell was a revolutionist, commentarian, visionary and muckraker of the first order; Eric Blair was a bloke who enjoyed the occasional pint 'n pipe while knocking the dirt from his boots after a tough day of digging potato trenches in his garden, and the latter, while charming, is not all that exciting to read about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZTGOE5OU1BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871406640#wasThisHelpful","RHZTGOE5OU1BA","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whenever people saw me reading CO. AYTCH, they invariably frowned at the word ""Confederate"" in the subtitle. Evidently in today's politically correct climate, it's infra dig to read anything written by those who once wore gray. When I asked them if they'd seen Ken Burns' documentary on the Civil War, however, they all instantly said, ""Yes!"" and were dismayed to learn that the book had formed a significant amount of Burns' narrative. So: nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.Now, to cases.Sam Watkins wrote this marvelous little war memoir in 1881, long after the war had ended and the rebel banner ""had been furled, never to be unfurled."" A former member of the illustrious First Tennessee Regiment of the Confederate States Army, Watkins decided to set down his remarkable experiences for posterity, acknowledging in the opening pages that as he wrote, ""there was no north or south, but only one nation, undivided."" However, he quickly takes us back to a time when that was anything but the case -- 1861. Like many of his fellows, Watkins joined The (not yet) Lost Cause full of passionate zeal to defend what he saw as the sovereignty of the state of Tennessee, its right to secede from the Union if it so chose, and to resist any efforts to forcibly bring it back into the same. Watkins, like the other 94% of those who carried arms for the C.S.A., did not own slaves and did not consider the ""peculiar institution"" to be a factor in why he fought. His attitude was simply: ""Yankees, stay the hell off my land.""In every war, there are a handful of soldiers who cheat the statistical odds and serve from first shot to last without serious injury or death. Sam Watkins was such a soldier. In fact ""of the 3,200 men (1,250 when the regiment was first raised, plus a further 1,950 recruited or conscripted between then and then end of the war) who fought in the First Tennessee, only 65 were left to be paroled on that day."" He marched or rode by rail all over contested America, serving with the Army of Tennessee under -- in order, the sternly incompetent Braxton Bragg, the beloved but retreat-crazy Joe Johnston, and the self-destructively aggressive John Bell Hood. He fought at Shiloh, participated in the invasion of Kentucky, and a hundred other engagements throughout Tennessee and Georgia, including Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Franklin and Nashville. He killed Yankees and was in turn shot by them, and got captured more than once, only to escape and return to his regiment. He brushed shoulders with many a historical figure, including Albert Sydney Johnston (as he lay dying), Patrick Cleburne, Bishop Polk, Stonewall Jackson, and many others, but rose himself only to the rank of ""fourth corporal,"" and took a great deal of pride in being an ordinary foot-slogger. For these reasons alone the book is worth reading, but in fact it is Watkins' personality which elevates what could be a run of the mill war memoir to something special, something of more than merely historical value. Sam Watkins had a hell of a sense of humor, tinged with both patriotic feeling and an unobtrusive but deep religious conviction, which made the horrors of war tolerable to him, and will often make the reader laugh out loud...or blink away tears. Watkins is not an expert prose-writer, but like many gifted amateurs, he is often able to connect with the reader emotionally, especially when talking about lost battles or dead friends. On the other hand, he is constantly pointing out the foibles and shenanigans of war with rude good humor. I could choose from many examples of his brand of black comedy, but I'll discipline myself to just one, a quotation about Stonewall Jackson which summed up that eminent soldier's attitude toward discipline: ""He'd have a man shot at the drop of a hat, and he'd drop the hat himself.""In regards to those who hesitate to read the book lest it be ""too sympathetic"" to the South, the fact is that while Watkins' Southern patriotism beats like a pulse throughout the whole book, and he frequently boasts about just how often his outfit beat up on the Yankees, he so frequently damns the Confederacy for its various stupidities, blunders and contradictions, and so often mingles praise for the courage of the Northern soldier with contempt for his propensity to rob and burn, that even the most eminent Southern-haters will take some pleasure in his writings. What's more, he recognizes the fatal absurdity of the Southern cause, that it was almost certainly doomed from the start, that it betrayed its own convictions almost immediately by adopting the same centralized institutions as the North, and was perhaps best lost anyway, since ""one nation, undivided"" seems to have been God's design for the country. Watkins may have been unrepentant and partisan, but he was neither a fool nor a fanatic.By coincidence, I write this on Veteran's Day, and I can hardly think of a better book to review under the circumstances. Sam Watkins may not have been in the U.S. Army, but he was a quintessential American of his time, and the fact that his words are still avidly read today is a testament to the principles by which he lived -- and fought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UC3B642H2UYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619491451#wasThisHelpful","R3UC3B642H2UYJ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This booklet -- it's too short to really qualify as a book -- is an English-language transcription of two speeches given by the Nazi Party's chief propagandist, Joseph Goebbels, during the years 1935 and 1936. It's not exactly a secret that the Nazis had a murderous grudge against Jews, but it is less well known that they viewed Judaism and Communism as synonymous, actually viewing Communism as an expression of Judaism, that is to say, a political platform of, by and for Jews. (Hence Dietrich Eckhart's book, BOLSHEVISM FROM MOSES TO LENIN.)The speeches are more or less alike in structure. Both contrast the theories and slogans of Communism -- equal distribution of resources, abolition of private property, elimination of social classes, solidarity of workers and peasants -- with the realities of Communism: purges, slave labor, assassination, mass starvation, subversion of existing governments, etc., etc. Goebbels' uses extensive quotations from non-Nazi sources, such as an independent counsel of religious leaders (including, surprisingly, a the head of a large rabbinate) to back up his claims, while also contrasting the bloody methods of the Bolsheviks with the supposedly more peaceable tactics of the National Socialists. However, and as I said above, he strives constantly to link Judaism with the Communist leadership, pointing out the many Jews of powerful stature in various nations who had been or were Communists -- Karl Marx, Bela Kun, Kurt Eisner, Genrich Yagoda, Erich Mhsam, Karl Radek, etc., etc. The linkage between Jews and Communism was a core part of Nazi ideology and explained both the infamous ""Commissar Order"" issued by Hitler and the actions of the Special Action Groups in the USSR during Germany's invasion of that country in 1941. These ""Einsatzgruppen"" had standing orders to execute, summarily, every military Commissar and every Communist official of whatever rank, that they encountered during the invasion, and they did so with great enthusiasm. However, the Einsatzkommando did not stop with these people but expanded their mandate to include every Jew they ran into, under the rationale that Jews were basically unofficial commissars themselves, and carried the ""bacillus"" of Communist thought. The seeds of such actions were, consciously or unconsciously, being sewn here.With the possible exception of Otto Dietrich, Goebbels was far and away the smartest, the most eloquent, and the most erudite of Hitler's disciples, and this book demonstrates this fact. His monologues generally lack the tedious pedantry of Alfred Rosenberg or the rambling and often repetitious rants of Adolf Hitler, and are structured in a more logical way. Goebbels had an inborn instinct for crowd psychology, and his academic training came in handy when he penned his speeches. However, I would be lying if I said by themselves they made for riveting reading. The fact is that most speeches are written in an entirely different style than academic works -- they are meant to engage and incite. These, on the other hand, though they have flashes of his trademark sarcasm, are actually quite ""pedagogical"" in nature. Evidently Goebbels thought that this argument needed to be made on an intellectual level, or perhaps he simply hadn't unlearned his university training yet (his ""Total War"" speech of '43 shows that he definitely was capable of striking at the adrenal glands as well as the brain), but at any rate they are not edge-of-your-seat stuff. They are, however, an interesting window into the very core of Nazi thought.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3RF8S0N8KLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1494233541#wasThisHelpful","R3O3RF8S0N8KLO","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of the boob tube. This is the story of Dr. Quincy -- no first name ever given! -- a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell: and the fifth season continues where three and four left off in that the budgets were getting larger and the episodes slowly but surely getting edgier.Some of my favorites:""No Way To Treat A Flower"" - Quincy is shocked to discover a deadly plant poison is being mixed with marijuana with deadly results, yet the sale of the poison to smokers is completely legal.""Hot Ice"" - Quincy in Vegas. Stolen diamonds. Secret agents. Nuff said.""Mode of Death"" - Quincy uses the technique of ""psychological autopsy"" to solve the mysterious death of a television evangelist.""The Money Plague"" -- Money recovered from a D.B. Cooper-like unsolved hijacking turns out to be loaded with anthrax.""For the Benefit of my Patients"" - Quincy once again tackles the practice of ""pay before stay"" at rich hospitals, which costs poor patients their lives.""Murder by S.O.P."" -- Quincy's big mouth lands him in a small town jail, which promptly catches fire; he ends up railroaded into taking on the case.""Cover-Up"" -- Circumstances surrounding the death at a medical clinic are covered up by two young doctors, who must then face Quincy's wrath.""The Winning Edge"" - The death of a female gymnast puts Quince on the trail of a coach who may be dispensing uppers to her athletes.""New Blood"" - Quincy butts heads with a good-looking pathologist who he feels isn't experienced enough to handle the politically sensitive murder case she's working on.""T.K.O."" - When death strikes too close to home -- meaning at Danny's -- Quincy takes up a lance against unregulated medical care facilities.""Final Gift"" - When an old friend of Quincy's dies from arsenic poisoning after a blood transfusion, he discovers that his other old pal, who donated the blood, may be the victim of a murder plot in progress.""Deadly Arena"" - Quince must race against time to prevent a massive epidemic of botulism from wiping out the World Cup.I'm leaving out some winners here, but suffice to say Season 5 is another winner, perhaps a percentage point or two below Season 4 in terms of overall quality, but still excellent and a lot of fun. In fact, QUINCY was and remains a unique series in the annals of television. It was neither a medical program nor a mystery show, but combined both elements and also introduced audiences to the world of forensic pathology -- twenty years before CSI hit the airwaves. At the same time its structure was equally unique, in that two-thirds of the storylines were about causes which the producers, and Jack Klugman, felt needed a champion, or evils which needed to be exposed to the viewing public: autism, the ""code of silence"" in medicine, toxic waste dumping, plastic surgery malpractice, dangerous airline regulations, affirmative action and organ donation are all subjected to the ill-tempered Quincy treatment. It's true that by modern standards the show is sappy and heavy-handed, that the technology is laughably outdated, and so on, but it's also true that nearly every ""cause"" tackled by QUINCY has yet to be resolved today. Some shows date badly, and others remain timely while having a wonderful sense of nostalgia. QUINCY is the latter. So the next time you're in L.A., give him a ring. You may be murdered during the visit, but I guarantee he will find out who did it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRPFP84TTVXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJXO48W#wasThisHelpful","R3MRPFP84TTVXW","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A number of SHADOW episodes dealt with ""spiritualism"" and the occult. This is not the flashiest of the bunch by any means, but it is a pretty effective mystery-suspense story with the sort of late-episode twist that distinguishes a good episode from a very good one.We begin with the brutal murder of a wealthy man named Sanders who is caught in mid-snitch to the police while on his telephone. Cut to the murderers: a gang whose racket is a using fake seances to wring cash out of the bereaved rich. Since Sanders' daughter Consuela is still under the thrall of the gang, they aren't too worried, but maybe they should be, since Commissioner Weston has tipped Lamont Cranston to their activities in the hopes the amateur criminologist will be able to do what the police department can't. No sooner has Cranston taken the case, however, than he's target by the most dangerous type of assassin -- one who seemingly does not know they are an assassin. Soon bullets are flying, double crosses are no short supply, and it will take all of the invisible avenger's wits to avoid ending up on the wrong end of a seance himself.""Seance"" is a tightly written episode that explores a very familiar theme -- con-men with itchy trigger fingers -- and takes it in some unexpected directions, not only providing us with a first-class plot twist toward the end, but also exploring in some detail how this particular con-job was run. The 30s and 40s were perhaps the last hurrah of the high-society seance con artist, and the gang of Doc, Robbie the Gunman and Swami the Fake Swami are quite a villainous trio, who, it turns out, have more to worry about than just The Shadow.""Seance with Death"" was originally broadcast on May 25, 1947.and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZVGU044ZKFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N3AOBY#wasThisHelpful","R35ZVGU044ZKFX","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get annoyed when there is no product description for an item sold on Amazon, but I get really annoyed when the item in question is a radio compilation. How are you supposed to make an intelligent decision as to whether to buy a compilation if you don't know what the hell is in it? To rectify this omission I went to the Radio Spirits website and got a product description, and while I don't own THE SHADOW: SILENT AVENGER, I have heard everything on it. So here is a list of episodes along with a very brief description of each:The League of Terror 1-09-38 (Orson Welles): To save innocent shopkeepers from extortion, the Shadow takes on a mysterious crime lord known as The Big Boss.The Plot Murder 02-27-38 (Orson Welles): A  foreign spy with the power of hypnosis plots to assassinate the President of the United States using radical military technology and an unwilling confederate in the U.S. Army.The Silent Avenger 03-13-38 (Orson Welles): A shell-shocked former sniper is convinced by his murderous brother, now on death row, to avenge his coming execution by slaughtering the jury which convicted him.The Fire Bug 04-10-38 (Orson Welles): The Shadow goes after a gang of arsonists.Night Without End 10-16-38 (Bill Johnstone): The city is held for ransom by a gang in possession of a military device which shrouds the city in perpetual darkness.Shyster Payoff 11-06-38: (Bill Johnstone): The Shadow takes on the unholy trio of a crooked lawyer, an equally bent politician and a ruthless gangster.The Oracle of Death 10-20-40 (Bill Johnstone): Lamont and Margo are bewildered by a man who can seemingly predict the future of crime.The House of Horror 11-17-40 (Bill Johnstone): The Shadow must rescue Margo from the clutches of a mad scientist with a breathtakingly villainous agenda.The Chess Club Murders 02-23-41 (Bill Johnstone): Lamont's chess club is the scene of a series of murders, each of which has a plethora of suspects.The Unburied Dead 04-14-46 (Bret Morrison): The Shadow tangles with a vicious gang running a grisly corpse-swapping scheme.The Cat and the Killer 01-12-47 (Bret Morrison): A visit to a pet store uncovers a murderous mystery whose solution seems to lie with a cat with a diamond collar.Death Rides High 05-18-47 (Bret Morrison): The Shadow travels south of the Border to take on a ruthless alien smuggling ring.Sance With Death 05-25-47 (Bret Morrison): The occult is the backdrop for this tale where trying to communicate with the dead leads to many more of them.The Phantom of the Lighthouse 09-07-47 (Bret Morrison): Lamont and Margo investigate brutal murders taking place at a remote lighthouse, murders seemingly committed by the ghost of a long-dead pirate.Death Takes the Wheel 09-28-47 (Bret Morrison): The Shadow tangles with a gang of car insurance fraudsters.Death and the Black Fedora 01-18-48 (Bret Morrison): A missing hat is the key to a tale of blackmail, murder and memory loss that only The Shadow can solve.The Beast of Darrow House 03-07-48 (Bret Morrison): A paranormal investigator, the heiress to a supposedly haunted mansion, and The Shadow cross paths in this violent tale of a (maybe) supernatural hound.Revenge Is Murder 09-19-48 (Bret Morrison): When a gangster is left for dead by his partners in crime, he embarks on a bloodthirsty quest for vengeance.This is a pretty broad compilation of SHADOW stories, covering more than half of the show's seventeen years on the air and including tales from the three actors to definitively play the role: Welles, Johnstone and Morrison. The reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that it contains no newly discovered episodes (in recent years about fifteen supposedly ""lost"" tales have been discovered and released by Radio Spirits, who own the rights to The Shadow), and because there are a few dud episodes in the lineup (""Firebug"", ""Night Without End""). On the other hand, all the rest of the stories range from sold to spectacular, and demonstrate a pretty wide cross-section of plot types favored by the show -- meaning mystery, suspense and good old-fashioned horror. People who have been collecting THE SHADOW for years will find nothing new here, but new hands to the OTR game will definitely enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H97YPKFDHTLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617090662#wasThisHelpful","R1H97YPKFDHTLF","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Carnival of Death"" is a solid B-/C+ episode of THE SHADOW. A highly innovate and extremely macabre idea that is fairly well-executed, it lacks that ineffable quality which elevates a middle-of-the-road installment of this series from the truly outstanding, yet remains an enjoyable listen.Lamont and Margo are headed to Joy Island, an amusement park with a tragic past. On the park's opening day, a terrible subway accident killed 40 would be carnival-goers headed to the park, causing the city to shut down and seal off the line. Arriving at the Island, Lamont and Margo enter a wax museum and discover, to their horror, that is populated not by wax figures but human corpses. When they are unable to convince the carnival's owner, Mr. Norcross, of their claims, Lamont dons the Shadow's cloak and investigates, but it turns out the mystery goes way beyond -- and way deeper -- than the mysterious owner. There's a conspiracy of silence at work at this carnival, protecting a killer whose motives and modus operandi are horribly linked, and The Shadow must get to the bottom of it before Margo becomes his next victim.This story is quite original and features a killer who has been terribly wronged, yet who, in the tradition of SHADOW villains, executes a revenge scheme which sweeps up the innocent rather than the guilty in its clutches. There are  elements reminiscent of such stories as THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and WAXWORK, and an added air of mystery since the killer is seemingly being enabled by those who run and work at the carnival. Yet for some reason the episode is not scary; all the pieces are in place but the puzzle doesn't quite come together; what should be a grisly tale of insanity and revenge ends up being a modestly entertaining story and nothing more. The best thing I can say about it is that it's worth a listen.""Carnival of Death"" was originally broadcast on November 10, 1940, and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow and Marjorie Anderson as Margo Lane.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GDPABLQUCYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MTECBM#wasThisHelpful","R23GDPABLQUCYX","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my 700th review on Amazon -- yes, I have no life -- I wanted to do something special. Not just some run of the mill book or movie or product but something different, something special.LIBERATION definitely qualifies.I've seen a crap-ton of WW2 movies and mini-series over the years -- American, Canadian, British, Italian, German, Japanese, and even one Russian one (THE HOT SNOW). I wasn't prepared, however, for either the scope or the sweep of this Soviet-era epic, which chronicles the entire Eastern war from early '43 to the fall of Berlin in mid-'45, as seen both from the very top (Stalin, Zhukov, et al) to the very bottom (junior infantry officers, enlisted tank crewmen, a female medic, fighter pilots, etc.). Forget everything you think you know about ""big budget"" war films; even THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR look a bit sickly when compared with this historical epic, which features not only a cast of thousands, but enough period military equipment to actually fight a minor war.LIBERATION is divided up into six parts, which cover not only the Soviet point of view but also the German, and to a lesser extent the American, British, Italian, Polish, and Yugoslavian as well. Though there is not much room for personal moments, a few minor characters in the army and air force round out the parade of important historical figures. The episodes are:The Fire Bulge - This is an utterly awe-inspiring look at the Battle of Kursk, i.e. the greatest tank duel of all time, from inception at German HQ to the burning fields of Prokarovka, where it came to a climax. The combat sequences are incredible, featuring brilliant cinematography and using hundreds of real tanks. There is a single take which goes on for some minutes featuring savage point-blank battles that resolve into vicious hand to hand fighting, occurring against a backdrop of tracer fire and explosions, that the viewer will never forget. But equally interesting is the high-level strategizing on the German and Russian sides.Breakthrough - Another staggering episode shows the heavy price the Soviets had to pay to push the Germans back to the Dnepr River in late '43, and some of the ruthless tactics they employed, including diversionary attacks which condemned whole units to annihilation. This story also covers the progression of the war in other theaters and the rise of guerrilla movements.Direction of the Main Blow Parts I & II -- An episode steeped in intrigue, this one takes place in the summer of '44. Stalin wants to drive the Germans from Soviet soil once and for all, but there is a great deal of argument among the Russians on how to do it, and among the Germans on how to stop it. Meanwhile, the plot of the generals against Hitler is hatched.The Battle for Berlin -- A slightly deceptive title, this is actually about the Soviet push in late '44 - early '45, which brought the Red Army to the gates of Hitler's capital; also about Hitler's decline from a self-confident warlord to a jittery, paranoid, delusional dead man walking. Also about intrigue among the ""frenemies"" -- America, Britain and the USSR.The Last Assault - A lavish episode, featuring a whole army of extras, shows in brutal (and occasionally humorous) detail the vicious fight for Berlin, which lasted only a week but cost the Soviets 300,000 casualties. A great deal of time is spent showing the fight for the Reichstag, and some of the street-fighting sequences are as spectacular as they are vicious.LIBERATION was directed by Yuri Ozerov, and it must have sorely tested his skills as an organizer, because the scale of this series is massive. In ""The Fire Bulge"" we see battles waged with entire battalions of real tanks. In ""Breakthrough"" a massive-scale river crossing (under fire) is shot, as is the deployment of what looks to be a whole army of Germans in full regalia with Tigerpanzers and heavy guns. And in ""The Last Battle"" what seems like the entire Red Army brawls with the last, most fanatical remnants of the German in the cathedral-like Reichstag. Aside from big battle sequences, however, there are some really good depictions of Churchill -- quite rightly shown as a cold-blooded imperialist with a hidden agenda; Mussolini (when he is deposed in '43 by his own army, he snaps, ""This is the only successful operation of the General Staff!""), and Roosevelt (shown as an idealistic dreamer), as well as interesting depictions of guerrilla warfare against the Germans, and various strategy sessions and political intrigues. The acting is quite good, and I was particularly impressed by the performances of Mikhail Ulyanov as Marshal Zhukov, Horst Geise as Joseph Goebbels, Peter Sturm as Walther Model, and Nikolay Olyalin as the tough Russian soldier Tsvetaev. Writers Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov could have chosen to depict all Soviets as heroic archetypes and all Germans as Nazi sadist-murderers, but in the end they chose to be pretty fair in their depictions, and the series benefits as a result.The reason I gave LIBERATION four rather than five stars is due to a certain amount of historical whitewash. All nations fib and distort history to make themselves look better, and the actual amount of outright lying in this film is very small -- perhaps even less than in an American war film. For example, the subject of the Russian National Liberation Army, a nationalist army organized by the Germans from Soviet POWs and defectors to fight communism, is tackled with surprising honesty -- I wouldn't have blamed the Sovs for omitting this embarrassing story completely. However, the depiction of Stalin (Bukhuti Zaqariadze) is oddly wise and all-knowing (odd because the cult of Stalin had long since been debunked when this series was shot), the portrayal of Hitler (though ably performed by East German actor Franz Deiz) is cliched and somewhat ""slanderous"" (the bunker sequences are flat-out wishful thinking on the Soviet's part), and there is a scene with Zhukov, where he orders his army to make use of searchlights to blind the German defenders, that is not only inaccurate but actually a flat-out inversion of history (Ozerov depicts the Germans as completely flabbergasted by this technique, running around with their hands over their eyes and fleeing in terror; in fact this tactic failed miserably, and merely provided the German gunners with big, sparkly targets.) Most egregiously, there is no mention whatever of Soviet atrocities in Germany. The Reds behave like Merry Men in a ""Robin Hood"" film when they reach the Fatherland, flirting with willing German girls and sparing the lives of wretched German boy soldiers. In fact, the Soviets behaved more like Mongols, slaughtering and raping on a scale that is difficult for an American to even conceive, and while I understand they wouldn't want to linger on this subject, it deserved at least a passing mention. Finally, on a technical note, though the English-speaking and German-speaking sequences are filmed in their own language, they are translated by a narrator who is overdubbed in Russian -- so we get two languages going at once while subtitles play out below. And the translations from Russian into English leave a great deal to be desired.Having said that, I can't recommend this series highly enough. Americans and Brits love WW2 movies because they depict us in a heroic, world-saving light, while seldom or never mentioning the fact that the center of gravity in the European war was in Russia and not in the West. In fact, of Hitler's 200 divisions, 150 were deployed in Russia, along with 2/3 of his air force, and while there is little or nothing to choose morally between the Nazis and the Soviets of the same era, there is no denying that Hitler's dream of European mastery was choked by Soviet blood: 27 million Soviet citizens died between 1941 and 1945, and they inflicted 75% of the casualties suffered by the German Wehrmacht during WW2. LIBERATION, while not pretending the USSR won the war alone, gives a much-needed ""Eastern"" perspective on the world's most destructive war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJOL4U851EUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTJI2U6#wasThisHelpful","R1EJOL4U851EUV","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's logical to expect that a bad idea will produce a bad story, and a good idea a good one. Nothing is more frustrating, however, when a good idea is badly executed. This was only rarely the case with THE SHADOW, but it sadly applies to ""The Comic Strip Killer,"" a fine and innovative idea on a vain quest for proper execution.The story begins with a rash of inexplicable, fatal poisonings throughout the city. Chief Weston is, as usual, baffled in the face of the crime wave -- he can't even figure out how the poison is being delivered to the victims -- but Lamont Cranston has a crazy idea. A popular cartoonist has recently created a character named Hypo, who offs his victims by using a special hypodermic needle that doesn't even break the skin. Is the killer a simple copycat, or could it be the cartoonist himself? It's up to the Shadow to discover before Hypo strikes again.The idea for this episode is fiendishly clever. The idea of a murderer imitating a psychopathic cartoon character is a great one, and the story opens strongly. Also, the identity of the killer is well-disguised through until the very end through red herrings and misdirection. Unfortunately, the episode bogs down at the exact point it ought to speed up, with the investigation becoming talky and tedious rather than exciting, and by the time it gets out of neutral and into drive once more, the interest of the listener is elsewhere. This script definitely needed, and never got, a second draft.""The Comic Strip Killer"" was originally broadcast on November 23, 1947 and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOP6GU4E0X29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N3AODM#wasThisHelpful","RDOP6GU4E0X29","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think everyone would agree that THE SHADOW was a dark and often brutal show, one which showed the full range of human villainy and didn't shy away from Old Testament-style punishments for its bad guys. In its 220+ surviving episodes, evildoers were stabbed, shot, strangled, beaten to death, ripped apart by dogs and wolves, crushed by gorillas and robots, plunged into baths of acid, irradiated, gassed, flung from aircraft or into volcanoes, blown to pieces, drowned, poisoned, bitten by venomous spiders, and dispatched by death rays. Sometimes they survived, only to be scheduled for electrocution or hanging. A small number simply did prison time, but none escaped scot-free. Once a year, however, the show put down its Old Testament lightning bolt and dispensed hefty doses of sentimental Christmas schmaltz: Hence, ""The Stockings Were Hung.""The story opens with Lamont and Margo going to tip a paperboy on Christmas Eve. When they can't find him, they do a little investigating and discover that his father, Mr. Grover, has been forced out of his job by his crooked business partner Mr. Jordan, and that the whole Grover family is now destitute. Unable to prove that Jordan is guilty of a crime, Lamont must devise a strategy which will save Christmas for the Grovers, and he hasn't much time -- in a few hours it will be Christmas day.There are only two surviving Christmas episodes of THE SHADOW, and this is definitely the superior of the two (""Joey's Christmas Story"" is just awful). That is not to say that it is actually good, of course. The gushing sentimentality of the 30s - 40s, all sap and saccharine, is a bit difficult to swallow, especially from a show where happy endings often consisted of innocent people merely being avenged rather than saved. Essentially this is THE SHADOW's take on A CHRISTMAS CAROL, with the Grovers as the Cratchit family, Jordan as Scrooge, and The Shadow as the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, but the tale was better told by Dickens, and the heavy-handed moralizing about the self-defeating nature of individual greed ignores many of the built-in social problems caused by a greed-based economic system.""The Stockings Were Hung"" was originally broadcast on December 24, 1939 as stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow and Grace Matthews as Margo Lane.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RPV0PY7Y1N5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MRA434#wasThisHelpful","R1RPV0PY7Y1N5P","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vampire. Knight. Pilot. Wizard. Sith Lord. Dad. Assassin. Inquisitor. Soldier. Heavy metal musician. Is there anyone Christopher Lee hasn't been been, either on screen or in real life? Let me answer my own question: no. There isn't. This is a guy who is descended from Charlemagne through his mother and Robert E. Lee through his father, and is a cousin by marriage to Ian Fleming. That alone would qualify him for my interest, and he had all that at birth. It's the 90 years that have followed which make things REALLY interesting,LORD OF MISRULE is the autobiography of one of the most prolific and accomplished actors of the last century, Sir Christopher Frank Carimandi Lee. Lee, of course, is best known as the man who played Dracula in about 17 Hammer horror films during the 50s, 60s and 70s, often pairing up with the legendary Peter Cushing in the process; as the formidable Bond villain Scaramanga in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, the evil wizard Saruman in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, and as Count Dooku in the STAR WARS prequels. In other words, every generation from the end of WW2 has known what it means when this enormously tall, basso-voiced guy with the terrifying smile enters the room: something bad is about to happen. The book, however, is about considerably more than Lee's long film career. It covers his entire life, and brother, what a life it's been.Lee was born in 1922, during the ""interwar period,"" but his childhood was really an echo of the Edwardian age: he grew up in a privileged environment and attended a classically English boarding school. Indeed, if not for the fact that his mother, a Countess by marriage, hadn't had very poor taste in husbands he might have led a much interesting life. As it was, the outbreak of WW2 found him a clerk working in London. He joined the RAF but was disqualified from flying just after he became a pilot due to an issue with his vision, so he ""fell"" into intelligence work, which carried him from North Africa through Sicily and into Italy and finally, Austria. After the war he entered acting and struggled on the fringes for years before landing a role as Frankenstein's monster in a Hammer horror film, the move which was to define him as one of celluloid's most intimidating baddies. In the decades that followed he appeared in nearly 300 movies, worked with most of the major actors and directors who came along -- it's a damned Who's Who of Hollywood -- and set a record, which he still holds, for having participated in the most swordfights cinema history. His celebrity gave him a chance to indulge in other passions, such as travel, music, fencing and golf with some of the greats of that sport, and just when it appeared that age would render him irrelevant, he enjoyed a massive career renaissance by landing, in short order, important roles in the films of Tim Burton, Peter Jackson and George Lucas. All in all a life of breath-taking scope, and Lee relates it very well, often utilizing a wry and extremely English sense of humor, even when conveying the darkest parts of his life: near-starvation as an unknown actor, near death in WW2, near tragedy when his daughter was born with a serious ailment. I've read a lot of autobiographies and memoirs in my life, but Lee's shows us a little more than names, places, dates and anecdotes: it gives us (I think) a real look at the man behind the fangs, and while he may be a little intimidating and imperious, he also strikes me as a good human being. Assuming, of course, that Lee really IS human...which I tend to doubt.Now, I didnt say the book is perfect and it isnt. Lee has many interests and not all of them will thrill the reader. If youre not interested in golf, Lees obsession with the sport will tend to bore you. Likewise, anyone who has lived as long as Lee is going to have to be very selective about what he puts in a book versus what he leaves out, and if there is a major sin in these pages it is definitely one of omission. For example, while he speaks extensively about his military service during WW2, he almost entirely avoids discussion of his service in the SAS and the SOE, which is sort of like being an astronaut and leaving out the fact you actually went into space! Likewise, he barely mentions is friendships with such people as Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, except in retrospect. Chapters involving his role in the Star Wars prequels are similarly scanty. This is a guy that did so much fascinating stuff that even to touch lightly on all of it would have filled a volume twice as long, but despite the book's length I often found myself wishing he'd been more rather than less verbose. He is a walking testament to what can be done when a human lives life to his fullest potential.At the time of this writing Lee is 92 years old, and still acting. Doubtlessly he will have to retire sometime, and I don't suppose he will live very much longer regardless...but I'd bet that Death is more afraid of meeting Christopher Lee than the other way around. After all, this is the guy that famously said:  ""I've seen many men die right in front of me - so many in fact that I've become almost hardened to it. Having seen the worst that human beings can do to each other, the results of torture, mutilation and seeing someone blown to pieces by a bomb, you develop a kind of shell.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI42LSGJP947D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752859331#wasThisHelpful","RI42LSGJP947D","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The average life expectancy of a combat infantry officer in the U.S. Army during WW2 was ninety days. By that time lieutenants and captains could expect to be W.I.A. (wounded in action) K.I.A. (killed in action) or an N.B.C. (non-battle casualty). In essence, pinning the gold or silver bars to ones' collar was a deferred sentence: you knew you'd be clobbered eventually, the question was merely when and how badly. This grim knowledge hung over George Wilson, the author if IF YOU SURVIVE, from the moment he landed in Normandy in July of 1944, and it followed him until the end of the war. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that Wilson beat the odds just because he lived to tell his tale: this is a man who paid full homage to the grim logic of war.Wilson was a more or less apple-pie American from Michigan who was selected, after completion of basic training, for O.C.S., the so-called ""shake 'n bake"" school which turned enlisted men into second lieutenants after a 90-day course of instruction. He shipped into Normandy after D-Day during the horrific hedgerow fighting that followed, during which the U.S. Army alone, independent of the others, lost 20,838 killed, 94 881 wounded, 10,128 missing (a total of 125 847 casualties) in just three months. Wilson, of course, didn't know how bloody the campaign would prove to be when he arrived, he was simply told by his commanding officer, ""If you survive your first day, I'll promote you."" Some welcome, huh?IF YOU SURVIVE is, despite its grim subject matter, a highly enjoyable and fast-paced book, the journey of an American everyman from a green-as-grass private soldier to a battle-hardened captain who became a past master at infantry tactics.Wilson takes us from the brutal slog through the hedgerows, in which gains were measured in yards per day, to the sudden triumphant steeplechase across France that led to the liberation of Paris, to the green hell that was the Battle of the Huertgen Forest. Having emerged from that slaughterhouse intact, he found himself thrust into the Battle of the Bulge, and finally a long, punishing march eastward to the Rhine and beyond. The fact that he survived all of this -- the man had a positive knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time -- is a medium-sized miracle in and of itself, and Wilson is keenly aware of it. This book is not the work of a braggart or a glory-hound, but a totally ordinary guy thrust into horrific circumstances that showed just now extraordinary he truly was. I was constantly reminded of the fictional Captain Miller in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: a hero who is all the more heroic because he is so totally undistinguished.IF YOU SURVIVE is a narrative written in a plain but entertaining style, and there are numerous images which stand out in my mind: the night in Normandy his position was bombed by the Luftwaffe, his disgusted reaction to the mounds of German corpses he saw rotting in the Falaise Pocket, the time he was almost refused entry to a snobby officer's restaurant in Paris because he was still wearing combat fatigues (no infantrymen welcome!), the massacre of an American battalion he witnessed in the Huertgen when an attack went wrong, the rage he felt when the Germans were allowed to occupy a position unmolested because he couldn't convince headquarters what he was seeing was real. These and a hundred other incidents -- funny, tragic, horrifying, disgusting, thrilling -- come together and give us a picture of an infantry officer's life, a life in which friendships were created in seconds and measured in weeks, where goodbyes to dead comrades were a constant refrain, where sanity was constantly tested and sometimes found wanting, and where hunger, cold, exhaustion, brutality and terror were everyday occurrences. And Wilson, to his credit, doesn't fall into the trap of glamorizing or romanticizing his experiences, even when they are nakedly heroic, as some vets are prone to do when time has dulled their emotional memories. You know that this is a guy who remembers everything perfectly -- stench, discomfort, fear, grief -- and never wants himself or anyone else to have to go through war again.I've read a hell of a lot of war memoirs, and I've certainly read ones that were better written or struck more profound notes of observation or wisdom, but IF YOU SURVIVE nevertheless became an instant favorite of mine. It's simply the unembellished story of one man who managed to do just that....against the heaviest possible odds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYH84FNKY87H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804100039#wasThisHelpful","R2NYH84FNKY87H","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LONA MASON: Turn on the light, Hugh. Put us to the test. Let us see your face.HUGH WINDHAM: All right, I'll do it -- but remember, I warned you. I warned you all...""The Face"" stands out as one of the most sinister and brutal episodes in the canon of THE SHADOW -- and given the show's taste for exploring the dark corners of the human heart, that is saying something. Far from being gratuitous, however, this story stands as a fascinating exploration, not only of the vanity and narcissism of its villain, but of the shallowness implicit in all its characters -- and in all human beings -- for placing so much emphasis on the collection of features we call a face.Hugh Windham was one of the most successful -- and the handsomest -- actors of stage and screen. When a horrible accident disfigured his face, however, he retreated into seclusion. When his former co-star Lona Mason convinces him to reveal himself, however, she isn't prepared for the horror she sees, and neither are Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane. Not long after this incident, the landlady who first saw his horrid new visage, and screamed in revulsion, is found strangled with her own face beaten beyond recognition. This is the beginning of a series of grisly ritual murders, at first seemingly unconnected; only The Shadow comes to suspect that all the victims have one thing in common: each is a woman who saw the new and terrible new face of Hugh Windham. And if that is the connection, then Margo may be the next to turn up in the morgue...As I said before, this is a very dark episode, in which the villain has a motive which, though twisted and springing from a perversion of his own enormous vanity, is entirely understandable. Worshiped for his looks, he is now reviled for them; driven into isolation by his shame, he is coaxed out into the public eye by well-meaning people only to be regarded with disgust and horror. His quest for vengeance is single-minded and cruel -- the killing of the nurse is extremely ""graphic"" -- but one can't but feel as if he's right when he screams ""I gave you a chance, and you failed, failed miserably!"" As for his final confrontation with the Shadow, it is at once macabre in the extreme and strangely pathetic. This is one serial killer who is less a monster than a reflection of the ugliness of a society that places so much emphasis on looks and so little on talent or character. Unfortunately I don't know the name of the actor who played Windham, but he certainly deserves honorable mention for a blistering vocal performance.""The Face"" was originally broadcast on September 21, 1947 and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow and Grace Matthews as Margo Lane.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LO9VA7W8JVLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N3AOCS#wasThisHelpful","R2LO9VA7W8JVLL","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INFESTISSUMAM is one of those albums that gets better with time. This is a good thing, because my initial reaction to it was a bit underwhelming. I felt as if it were missing some ineffable quality possessed by its predecessor, OPUS EPONYMOUS, something I couldn't quite name but could definitely hear. It turns out that what I was hearing wasn't disappointing, it was merely different. I guess in our secret musical hearts we always want bands to make the same sort of music over and over again and never branch out; but I'm glad Ghost did, because like a slow-acting poison, this album packs quite a wallop if you give it a chance.The show starts with the title track, a slam-banger right out of the soundtrack one of the OMEN films. This transitions into ""Per Aspera Ad Inferi,"" which reunites the audience with the surprisingly non-metal sounding voice of lead singer Papa Emeritus, coupled with a militaristic beat that summons images of zombies marching along to Satanic drummers. After that we get ""Jogolo Har Meggido,"" a mildly catchy song that shows some very interesting guitar and keyboard work. Next up is the intended showpiece of the album, ""Secular Haze,"" which on the Deluxe version comes in two versions, the second with a video. This song took me quite a long time to appreciate: at first I was off-put by its weird, carnival-like melody and out-of-the-box lyrics, but I have to admit it grew on me with time (although I still feel as if it's a bit out of character for Ghost). Likewise ""Guleh (Zombie Queen)"" which starts very slowly and rather drearily, with some disgusting lyrics, before putting the pedal to the metal and turning abruptly into a rocker.By this time, during my initial hearing of the album, I was kind of confused and disappointed. The production felt a little flat and the songs were all over their place in tone, as opposed to the extremely hand-in-glove approach used in the previous album, where every track felt like a chapter one great book. Then, suddenly, I fell into the fiery, foot-stomping ""Year Zero,"" a Satanic anthem that pretty much epitomizes everything that Ghost stands for and does well: beautiful vocals full of diabolical lyrics, driving drum beats, and rousing guitar work. The next four tracks (""Body and Blood"", ""Monstrance Clock"", ""Depths of Satan's Eyes"" and ""Idolatrine"") are much more in the vein of OPUS EPONYMOUS, which came as a great relief. ""La Mantra Mori"" is pretty much just filler, but evidently it was just a breath-pause before the next-best song on the album,  the decidedly Megadeth-esque ""Marionette."" This song, with its brilliantly bitter lyrics and reeling refrains (so unlike the detached, coolly observational tracks on OPUS EPONYMOUS) is perhaps not quite in-character for Ghost, but it's so emotionally authentic and resonant-- the lamentations of a court jester, laughed at and despised by all, powerless over his own fate -- that it deserves special mention. As I said before, the band places a lot of emphasis on ""Secular Haze"" and in fact closes the album with a second version (8 seconds difference) which includes a video which will play on your mobile device as you listen.Ghost is definitely one of the most unique bands I've ever heard. They have taken quite a beating in metal circles recently because they are not genuine Satanists and so are viewed by some as poseurs and exploiters, but personally I couldn't care less whether they are Satanists, Christians, atheists or freaking Jewish Nazis. Some of the best novels on war were written by men who never came within 1000 miles of a battlefield, and I'm pretty sure Tolkien never met a Hobbit. What matters to me is the end product and not the resume. Papa Emeritus and the Nameless Ghouls make darkly beautiful, highly evocative music which takes its share of musical risks and combines lavish atmosphere with extremely clever lyrics; not to mention that P.E.'s vocals are light-years away from the tuneless screaming which is the signature of this genre. INFESTISSUMAM isn't as neatly composed as OPUS EPONYMOUS, it takes more risks and therefore makes more missteps, but it's got guts, and as Sgt. Hartman says in FULL METAL JACKET, ""Guts is enough.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXGCMPPAHV41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CB4FHNI#wasThisHelpful","RUXGCMPPAHV41","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Wailing Corpse"" is a strange but enjoyable episode of THE SHADOW that blends the more prosaic motives of greed and revenge with spiritualism and macabre intrigue.When Ellsworth Van Dyke asks an undertaker for a coffin, it's business as usual at the funeral home, until the rich old gent specifies that that the coffin must be twice the normal size and made of glass. Then things get really weird. When Van Dyke is asked who the coffin is for, he answers simply, ""Myself."" Van Dyke promptly dies and is buried in his telephone-equipped casket. The funeral director takes this bizarre news to Lamont Cranston, whose love of all that is odd is well known and ties in neatly with his secret life as The Shadow. But as the invisible avenger begins his investigation, he soon discovers that Ellsworth's bizarre request was hardly the weirdest thing about the Van Dyke clan. The house is full of scheming relations with motives for wanting the old man dead, a daughter who may or may not be insane...and a pesky voice that may or may not be Van Dyke himself, communicating from the beyond.As I stated before, this episode has a lot of intrigue which is spiced by a possibly supernatural element -- the ghost (or is it?) of Ellsworth Van Dyke. The show's half-hour format -- less when you factor commercials -- is a tough one when you want to develop a complex storyline with multiple suspects -- in this case no less than four! -- but THE SHADOW's writers were usually up to the task, and they more than earned there paychecks here.""The Wailing Corpse"" was originally broadcast on November 8, 1942 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTSQZ0PAIOY9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MV8X8S#wasThisHelpful","RTSQZ0PAIOY9C","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Death Stalks The Shadow"" pits the invisible detective not against a psychopath, foreign saboteur, or mad scientist, but an even lower form of criminal...the crooked lawyer. THE SHADOW wasn't awfully shy in depicting that breed of lawyer known as the shyster, the mob mouthpiece or the Cop-Out Louie, but in this episode we examine an even baser aspect of legal criminality: the lawyer as head of a gang.The story begins with crooked lawyer Peter Murdoch visiting one of his clients on death row. Dan Malley is about to be executed for a murder he committed on Murdoch's orders, but Murdoch isn't shedding any tears for the man he threw to the prosecutorial wolves. After all, dead men tell no tales. Unfortunately for Murdoch, while the governor declines to pardon Malley, The Shadow hears his last testament as to Murdoch's guilt and decides to take the shyster down. But Murdoch is no dummy: knowing the invisible vigilante is after him, he devises a fiendish trap using the latest technology: a death chamber triggered by a photo-electric beam. Facing a situation where his hypnotic powers are useless, The Shadow will have to dig deep simply to survive the night, much less take down Peter Murdoch.This episode has many of the qualities which endeared me to THE SHADOW. There's plenty of crackly gangster dialogue, an absolutely vicious criminal who is a worthy match for Cranston, and a diabolical concept centered around technology which in 1938 was practically science-fiction, the photo-electric beam.This last bit is not only unintentionally funny to modern listeners, but gives a wonderful snapshot of the world of that time, which was teetering on the edge of a technological revolution. The earliest seasons of THE SHADOW suffered somewhat from the omnipotence of the character, but soon after Bill Johnstone took over the role, the writers increased the cunning of The Shadow's enemies and as a result, tended to produce better drama and suspense. This episode is a fine example of that evolution.""Death Stalks The Shadow"" was originally broadcast October 9, 1938 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW44PJIG5J7ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ54FI#wasThisHelpful","RW44PJIG5J7ZE","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Creeper"" is one weird episode of THE SHADOW, but its weirdness doesn't detract, and in fact adds to, the twisted appeal of the story. Macabre is a term rarely used nowadays, but I think it applies to this tale where murder is only a side-effect of one man's twisted obsession.The story opens with a rash of mysterious disappearances in the exclusive Mayfair District. Private security guards and sophisticated burglary alarms are of no use: people are simply vanishing out of their homes with no evidence of foul play. When Margo's dear friend Edith Day joins the list of the missing, however, she begs for Lamont Cranston to get involved, and get involved he does, using forgotten blueprints from the end of the 19th century to discover a hidden tunnel system running through the district. This discovery, however, only tells him HOW the unfortunates may have been whisked away, not why, or who is doing it. That answer lies within the tunnels, where a mysterious lunatic who calls himself The Creeper keeps his lair...as well as his victims, which, much to The Shadow's horror, may now include Margo Lane.""The Creeper"" is a classic showdown between The Shadow and a crazed but diabolically clever nemesis. It wasn't unusual, even in a show as morally heavy-handed as this one, to make the bad guy as pathetic as he was evil, and Everett Sloane, a staple of the early years of THE SHADOW, delivers one of his trademark ""sad monster"" performances. Orson Welles is also near the top of his considerable game here, trying to deal with a nut whose motive isn't money or revenge but simply...well, to find out you'll just have to meet The Creeper yourself.In closing, I'd like to note that the title ""The Creeper"" was used for two different episodes of THE SHADOW. This one is not to be confused with the story of the same name, with a completely different plot, broadcast in 1940 during the Bill Johnstone era. ,""The Creeper"" was originally broadcast on May 29, 1938 and stars Orson Welles as The Shadow and Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane..","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VL9CYG0XIW5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ539U#wasThisHelpful","R2VL9CYG0XIW5Z","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An unusual idea inside a fairly typical storyline, ""Scent of Death"" is a strong and brutal episode that once again showcases how versatile the writers of THE SHADOW were. Having only a half-hour (minus commercials) to work with, they managed to pack this one with enough violence, double-dealing, and snappy-gangster dialogue for a Humphrey Bogart movie.The story opens with a man giving his wife a bottle of perfume as an anniversary gift. One inhalation of what's inside, however, and the lady drops dead, prompting the grief-stricken husband to look up the underworld's least favorite amateur detective, Lamont Cranston. But the occasionally invisible detective is immediately stumped by one stark fact: there was nothing IN the bottle at all. No perfume, and, evidently, no poison either. His investigation soon turns up a counterfeit perfume racket whose members include a befuddled, former Prohibition-era chemist and a trigger-happy gunsel named Jackie. But who's running this murderous show, and how did knockoff perfume end up taking lives? The Shadow will have to move fast, because the bodies are piling up even faster.""Scent of Death"" is one of those SHADOW episodes that downplays the invisible-detective angle in favor of classic gangster themes: extortion, double crosses, brutal murders, and most importantly, absolutely crackling dialogue right out of THE MALTESE FALCON. The homicidal and sadistic wise-cracker Jackie is as nasty a piece of work as you'll encounter, his gun-moll is even better, and The Shadow has his hands full just trying to negotiate through the corpses, much less solve the mystery. The writers of this show loved to point out that there was no honor among thieves, and these thieves work very hard to show their creators right.""Scent of Death"" was originally broadcast on February 2, 1947 and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1G0QOI9LQK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N3AOBE#wasThisHelpful","R3V1G0QOI9LQK0","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SHERSTON'S PROGRESS is one of those books that makes me wish the rating process on Amazon had a little more flexibility: it's somewhat better than the three-star rating I gave it but not quite good enough to merit four. The final act of the ""Sherston Trilogy"" which began with MEMOIRS OF A FOX-HUNTING MAN and continued with MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OFFICER, it is a book of an entirely different mettle -- as terse as the other books were loquacious, and as humorous and rich in self-depreciation as they were in callowness and self-involvement.The Sherston Trilogy are semi-autobiographical novels by Siegfried Sassoon, the English poet and war hero who famously threw his Military Cross into the river Mersey and wrote an eloquent denunciation of British war policy while WW1 was still raging. The first book dealt with ""George Sherston's"" formative years in late Victorian/early Edwardian England: a sedately beautiful portrait of a bygone era of horse races, trophy cups, claret, flannel bags, pipe smoke, riding boots, boarding schools and snobbery, snobbery, snobbery, which was abruptly and brutally ended by the First World War. The second explored the painful growing-up Sherston experienced as an infantry officer at the front, which saw his boundless thirst for glory evaporate into a sullen resentment at those who he felt were prolonging the war for purely imperialist ends; a resentment which led him to being locked up in a mental institution to spare the government embarrassment. SHERSTON'S PROGRESS picks up where this book left off, with Sherston leaving the institution having resolved to see the war through, despite maintaining it had outlived its original aims. It is a novel which reflects the deep and profound changes that occur when one lives not only through a brutal and stupidly-fought war, but through the end of a great era.As I mentioned, PROGRESS is much shorter than its predecessors, taking place over a single year which begins with his admission to Slateford War Hospital for ""war neurosis"" in 1917. There Sherston meets the man who will guide and shape the rest of his life: W.H. Rivers, the famous neurologist/psychologist/anthropologist whose job was to get Sherston to abandon his antiwar stance and return to the front. Once Sherston agrees, however, he finds himself not back in France but in mutinous Ireland, engaged in sophomoric shenanigans with other former patients of Rivers' which harken back to the more innocent first novel. The shadow of the war is long, however, and following a colorful and beautifully-written sojourn to Palestine, Sherston ends up in heavy combat once more in his old Gaullic stomping-grounds, is wounded once more under the most ironic circumstances imaginable, and returns to England, a man who has perhaps finally come to terms with everything in his life, including, it seems, the fact that the England he fought to preserve is now as dead as many of his former comrades in arms.I definitely enjoyed SHERSTON'S PROGRESS -- especially the Palestinian passages, which feature some of his finest descriptive prose -- but I did think the novel, like the others, suffered from Sassoon's overly powerful sense of self-control. He writes everything, from battle to travelogue, in the same sedate, measured style, with the result that the entire novel never leaves its initial gear. Though it is as occasionally evocative as FOX-HUNTING MAN, which was an amazing if slow-paced reconstruction of Edwardian England at the height of its lovely, decadent silliness, it is also a description of a world which is palpably less attractive: a world of mental hospitals, backwater garrisons full of recuperating men, crowded troop ships, snobbish staff officers and muddy trenches. War is of course an interesting subject in and of itself, but oddly enough, it is perhaps not the best subject for Sassoon, because of his oddly cool-blooded perspective of the world. We read about his anger at the waste, stupidity and insanity of his surroundings, yet there is no sense of passion in these paragraphs. Sherston's anger is intellectual, not emotional, and I began to wonder in this third volume if perhaps he hadn't gone to war to experience that emotion for himself after an incredibly shallow youth centered around nothing but horse races and fox hunts. The English, particularly in Sassoon's day, were notorious for their stiff upper lips and calm demeanor in the face of adversity, but as George Orwell once pointed out, a mask can twist the face that wears it, and it may be that the mask of haughty indolence worn by the young man could not be removed. A reviewer of this novel claimed that it was nothing more than an Englishman trying to rise above his own Englishness -- and failing -- and that seems rather accurate.It's interesting to note that just a year after the war began, Sassoon -- not Sherston but the actual Sassoon -- famously wrote, ""I want a genuine taste of the horrors, and then  peace. I dont want to go back to the old inane life which always seemed like a prison. I want freedom, not comfort. I have seen beauty in life, in men and things ... The last fifteen months have unsealed my eyes. I have lived well and truly since the war began; now I ask that the price be required of me."" In MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OFFICER he paid that price and then some, but I'm not sure that he sentiment about not wanting to go back was true. I think both Siegfried Sassoon and his alter-ago George Sherston were fighting for just that -- for ""Atlas buses, of the hansom cab, of sulphurous fogs, of the lazy country-house life, of the long, lovely decade of the Edwardian age"" Indeed, a better epitaph for his experiences might be summed up in his own comment from MEMOIRS OF A FOX-HUNTING MAN: ""I wanted the past to survive and begin again.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAB922VA4IFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107178#wasThisHelpful","R2BAB922VA4IFJ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the interesting things about radio is that there are some stories which couldn't be told in any other medium. ""Death Shows The Way"" is arguably such a story, but that doesn't detract, and in fact probably adds to, the luster of this amusing and brutal tale of deception, thievery and murder.Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane are spending the weekend at their good and very wealthy friends the Bartons; present as well is the equally rich Count Santo, whom they met while traveling in the Mediterranean. Henry Barton has just purchased the Great Harvey Diamond, which has a reputation of bringing misfortune on its owner, but he is unperturbed when a representative of Taylor & Co. shows up to deliver the priceless stone. His mood of insouciance doesn't last long: before you can say ""Is the curse on this necklace real?"", the representative is dead and the annoying adopted son of the Bartons, Skippy, has been kidnapped. Cranston doesn't believe in curses, however, and donning the Shadow's cloak begins an investigation which shows him the way to truth...but only by way of death.This episode is a great deal of fun from its humorous beginning, which shows Cranston losing a round to his implacable butlerAlan, to its decidedly brutal ending, which involves a criminal who should have been nicer to the Barton's Great Dane when he had the chance.There are not one but two, maybe even three, major plot twists I can't even hint about, and some delightfully sarcastic dialogue involving Cranston and the Barton's obnoxious child Skippy. All the SHADOW episodes that dealt with priceless jewels or objects -- ""Death and the Crown of Odalph,"" ""The Giant of Madras,"" ""The Ruby of Karvahl,"" ""Collectors of Death"" etc. -- were excellent, and this one is no exception.""Death Shows The Way"" was originally broadcast on December 3, 1939 and features Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R380FQTUL7WYWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MRA42A#wasThisHelpful","R380FQTUL7WYWX","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Bride of Death"" is an excellent episode from the Orson Welles era of THE SHADOW. It is also one of the more brutally told stories in the whole canon, and exposes the rather tired lie that entertainment back in the 1930s was less violent than it is today. This is one bloody half-hour.""Bride"" is the story of a cult leader who calls himself ""The Prophet of the Ancient One"" who has ensconced himself in a small seaside town in New England, using the money of one of his rich followers to support his nefarious doings. The mysterious Prophet, who hails from ""some Asiatic sinkhole of the godless"", travels with several vicious bodyguards and even a pack of trained panthers and has the entire village living in fear. However, when the local reverend's daughter falls under his sway, the reverend speaks out against the Prophet in church - whereupon the whole place goes up in one huge explosion, killing the entire congregation. This massacre draws the do-gooding pair of Lamont Crantson (Orson Welles) and Margo Lane (Agnes Moorehead) to the town; but when the Prophet learns they are investigating him, he kidnaps Margo, and it's up to The Shadow to save her and foil the Prophet before she becomes the latest sacrifice to the mysterious god known as ""The Ancient One.""Orson Welles' tenure as The Shadow was very much a hit-or-miss affair. Many of the storylines he was given were superb and even brilliant pieces of entertainment, while others were boring and silly. This one is firmly the former category. Although the plot is straightforward and there is no real mystery element (except for the true motives of the Prophet), it is a very well-written and well-acted episode, with lots of atmosphere and some great dialogue (""I stood fifty year afore the mast,"" one old salt tells Cranston. ""And I ain't afeared of man, devil or the sea."") But even for a show as violent as THE SHADOW, this one stands out as unusually brutal. Just goes to show you that, blow up churches or unleash panthers as you will, when Mr. S is around...crime don't pay.""Bride of Death"" was originally broadcast on March 6, 1938.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q2DJCSR7B0VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MKZ5QW#wasThisHelpful","R1Q2DJCSR7B0VL","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DETECTIVE MONTALBANO is like pasta. No matter how much you eat, you always want more. Luckily, this TV show is not only delicious...it's good for you, offering nutrition not only for the mind and the wit, but for the eyes and the soul.For those unfamiliar with this superb mystery-comedy-drama series produced over many years by Rai Television, DETECTIVE MONTALBANO follows the life of Salvo Montalbano (Luca Zingaretti) a wily, quirky, quarrelsome, food-addicted Sicilian cop who is police chief in the small but far from sleepy seaside Sicilian village of Vigata. Backing up Salvo, and quite frequently fighting with him (this is Sicily, after all) are his long-suffering, long-distance girlfriend Livia, sultry and (mostly) platonic friend Ingrid, hot-tempered and perpetually amorous second-in-command/best friend Mimi Augello, bumbling but loveable aide Catarella, gentlemanly sleuth Fazio, trigger-happy Galuzzo, indolent CSI tech Jacomuzzi, and of course the irritable pathologist Dr. Pasquale. Together they are half-family, half-colleague, and all entertaining. This DVD set includes three episodes: ""The Mystery of the Terracotta Dog"", ""The Artist's Touch"" and ""A Trip to Tindari.""MYSTERY - Montalbano has his hands full, and then some, juggling a Mafia don who wants to defect and a 50 year-old double murder committed during the final days of Italy's involvement in WW2.  But while digging up the past is touchy stuff, playing the Mafia is dangerous business, and a mistake by Mimi Augello turn Montalbano from hunter into hunted, with tragic consequences.ARTIST - A wealthy but crippled goldsmith commits an almost ritualistic suicide in his wheelchair, but when his will is determined to be a forgery, his estranged brother becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Montalbano's investigation unearths a love triangle, an old family quarrel, and an elaborate plot centering on that oldest of Sicilian motivations: revenge.TINDARI - A notorious womanizer is shot dead on his own doorstep. An elderly couple disappears on an excursion to the resort town of Tindari. Is there a connection between these two seemingly unrelated incidents? Before you can say ""mingia!"" Montalbano is dealing with an aging Mafia boss speaking in riddles, a young Mafia hood on the run from the law, and a lot of home-made pornography which may be the clue to solving it all.I hesitated whether to give this package 4 or 5 stars because I didn't feel ""The Artist's Touch"" was quite in the league with the other two. However, ""Terracotta"" is so damned good it is almost painful -- a mingling of Sicilian history with a Romeo & Juliet style love story, slippery Mafia intrigue, and some brutally violent action. As for ""Tindari"", it is the most nakedly sexual and at the same time, most diabolical of all the MONTALBANO storylines, showing both the grisly depths of barbarism to which the Mafia sinks as well as one of the funniest sequences in the history of the show, when Montalbano tries to kick down a door that proves to be somewhat tougher than he is. As always, the episodes spend much time exploring Montalbano's complex sense of honor as well as his relationships with such people as Mimi and Ingrid, but the best thing about MONTALBANO is not the plotting -- which can at times be convoluted and sluggish by American standards -- but the superb writing (adapted for TV from the novels of Andrea Camilleri), the wonderful chemistry between the actors, and the exploration of Sicilian life and culture -- a life of food, family, argument, corruption, humor, violence, sensuality and intrigue. That, and Luca Zingaretti, who is just a joy to watch, and brings to the screen the same mix of genius, idiosyncratic irascibility and off-kilter sex appeal that Jeremy Brett did to the amazing Granada TV SHERLOCK HOLMES series of the 1980s/90s. Montalbano loves a mystery, but what he really hates is the idea that someone can play him, and as a general rule, it's not wise to try. Though it is fun to see!These episodes (in Italian with English subtitles) are presented in 16:9 anamorphic, and total up at 312 minutes, or about an hour and three quarters each. So sit back, open a bottle of wine, and get ready to feast your brain on some of the finest TV around...from Sicily, with love.Arrivederla!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGWC6ZB4CHP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R9IELI#wasThisHelpful","R3EGWC6ZB4CHP8","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're like me -- poor -- you probably still drive a car that uses audio cassettes. And if you're a fan of old time radio -- like me -- you probably love THE SHADOW, arguably the best and certainly one of the most successful programs to air during the Golden Age of Radio. Of course, THE SHADOW is generally associated with the most famous actors to play the role: Orson Welles, Bill Johnstone and Bret Morrison; the name John Archer doesn't necessarily ring any bells, and that is perhaps understandable. Archer only played the part for one year (1945), and as of this date, only two episodes from his brief run survive. This cassette includes both. They are:""The Destroyer"" - Foster Merrill is a kindly-looking old man, a respectable member of society, and a friendly acquaintance of Lamont Cranston. He's also a lunatic. Merrill gets it in his head that only those who destroy go down in history, and one day embarks on a rampage of arson simply to prove his point. The police are baffled, and so too is Cranston, especially when arson escalates to bombing and mass murder. And just as Cranston narrows the list of suspects to Merrill and two others, Merrill decides that the nosy amateur investigator must die, to clear the way for one final, massive act of destruction.""The Little Man Who Wasn't There"" - A seemingly invisible thief is robbing jewelry and other priceless valuables from city luminaries in broad daylight. Chief Weston suspects The Shadow has turned to crime, and only Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane know otherwise. But how does an invisible detective track down and invisible criminal, especially one who seems to have greater powers than The Shadow himself?Both of these episodes are highly enjoyable, and I would argue that ""The Destroyer"" is about as good as anything THE SHADOW produced in its 17 years on the air. I don't know if John Archer's brief tenure was this good all the way through, but these two episodes provide some evidence in that direction. Archer, who died in 1999, was hardly an actor of the standing of, say, Orson Welles, and he isn't as important to the legacy of THE SHADOW as Morrison or Johnstone, and I always thought his delivery was a little too nasal to be really effective: but he was a competent, effective Shadow who played the role with enthusiasm. If you give him a little of your time, he won't disappoint you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQL2BTF32Y4W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GE3JKC#wasThisHelpful","RQL2BTF32Y4W7","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I don't know if it's art, but I like it."" So says the Jack Nicholson version of the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN. Well, I don't know if OPUS EPONYMOUS is art, either, but I love it. This is one devilish metal album that demonstrates once and for all that this genre of music doesn't have to consist of sweaty mustachioed men in too-tight leather pants screaming unintelligible nonsense into spittle-dripping microphones. It can be melodic, lyrically beautiful, technically precise and grandiose without being gaudy, all the while rocking its freaking brains out -- and yours, too.Other reviewers have gone at length into the history of the band Ghost, so I'm going to approach OPUS EPONYMOUS from the point of view of somebody who just likes good music and doesn't give a damn what genre label has been slapped upon it, or whether or not the guys in the band are really Satanists or just playing the role, or any of that. My only criteria is: does this album rock? And my short answer: HELL yes.Now, when I say it rocks, I don't mean you'll be banging your head off listening to it, or emerging from a mosh pit covered in blood, or left with a desire to start fights or smash things. OPUS isn't quite that type of album. In fact, the bookend songs -- the organ into ""Deus culpa"" and the driving, cosmic-sounding instrumental ""Genesis"" -- don't sound like Metal at all. They are merely demonstrations of Ghost's musical versatility -- not only technically but in terms of style. ""Con clavi con Dio"", the first full track on the album, hits pretty hard with relentless bass, drums and guitar rhythms, but it also showcases singer Papa Emeritus' surprisingly clear and restrained yet passionate vocals, which are not in any way typically ""Metal."" Next up comes ""Ritual,"" which opens softly before shifting to more traditional crunchy guitar chords, over which Emeritus busts out some superb rhymes -- half clever wordplay, half Black Mass, which continue the Hammer horror-film atmosphere established by the opening track.After that is ""Elisabeth,"" my personal favorite on the album, dedicated to history's most prolific and sadistic serial murderer, the Countess Elisabeth Bathory, ""whose acts of cruelty and lust for blood make her one of us."" The song is excellent, but what it really does is put the last nail in the album's coffin: there's no doubt, listening to this oddly romantic and poignant track, that you are in the midst of a musical horror movie. This theme is extended by ""Sand by Him,"" an ode to a witch who hasn't renounced Satan despite being burned at the stake, and by ""Satan Prayer"" (do I really need to explain this one?) and the extremely catchy ""Death Knell.""The album's penultimate track is ""Prime Mover,"" which is almost hypnotic in its sinister, bass-heavy intro, before telling a story which, if it had been a script, would certainly have been made into a film starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. And make no mistake about it: this is a band that is striving -- and succeeding -- at establishing an atmosphere of fog-shrouded, full-moon-'n-the-werewolf-is-hungry-style horror. The album cover, showing the miter-clad Papa presiding over a spooky Dracula-style castle, says it all. These are songs for Halloween...or for people who want to summon up the feeling of Halloween any time they press ""play.""It's not my purpose here to talk about the band itself, or what their actual agenda may be, or even how they are perceived by their fans from an aesthetic standpoint. I don't know if this is art or just superb musical craftsmanship, and I don't really care. I just know that I like it -- and so, I think, will you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22POITI9S5OCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EJUMT2#wasThisHelpful","R22POITI9S5OCQ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every now and again, a pop music album comes along that transcends the temporary nature of the genre, and has a lasting impact on the listener. Eddie Money's CAN'T HOLD BACK is such an album. On an intellectual level I can pick it apart; emotionally it remains irresistible to me - the moreso because the songs for which it is known by the general public are only the tip of its creative iceberg. This is just a very enjoyable album, and more importantly, one that hasn't dated - which is more than I can say about most 80s pop.The album starts with the song that made it famous, ""Take Me Home Tonight"", a bellowing, extremely catchy and sexually charged duet with Ronnie ""The Original Bad Girl of Rock `n Roll"" Spector that dominated the airwaves for what seemed like aeons when I was a teen. It's a terrific song, but those who buy the album on the strength of this duet will be surprised at the depth and enjoyability of what comes after it.It's said that any decent singer can make you feel nostalgic, but only a great singer can make you feel nostalgic for things you haven't done. I don't know if Eddie Money qualifies as great, but on ""I Wanna Go Back"" he made me long for my high school years...when I was 14 years old and still had plenty of them left ahead of me. That's pretty impressive. Likewise, he transcended the obvious message of ""One Love"" with a stucatto delivery and that half-sleepy, half-passionate delivery which made him famous. On ""Endless Nights"" and ""One More Chance"", he elevated what could have been clich-ridden songs about the anguish of failed romances with some clever lyrics and, as before, a delivery that seems so perfectly syncopated with the music that you just have to tip your hat to the album's engineers and mixer Richie Zito.The album's second side (yes, I still refer to it that way, having originally bought it on tape) switches up the gears a bit, opening with the powerful and underrated ""We Should Be Sleeping"", which makes the excellent point that a couple's energy is better spent making love than fighting.After that comes ""Bring on the Rain"", a tune about being a transplanted Easterner in Southern California, which easily could have been released as a single, and which appeals to me greatly...being a transplanted Easterner in Southern California. The song's title track is fairly ordinary, and ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" is so totally 80s - with its somewhat hollow background vocals and coldly mechanical drum-machine beat - that it feels dated. Likewise, ""Calm Before the Storm"" is forgettable and ends the album on a ho-hum note, but by this time it scarcely matters.As I said at the beginning of this review, there are some albums that are more than the sum of their parts. CAN'T HOLD BACK is a gushingly sentimental, occasionally trite pop album that relentlessly beats the pinata that is love in the hopes of producing some lyrical candy. Ordinarily this would annoy me to no end, but thanks to Money's great, somehow distinctly blue-collar delivery, and to some very pleasing harmonies and background vocals, it works. Big time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYKG204TH9VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P6ISXK#wasThisHelpful","RQYKG204TH9VN","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's either amusing or disturbing -- or both -- just how many institutions of today sprang from the scheming brain of Nazi Germany. The Autobahn... modern highways...the Volkswagen...INTERPOL...U.S. military doctrine...the jet engine...the guided missile. Among this cornucopia can be numbered the musical request show. As strange as it may seem today, the idea of ringing up a radio station and asking for a specific song did not originate with radio itself. That medium was around for nearly a generation before a wealthy German told a popular station he'd donate to the cause of their choice if they played a favorite tune of his. Cut to a few years later; WW2 has broken out and the German people are in need of distraction: the Wunschkonzert fr die Wehrmacht is born. This was a popular weekly broadcast which allowed civilians and soldiers to request and dedicate songs to loved ones, military units, or whoever they seemed worthy. It featured appearances by all the greatest stars of the day as well as jobbing amateurs and was enormously popular. So it's little wonder Goebbels decided it could feature as the backdrop and inspiration of its own feature film.WUNSCHKONZERT, in the tradition of other German films of this period such as UBER ALLES IN DER WELT, is actually a number of stories which interweave around a single unifying idea, theme or incident. It begins at the Olympic games in Berlin in 1936, where the lovely Ilse Werner (Inge Wagner) meets and falls in love with Luftwaffe Lieutenant Herbert Koch (Carl Raddatz). After a whirlwind courtship they plan engagement, but he soon receives orders to go to Spain, where the civil war is raging, as a military adviser to the Fascists. The mission is top secret, and thus Koch is forced to abandon his flame without explanation. Eventually she becomes close to another Luftwaffe pilot, Helmut Wilker (Joachim Brennecke), who befriends Koch without realizing they are in love with the same woman. As war breaks out the pilots fly together in combat, neither knowing the other is in love with Ilse. At the same time, there is an extensive sub-plot about a unit of German infantrymen going into battle in France, which involves not only their various loved ones (especially their mothers) but two bumbling soldiers who are sent to Berlin to perform a ditty of their own composition for the Wunschkonzert. As the story goes on, each character's destiny is affected and to some degree decided by their decision to request songs.As the title implies, WUNSCHKONZERT is not so much about the individual characters in the film per se as the way their lives are tied into, and ultimately effected by, the popular request show. The fate of the two star-crossed lovers, Herbert and Ilse, actually turns on the Olympic fanfare he requests of the program; and in another sequence, the fate of a German infantry squad is decided by one soldier's rendition of a Beethoven song on an organ he finds in a burning French church. There are also performances by real-life celebrities of the day, including the Berlin Philharmonic and Marika Rkk, arguably THE pin-up girl/singer of the Nazi era next to Lale Anderson. The film is also strong on the theme of men performing their duties in wartime while their women (moms, wives, sweethearts, sisters) wait anxiously at home, and how the music unites them. If all this seems a bit corny, one must remember that this film was released in 1940, and is not measurably sappier or more contrived than British or American romantic war movies of the same era. In fact, I would unhesitatingly say that WUNSCHKONZERT is one of the best WW2-era movies I've yet seen, featuring a skillful balance of romance, propaganda, music, history, and war-movie action, which give the modern viewer a fascinating, if idealized, view of popular culture in Nazi Germany. The acting is good, there are an unusual number of obstacles for the young lovers to face in their quest to be together, a splash of intrigue with the Spanish Civil War angle, a certain amount of pathos, and some entertaining Laurel & Hardy-style moments involving two bumbling soldiers and a captured pig. Like all movies of this type, it tends to blur its focus on the main element of the story towards the end in favor of a grand, all-inclusive climax, but aside from that I had no major complaints.Believe it or not, though hundreds of feature films were released in Germany during WW2, only twenty or so actually dealt with the war which was taking place at the time, following Goebbels' undoubtedly wise decision that what the people of Germany needed was distraction from the war and not reminders of it. This stands in fascinating contrast to Britain and America, who cranked out war movies nonstop and kept them going long after the war itself had ended. And because of this, WUNSCHKONZERT is just as valuable as historical evidence as it is an entertaining flick in its own right. Like all Americans I grew up on a steady diet of WW2 movies which seldom, if ever, gave even the slightest thought of what the enemy was like -- what he wanted, what he was feeling, why he was fighting, and what was waiting for him when he put away his rifle and went home. WUNSCHKONZERT puts faces and names and hopes and dreams on the dreaded, faceless Nazi soldiers, and it's perhaps no big surprise that these things weren't a helluva lot different for guys named Gotthard, Eberhard and Johannes than they were for the Joes, Mikes and Bobs of the war.  As a German song of the pre-war period refrained: ""All I want is music! I don't need anything else!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2495OTISPE2J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E27NH1G#wasThisHelpful","R2495OTISPE2J6","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I mention the name Ernie Pyle to people today, their usual reaction is ""Who?"" This is unfortunate, and a commentary on the ephemerality of fame, because there was a time when Ernie Pyle was as famous as any of the big-name American reporters you care to name today, and probably more deservedly so. Though he is best remembered (if he's remembered at all!) as a war correspondent, one who ""brought the war home"" to millions of Americans through the almost daily dispatches he sent from North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and later the Pacific, Pyle actually won initial renown as a syndicated travel reporter, and ERNIE'S AMERICA is a best-of collection of his domestic reportage during the Great Depression and the very first days of WW2.The format is quite simple. Ernie simply drove from town to town, state to state (and territory to territory), crisscrossing the whole of the country, filing stories what he saw, who he spoke to, and the strange, funny, interesting and tragic things which happened to him on the way. Nothing and nobody were neglected: he drove through huge cities and ghost towns; he traveled to the wilds of Alaska and the tip of the pre-bridge Florida Keys; he talked to people of all races and all ages, all professions and trades, and all economic levels from the super-rich to the dirt-poor. Once in a while he'd encounter someone genuinely famous -- Booker T. Washington, for example -- but more commonly an unknown person with an absolutely fascinating life-story: a sea captain, a prospector, a prohibitionist, a cowboy, a fur-trapper, a barnstormer, a moonshine-maker, a former slave, and get it out of them. Over the years, and over thousands of columns, he unearthed a million fascinating details and the best of these have been sifted out and placed here for your reading pleasure. Together they form a kind of patchwork quilt image of the America of 80-odd years ago, and make for fascinating, amusing and often touching reading.It's worth noting that Pyle's writing style is very much like he comes off in his reports: apple-pie American, which is to say plain and simple but also honest and enjoyable. He isn't corny or naive or sham-patriotic, and his isn't the most gifted prose-writer who ever picked up a pen, but when he tells a story, you tend to remember it. Indeed, I retained more memories of this book -- more clear and vivid mental imagery -- than I have from many others. Ernest Hemingway, a man known for carrying grudges legitimate and made-up, often referred to himself as ""the Poor Man's Pyle"" -- implying that Pyle was some kind of literary snob. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pyle was not only not a snob, he was exactly the opposite of one. The image left to me after reading this book is of a balding redheaded sunburned Hoosier in a Chevy with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, a crumpled road map on his lap, and a half-eaten hamburger on the front seat. In other words, of a plain old American, jamming down Route 66.Now, it's worth noting that America of 1935 - 1941 was obviously very different than that of today. The Civil War was still a living memory for the very old, Alaska and Hawaii were still territories, Arizona had only been a state for 20-odd years, and some West Coast towns were mere shadows of what they later became. Vast stretches of the country were scarcely inhabited. Drought had turned huge sections of the Middle West into a Dust Bowl, Jim Crow ruled the South, and most of the inventions and conveniences we take for granted today weren't even in the realm of science fiction back then. Yet what struck me was how little the essence of America has changed. Pyle's comments and observations on the politics of Washington, the thickness of government bureaucracy, anxiety over foreign wars, issues of poverty, inequality, immigration, racism and the economy don't seem dated, but rather timely. And on top of this, Pyle manages to convey through his reports something of the immensity and diversity of this huge country -- old mining camps in the Rockies, white shantytowns in the Deep South, trapper's cabins in Alaska, tomato stands in Hawaii, trim little Cape Cods in New England, and the enormous clamor of big cities everywhere. One can't help but feel, having read the book, that one has not only accompanied Ernie on his road trip across America, but actually traveled back in time to an era which is shockingly different and yet hauntingly the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I07AD9BQFXFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394575725#wasThisHelpful","R1I07AD9BQFXFL","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In George Orwell's superb but conveniently half-forgotten essay on Salvador Dali, he made the extremely unusual case that it was possible to produce great art which should should nevertheless be suppressed as an outrage against morality. Orwell posed the question using this comparison: ""The first thing I ask of a wall is that it be sturdy and not fall down. That is the purpose of a wall, which is separate question entirely from how the wall is used. But the best-constructed wall in the world deserves to be torn down if it surrounds a concentration camp. It ought to be possible to argue that such-and-such is a great artist, and his work out to be burned in the town square by the public hangman.""One could argue that ICH KLAGE AN is great art, and one could argue that it ""ought to be burned by the public hangman"" despite this, given that the film's ultimate legacy was as a softening-up bombardment in the Nazi campaign to desensitize its population to the idea of euthanasia preparatory to initiating their hideous ""T-4"" mass euthanasia program, which saw 100,000 mentally ill Germans gassed or poisoned as an act of racial hygieneThe story begins with the effervescent and life-loving Hanna Heyt celebrating the appointment of her research-scientist husband Thomas to a professorship in Munich. When Hanna injures her arm slightly during their dinner celebration, however, the injuries don't heal, so Thomas calls in a former romantic rival of his, Dr. Bernhard Lang, to perform an examination. To everyone's horror, Lang, who is still in love with Hanna, diagnoses her with multiple sclerosis. Thomas immediately throws himself into researching a treatment for the progressive and fatal disease, which is steadily robbing Hanna of all the quality of life; but when his efforts come to nothing he begins to seriously contemplate granting her wish for euthanasia, even though the law forbids it, and Lang is militantly opposed. Thomas' decision ultimately lands him before a court of inquiry, where his actions and motives are scrutinized and some evidence is presented that may exonerate him without a clear decision as to the morality of assisted suicide. But Lang isn't having it: refusing to grant anyone an easy way out, he demands to be tried solely on the basis of whether his actions were right or wrong, and its upon this verdict that his fate rests.IMDB's review of this movie calls it ""morbid melodrama,"" but I no longer trust any official reviews of Nazi-era films, since the reviewers inevitably confuse enjoying a film produced by the Nazi government to mean the viewer is in sympathy with its ideology and methods.I myself found the film deeply moving and extremely dramatic. The direction, by Wolfgang Liebeneiner, is crisp and assured, the performances are absolutely first-rate and the script is tight and beautifully written. The lovely Heidemarie Hatheyer delivers an award-worthy performance full of charm and pathos. Hartmann and Weiman are also superb as the rival doctors. Margarete Haagen is also excellent as Hanna's housekeeper/surrogate mother, the loving Berta, as is the always-reliable Christian Kayssler as the judge. This film won the prestigious (at the time, anyway) Biennale Cup, and I believe deservedly so. It's at least as good, and probably considerably more gutsy in its subject matter, than most American and British films shot at the same time.ICH KLAGE AN translates from German to English as ""I Accuse"" and it is an appropriate title for the film. On trial for his life, Thomas Heyt ultimately accuses his accusers of cowardice and hypocrisy for being willing to condemn a suffering human being to indefinite physical suffering merely to spare themselves moral anguish, and he asks the audience to render its own judgement on his actions. In other words, this film was designed to open a dialogue as to its subject, and I believe it does just precisely that. What surprised me was the even-handedness with which the movie explores the idea of euthanasia itself. Religious, moral and ethical arguments against it are all brought to bear and given, I believe, at least the pretense of a fair hearing. There's little doubt where the movie itself lands, but it does not subject the anti-euthanasia crowd to ridicule. For a Nazi-sanctioned film, it's surprisingly fair.I quoted Orwell above because I know there are many who wonder why Nazi-era cinema has a modern audience or is even allowed to be sold. Many would argue that whatever the artistic or technical merits of movies like STUKAS, SA-MANN BRAND, UBER ALLES IN DER WELT, etc., etc.  they were ultimately fruits of the poisonous tree that was Nazi Germany, and should be suppressed or destroyed, as so much Nazi literature has been suppressed and destroyed. Orwell himself may have argued this, but I can't agree, and I'm grateful to live in a country where -- unlike most of ""liberal"" Europe, in which these films are banned -- art is not burned in the town square by the public hangman. After all, who appoints the hangman? And who is to say what else he might choose to burn?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86Y87DLIAJVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D66JVC#wasThisHelpful","R86Y87DLIAJVZ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is very interesting to note that THE HELLBOUND HEART is as economical a novel as its predecessor, THE DAMNATION GAME, was overwritten. In fact, it is not a novel at all but a novella, a sort of gory-fied short story that is all the more disturbingly effective because it later gave birth, in movie form, to the HELLRAISER franchise -- in other words, to Pinhead and his ghastly latex-demon pals, the Cenobites.THE HELLBOUND HEART opens with the hedonistic sociopath Frank Cotton playing with a mystical puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration. He soon discovers that the rumors about the box are true: it has the power to summon a group of demonic entities known as the Order of the Gash, who offer Frank -- who feels as if he has exhausted all known forms of pleasure and debauchery -- an experience he has never had before. It soon turns out that Frank has bitten off more than he can chew, but there is no going back from a bargain with the Order. Cut to a few months later: Frank's tame brother Rory and his faithless wife Julia have moved into the Cotton family home. The wife carries a dark secret: she once bedded, and has ever after lusted, after Frank. So when she discovers, after a bloody accident, that the presumed-missing Frank is still in the house, she readily agrees to help him escape the Cenobites so they can ditch Rory and run off together. Of course there is a little business which must be taken care of first: the demons have reduced Frank to a disgusting parody of a human being, little more than an animated skeleton. To regain his humanity, he needs blood...lots of blood...which Julia must supply to him via a series of hapless horny businessmen she picks up in airport bars...and after that, he needs skin to walk around in...which perhaps his brother can supply. And here comes the small hitch in the plan: Rory's wife may be a two-timing narcissistic psycho, but his friend Kirsty thinks he's the greatest guy on earth and is (pardon the pun) hell-bent to protect him. Suspecting Julia of an affair, she soon discovers wifey is up to much worse, and ends up making a twisted bargain of her own with the Cenobites to save the day. The trouble is, she may not be able to hold up her end of it; and even if she does, who's to say they will keep their word? In the grisly world author Clive Barker has created, the only certainty is that come what may, there will be blood. Lots and lots of blood.THE HELLBOUND HEART was Clive Barker's second novel, and it is written in a very different style than his debut, THE DAMNATION GAME. The latter book was interesting and even occasionally brilliant, but so heavily overwritten as to become a bit tedious. This novel has almost the opposite problem: Barker has written such a terse, economical story that I began to wish, halfway through, that he'd fleshed it out some more. And that is really the only criticism I can level at the book. It reminded me strongly of the film Noir movies of the 40s and 50s, albeit with a demonic twist. It is a highly imaginative and deeply disturbing story, in which each character has a clear and understandable, if not necessarily sympathetic, motive. Frank, suffering from his own bad decisions, wants out of his living hell. Julia, suffering from anomie and boredom, wants out of the dull confines of middle-class marriage. Kirsty wants to protect her secret love, Rory. And Rory? The poor guy just wants his wife to love him again. Amidst all this simmering human motivation the Cenobites add an unholy spice to the broth: they want what is owed to them, and they are damned well (pun intended) gonna get it.To be sure, if you have already seen the movie HELLRAISER this book will not surprise you: Barker's script stuck very closely to his novel, and there are few,  if any, significant departures from the story. But even having seen the movie a number of times I found myself page-turning almost frantically as the novel stamps along to its gory, barbaric and apocalyptic conclusion. This is a very dark tale, full of twisted motives, shattering betrayals and brutal murders, and while it can be said that vice is punished, it can't necessarily said that virtue is rewarded. In the world Barker has created, once you make a deal with the devil, there's no such thing as a bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKC1151KBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061002828#wasThisHelpful","R1MKC1151KBU","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The definition of ""strange"" is ""something which is different from what is usual, normal or expected."" The definition of ""macabre"" is ""involving death or violence in a way that is strange, frightening, or unpleasant; having death as a subject : comprising or including a personalized representation of death.""Both these words apply to THE WICKER MAN.I'd heard rumors and whispers about this movie for years; I'd even read Christopher Lee's warm words for it in his autobiography, but I didn't watch it until this year, and I admit that about halfway through I was ready to press STOP and give up. The movie was slow, eccentric, bizarre and at times, borderline ridiculous; then, all of the sudden, the eccentricity began to ravel into a feeling of increasing unease and menace, a sort of ""everyone is in on the joke except the hero, and it's a very black joke indeed."" By the climax I was watching mainly to see what the hell would happen, and once it did...well, not since the original PLANET OF THE APES have I been so jarred by a movie's ending.THE WICKER MAN is the story of a British policeman named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who flies out to the remote, clannish, half-forgotten Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Almost immediately upon landing he begins to suspect the tight-lipped islanders aren't telling him everything, but his frustrated investigation rapidly yields one piece of very disconcerting information: on Summerisle, Christianity is dead and Celtic Paganism is the one true faith. Howie, a devout and somewhat self-righteous Christian, is revolted by this, and by the wanton sexuality of the island's female population, most noticeably the gorgeous Willow MacGregor (Brit Ecklund). Encountering the island's de facto ruler, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), Howie gradually begins to suspect that Rowan Morrison may not have been murdered as he first suspected, but may in fact have been kidnapped preparatory to some Celtic ritual of human sacrifice. Determined to save Rowan's life, he searches the island from one end to the other without success, before deciding on an even more radical plan of action: he will infiltrate the ""cult"" by masquerading as one of them. Only then will he discover the answer to the question that brought him to Summerisle and has now placed his life in jeopardy: what the devil happened to Rowan Morrison?As I said, I found the first half of this movie to be heavy going. There is a lot of bizarre dialogue and a lot -- I mean a LOT -- of singing. A lot of what I saw seemed weird for the sake of being weird and I didn't understand what the hell the point of all of this discomfort was. Only my loyalty to Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee kept me going, but once I crested Mount Weird, I began to see that like Rowan Morrison, I was being led somewhere...somewhere very freaking nasty, and all the nastier because the bad guys in this film don't see themselves as bad at all. Quite the contrary....Obviously I am not giving you hard details here, because I can't describe the movie very accurately without giving away the store. What I can say is that Edward Woodward delivers a possibly career-best performance as a devoutly Christian cop whose entire sense of right and wrong, sane and insane, and hell, even up and down, are attacked from the moment he lands his seaplane by the quiet little island -- at first subtly, then more and more blatantly until the audience wonders just how much power the law has on an island which seems to be a law unto itself. This is a film that crumbles the self-assurance of its hero by degrees, inflicting a slow nonviolent torture on both him and the viewer, until exploding into a climax so jarring, so disturbing, and so outright horrifying that it took me hours to recover.And isn't that exactly what you want from a horror movie?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UDEFRI918XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QCD2QO#wasThisHelpful","R28UDEFRI918XP","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched GERMANIN: THE STORY OF A COLONIAL DEED out of sheer curiosity. I've been exploring Nazi-era cinema at some length this year, and have generally found it to be much more subtle thematically, better written and better acted than I would have expected. Shot at the height of WW2, this movie can be excused for its propagandistic and anti-British themes, and represents a solid of unspectacular UFA studios release which perhaps belies George Orwell's assertion that no art of any value can be produced under a dictatorship.GERMANIN begins in 1914 in a German colony in Africa. A resolute German physician (Peter Petersen) and his lovely assistant (Lotte Koch) are working on a cure to the dreaded, fly-borne disease of sleeping sickness, which is decimating the population. When war breaks out, the British attack his isolated research outpost, forcing a friendly trapper (Luis Trenker) to flee to Germany with the doctor's research. After Germany's collapse, the three reunite in Berlin to continue the fight against the disease, only to face bureaucratic obstacles set in their path by the British and by the Bayer corporation. After an act of heroism by the trapper, which proves the doctor's formula is effective, Bayer gets on board and the British reluctantly allow the trio to return to their former colony to bring the ""Germanin"" formula to the masses: it's only then that the true extend of British perfidy is revealed, and our three heroes must fight both a scheming British officer (Albert Lippert) and the disease itself in order to see that justice is done for the people of Africa.GERMANIN is a film somewhat typical of the period in which it was shot and to some extent, the government which authorized its production. The idea of European colonization of Africa is accepted on its face as a beneficent enterprise: the Germans bringing modern medicine and technology to well-meaning savages (whose customs are depicted in great detail, with a huge cast of black people which includes the German-speaking black actor Louis Brody). At the same time, the loss of the colonies after Versailles is depicted as a national humiliation, doubly so because the rationale for stripping them from Germany was Germany's ""moral unworthiness"" to guide the local populace to civilization: yet the morally ""superior"" England is shown deliberately interfering with the distribution of ""Germanin"" in favor of an inferior American medicine, to the detriment of the natives. And the Germans themselves are depicted as ethical, manly and heroic (if they are men) and sexy and stalwart (if they are Lotte Koch). By today's standards the film is clumsy, obvious and deeply racist (in a strangely well-meaning way) but American and British films of the same era are no different, and as far as the British characters are depicted, the script actually allows for more character development from the British antagonist than would have been granted to a German in an ""Allied"" film of the same time.As entertainment, GERMANIN does the job without exceeding expectations.The acting is quite good, and there are a few interesting twists to the story and some first-class villainy on the part of Col. Crosby, the bad-guy Englishman, such as when he destroys all the Germanin out of spite. (Lotte Koch is really a sight, too.) Technically the film is pretty sophisticated, and director Max Kimmich (Goebbels' brother-in-law) does his job with professionalism and some obvious gusto.  I'm not sure where the exteriors were actually shot, but the locations look African to me and I suppose it's not impossible some of it was filmed there during the period when the Axis had a large foothold on ""the black continent."" The camerawork is more mobile than many films of its time period (1943) and the use of stock footage of  chimpanzees, snakes, cheetahs, waterfalls, jungles, swamps, etc. is less obtrusive than you might imagine. The weaknesses are a lack of character development (everyone is pretty much fully formed at the beginning of the movie and stays the same all film through, except for Col. Crosby), uneven pacing, and a somewhat anticlimactic ending. We are continuously told that curing the sickness is only half the battle, that exterminating the tsetse fly is the real answer, and that the British stand in the way, but there is never an explanation as to how this might be done even if the Brits don't interfere -- especially by a band of 3 Germans with some native helpers.All in all I'd say this is a decent but not a great film, entertaining without being riveting and enjoyable without being truly resonant. I'd recommend it for fans of 40s-era movies, adventure cinema, and those curious about what going to a movie in Nazi Germany would have been like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333LPK5H4LUGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGQWM3U#wasThisHelpful","R333LPK5H4LUGS","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Circle of Death"" was one of the very first, if not the first, episodes of THE SHADOW to deal with a mass-murdering lunatic. Not coincidentally, it features the actor Alan Devitt as the bad guy, in what would become his signature type of role on that show: a crazy man with a penchant for murder. Few people did it as well as Devitt, which explains why ""Circle of Death"" is a such solid and enjoyable episode.The story opens with a mysterious bombing in the ""City Arcade"" (presumably Times Square), which kills many innocent people. The bombings continue, seemingly at random and without motive, and the angry business owners are soon demanding Commissioner Weston resign if he can't catch the person(s) responsible. The Shadow decides to take a hand in the matter and publicly challenges the anonymous killer to bomb the Arcade again. It's a risky gamble, but in order for The Shadow to stop the bomber, he must get him to expose the diabolical method he uses for delivering his bombs.""Circle"" is not a perfect episode. It has a few plot holes, the ending is a bit anticlimactic, and the reliance on the Shadow's ability to read minds (a device quickly abandoned after about one season) weakens the suspense. Balancing that are a slam-bang (no pun intended) opening, some great verbal jousting between Weston and The Shadow, and a great performance by Devitt as the lunatic. It's not a classic tale, but it delivers many of the elements which made the show itself a classic: jarring violence, high stakes, and a bad guy who puts the ""c"" in ""crazy."" As a bonus, this ep was produced during the era when Weston hated The Shadow, which made for some great humor.""The Circle of Death"" was originally broadcast on November 28, 1937, and stars Orson Welles as The Shadow/Lamont Crantson, Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane, Ray Collins and Commissioner Weston, and Alan Devitt as Anton Spivak.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3GHV6O77ZEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MKZ5P8#wasThisHelpful","RX3GHV6O77ZEB","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cut to twenty years later; Evans, DuBrille and Covet all have successful lives in America, and have forgotten Martan...until he finally manages to escape, and embarks on a quest for revenge. Evans, who saved The Shadow's life by removing a bullet near his spine years before, pleads with the invisible avenger to intercede and stop Martan before he can exact his revenge. Can The Shadow stop a man that even Devil's Island could not contain? All is not what it seems in this story of twisted motives and debts that can only be paid in blood.""Triangle"" is a strong if unspectacular story; its only real flaw is a certain muddiness caused by the large number of characters and the central plot twist (a case of addition by subtraction). It is nevertheless a very good example of the type of tale which relies mainly on understandable human feelings and motivations (like guilt and revenge), rather than a flashy gimmick like a death-ray or a mad scientist. (THE SHADOW was often at its strongest when rooted in the real world -- or rather the real underworld.) And as always, the vocal acting is excellent all around.""The Death Triangle"" was originally broadcast on December 12, 1937 and stars Orson Welles as The Shadow/Lamont Cranston, Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane, Bennett Kilpack as Pierre Martan, Alan Devitt as Raymond DuBrille, Ned Wever as Dr. James Evans, and Everett Sloane as Jacques Covet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEYP7I9YI9ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MKZ5PI#wasThisHelpful","R2IEYP7I9YI9ZP","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SHADOW was nothing if not inventive when it came to storylines, and ""The Phantom Fingerprints"" is as good an example as you could find of a show which never let its own formula detract from spinning a great yarn.Our story begins with Chief Weston debating whether or not to retire a beloved but aged police surgeon. The old man demurs, saying that retirement would kill him: so when he's found brutally murdered in Weston's office, there's a heavy dose of irony as well as outrage that sweeps the Police Department. Confusion is added when the fingerprints of the murderer come back as belonging to Killer Norvelli, a vicious hoodlum who Weston sent to the electric chair years before. Ridiculing the notion that a dead man wielded the fatal knife, the principal suspect becomes a cop with a gambling problem who owed the surgeon money...but the Shadow isn't convinced. To get to the truth, however, he has to track down Norvelli's widow, and discover whether the cop is guilty, the murderer really has returned from the grave...or a third suspect is out there and waiting to strike again.There is nothing specifically spectacular about this episode. The basic themes are familiar to any veteran listener of the show, and it could be argued that the ultimate identity of the killer becomes obvious sooner than the writer would have liked, but these are minor points. Sometimes even the less complex SHADOW tales managed to strike precisely the right notes of mystery, suspense, terror and the macabre, and ""The Phantom Fingerprints"" is one of those. Throw in a killer both evil and ridiculously cunning, and you have a sure-fire recipe for entertainment.""The Phantom Fingerprints"" was originally broadcast October 29, 1939 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD37TQOXAMAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MRA416#wasThisHelpful","R3DD37TQOXAMAA","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Death Speaks Twice"" is an entertaining and original episode of THE SHADOW which hovers somewhere between three and four stars in my estimation, Three because there is nothing really spectacular about it, four because what it does, it does quite effectively.Paul Bartow is in prison, but if you believe him, he's been framed -- framed by his corrupt, bullying judge of an uncle, who just happens to be the same judge who sentenced him to prison. Paul doesn't have much time left on his sentence, but his lifer cell mate, Marty LaGort, another victim of the hanging judge, convinces him to escape and get even. Why? Because Paul's ex-flame is about to marry his shifty  step-brother. News of the breakout alarms everyone in the prosperous but troubled Bartow family, and when Judge Bartow is brutally murdered, Commissioner Weston is determined to bring Paul to justice, but Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane have their doubts as to Paul's guilt. The trouble is, Weston has the most damning of evidence: a recording of the murder itself! With everything stacked against Paul, it's up to The Shadow to discover just who has committed the real crime here...and who must pay.I probably overuse the word ""straightforward"" when reviewing episodes of THE SHADOW so I'll just say that this one is direct without being overly obvious. The opening, set in prison, is very strong, and there is a remarkably clever device by which Paul may or may not have been framed. Throw in the opaque motives of the escaped murderer Marty LaGort, and a lot of twisted, inter-family scheming, coupled with Chief Weston's tendency to shoot first and ask questions never, and you have a fun, swiftly-paced half-hour which just goes to show that crime does not pay, but it does entertain.""Death Speaks Twice"" was originally broadcast on February 15, 1942 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPEFH1AW28BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MV8X88#wasThisHelpful","R3OPEFH1AW28BG","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are episodes of THE SHADOW that rely very heavily on the fact that the show's hero, Lamont Cranston, has the power of invisibility. ""The Temple Bells of Neban,"" for example, or ""The Shadow Challenged"" or ""The White Witchman of Lawaiki."" just to name a few.. On the other hand, there are quite a few stories in which this dramatic gimmick plays little part, and the plot is simply straight gangster - Noir. ""Until Death Do Us Part"" is one of them.The story begins with a brutal murder: a hit-man named Roxy offs the supposedly two-timing wife of a big-shot gambling kingpin named Lou. Cut to two years later: Lou has remarried, but his new spouse Fey is just as unhappy as her predecessor -- so unhappy she tries vainly to seek comfort in the arms of Lou's chief lieutenant, the handsome Vince. Vince, however, isn't having it, even when Fey reveals that she has evidence Lou killed his first wife and that he's planning on doing her the same way. Enter Lamont Crantson, who steps in to try to protect Fey while simultaneously dealing with the murderous Roxy and a kingpin who doesn't seem to be deterred by the army of cops sent against him. But where cops fail, the Shadow is determined to succeed -- if only he can get to the bottom of a nasty tangle of greed, jealousy, betrayal and murder.This is a fine story full of plot twists, double-crosses, violent ambushes, and brutal murders. The dialogue is straight gangster pulp, with the actors who play Roxy, Vince and Fey doing exceptional jobs at portraying people for whom lawbreaking, scheming and hustling are second nature, yet have their own weird charisma all the same. As with most stories of this type, not everyone who is guilty gets punished to the full extent of the law and not everyone who is innocent lives to see the end of the episode, yet the moral at the end is harshly decisive. Or, as the Shadow puts it apropos of a killer: ""He'll get what's coming to him -- every volt.""""Until Death Do Us Part..."" was originally broadcast on March 6, 1949 and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUT74VEED6ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N85U7M#wasThisHelpful","R2YUT74VEED6ER","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hans Zberlein was one of the lucky ones.Or was he?Born in 1895 in Imperial Germany, he was of precisely the right age group to be sucked into the maelstrom of World War One. That was unlucky. And no sooner had he finished his military training than he was shipped off to the massacre masquerading as a battle known as Verdun. That was unluckier still. So it's no coincidence then that the first volume of""Faith in Germany"" (Glaube an Deutschland) his (when all volumes are counted) 900 page account of his wartime experiences, begins with an account of that massacre -- and reading through it, one wonders how the hell he survived.Maybe he was lucky after all?Purely by accident, Zberlein became a ""guide"" almost as soon as he arrived at the front. His job was to lead fresh troops to the trenches and worn-out ones back from it. It sounds like a simple-enough task, but Verdun in 1916 had ceased to be a town, a fortress or even a geographical location, and devolved into a massive, shell-cratered sea of mud and corpses, whose landscape was pounded into fresh new shapes every day by French heavy artillery. At night, with poison gas lingering over everything, with shell holes deep as three-story houses and full of stagnant water everywhere, with one's boots sinking ankle deep in slime, with machine-gun bullets shrieking overhead and shrapnel and high-explosive detonating all around....well, the task of being a guide had its own peculiar difficulties.What struck me about Verdun, from the German perspective, especially when the author contrasts it to the idyllic, full-bellied time he spent on the Eastern Front, sunbathing and drinking ""grog"" and waiting for action that never came, was that Verdun was not so much a battle itself as a kind of natural disaster which  consumed human lives by the hundreds and even the thousands every day. For the first 2/3 of the book, the Germans seldom ever even glimpse the French, except as rotting corpses. Their reality is mud, lice, rats, stench, more mud, still more mud, and constant fear of death. The idea was not to win, to attack or even to defend, but simply to endure, and to survive. As an American soldier once quipped when asked by a journalist what he wanted most in the world: ""Gimme tomorrow.""VERDUN isn't what I'd call a page-turner until the book's final act. Like a lot of amateur writers, Zberlein's clumsy prose style becomes more surefooted as he gets deeper into his subject, and his word-pictures become clearer and more concise. What's more, the war itself changes character, with more direct action, including a fascinating accidental attack conducted by the Germans, and a brutal yet black-comic sub-plot about a French sniper who utters a horse laugh every time he picks off a German soldier (it's Zberlein's task to teach this fellow some humility). The climax of the book, which shows how Zberlein's outfit is treated in the rear after their arduous and selfless duty, is a real gut-wrencher, right out of THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER or IF THIS BE GLORY, and seems to represent a turning point in his attitude. Naivete  and obedience to authority begins to ferment into bile and gall, as well as the hard self-assurance of a battle-tested front line soldier, who tells his superiors, in essence, to go F themselves, you can keep your Iron Cross. It's not hard that the Nazi in Zberlein was conceived out of sheer bitterness.If the short first volume (only 115 pages) is emotionally honest -- Zberlein freely admits to fear, horror and confusion at all times -- technically, the book is all over the place. The author writes in a typically German vein, meaning he uses the present tense and begins the memoir in media res, without any biographical information other than what is occasionally revealed by idiom, reminiscences, or conversation. This is effective for dramatic purposes but doesn't give us too much to work with in regards to getting to know Zberlein. The book's translation is from German into British English, and it is often unwieldy. As for the editing , it is just plain atrocious. Words are repeated, mis-spelled or just plain omitted, many quotes aren't closed, punctuation is occasionally missing, and despite the handsome illustration on the cover, the whole book has an atmosphere of something which was rushed into print by a small-press publisher with no time, no money and no editor. I'd have dearly loved just one day to proof-read this sucker before it went to press, as it would have dearly helped the readability. I don't want to seem ungrateful, and I'd rather have this version of ""Faith in Germany"" than none at all, but I hope, if only for the sake of book sales, subsequent volumes of Zberlein's book produce cleaner copy. I will, however, be buying ""Volume II"" when it comes out, regardless.Now, it's worth noting that ""Faith in Germany"" was, until the end of WW2, considered, alongside ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" and ""In The Storm Of Steel""  to be perhaps THE account of the Great War as written from the German perspective. The book was an international best-seller, became the basis for an equally successful film called ""Shock Troop 1917,"" and was evidently read and admired by Adolf Hitler, who later wrote a forward for it in which he called it ""the legacy of the front."" But therein lies the rub. Because Hitler saw in  Zberlein a kindred spirit, one who had taken the ""right"" attitude toward the war and drawn the ""right"" lessons from it, and because Zberlein, unlike, say, Ernst Jnger, joined the Nazi Party and may have even been involved in the postwar ""Werewolf"" movement, he has suffered the fate Orwell might have called ""Going down the memory hole."" Since 1945 his works have been banned in Germany, and the movie is only permitted to be shown after heavy editing, lest it rouse in its viewers some resentment at the victorious Allies or some spark of Teutonic martial spirit. Indeed, it's only just now that both the film and his multi-volume memoirs are available to even the English reader, and for that I am grateful to the publisher, notwithstanding my comments as to the editing. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech and freedom of thought, and I believe that suppressing ""dangerous"" literature in the name of freedom is far more dangerous than any literature could ever be. Hans Zberlein's experiences in the war -- which in this volume, anyway, aren't to be distinguished from Remarque's, though his conclusions certainly were -- speak for themselves. It should be, and thanks to TRB, it is, up to the reader to pass judgement on them. The reader, and not the government.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACT28EL2MDPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XQV65E#wasThisHelpful","R1ACT28EL2MDPI","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my Fitbit One for about two years now and for better or worse, can't imagine life without it. I had to order a replacement charger when I lost the original, so I thought I'd write a fast review of this device for the newcomer.THE PROS: The charging cable is small enough to pocket and forget about. It travels easily. It's a USB plug, so you can charge the Fitbit from pretty much any computer of any size, whether the FB software is installed or not. It also charges the unit with remarkable speed.THE CONS: Because it's a USB, wall outlets won't help you, and this is annoying. If the Fitbit's battery is totally dead, it will take several minutes to register a signal. This can confuse the owner into thinking the charger is broken. It's also grossly overpriced, which sucks because it's very small and correspondingly easy to misplace.That's pretty much it.

"I've seen a helluva lot of war movies, but THE HOT SNOW definitely gave me something different to chew on, presenting both a broad and extremely narrow view of history's most destructive conflict, and employing a literal ""cast of thousands"" to tell a tale of heroism, grim determination, and the importance of the individual in the face of huge historical events.In terms of plot, THE HOT SNOW is about as straightforward as a bullet. It's December of 1942, and a Soviet anti-tank outfit has been charged with holding the line against a German attack intended to relieve their trapped army at Stalingrad. Because the fate of the war may hinge on repulsing the relief attack, the Soviet general in charge orders each of his soldiers to fight to the death where he stand -- there is to be no retreat. Correspondingly, after a series of tough fights against waves of oncoming German tanks, only one gun and its seven-man crew (actually six men and and one woman) survive. Freezing, cut off, surrounded by dead men, each member of the crew struggles to master their nerve and do their duty while staring, quite literally, down the barrels of German guns.Although I've very little experience with Russian films (ALEXANDR NEVSKY and NINTH COMPANY are the only other two I've seen), in some ways I found this movie familiar, in that it's the classic story of a small unit thrown into the crucial sector of a huge battle -- a story told in movies as disparate as BATAAN, THE ALAMO, THE LOST BATTALION, and 300, just to name a few. On the other hand, I was fascinated by the differences between Russian/Soviet culture and, for example, that of Americans or other Westerners. Everybody knows the Russians have a reputation for toughness, stubbornness and ruthlessness, but even so, the cold-blooded behavior of General Bessanov made quite an impression on me. Early in the movie his HQ is strafed by German fighters; he tells the flying-control officer that the punishment for this ought to be death. A short while later he orders the summary execution of a drunken tanker who has retreated instead of fighting to the death. Later yet he waits to order a counterattack even though he knows it may mean the annihilation of an entire division, because the time is not yet right. One gets the idea that the Russians are at once primitive and almost savage folk, with their guitars and vodka and barbaric discipline and casual regard for life, yet at the same time deeply and fatalistically soulful, understanding that life is a rental and not a purchase, and that the cause they fight for is infinitely larger than themselves.Technically the film is sound. The acting is very good, I enjoyed the script -- the translation seems very spot-on, with a lot of idioms -- and the cinematography was respectable and sometimes quite inspired. The sequences of the gun-crews clanking shells into the smoking breeches and firing round after round at the elephantine German panzers were superb. And being filmed in 1972, the producers couldn't fake battle sequences with CGI, they actually had to employ vast groups of extras and surprisingly large numbers of vehicles to get the job done. There is some model-work typical of the period, but for the most part if you see a tank, it's just that, not a blob of pixels. Of course the viewer already knows the ultimate outcome of the Stalingrad battle, so the tension lies in the fate of the individual characters. And here, to some extent, is the film's main weakness. Although several of the characters do get killed over the course of the movie, I felt that to some extent, the writer was not quite ruthless enough in doling out the scythe as the film went on. What's more, there is no precise point of climax in the story; just a lot of fighting which tapers off to a long, miserable night in a bunker followed by the battle's aftermath. An American writer would have structured the story more predictably, but also with a greater eye to tension and pacing.I can't say THE HOT SNOW is a great war movie. There are a lot of characters to follow, probably too many stereotypes, and having been shot in the Soviet era, there is no mention of the tension which probably existed between the general and his chief commissar -- the two men come off more like brothers-in-law. Yet I can't say the movie didn't effect me or that I didn't enjoy it, and I will almost certainly watch it again. That's a pretty strong recommendation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FE67K7JQVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NPQ0GA#wasThisHelpful","R6FE67K7JQVJ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For an Orson Welles episode of THE SHADOW, ""The White God"" falls pretty squarely in the middle of the pack. It's not anywhere near in the league of such classics as ""Death From The Deep"" or ""Sabotage""; nor is it as bad as clunkers like ""Hounds in the Hills"" or ""Voice Of The Trumpet."" It's a fairly fast-paced, respectably entertaining, e'er so slightly ridiculous story that will hold your interest but probably not resonate in your mind.""The White God"" opens with a rash of inexplicable ship disappearances and sinkings in the South Pacific. Volunteering his services to the U.S. Navy, The Shadow, with Margo at his side, is flown to a remote island chain to investigate. However, no sooner have they approached the chain than their plane crashes, evidently affected by some mysterious force. Washing up on the island, they discover the natives worship a mysterious, homicidal white man who claims to be responsible for wrecking the ships. The boast seems preposterous, but if it isn't supernatural power behind the reign of the White God, what is it -- and how will the Shadow put a stop to it?As I said, this episode is not one of Welles' best. The premise is rather busy for a half-hour show; plus it is bizarre and a little silly, which makes the vicious brutality of the White God seem jarring. The best SHADOW episodes knew when to play a story absolutely straight and when to place tongue firmly in cheek; this one lacks that balance. On the other hand, it is pretty bold in its scope, solidly entertaining, and surprisingly well-written for all its silliness. The 30s were a time when mankind was beginning to actively fear the products of its own science, and ""The White God"" is a good reflection of this growing unease.""The White God"" was originally broadcast on July 10, 1938 and stars Orson Welles as The Shadow and Agnes Moorehead as Margo Lane.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTRJGJYDZCKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ53AO#wasThisHelpful","RRTRJGJYDZCKU","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a show that depended heavily on formula, THE SHADOW was nothing if not diverse in its array of storylines. Few lawmen or vigilantes in history had to deal with such infinite varieties of villainy as did poor Lamont Cranston and his trusty sidekick Margo Lane: from ruthless foreign spies to home-grown gangsters, from psychopathic murderers to mad scientists, the invisible detective tackled 'em all, and in ""The Leopard Strikes"" our heroes are tested once more by crooks that think -- and kill -- outside the box.The story begins with two beat cops patrolling a park near the city zoo. When one of them is killed by what appears to be a huge animal, suspicion naturally falls on Rebu, a huge leopard maintained by the zoo. One of the keepers agrees with Commissioner Weston's conclusion that the big cat must be responsible, but Rebu's keeper violently denies this. The disagreement, and several subsequent murders, make Crantson wonder if there isn't more to this case than an escape-prone leopard, and as The Shadow he begins an investigation which takes him from the zoo into the midst of a bizarre animal cult that may...or may not...be responsible for the grisly killings.This episode is a good if not riveting listen, and I hesitated as to whether I should give it three or four stars, because it's fast-paced and entertaining. I settled for three because despite an interesting premise, the story itself is a bit too linear to be really gripping, there are several glaring plot holes, and I found the Shadow's attitude toward the feelings of the keeper whose favorite animal dies during the story to be rather callous. On the other hand, it's noteworthy that in this story, The Shadow actually kills someone deliberately, an event I think unique in all 220+ surviving episodes, and for that reason alone it's probably worth a listen.""The Leopard Strikes"" was originally broadcast on January 5, 1941 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9Z9R07IYM8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MTECD0#wasThisHelpful","R1C9Z9R07IYM8F","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I go any further let me start by saying that the meager three stars I've bestowed on QUINCY, M.E. is based on a sliding scale. In other words, I only rate the first two seasons as ""okay"" because I know just how good the show became when it finally hit full stride in its third. This two-season package is well worth owning, and is in fact a must-have for fans (or aspiring fans) of the series.Having gotten that out of the way...welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of the boob tube. This is the story of Dr. Quincy -- no first name ever given! -- a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell.Now, it must be said that the first ""season"" of QUINCY is not a ""season"" in the understood sense of the word. When the show originally debuted in 1976 it was intended to be a ""movie of the week"", not a regular series, and in fact the first seven episodes in this 17 episode package are just that -- TV movies of about 75 minutes. Beginning with episode 8, the format changes drastically: the show goes to an normal hour length, and most of the episodes are shot on sets or back lots rather than expensive locations. Quincy's steady girlfriend is given the soap opera ""unperson"" treatment and a revolving door of suspiciously young, hot women take her place. Finally, the ""strictly mystery"" approach is replaced by alternation between regular mystery stories (in which Quincy uses forensics to solve a crime) and ""causes"" -- battles in the public interest which Quincy (and presumably the writers and producers of the show) felt were worth fighting. Each element, in 1977, was unique to television; nobody had ever done a show about forensic pathology and nobody had ever done a prime-time network drama with a social conscience. Combining the two made TV history...and I guarantee will make your day.Some of the better episodes include ""Hot Ice, Cold Hearts"", ""Snake Eyes"", ""The Thighbone's Connected to the Kneebone"", ""Let Me Light The Way"" and ""Visitors In Paradise."" However, it must be reiterated here that Seasons 1 & 2 of QUINCY are primitive in several ways. First...this show was shot before DNA, before computer simulations, before the Internet, cell phones, and just about every other damn invention except fire. So a lot of what seems revolutionary to our protagonist will seem like ancient history to the viewer, especially the younger viewer (""DUDE...nice station wagon!"") Second, the show, particularly when ""causes"" get embraced, is cheesy and heavy-handed, albeit in a charming way: there is more than a hint of ""ABC After School Special"" morality being dispensed here, and some will find it too much to swallow. But when you balance this with the superb performance of Jack Klugman, who plays every scene with lusty relish, the engaging storylines chock-a-block with famous character actors from shows like M*A*S*H, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and STAR TREK, and the wonderful nostalgia element of 1970s fashions, it's hard not to give a thumbs up. I still maintain that the show didn't really reach a gallop until Season Three, when the budget increased, the background characters like Sam and Asten got more play, and everything just generally came together: but every story has to start somewhere, and for a modest price you can ride along with the ill-tempered angel on his very first missions. It's not a bad deal, believe me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SI0KCYSGKNVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JO3P#wasThisHelpful","R1SI0KCYSGKNVY","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Oracle of Death"" is an overlooked episode of THE SHADOW. While not classic or even great, it's an entertaining and enjoyable story with several very clever plot gimmicks and is well worth a listen.The story begins with a car accident; submoronic cab driver Shreevie has accidentally run down a pedestrian while carrying Lamont and Margo home after a dinner date with Chief Weston. The couple obligingly takes the pedestrian, who calls himself Spud, into Lamont's apartment, and when he recovers, Spud claims that he is twenty-four hours ""ahead"" of everyone else. As proof, he points out that in his yesterday (which is their today), the Continental Bank was robbed. Lamont, erring on the side of caution, phones Weston and tells him to send some cops to protect the bank; Weston replies that it's too late -- the bank was robbed only minutes before. This is the first of several eerily accurate predictions Spud makes, the last two of which are that a series of bombs will rock the city's East Side ""tomorrow""...and that Lamont Cranston will be murdered...""today."" Now Lamont, or rather The Shadow, has only hours to determine how to foil the prophecies and determine just how -- and more importantly, why -- Spud is able to predict the future.I realize that this story sounds somewhat ridiculous, but it actually works surprisingly well. From the opening banter between Lamont, Margo and Weston to the addition of Cranston's ex-convict butler Roland to the storyline, ""Oracle of Death"" makes a sustained effort to rise above convention and provide a fresh angle for the invisible detective and his audience. It's not a nail-biter, but it shows a little more of Lamont Crantson than we usually get to see (pardon the pun) -- including one who is unusually ruffled by his impending doom.""Oracle of Death"" was originally broadcast on October 20, 1940 and stars Bill Johnstone as The Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B7XF74W9EMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MTECBC#wasThisHelpful","R2B7XF74W9EMC","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a jar of this for free through the Amazon Vine program and thought I'd check it out. Why? Because, damn it, the hair on the back of my head is thinning and who the hell wants to walk into the grocery store and see a big reflective spot on one's dome as he walks beneath the security camera? No this decaying middle-aged specimen. In fact, when I got this I was already using Fixplant, which I'd found more than adequate if not spectacular. So, here is my verdict on the experience I had with this product, which I think may be semi-valuable as I have something to compare it to:This stuff is not bad. It does the job in question, which is to thicken the hair you have. It differs from Fixplant in that the filler is very fine and less clingy, so that you lose more during application to the scalp. Probably because of this it requires more to achieve the same effect, which is why the bottle didn't last nearly as long as one of Fixplant. I found it slightly more resilient, however, i.e. it seemed to last longer before a new application was needed. And lIke Fixplant it washes out immediately when you shower. I had some issue with the coloring not matching the description -- ""dark brown/black"" actually looked a lot like medium brown to me.All in all I can't say I think this product is better that Fixplant, though whether it is worse is a matter of opinion. (I don't think quality control on FP is all that good). However if you use it in tandem it actually achieves a better effect than either would alone. I would definitely use it again if the price was right.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2763RO6HY4UZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZRFJFA#wasThisHelpful","R2763RO6HY4UZZ","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've said it before and I'll say it again: 1948 was an excellent year for THE SHADOW -- maybe the best the show had in its 17 year run on the air -- and the fact that ""The House That Death Built"" is not the best produced that year serves as proof of that fact. It's an outstanding half-hour that blends mystery, suspense and terror into a near-perfect formula.The story begins at night during a snowstorm, with a gang of hoodlums digging up the grave of old Ben Falkenberg, a former prison guard who took a fortune in bribes to help a death row inmate escape years ago. Cut to Lamont Crantson and Margo Lane, who are seeking refuge from the storm in Falkenberg's decaying old house, conveniently located deep in the middle of nowhere. There they encounter both the gang, which is ripping the place apart in hopes of finding Falkenberg's stash of illicit cash, and a mysterious woman with a hidden agenda. Unfortunately for all parties, the dear departed Falkenberg (evidently both a miser and a homicidal maniac) has turned the house into a death trap, rigging the rooms and hallways with enough pitfalls, ambushes and lethal devices to fill an Egyptian tomb. Between the trigger-happy gangsters, the mystery woman and the traps, The Shadow will have his hands full just keeping alive, much less proving to all involved that ""crime does not pay.""This episode has a lot going for it: it moves swiftly, throws out dense layers of characters and numerous plot-twists -- on top of everything else, one of the gangsters is not what he appears to be -- and continually attacks the audience by attacking the characters with double-crossings and fatal and near-fatal ambushes. What's more, it's remarkably prescient: 60-odd years before the SAW films made a horror sub-genre out of sticking gangs of characters into houses loaded with murderous traps, the writers of THE SHADOW delivered the same kind of creepy premise -- without all the gore and bad acting.""The House That Death Built"" was originally broadcast on January 25, 1948 and stars Bret Morrison as The Shadow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZGNJXP93ZGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N85U5O#wasThisHelpful","R2VZGNJXP93ZGW","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to write a proper review of this movie when I have the cast information etc. in front of me. For now let me just say this: based on what the other reviewers have written it seems clear to me that everyone has been fooled into believing this is some kind of Nazi-themed ""Chained Heat"" lesbo-style prison flick. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a serious film -- albeit with an idiotic title -- about the Lebensborn program initiated by Heinrich Himmler during the Second World War. Himmler, head of the SS, grew worried that the war was killing off large numbers of healthy young German men before they could have children. To combat this problem he created a program by which racially pedigreed German soldiers with no kids (serving at the front) would be taken out of the line and mated with women judged to have equal racial value. This program provides the basis for the plot of the movie, which in brief is this:A Luftwaffe pilot who voiced strong anti-Nazi views in a moment of drunken rage is sent to the rear to be court-martialed. With him is the man who denounced him, a fellow pilot and staunch Nazi. En route their car is ambushed by partisans. The Nazi is killed, and our hero, realizing that the Nazi was headed for Lebensborn to ""mate"" with some blue-eyed Aryan princess, decides to switch identities. He arrives at the love-nest compound but immediately falls under the suspicion of the beautiful but ice-cold ""house mother,"" who seems to be a committed Nazi herself. In the mean time, conflicts arise when the law of natural physical attraction imposes itself over the desires of the SS scientists, who seek to mate the men and women based on ""racial compatibility"" and not whether they actually want each other. (As Jeff Goldblum says in JURASSIC PARK: ""Nature will find a way."")I don't want to repeat myself, but this is not -- repeat NOT -- some kind of soft-porn flick in a Nazi uniform. It's a serious film, starring serious actors (I grant you the female actors are smoking hot) that highlights at once the absurdity of Nazi racial ideology and the fanatic and dangerous seriousness with which they pursed it. Although it's not a great movie, and the subtitles will turn off some people, it is of interest for fans of foreign films, WW2 buffs and anyone with a taste for (very) unconventional love stories.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3E2UWYOAGJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZP6PE8#wasThisHelpful","R2T3E2UWYOAGJU","A2E9TRM8096BXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9TRM8096BXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Much better than Brita. The filter fits securely so you are sure no water is seeping through. Definitely makes a difference in the taste of my water.Cons? These filter replacement indicators are pointless. It has no idea how much water the filter has filtered. It never comes in contact with the filtered water to judge how well the filter is still working. It doesn't indicate anything. I reset it when I first used it. If I fill the pitcher to the brim and close the lid, it will blink ""Good""... I don't know how this sealed plastic can tell the quality of the filter by telling me the unfiltered water is good. It's supposed to measure the time you've used the filter... but not how much water it has filtered, which is more important.I just don't get how these types of indicators are becoming the standard. They're confusing. They don't measure how much the filter has actually filtered so how do they know when it should be changed?  They only light up when you fill the container to the brim. It's the most unintuitive, inaccurate measure of a filter's effectiveness. Either the FILTERED water should pass over a sensor or the sensor should be connected to the actual filter, but sealed in plastic and only indicating ""good"" if I over-fill the tub and close the flap is senseless. How is this ineffective, unintiutive, glitchy system becoming the norm?

"The good? I love that Brita made a hand-held filter of this size.The ill-fitting components don't ensure that all water is filtered. It's such a simple contraption. You'd think that, with all the experience Brita has in this department, they'd have the basics down by now.The filter indicator light has no idea the quality of the water or quantity of water I've used. I has no idea the status of the filter. It's sealed in plastic and takes a stab in the dark as to how much water I've filled the device with when it tilts up and down.The filter tub cannot be removed. Condensation builds up in a pitcher that can never be cleaned. Potential mold health hazard.This is not some complicated piece of machinery. I mean, Honda can build a whole car and it runs well for years. In situations like this, I can't help but wonder why companies don't just use their own product. If they try it at home, they'd know the filter doesn't quite fit and the indicator doesn't indicate a thing. They'd see the condensation build up. Car-makers don't just throw a car together and hope for the best. They test it.

"(UPDATE:  These pills & the bottle smell like bug spray. I mean, they smell like an actual can of bug spray. I get the smell of bug spray whenever I put these in my mouth. I know. Sounds crazy. Doesn't happen with anything else I take, yet it happens every time I take one of these pills. I can only imagine what that means. For the record, Garden of Life does make organic probiotics. It's not my house or my fingers or my breath, because it only happens when I take this supplement... and I get that smell/taste every single time. I first thought it was my imagination or just some other lingering odor from elsewhere. Several pills and weeks later, it's still like a can of Raid. So, I stopped taking these pills. This is kind of serious, but I'm hoping my bottle is the exception to the rule)Before you buy those popular Pearls probiotics, have a look at the strains & colony forming units. With 15 strains per capsule, 50 billion CFUs per capsule and 30 pills per bottle, the going price is a steal. You can surely find cheaper options, but you won't find them of the same quality or potency.Garden of Life makes superior supplements. I've used them many times. This product is no exception. Unlike probiotics of yore, these are constructed in such a way to resist normal temperatures which makes them easy to travel with.Probiotics restore beneficial bacteria killed off by antibiotics (pesticides, GMOs, who know what else?). Even if you haven't taken antibiotics directly, our meats in the US are chock full of antibiotics fed to the animals. So, if you eat meat, you're constantly killing some of your gut flora bacteria. The higher the CFU and strains, the more likely you are to replenish what you've lost.As for the benefits of probiotics in general, they depend on how your digestion issue manifests itself. Some folks have gas. Some have acid reflux. Some may have bone or teeth issues because they're unable to digest & absorb a specific nutrient. What you suffer from depends on which of the billions of bacteria you are missing. In my case, after taking probiotics, my skin becomes extremely smooth which suggests that it improves my liver... or is it kidneys? One of the two. This is something I've noticed after using probiotics many times. Interestingly enough, drinking fresh lemon water three times a day has the same effect. Probiotics may also reduce allergic reactions to foods because you now have the proper bacteria to digest it. For my father, that means he has a lot less mucus after eating wheat when lays down.As Once Daily doesn't need refrigeration, it is easy to travel with. The strains and CFUs make it quite potent. The price is reasonable. For these reasons, I love and recommend Garden of Life Once Daily Men's Probiotics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR62LKMD32PMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8MP5VA#wasThisHelpful","RR62LKMD32PMD","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hot damn! This is one helluva bag. I won't bother to parrot what's abundantly clear, but I will make a suggestion.(UPDATE: Of course a bag this size does not qualify as carry-on. However, if you wish to carry-on 70-ish liters, you might consider buying a 40-45 liter backpack (Osprey Farpoint 40, Tortuga, Pacsafe, Kelty). Most airlines allow for one personal item. I used my 22 liters laptop bag and strapped it onto my front. I was able to pack 67 liters as carry on. ...or you can buy this 70-liter back, bring pretty much the same amount of stuff, but find yourself waiting in baggage claim or paying fees for checked luggage. Another option is to buy Outlander's 30 liters packable daypack. )Just after I ordered this bag, I did a trial run to see how much I could get into a carry-on sized bag. (Shoes, sandals, 3 pants, shorts, 4 tops, jacket, underwear, laptop, toiletries, even my hair clippers)Guess what? Everything I needed fit into a carry-on sized bag.I'm not one of those obnoxious, ""I traveled throughout Asia for 90 years with only a 5 liter backpack"" types but, unless you need to carry large pieces of equipment for work or you're traveling with kids, it might behoove you to pack a lot less into a smaller bag for more than bragging rights. Here's why...1. Save money on baggage check. Checking bags can cost $50 each way. (to put that in perspective, the cost of a flight from Mumbai to Delhi... 2 round trips from Bangkok to Chiang Mai... 2 round trip bus tickets between LA and San Francisco... 5 days in a decent cheap motel in Thailand or India.)  If you're hopping about the globe, then you could easily save $200.2. Save time at airport. Baggage claim can add an hour onto your travel on each end. The two hours you spend waiting could be spent on a round trip flight from LA to San Francisco.3. Your carry-on is a lot less likely to get lost or damaged, or be picked through.4. Even if you're on the road for a year, you really don't need an outfit for every day of the week.5. Less weight to carry around is never a bad thing. You can always carry a foldable daypack for side trips at your destination.(for foldable daypack, search for ""Outlander Packable Handy Lightweight Travel Backpack Daypack+Lifetime Warranty"")What's more is that you can still get Osprey quality, warranty and beauty if you opt for the carry-on-sized Osprey Farpoint 40.As much as I love the looks, quality and function of this bag, it's just too big. That's not a bad thing, however. It's just not for me. I'm guessing that if you're a frequent traveler who purchases this bag, you may come to this realization on your own eventually.... after paying for baggage claim.. waiting in baggage claim... damage or theft to your checked bag... the extra bulk.The only strike is that there's no excuse for a modern-day bag not to have hip pockets for easy access to passport, money, keys, lip balm, mobile phones. It should be standard these days, really. That said, the hip belt is so strong & the suspension so finely-tuned that it's responsible for most of the bag's weight being transferred to your waist instead of shoulders. Well done. It almost improves your posture.If you're sold on Osprey for its looks, lifetime warranty and truly superior suspension, consider the Farpoint 40. (There is a Farpoint 55 but, even without the 15oz daypack, the frame of the 55 is too big for carry on.) However, if you want an additional 4 liters of space, but still a quality carry-on bag, try the Tortuga backpack. It carries 1 gallon more of stuff; it has substantial hip pockets for easy access to keys, passports, money & phone; it has larger, more accessible side pockets which aren't cut-off by compression straps (as the Osprey 40's is). Tortuga is very well made and its focus a little more on travelers than backpackers. They don't really advertise, so it has sort of a cult following amongst digital nomads. Tortuga is a purely functional bag, though.  That is to say, she ain't pretty.If you need or simply want more of the comforts of home with you, or if you need to carry lots of equipment, then you surely can't go wrong with this pack. Pacsafe makes a 65 liter pack, but it has no detachable daypack. I still need some things with me when I'm onboard an aircraft, so I'd end up carrying a second back if I used the Pacsafe. I prefer Osrprey's built-in daypack with bottle holders. The Farpoint 70 is the only large bag I would consider. Osprey should really include hip pockets on all packs, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TU5SLMPC2HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GC11UC#wasThisHelpful","R31TU5SLMPC2HJ","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted as much space as possible w/o having to check my bags. I wanted quality and versatility. I wanted a good suspension that places the weight on my waist, not my shoulders. Along came the Farpoint 40. I fell in love with this bag... then I found another option.Some folks say a 40oz bag is only good for a few weeks. Truth be told, it's good for a year+. You really don't need an outfit for every day of the week. Unless you need to carry around lots of equipment for work or you need to keep items for children, you're better off keeping it simple & carrying less for a number of reasons.Checking baggage can cost $50 each way. (That will pay for a side trip somewhere.) Checked baggage is more likely to get lost. Checked baggage is more likely to get damaged. Checked baggage can add an hour to your travel time. (An hour that could've been used taking a side trip.)You really can get by with a full-size carry-on. Don't believe me? Do a trial run for yourself. Try packing one of those roll-along, squared, wheeled carry-on bags that's in your closet. If you roll your items tightly (and/or use packing cubes) & avoid all of those ""just in cases,"" you'll find that 40 is sufficient. Most folks find that they really don't need that spare suit or ballroom dress. You don't really need those boots or four pair of shoes. In the event you need something particular on the road, buy it then.So, why the 40 over the 55? Some folks think that, if they simply remove the 15L daypack from the 55 bag, it will be carry-on-worthy like the 40. That is not true. The very frame of the 55 is too large for carry on.Daypacks do come in handy, when you want to make a side trip to the beach. If this sounds like you, there are well-rated,  *foldable* daypacks to be had on Amazon for $20, some of them with up to 30 liters of space. When you don't need it, you can fold it and pack it or push it into one of the mesh pockets or put it under the compression strap, so it won't take up more space.As well-made, versatile and handsome as the Farpoint 40 is, sometimes you pick up an extra item along the way and need just a little more space, but you still want the bag to fit as a carry on. Sometimes you wish you had hip pockets for easy access to your keys, passports, money, cards and mobile phone. Sometimes you wish you had easy-to-reach side pockets that aren't cut-off by compression straps.If this is you, you might consider the Tortuga backpack. It's squared-off corners provide 4 more liters (1 gallon) of additional space within the dimensions of a carry-on. The 2 hip pockets are convenient and generous. The side pockets are easier to reach. Tortuga does not advertise. It's sort of an ""insider's"" bag with some digital nomads. (Features and convenience niche.)Minaal also makes a carry on backpack, but it has only 35 liters of space. Great for absolute minimalists, or those who simply don't need 40+ liters of space. The nail in the coffin for me is that Minaal doesn't offer a good waist belt, so the bulk of the pack's weight rests on your shoulders. Packs with good waist belts transfer more of the weight to your hips. Minaal is the most conservative-looking bag and comes with briefcase-like pockets which makes it great for business use. (Minimalist niche & professional niche.)Pacsafe offers a 45 liter carry-on backpack as well. It's also bigger than Farpoint 40, but it doesn't have the convenient hip pockets that the Tortuga has. It does, however, offer a wire mesh made into the bag to prevent slashing and tearing, as well as a steel locking cord, RFID blocker & many other safety features. (Security niche.)Kelty offers the Redwing 44. (They also have a 50 which doesn't quite meet carry-on dimensions, but I've seen them on a number of flights.) The suspension system is excellent & probably better suited to those who wear their packs for longer periods. It can accommodate a water bladder as well. However, There is no built-in cover for the suspension. Should you need to put the bag below on a bus, the zippers are not lockable. There are no hip pockets either. It's more affordable than the others and it better suited to longer treks. (Affordable & longer treks niche)Although I must disqualify the Minaal for not having a hip belt, you really can't go wrong with the Farpoint 40, Tortuga, Pacsafe or Kelty. They each have their own niche. Osprey is the most well-known of the quality backpacks, so many buy them having never heard of other options. So... here you are.Your call.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRTCBJ1X0HM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006P5Q02Q#wasThisHelpful","RVRTCBJ1X0HM2","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(Update below)PROS1. Most modern Android flagships have 3gb of RAM and quad core processors. The Mate 7 has 2gb of RAM, but comes w/an octacore processor. A processor is not the same as RAM memory, but it does use the RAM differently which seems to level the playing field. I'm a multi-tasker. At any given time, I have at least a spare .7gb of RAM. Plenty for safe, smooth operation, as well a bit of future-proofing.Huawei was smart to keep the screen resolution at 1080p. QuadHD pixels aren't noticeable to the human eye, they take up a lot more battery power & they require more memory to operate. Huawei's choice of 1080p, 8 cores & large battery is a much more efficient combination. Huawei does offer a 3gb version of the AM7, but that model doesn't work with USA LTE frequencies, and costs $800.2. Unlike iPhone, you needn't wake the phone up to activate the fingerprint reader. However, you do have to pick the phone up to do so. Unlike Samsung, you needn't wake phone up, then swipe repeatedly. Simply touch and it awakens. It's very responsive, but takes a couple of tries first thing in the morning, when it's cold. Although you must pick it up, you can program the device to lock only after you click the side button, but to stay unlocked for 30mins when the screen fades to black on its own. You can store two fingerprints profiles. One for you and another, limited-access profile (for example), for someone who needs to make a call.3. AM7 has dual sim slots for two phone numbers. Their profiles can be activated with different fingerprints. So, you can have your personal and business line in one phone. If you travel overseas, you can rent a local sim but still receive and make calls with your home number. However, if you plan to use dual sim regularly, you cannot use a memory card. The memory card resides in a sim slot.4. AM7 will work on AT&T as well as T-Mobile, however, MMS will not work on T-Mobile, unless you're using WiFi. I don't know if it works on AT&T. In the end, this all depends on which LTE band T-Mobile uses in your area and reception at any particular point. This is a GSM device so neither Sprint nor Verizon are supported,but you can take it overseas and swap SIM cards.  It supports LTE frequencies for China, Germany, Spain and many other countries. It supports Cat6 LTE-A which hasn't yet come to the US, but contributes to making the phone future proof.5. This phone has the largest battery in the business. End of story. The Kirin processor isn't as power hungry as the latest two Snapdragon processors running in the competition. LG's new G Flex 2, for example, has the latest Snapdragon processor & 3gb of RAM. It's prone to overheating so it has a mechanism which slows the processor down, rendering the speed irrelevant. (YouTube channel ""PocketNow"" has a video demonstrating this) Huawei's Kirin processor is more efficient. It runs incredibly cool and isn't as taxing on the battery. When you combine that with the largest battery in the business, you're left with a device that lasts two full days. I play videos, shoot HD videos, use widgets, etc... and it still last two full days.... with +/-18% battery remaining when I go to bed. I don't need a car charger or battery pack. I've left home w/ 50% charge and made it to be w/o charging or having to monitor curtail usage. I'm not even slightly exaggerating.6. Speaking of the battery, Mate 7 offers reverse charging. You can actually charge other folks' mobile devices (or your tablet or smartwatch) from the AM7. With a battery twice the size of most, you can surely afford to be so generous. It requires a special cord, though. (Huawei Reverse Charge Cable - $10)7. The camera functions well in low light. The front-facing camera lets in a surprisingly good amount of light in dim situations. Like other Chinese phone, the front-facing camera has ""beauty mode"" which noticeably smooths creases in your skin, makes you yellow, and makes your eyes look alien. (WTF?). In regular mode, it takes flattering selfies as it adjusts very quickly to light and dark subjects8. In The States, you'll be the only one of your friends to have one. It's bigger than the Note and the iPhone 6 Plus, plus it is made of far better materials and has smaller bezels.9. Huawei's Emotion user interface is lighter than Samsung's TouchWiz. There is not much lag or stutter. Because it's an Android, M7 is far more customizable than any iPhone, plus you can have scrolling widgets. I even use an old version of aDownloader which allows me to download movies and current TV shows quickly and for free. iPhone is a Lexus - smooth, silky, slick & high-end. It should be smooth, it's only capable of driving on surface streets. Flagship Androids are like multifunctional Range Rovers - high-end, but a little rougher around the edges because of that capable off-road suspension. They just do so much more, though not always so silky. Tradeoffs. Not so much better or worse. Different philosophies for different types of users.OTHER INFOQuick pics: If the screen has already gone black & you want to take an instant photo w/o waking the phone or swiping a lock screen and then snapping the shot, tap the volume-down key twice and a photo will be taken instantly. That doesn't simply open the camera app. Your second tap actually takes a photo.Screenshots: You can pull the notification bar down, then swipe to shortcuts, or you can press 'power' and volume-down keys simultaneously.CONS1. For the inexperienced user, there are too many built in alerts that might make one paranoid. Alerts of an app using 4mah of battery life (that's minimal & most don't know what that means)... an alert that a power-hungry app is open, even though you have RAM and battery life to spare. It's all about optimizing performance, but it's too obtrusive, scientific & unnecessary. It's like having a car that goes 200mph, but you get a warning at 100mph, then at 110, yet another at 120. Yeah...no. That's one of the first things I (thought I) disabled. That's one thing I like about iPhones. I don't wanna know all of that, just handle it. You have a to be techie to get the most out of an Android. With an iPhone, if something is using up too much memory, iPhone closes it, no fanfare. Androids will either tell you to do it, or slow down & stutter until it finally gives in and does it for you. The thing is, the apps Mate 7 constantly warns you about are far from taxing the phone. Which brings me to my next point.2. If you're new to Android, you'll find it is still a bit of a science project.  For example, my previous device was a Galaxy which comes w/a lot of unwanted bloat apps you can't remove. When I updated my M7, it automatically downloaded all my apps from Google Play.... including the unwanted Samsung/T-Mobile bloat apps. :-/ On top of that, the average person wouldn't have a clue as to how much their Android can truly do. That said, any American who knows about the Mate 7 is not the average smartphone user.3. Another peeve is that WiFi has been known to disconnect after the screen is locked for a while. Knowing Android, there's probably some mislabeled setting (buried so deeply that I'll never be able to find twice) which disables this... or offers a timer... or a time of day that it does this. You get the idea. ***Too much customization on silly stuff.*** Perhaps it's another superfluous, unnecessary power-saving trick. This phone has more power-saving tricks than any phone I've used and yet it has a battery twice the size of most. There are so many settings on high-end Androids that, when you stumble upon a setting to change something you didn't know could be changed, you'll most likely forget how you found it. Textbook Android. Soooo textbook Android.4. Huawei complicates Android further by putting a ""Protected Apps"" function. This doesn't hide or lock apps. It ""protects"" apps from being closed when the screen goes off. To monitor what runs in the background is one thing, but ""when the screen is off"" is a bit vague.  It's hard to know what should and should not be open. It indicates that a vital Google Android app uses too much power and should be disallowed. That Google app runs Android operating system! Note to Huawei: Android is convoluted enough w/o poorly worded,obtrusive monitoring apps. An alert told me WhatsApp was using too much power & to close it, so I did so. I didn't know it would prevent the app from alerting me. But there's also a ""Notification Manager"" which is apparently overridden by Protected Apps. Then there's a ""Dropzone"". WTF?  The way Protected Apps is executed doesn't work as a monitor of background apps because it disables the app's functionality. Background apps aren't a function of a screen being on or off. Stopping an app should not disable alerts. Notification manager clashes w/ Protected. To this day I don't usually get my WhatsApp messages. An absolute unnecessary mess. I really hate this because this something Huawei added to this phone. It was on purpose.  I just want my phone to manage power and apps. I don't want to have to take a class or do research. Folks who are used to iPhones might think twice. As one who has used Android since 2011, I despise this feature. It's important enough to give me a few regrets.5. The earbuds that come with the M7 are for the birds. Too big for my ears, hard, poor sound.  Everything else is so tactile and high-end. I threw mine in the trash.6. As this a Chinese phone, the unit is shipped with a plug converter for American consumers. Unfortunately, the prongs are too small for American outlets, so I find myself pushing a chair against the charger so it stays in the wall. Adapters are not some strange, rare thing. This isn't acceptable for a flagship phone.7. Samsung's 2013 Galaxy just got Lollipop. As of March 2015, Huawei has said nothing of Lollipop or it's coming for AM7. That's not acceptable for a flagship device that was released only months ago.One more thing, if you're looking to root the M7, Huawei doesn't offer an unlock for the bootloader. There are a couple of bogus videos out there that say otherwise, though. Fortunately, Huawei doesn't load the M7 with as much bloat as *some* companies. As you're not buying this from a carrier, you won't have additional T-Mobile or AT&T bloat, but there's still some. I don't know why they must have any. iPhones don't.LET'S WRAP THIS UPIn summary, what makes the Ascend Mate 7 great and so unique is... 6"" screen... well-executed fingerprint scanner... gargantuan battery that charges other batteries... optimized processor and user interface... dual SIM... 8 core processor... tiny bezels & high-quality metal body... Cat 6 LTE-A... unlocked to be used by multiple carriers... you'll be the only one of your friends to have one.I've read complaints that it's too big. It's a frickin phablet, for crying out loud. Would you buy a sedan then complain that it has too many doors? Why would you buy a sports car, then say that it's too fast?AM7 is a well-spec'd device for a seasoned Android user. However, the incessant, confusing warnings of RAM and battery usage, along with misleading ""protected apps"" could make this phone a paranoid nightmare for someone who is new to Android. It would seem to require more babysitting that it truly needs. Huawei manages to make Android more confusing by making these alerts the default. Not to mention constant update messages for theme pictures you don't even use. Twice a week, I get alerts (that I cannot turn off) about picture updates for themes. For the sake of Android newbies, and even my annoyance, I'm going to have take back a star & leave the Ascend Mate 7 with 4 stars... a generous 4 stars, mind you.In the end, I compared the OnePlus One, Note 4, LG G3 & even the iPhone 6 Plus. I settled on the Huawei Ascend Mate 7, not because it's perfect, not simply because it's the best value, but because it's the best combination of features & efficient engineering... along with some imperfections that one could easily find by spending time w/any other device. The Mate 7 seems to be the best overall package for me, even down to the meticulous packaging & attention to detail. From software to hardware, it's really a quality device. If this will be your first Android, however, I'd steer you in another direction without question.UPDATE - Late May 2015I've used smartphones since Symbian of 2003. I've used Android since 2011. I've had this phone for nearly 3 months now. Between the Notification Manager, Protected Apps, Drop Zones, constant intrusive alerts about picture updates for themes, constant alerts about apps that are barely using any power, constant alerts about system apps that are supposed to be running - I'm finding the AM7 annoying and undependable. Protected Apps disables notifications... even though there is a separate Notification Manager. Notification manager gives options to Allow or Notify which makes little sense. If you try to swipe away certain types of notifications w/o reading or listening to them, AM7 will ""cause exception to the application sending it"" and you will no longer get any alerts from that app. So, you have to read every message from certain apps to remove it from notification bar. You can't just swipe them away for later w/o the phone telling that app to never alert you again, but this is Android so defaults don't always stick anyhow. For the life of me, how did this make sense to any engineer? ....""Drop zones"" What the hell is that? I'm tired of having to do so much research & study for Androids.  .... I still get warnings of apps using minimal energy and RAM even when I'm not multitasking & there's RAM to spare. ....Like many Androids, the calendar alarm only rings once, briefly. If you miss it, you miss your appointment reminder. Eventually I aligned it with Google Now, but defaults don't dependably stick (with most Androids I've owned).  All of the defaults I choose for gallery and browser disappear when I restart the device. This was the same for all of my Androids. What else? Like every Android I've ever owned, album artwork for my music is completely worthless. The call log, doesn't indicate if the logged number was ingoing or outgoing.  I mean, the list goes on and on. I configured a guest profile, using a second fingerprint. I chose to lock certain widgets. I tried it out & it worked. When I signed back on as owner, the widgets were gone. I had to re-customize and sign in again. I lost all of the pending information on my sticky note widget.  Almost done. ...The phone has no app drawer/tray. So, your homescreens will be crowded with countless folders. Either that, or you'll have need 5 screens to accommodate them, and AM7's homescreens don't loop. So, I had to download a launcher just to reduce the number of & clean up my homescreens. So much work and research. Not user-friendly. Not intuitive.I'll put up with quirks for customization, but this is a bit much. I need dependability and consistency - the basics - over tricks and dual sim cards and style. If all you've ever had is Androids, then you have nothing to compare. You've no idea how much more consistent, ""common-sensical"" an OS & phone can run.As much as I like about this device, I do regret buying it and would not recommend it, even to a seasoned Android user. Too much work and research and inconsistencies. It is, w/o question, the most annoying phone I've ever had, and I'm used to Android quirks. I've been using smartphones since the Nokia's original 6600 in 2004 & their N-Series in 2007. Way too many alerts. Way too much babysitting. Way too many inconsistencies. ......***Way too many convoluted (contradicting, overlapping, superfluous) settings.*** It is a parody of Android stereotypes.As you can see, I've gone from liking it a lot, to really disliking this phone. If it wasn't for the specs and build, I would give it 2 stars. My review is based on actual usage, not initial impressions. It's based on having experience with other Android devices, as well as iPhones & Nokias. My review is not based on a list of specs, some YouTube review or ""wanting my phone to be the best,"" as i suspect many are. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and have been as discerning as I can be. It's an insult to not give a flagship phone, from only months ago, the latest Android Lollipop. It's already behind the curve.The stats, performance and build are indeed supreme in every way. It's a really elegant, tasteful device. It feels *far* more expensive than the Note 4 & the iPhone 6 Plus. This is the first Android device I've used where an app has (literally) *never* crashed... not once. The phone has never locked-up or froze... not once. (Must be those 8 cores.) Unlike the more popular Snapdragon processors, Huawei's Kirin never gets hot. The 8 cores & Kirin processor are very efficient. The phone doesn't need all of the managements built into it. The Ascend Mate 7 is truly smooth & fluid in it's operation, without even a single hiccup. If only Huawei could've just left it alone and stopped trying to do so much. The last thing Android needs is more complications and settings.After all is said & done, I do not recommend this phone to anyone","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIVZT620G0CH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQZMKNY#wasThisHelpful","RIVZT620G0CH7","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know. It's a cardinal sin not to like Converse All Stars. I just don't like the ubiquitous, ""bubble gums,"" but I wanted a sneaker I could wear everything from shorts to casual, sporty, summer suits. I didn't want some bright shiny neon thing, but I didn't want something as low key as Ralph Lauren Polo canvas shoes either.Enter Adidas Samba Classics. A timeless, versatile shoe, without the hipster or preppy connotations of Chucks or Ralphs. Unlike the 'updated' Samba Originals, the Classics don't squeak.My only complaint is the arch support. It is huge. I have a mild arch and it's just too much. The shoe is so narrow and arch so prominent that I feel bound, even when I tried a larger size. If you need/want humongous arch support, you should know that the only reason I deducted a star is because of it. Arch supports are fine, but I don't need to walk on Annapurna, for Christ's sake.Other than that, these shoes are a winner. I'm going to need a pair in white. ...I can just feel it.

"This is a budget vacuum. Even at that, the price is too high. Even budget vacuums have hepa filters these days.The best part of the vacuum is the telescopic wand. It's the only piece that feels well-made.After puting everything together, I began vacuuming, only to have the thing cut off/on on its own. So, I checked the plug, the brushes, the fit of the canister, the angle with which I held the handle. It seems to have a mind of its own. At one point, I just stood there, holding the handle & listened to it turn on and off at random. I then plugged my old vacuum in the same outlet. Had no problems. Tried it again a few days later, and it seems to stay on. Let's hope it doesn't change its mind again.The canister is tiny, so you'll be emptying it often. When you have a bagless vacuum, the minute you go to empty it, all of the crap your vacuum sucked up is released into the air anyhow. Eureka suggests you ""shake the dust"" from a foam filter (What's the point of having a filter?), then rinse filter, screen and canister. By the time you're done shaking dust, everything that filter filtered is now on you, in your hair or in your lungs. What's the point of having a filter if you're just gonna handle and inhale it later?The build is very flimsy (even the handle). The tools routinely fall off. Fresh out of the box, the vacuum stuttered a few times. The canister is too small. I'm not about to shake a filter & have all that it filtered released into the air. A vacuum priced at $200 should have a hepa filter.For the same price, you can get a Bissell Healthy Home with a better build quality, bigger canister & a hepa filter.'Tis a good thing they reduced the price from $200 to $140. Of course that just tells you how grossly overpriced this machine was. Don't you hate it when companies knowingly overprice a cheap device? Another strike.I'd give it one star, but it does pick up dirt (when it finally decides to stay on). The telescopic wand is very well made. It's lightweight. ...but it's still certainly below average. So, two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NIC34T7E06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXB4XRW#wasThisHelpful","R34NIC34T7E06","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We brush, floss, have modern dentistry, eat organic foods... and our teeth still don't looks as good as fossils or as good as folks living in tribes.

"I've been using the Ambit2 for a month. My partner got his Garmin Fenix 2 a few weeks prior. Here are some differences.If you want a shorthand comparison, Garmin's Fenix 2 is like a high-end Android. Suunto's Ambit2 is like an iPhone. This pretty much sums up the differences, but read on for specifics.The Garmin has more features than the Suunto - vibrating alerts, receives text messages, virtual partner, edit profiles on device, connects to Android & iPhone. Unfortunately, Fenix 2 doesn't have the best software. The system can be glitchy and unstable. The user interface is not very responsive, has a bit of a lag.The Suunto has fewer features than the Garmin, but what it does, it does really well. It's very well-executed. The screen responds instantly. The GPS locks on notably faster than the Garmin every time. In place of Virtual Partner, vibrates & text messages, Suunto has quality upgrades like frequent updates, 10-second & 1-minute GPS pings which saves battery life. It's also waterproofed to 100m (Garmin is 50m). You can download apps. So, you never know what your Ambit2 might be able to do down the road.If you want a lot of tricks & customization, the Garmin will deliver. If music is important to you, Fenix 2's vibrating alerts make it your guy. ...but at the expense of reliability and a stable platform. You never know when these features will or will not be working properly. Fenix is sort of like an Android phone - lots of tricks, but not very consistent. We thought this dependability problem might just be a lemon issue, but we've since read similar complaints about Fenix 2. **To be fair, Fenix 2 does work most of the time.** Really, it's not a bad watch. I'm no fanboy. (I wish I did have vibrating alerts & Bluetooth.) It's just temperamental, unpredictable & the UI lags a bit.If you want a very capable, versatile, quality device that is always up-to-date and can grow with apps, with a dependable & well-executed user interface, then go with the Suunto.  However, the Ambit2 will have you tied to your computer and WiFi to edit profiles. It will not connect to your Android or iPhone because it doesn't use Bluetooth. You can't listen to music because there's no vibrating alert. Real issues to consider.They both have their pluses & minuses. 'The best' depends on your taste. I chose Ambit2 because there's nothing worse than running 20 miles or so, only to have your watch stop working or lose your info, even if that only happens twice a month or so. What good are bells & whistles if the basic functions of the unit are unpredictable? I'm also quite fond of the frequent updates and downloadable apps for the Suunto. It keeps the device relevant and future-proof.There's a bit of snob appeal, too. Suunto is sort of the Vitamix to the Garmin's Blendtec... The Audi to Garmin's BMW... The Osprey to Garmin's North Face. ;-)If you're considering either of these two devices, keep in mind that Polar has just released the V800. Pretty awesome stats, so you might wish to compare the three before making your purchase.In the end, Ambit2 does a lot, does it well & is always up-to-date. I just feels more 'professional'. It's the best overall package for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUVGMCUH7DA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3REX7E#wasThisHelpful","R1EUVGMCUH7DA1","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally, a printer with only 2 cartridges to buy.. and the cartridges are big enough to last. In this day in age, that's 4 stars right there.Printing from mobile devices or from out-of-town isn't as easy to set up or as well-executed as Espson's system. The apps and system for printing from a mobile just aren't up to par.Once you install new ink, there are too many unnecessary options: Nozzle check, cleaning, deep cleaning, head align, roller cleaning, bottom cleaning. WTF? My old printer lasted for ages & didn't have all of these superfluous, needless, confusing settings. Note to Canon: Visit Apple in Silicon Valley. They have a lot to teach you about the value of simplicity.Neither of these gripes are major deals. The printer is quick, quiet, dependable. I don't get harassed with a million updates or spam. The ink lasts forever (Be careful with refilled cartridges because these cartridges have microchips that tell the printer when ink is low. Refilled cartridges will still send a signal of low ink, so you'll have to press & hold 'start' for 5 seconds to print).I'm very happy with this machine.UPDATE: So, I changed my ink. There are a million setting for aligning, cleaning, etc. Even after changing settings between 'normal,' 'scaled,' & borderless, I cannot get this printer to honor a bottom margin. It prints right to the bottom of the page, no matter the setting. It even splits photos and text. This pretty much renders the machine useless for business use, and even non-business as photos are split on two pages.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19K0823BRK3QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HM0IV4S#wasThisHelpful","R19K0823BRK3QF","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Deodorant: Instead of rubbing God-knows-what chemicals under my arms everyday, I use this simple compound.Toothpaste: Instead of rubbing fluoride and God-knows-what chemicals into my gums, I use this simple, alkaline product. Read your toothpaste label. I'll bet it suggests you only use the product for a limited time. So, you change to a different toothpaste, right? Well, that one has the same harmful ingredient.Body wash: You got it. I mix baking soda w/glycerine & sometimes egg (for delivery). The slight abrasiveness exfoliates. It also deodorizes. No drying lauryls or suds. My skin doesn't need lotion when I'm done because it wasn't stripped. It was cleaned. Sometimes I do apply coconut oil, though.Mouthwash: Seeing as bad breath comes mostly from within, gargling w/mouthwash won't alleviate most bad breath. So, before I go on a date, I put a teaspoon in hot water and drink it down.Laundry: You bet. It's cheaper. It gets out stainsCleaning: Toilets, sinks, rugs, cement, etc. Mix it with water and spray on sofas to freshen them up.At the end of the day, most of us smell like toothpaste chemicals, soap chemicals, lotion chemicals, shampoo chemicals, detergent chemicals, deodorant chemicals. The skin absorbs what we put on it. That's how patches work. Take inventory of all of these chemicals in all of these products you use daily. That's what you're putting in your body daily.... then wondering why you have this ailment or migraines or some other unexplained condition.Instead of absorbing 100 chemicals into my body every day... Instead of spending all of this money on separate cleaners for this that & the other.... Instead of smelling like roses and mint and musk and summer breeze all rolled up together - I smell like a clean human. I smell fresh, not like some manufactured scent from a factory.My point? Well, if you haven't figured it out, I like to keep it clean, simple & healthy. You don't need most of the individual products you waste so much money on. You're simply paying to fill your body with harmful chemicals that have no business on our skin.Baking soda is one of the most versatile & useful products and it's incredibly affordable and healthy to use. Arm & Hammer is a trusted brand and, if you used baking soda like I do, 5 & 10 pound bags are the way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJPYN5GRH6P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNSJSX2#wasThisHelpful","RTJPYN5GRH6P4","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"$24 and the first two ingredients are sugars? This is *mostly* sugar. More on that later.D3 helps our bodies absorb calcium. Many of us aren't getting enough sun.

"I've been lifting weights since 1994. I've had the occasional shoulder joint pain that would go away. A few months ago I pulled, twisted, or otherwise injured my shoulder yet again. This time, the pain refused to dissipate. It had set-up camp and was in for the long run. I couldn't even sleep on my elbow in bed.So, I enlisted the help of GC. Within a week, the pain had gone.My only complaint is that I wish there was a concentrated supplement so I wouldn't have to take 4 large pills daily.I only hope that the pain stays away & I don't have to keep taking these.In the end, it's a great supplement that works... if you don't mind taking 4 pills per day.

"It's a multivitamin and, like most, it's hard to tell if it's doing anything. The thing about multivitamins is they rarely use the most bioavailable forms of the vitamins they use. For example, you can buy a calcium orotate, magnesium citrate or D3 supplement, but most multivitamins, Vita-Mini included, don't use these bioavailable types of vitamins/minerals.As multivitamins go, Vita-Mini is... okay. Two issues, though. It's not the most potent supplement by a long shot. A bigger issue is the soy. Why must *everything* in the American diet contain GMO soy or corn... even our health foods & supplements? ""Let's add some unnecessary GMOs for (God knows what real reasons).

"This potent & reasonably-priced product is delivered in oil. D3 is best absorbed in fat, so, in one way, this is a good thing. The downside is that, instead of using organic olive oil as some other brands do, Vita-Mini uses soybean oil & corn oil, some of the most genetically-modified and pesticide-laden oils there are. It also has other unnecessary additives like coloring.If you're D-deficient, you'll need to take D3, not D. You'll also need 50,000-70,000 IU per week for 8 weeks (look it up). If you're overweight, have diabetes or take meds which deplete your D, you should take the larger dosage. This high dosage is great for those who are deficient and it's also convenient for those who are simply trying to sustain and don't want to have to take it daily.I've seen improvements in my health. It's reasonably priced. It's delivered in oil. However, there are other similarly-priced options that use organic olive oil & have no coloring additives, so I'll have to give this supplement 4 stars for charging that same whist using cheaper, unhealthy oils.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106RVOS51K7AY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECBTEQ4#wasThisHelpful","R106RVOS51K7AY","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"D3 is best absorbed in oil. Not only does Nutrigold use oil, it uses organic olive oil. Many other supplements use GMO corn or soybean oil, if they use oil at all. So, for absorption & overall health, this is a supreme supplement.Nutrigold offers a 1,000 IU supplement which is great for maintenance. For those with a serious vitamin deficiency, you need to take 50,000 - 70,000 IU per week, for 8 weeks. 70,000 is for the overweight, diabetic or those whose D is lowered from meds. Herein lies the reason for the range in potency of D3. The 1000 IU dosage is excellent for maintenance for those who don't get much sun.I was taking a drug that is known to tax D supply in the body. Most folks are okay, but I don't get much sun either, so I started to have bone issues. Not good for a runner. Now, I'm able to take the drug w/o any issues at all. I've also witnessed an improvement in my dental health.Other than that, the pills are tiny and easy to swallow. The average person will need no more than 7,000 IU per weeks, so this is more than a year's supply of top-quality D3, even if you take 50,000 IU per week for two monthsNutrigold is just a good, quality D3. I appreciate that it's delivered in oil and they made the effort to put it in organic olive oil. Health products should be healthy, not surrounded in GMO soybean and corn oil. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UG2AUBV19VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N8TTBQ#wasThisHelpful","R18UG2AUBV19VN","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a quality product - attention to detail, well padded, spacious & versatile... with a small footprint.Unlike offerings from Targus or Swiss Gear, the Case Logic has padding & insulation more akin to what you'd find on an Osprey backpack. Everything from the shoulder straps to the back which allows for a bit of air flow between your back and the pack.If I need to tow a change of clothes for the day or overnight, I don't want to have to lug two bags just to have my laptop. This bag will fit my laptop and even a change of clothes & shoes. I've used it on day trips, hiking, overnighters.There's a safety pouch on the back where you can stow valuables like your passport, instead of carrying them in an outer pocket.The two zipping pockets on the side also have a mesh catch so you can stow your water bottles within easy reach, or zip up items you need easy access to. They thought of everything.There's a large, sturdy loop at the bottom of the bag for jackets or wet gear....and of course the pockets. So many pockets of differing sizes. Easy access, hidden, expandable.Like any other computer bag, it holds your laptop. However, Case Logic added design elements that make this a wonderful bag for overnight trips, day trips or hiking - the extra padding, zipping water bottle side pockets, space provided between your back and the bag, external loop, variety & flexibility of pockets and the light weight.You get a lot flexibility, quality & space for your money, in a small footprint.

"My initial review was singing the praises of this features-packed, reasonably-priced device. It delivered on it's promise... for a while.After using the watch only four times, it fails to charge. It discharges very quickly in the first place. Just sitting on my desk, GPS off, it lasts only one week. Whilst out of town, I let the watch completely discharge. The screen was completely off. Upon plugging in the charger, I received, ""Built in Self Test... Charger Fail!""Seriously? I've had 2 Garmins, a Runtastic, a Motorola and a Polar. I've never had an issue like this, particularly after only 3 months.  In spite of being totally discharged, when I unplug it, the screen still reads, ""Charger Fail!"" just to spite me.If you read other reviews, or simply search, ""Times Run Trainer 2 charger fail,"" you'll find this is a common issue.You can put exotic woods, leather, diamonds & pearls on a Ford Pinto... it's still a Ford Pinto. If a Rolls Royce lasts only 3 months, it's cheap piece of junk. This... is a cheap piece of junk.I even contacted customer service. The info & file they gave me just reset the phone, but didn't provide the firmware update I needed to keep this from happening again.It's a Timex, for crying out loud. If Garmin, Polar & Runtastic can make reliable watches, wouldn't you think Timex would have it down by now?Conclusion: Great for those who only wish to work-out for 3 months.

"Though very touching and nicely photographed, this kid is no different than the *millions* of other kids who grew up tribally & went on to pursue school in The West. There are millions of tribal kids who grow up communicating with animals just as their parents and parents' parents did. She's not special. Her story is not unique.All of those photos of her with tribal *men* beg the question, ""Weren't those men once *boys*  in Namibia?"" Don't these men have their own kids who do the same? Of course they do.Sorry. Being white doesn't make her story any more special than that of the countless black tribal Africans who left their tribes & sought schooling in The West. It's neither groundbreaking nor any more ""sweet"".Furthermore, I'm not aware of many Bushmen who grew up with bottles, diapers, jellies & sneakers. For a girl who grew up so raw in ""The Bush,"" she seems to have many Western trappings. A quick Google search will yield doubts about the authenticity of this story. 'Hoax' & 'Fake' come up right after her last name. The photos look like a professional photographer snapped a kid with some curiously tamed animals in posed settings. Wild animals don't pose. How many true Bushmen are professional photographers like her parents?She didn't 'grow up in The Bush,' fetching water from some far away source or lake. She had shoes, running water, a refrigerator & parents with jobs. I doubt her income-producing, French photographer parents were chucking spears at game for dinner, in spite of the posed, misleading photo with true bushmen in loincloths who actually do so. Seems very phony.If you want to see genuine photos of animals with folks who *actually* grew up in 'The Bush,' chucking spears & such, you'll probably get a more accurate photo by Googling it or looking on YouTube. You'll get a more genuine read from someone who is from these generational indigenous cultures, not someone posing with diapers, a spear & a bottle on tamed, posed animals. Her story, if even true, is nothing new.Simply put, this book is about Tippi's whiteness making her special. It somehow suggests that her story is unique or that she has special, unheard of insight & can relate to animals like no other. Tell that to that tribesman whose family has (really) been living that way (for generations) sans the sneakers, bottles, art direction, diapers, bank accounts, jobs, money & shoes. You think she grew up without a refrigerator? Actual Bush men don't have fridges. This is no Bush girl and you all know it.Consider the Editorial Review,... ""A white child, she was born in Namibia"". So, I'm not too far off base in that the book is a 'thing' simply because of her race.If you have a dog named Bella or Molly, drive a Prius/Subaru/Volvo or perhaps the type who says 'peace' all the time, you'll probably want to punish this review or read me the riot act (shored up with, 'Namaste,' of course... always), but race & Western trappings are really the only differences in Tippi and the millions of other children who were (truly) raised in The Bush, not by parents with jobs, incomes, running water, etc.Don't get me wrong, I find the photos touching and beautiful. That's surely reason enough to enjoy the book. It's just that I find the very premise insulting and the story rather questionable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18O3QQ1ZEMNAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=177007029X#wasThisHelpful","R18O3QQ1ZEMNAO","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Instead of parroting what you've probably already gleaned, I'll focus on why/how I use this as a juicer; pricing; organics & Blendtec options. Although I'm a big fan, I try to be discerning & will includes some 'peeves' below.JUICINGAside from making nut butters, ice creams, hot/cold soups, flours & smoothies, the 5200 does a decent job juicing. If you use a base of watery veggies like cucumber or celery and blend half of the pitcher first, they will create enough liquid such that you needn't add much water. To give you an idea, I blended a full pitcher of only kale, adding only 1 1/2c of water. Once strained, the end result was 6 cups of liquid, 4 1/2 of which was pure kale juice.  This will vary depending on the vegetables. So, if you're on the fence as to whether you'll get a juicer or a blender but can't afford both, go w/ Vitamix because you can do both.Once blended, strain the smoothie through a 'nut milk bag' ($9) or an old pillow case/tee-shirt, if you're really pressed for cash; just squeeze it into a large bowl.  An Omega or a Breville juicer might be more ideal, but chances are you'll have a lot more to clean, take up more space & be out an additional $150+. So, if you're concerned with cost, space or ease of cleaning, the 5200 is a good alternative for juicing.""Isn't fiber good for you? What's the point of juicing?"" Although fiber is good for you, the air & fiber in smoothies is quite filling. I can only drink so much at a time. By juicing, I can ingest a greater concentration of minerals & enzymes, instead of so much air & fiber. If you have digestive issues, juicing is a sure way to make sure those nutrients get into your system. I do prefer smoothies for fruits as that fiber regulates the absorption of sugars. This is why I love the Vitamix. I can do juices as well as smoothies, butters, etc. If you look at it this way, the Vitamix is both convenient & affordable...ish.PULPOnce juiced, there's not much nutritional value in pulp fiber, but if you want to stretch your dollar, you can put the flavorless pulp to good use. You can use it as a flour-type base to bake with, make pizza with or throw into a dehydrator to make raw cookies, crackers or crust. I flattened & dried mine, added sesame seeds & spices, then baked them. Made some delicious, healthy crackers for the hummus I made the day before. Tons of recipes online. Try 'liferegenerator' on YouTube.WHY 5200 IN PARTICULAR?Unlike the cheaper 2-speed TurboBlend, the variable-speed 5200 allows me to blend at the exact speed I need for a salsa or hummus, for example. The 5200 has no presets, but I've noticed that the time I blend a smoothie depends on the amount & type of smoothie I'm making. There is no preset time that's best for all smoothies. I prefer to manipulate each dish. Most times you'll only blend for a minute or so, so I doubt you'll have time for laundry in between. Of all the variable-speed Vitamixes, this is the most affordable.COSTThis exact model is available at Costco (not online) for $375. Comes with nice recipe book & DVD. Save your money. Some Costcos only carry the 6300 which costs as much as Amazon's 5200, but comes w/presets. Costco's *online* offerings for the 5200 usually cost more than what is found in stores because they include a second pitcher.The only model I'd consider, other than the 5200, is the Professional 300 (aka Professional 7500, not to be confused with the more expensive 750 w/presets). It runs a bit more quietly, has a shorter carafe, wider blade & wider base so it blends more efficiently and is easier to clean and remove thick contents. If you prefer the next generation Pro 300, Vitamix has the refurbished model on offer w/a 5-year warranty for $399. Go to VM site & click 'Specials'. They only have so many available every month or so. They also have a $330 refurbished, variable speed model w/like warranty. Bottom line, you needn't pay over $400 for a good Vitamix.AFFORDING ORGANICS""May not be organic, but at least I'm ingesting more veggies."" Mmmmm....Yeah-NO. Consider that, if you blend to increase your intake of vitamins, minerals & enzymes, but you're not using organic produce, you'll also be giving yourself direct, concentrated shots of harmful pesticides & other genetically modified material. Spinach is one of the more popular green juice/smoothie ingredients. Spinach, along w/ celery & apple, is some of the most sprayed & treated produce if not organic. (Do a Google image search for: dirty dozen organic). Pesticides are known to cause a host of neurological diseases, like Parkinson's... which my dad had.Don't fret. You don't have to break the bank as there are many options for organic produce than overpriced, gourmet Whole Foods, or those three items at your local store. Check local farmer's markets, warehouses, co-ops. Some online stores will deliver. I just got a 10lb bag of organic carrots for $5 & about 12 organic apples for $8 at Costco. If you're in So Cal, 'Better Life Organics' is a great place for a huge variety of goodies. Google 'organics' for your area. Don't be discouraged by the high prices and little variety at your local market. Of course, you can always start growing your own.BLENDTECThe shorter, wider carafe & wider blade create a better vortex to suck down ingredients of a full pitcher, particularly the Blendtec with Wildside jar. So, for making a full pitcher of smoothies, you're less likely to need a tamper. However, you simply need a tamper to make nut butters and ice creams. Blendtec doesn't have a tamper, so you must keep stopping, removing lid, stirring, replacing & restarting. Gets real old, real quick. (Search YouTube for ""Blendtec Total Blender vs. Vitamix 5200, Part 3 of 5 - Peanut Butter""). Blendtec does offer a ""Twister Jar,"" but it costs over $100 extra & it still doesn't work as well as the tamper. If you don't make nut butters or ice creams, then you might consider a Blendtec as you can use the same pitcher for dry blending. The 5200 *can* make flours from hard items like popcorn seeds, but VM suggests buying a separate jar to keep the blades sharp. (Blendtec uses blunt blades and more horsepower in regular pitcher whereas Vitamix uses sharper blades that might dull w/lots of hard/dry blending. Blendtecs are a bit louder, but they do fit under most cabinets. Blendtec looks more slick and pretty, w/animations and flat buttons. Vitamix looks more industrial and 'hardcore'. It looks like it means business. Vitamix has been around much longer than Blendtec & lots of raw vegans seem to prefer VM, so there's a bit of snob appeal for some. Make no mistake, you can't go wrong with either.CLOUDY PITCHERYes, you can easily clean your blender with a few drops of soap & switching it on high. However, if you wish to keep your pitcher from turning cloudy, I suggest using a soft sponge on it a couple of times per week. Most importantly, *dry it immediately*. Letting the blender drip-dry will cause clouding. It will also turn the black top grey.PEEVESThe tall, skinny carafe. If I'm blending a full load of a thick smoothie, the vortex created by the narrow jar doesn't always recycle the mixed contents at the top w/o a bit of prodding. Minor annoyance because it will ultimately blend it all if I blend half of the mixture first, then add the other. Here is where the Next Generation Vitamixes and the Blendtec's w/Wildside Jar excel. The wider blades, wider bottoms and shorter profiles recycle a full pitcher more quickly and efficiently. The 5200 will get the job done just fine, though, with a few extra pushes from the tamper stick. On the other hand, if your making nut butters, the narrow pitcher comes in handy.CONCLUSIONIn summary, you don't need a juicer & a blender to have it all. You needn't pony up extra cash for presets. The 5200 does everything you'll need. You needn't pay over $400 when Costco & Vitamix' site have reasonable options. Blendtec simply needs a tamper, costs more & is louder, but creates a better vortex, thanks to the shorter, wider profile carafe. Affordable organics are available if you look hard enough & buy in bulk. If you live alone, consider that my neighbor & I go in on bulk items together. Where there's a will...I've made dishes I've never thought of - Brazil nut milk... dandelion green juice (hardcore)... raw vegan pizza w/my pulp... mango/mint smoothies... coconut/almond yogurt... raw vegan cookies... pistachio ice cream. (Banana or coconut or avocado all work wonderfully for a creamy ice cream base.) All of these recipes take only minutes to make.In the end, the 5200 is the best price/value Vitamix. It will front as a blender & juicer. Vitamix is simply the best all-around blender for most uses, but don't spend over $400 when you don't have to.

"Armed w/a robust mobile app & a new GPS heart rate monitor watch, Runtastic is serving up a well-made, nicely stylized sports band w/ key holder/money slot.My 4.5"" Samsung fits perfectly. I can easily control side keys & volume rocker. Touch response through the plastic screen cover is good.I'm a muscular guy, but not huge & I find the adjustable armband to be too tight, even in its most generous position. When I get to pumping, I feel like I'm having my blood pressure taken. If the band was just an inch longer, Runtastic could rectify the situation & make this a one-size-fits-all like most others are. Unfortunately, you'll have to dole out an additional $6 for a longer armband. That's not acceptable when the competition doesn't require this. Muscular, larger & overweight folks won't get much use out of this which is too bad because I quite like it otherwise.Although the phone is well protected, you might find a bit of moisture has formed on the back of your phone when running longer distances in warmer weather. That seems to be par for the course with these sports bands, to be fair.Some folks seem to expect this product to fit all phones as well as any phone case. That's just ignorant. There are a million different case sizes in addition to the numerous different phone sizes. The tight armband & neoprene covering will surely protect your device, people.Overall, it's a good product, limited by its sizing. It's just not the best for muscular, larger or overweight folks.

"Features-packed & very competitively priced GPS-HRM.If you're new to GPS & heart rate monitors, this is a great pick. Before investing in a $300 unit, I'd suggest this Runtastic. My sister dropped $300+ for a Garmin only to find that she doesn't like the scientific approach to running. She doesn't like concerning herself with numbers, graphs and tracking. She likes to freely run, not analyze graphs or keep checking her stats. You don't need one to train competitively. So, if you're unsure, I can't think of a better GPS-HRM watch than this one. Gives you what you need, but won't break the bank. That said, it's capable for more advanced runners, too.It has more goodies than a similarly-priced Garmin plus it has bike mounting, compass & better warranty. The quality is far superior to anything Polar has ever put out and it can easily front as a daily driver.Good quality & easy to read. The GPS locks quickly and is pretty accurate. The online site is decent. Not as robust as Garmin's offering w/o paying a fee. Not too keen on that, but if your a novice, you probably won't use all the bells & whistles for a while anyhow.Peeves? It only comes w/a USB charger, so you'll need a free or spare USB/plug converter if you're not near your computer. When I plugged it into my computer, there was some unnecessary drama in downloading a driver. I had to Google & search for it. Also, I wish there was a level indicator of charge strength, so I'll know if it's charged enough for a run. Finally, customer service is absolutely horrible. It's non-existant.Although my Garmin 410 has more goodies, I find the Garmin much easier to understand and operate. I thought I could just figure it out on the run, but I had to go home and read a bit before taking the Runtastic out. It's not as intuitive. I still haven't figured out why, after a random time & with no pre-programming, the watch beeps. Everything my Garmin does makes sense to me. Maybe it's just me. Unfortunately, customer service doesn't exist.Once you enroll on their site, your inbox will be BLOWN UP. I don't want a community or penpal. I want a GPS-HRM device. Leave... me... alone, Runtastic. I had to uncheck email options I never checked in the first place so that I wouldn't get 2 emails every day. ..but Runtastic continues to find new reasons to contact me & remind me of its presence.In the end, it's a great piece. I didn't expect such an impressive package for such a reasonable price. I do wish it was more intuitive, or at least it came w/good customer service. Runtastic is way too intrusive with emails. This, alone, has me using my other unit a lot more. ...and really makes me wanna give it 3 stars, but it's a nice, well-priced unit that works well, so a solid *4* for Runtastic's first GPS-HRM offering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46YQS56D0MHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BH5D6K#wasThisHelpful","R46YQS56D0MHN","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes, you just need the exacting flow of a keyboard, but the portability and ease of a tablet.Enter Microsoft's well-designed & features-packed 'Surface'. It's surprisingly easy to use and comes loaded with goodies.Instead of the usual screen of apps & images you'll find on most tablets & computers, Windows 8 is a portal for information. Although not quite as intuitive as Apple's offerings, with live personalized widgets, Windows 8 serves up more goodies and customization than its brethren.The compact keyboard manages to squeeze in a mouse pad & clickers, yet remains quite user-friendly. I had concerns the keyboard would be somewhat of a work around for my large hands. In fact, it's accurate & easy to navigate.Surface packs a snappy quad-core processor, complete Microsoft Office, HD webcam up front, second HD camera on back, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 3.0 port, 16 or 32gb of storage, plus a micro SD card slot. You simply won't find all of this on an iPad.It's relatively lightweight, has a small footprint & the swappable cover/keyboard comes in a rainbow of colors.With the functionality of a laptop & size of a tablet, Surface is the perfect travel companion.

"Unlike many inkjet printers that use 4 ink cartridges, the MX452 still uses the 2-cartridge ink system. The cartridges last much longer. You can have them refilled at Costco. You only need keep up with two.If you're considering a printer that does use 4 cartridges, keep in mind that many of them (like Epson WF2450) will not allow you to print anything if just one of the cartridges is low on ink. With 4 separate cartridges, one of them is almost always low.Although it allows for printing from a mobile device, I was unable to figure out how to do it with my Android. Epson's printers assign your printer an email address that allow you to print from your mobile anywhere in the world. Doesn't have all the bells & whistles, but, at this price, it's a great little printer and one of the best budget printers.This printer is fast for its price point. It's easy to set up & use.

"Truth be told, it's difficult to discern whether or not this product is actually 'facilitating the metabolism of carbs,' or 'transporting fatty acids into energy units' or 'preventing muscle atrophy'. Interestingly enough, all of it's many so-called benefits are not-so easy to gauge. This raises a red flag for me. I don't want to be one of those people taking 20 supplements I can feel nothing from ""just in case"" or because I'm told they do something I cannot notice. Folks will try to make money off of anything. I've felt no discernible results.However, after using this product, I became itchy all over, all day. I looked up *L-Cartinine itching* only to find that itching is a known side effect. Unfortunately, you won't know if you're allergic until you've purchased and partaken. This is not a reflection of Jarrow's supplement, but of L-Cartinine in general.I can't down-rate this product for my allergic reaction to the amino acid. I don't want to give the impression that it's only Jarrow's L-Cartinine that I find has no effect. Taken together, and considering the high price, I can't give it 5 stars either.If you're able to feel some notable difference from these pills *and* you're not allergic, I suppose you'd like them. Jarrow's is probably a good choice as I enjoy some of their other products. Just don't get caught up in every new trend, fad, or 'study' designed to make folks money.

Jarrow's D3 provides cholecalciferol D3 which is far more bio-available than ergocalciferol found in many D3 supplements.

"You'll love this printer for the first few weeks... until you start running out of ink... and you always seem to be running out of ink. Only then will you get it.Contrary to what it may seem, ink for this printer is *not* cheap. It's a racket. There are four ink cartridges you must buy. If Magenta, Cyan or Yellow runs low, the machine will not allow you to print in black (even if black is full). That's right. That black cartridge I just bought is off limits simply because magenta is almost out. It's a racket.With average use, the black cartridge doesn't even last one month. So, it's not as cheap as it seems and it's awfully inconvenient. You're forced to have all cartridges full at all times. In other words, you'll be buying ink every single month, sometimes twice a month. I'm constantly buying ink for this thing & lifting the hood.This printer is too obtrusive for wireless connections. It has more updates and reminds me of its presence more than I care to be reminded. I'm tired of self-important software, apps, etc. I like my printer to shut the hell up until I need it. I don't need it 'updating' every week. I don't wanna be a part of a community.I miss my old HP. I never heard from it unless I was about to use it. The ink cost more, but it lasted for months. When color ran low, I could still print in black. When black ran low, I had the option of printing in blue. When I use this Epson, I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.It's also a very wasteful printer. Print heads/nozzles in Epson printers are embedded in the printer. So if you don't print everyday, the system wastes ink to unclog the nozzles for a normal printout (without white lines). HP printers have empty spaces where cartridges with built in nozzles glide in. Every time these cartridges are replaced, it's like you get a new printer. HP cartridges cost more, but you get a lot more ink in the cartridge, use less ink for maintenance, and get better printouts.Although WF-2540 has some good reviews here, I'm guessing many of those come from folks who have only had it a short time or who rarely print anything.I'm now selling mine on Craigslist & buying an HP laserjet. All-In-One laserjets cost a bit more upfront, but they're more convenient to keep inked, cost less in the long run & are cheaper to operate.I would not purchase this printer. It is a scam.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8H6LLG341FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091UBCAW#wasThisHelpful","R2L8H6LLG341FE","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike North American Herb & Spice, Teliaoils oregano oil is not cut with anything. It's pure. It's the only one I've found that isn't cut with olive oil & is wild. This doesn't mean it's the best for you, however.If you're using this topically (to treat toenail fungus, for example), you can't beat this item for strength. (You really don't need to put anything mixed with olive oil on a fungus anyhow.)If you plan to ingest the oil, do not drop this undiluted product directly in your mouth. It's too strong. You will irritate your mucous membrane. If you put it in a capsule, your tender insides may burn. Your best best it to drop it into a teaspoon (or capsule) with coconut oil, or some other oil it can mix with so as not to irritate your insides. For this reason, it may not be the most convenient oral supplement.However, considering it's pure, wild, high-carvacol oregano oil *and* it's a fraction of the cost of less-potent North American Herb & Spice, it's a *much* better buy & worth the effort. The popular North American costs $34 for a less-potent mixture.As for oregano oil itself, here's my experience. My stomach flora was damaged from a few bouts of antibiotics. I had bloat, yeast overgrowth & sinus/fungal issues. Every review I read swore by oregano oil. So, I did my candida diet, oregano oil and probiotics. After 2 bottles of oregano oil, my stomach will only remain flat as long as I stay on candida diet. My sinus infection didn't change much. I finally dropped the oregano. Only after I bought a high-potency probiotic, did my sinus infection go away (and my vision improve) because I could better absorb nutrients.Sorry to have to say this but I just think oregano oil is ""snake oil."" It didn't do a thing for my fungal issues - sinus or toenail. Starving the fungus through diet & boosting my good bacteria with a decent probiotic (50 billion colony forming units & 12 strains) is proving more effective.If you think oregano oil works, however, Teliaoils has the most potent, affordable oregano oil around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PQA4YG10G8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GJTO9S#wasThisHelpful","R30PQA4YG10G8C","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:51 MinsAfter 4 bouts of antibiotics & nearly a year of horribleness, I've come to learn that nearly everything is connected to my gut. No matter how well I eat, if my digestion is off, my body is off. If too much of your good bacteria has been killed off (from antibiotic pills *or* meat which is stuffed with antibiotics), you might have a tough time fighting off certain ailments (like sinus conditions, rashes). Your digestive system may no longer be able to process nutrients or digest foods properly, so your skin, teeth, bowels, sinuses, mood can all be affected. You can call it IBS, candida, leaky gut, 'periodontal disease' or whatever. Those are all seemingly just the symptoms of poor digestion/absorption of nutrients.I've been all over the map trying figure out my bloated stomach, critical sinus condition & receding gums. Is it 'leaky gut,' candida, not enough good bacteria? Are my eye twitches and toenail fungus connected to this? Docs are clueless. They tried to prescribe more antibiotics for my sinuses & top it all off with Diflucan antifungal medicine. Ignorant.I tried P73 oregano oil. I tried Pearls Probiotics. I tried Candida diet.Only after severe problems did my docs even suggest probiotics to follow-up the antibiotics. ...but no one told me about the different strengths (colony forming units) or strains, so I wasted more time & money on weak probiotics like Pearls.Then along came ProBiota with a potent probiotic formula (50 billion cfu & 12 strains) that, when combined with somewhat of a candida diet, is getting my digestive system back in check. It has also cleared up my 6-month long sinus condition. It's no magic pill, but if you're not digesting vital nutrients, you're body can suffer in a number of ways. Probiota helps set your system right.Considering our meats (in the US) are stuffed with antibiotics, is it any wonder probiotic supplements are suddenly all the rage? Is it any wonder folks are suddenly gluten-intolerant or have unexplainable receding gums (periodontal disease) or can't get rid of 'belly fat'? Antibiotics kill good bacteria preventing your body from properly processing your *fuel,* even if you're taking in 'high octane' fuel. Unless you're a vegetarian or can afford grass-fed organic meats, you should probably be taking at least a low dosage probiotic. ...before your dentist starts telling you that you have periodontal 'disease' & can't tell you how it came about or how to stop it.I take 2 of these pills 2-3 times a day. That's more than the 2 they suggest, but I had serious issues. I've had zero side effects. I no longer look like Humpty Dumpty with muscles. I can breathe out of my nose whilst lying down. Too bad I wasted so much money on a new mattress & high-end air purifier & anemic probiotic brands.It's a process. My sinuses are better (as long as I take probiotics). My digestive system is well on its way. I'll give it 2 months of avoiding yeast, grains, sugars (including fruits) so that I can starve any fungus & thoroughly replenish my good bacteria with probiotics.With the condition of food these days, however, it might be a good idea to do probiotics a couple of times a year anyhow.Two issues, though. This product has 60 pills with 50 billion CFUs at $42. 'Garden of Life' offers a product with 90 pills, 80 billion CFUs per pill & 12 strains for $32.  Seeking Health has this product way over priced.The other issue is the inconsistency in results. I used these 3 times & I can tell the potency is not always the same.  Most good probiotics ship with a cold pack to ensure potency. Seeking Health claims there's doesn't need to be. Probiotics are probiotics. These things aren't hermetically sealed. Considering the inconsistency in results, they might consider it. ProBiota isn't packed in any special way and, at this (over) price, they should offer complimentary cold pack shipping.If you buy Garden of Life Raw Probiotics from iHerb, you will have a stronger supplement, more of it, for cheaper & shipped in a cold pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QPT1P3VYNWHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X5KGQW#wasThisHelpful","R3QPT1P3VYNWHD","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After irresponsible doctors/dentists stuffed me with 4 rounds of antibiotics in less than a year, my stomach flora was crap. Any type of sugar (even fruit) or bread (even gluten-free) turned this runner & fitness nut into Humpty Dumpty. I couldn't comprehend. So, I looked into it, and here I am. Unlike many others, however, ""Nature's Bounty"" hasn't produced any noticeable results whatsoever.Now I know why. ""Nature's Bounty"" offers 2 billion active cultures per pill (or colony forming units/CFU). I've since found products with 10, 30, 50, even 200 billion CFUs. In other words, just two pills of a 30 CFU probiotic pill is the equivalent of THIS ENTIRE BOX.'Bounty' offers 6 different probiotic strains per pill. There are products with 12 different strains (anything over 12 is usually strains of other minerals, not probiotics). This is a weak, incomplete supplement. As I've no idea which strains were killed off, I'd rather cover as many bases as possible. (Ridiculous that modern day meds/docs/food has brought us to this).If you're simply taking these to maintain good flora due to the antibiotics in every day meats, I suppose this may be sufficient. If you have a specific issue, I wouldn't pussyfoot around with this  weak, anemic dosage.""ProBiota 12 Maximum Support"" has 50 billion colony forming units per capsule plus 12 strains of probiotics. That's 25x more potency and twice as many strains of probiotics per capsule. There are 60 pills for $43. ProBiota probiotics also cleared up my chronic sinus issues.If you have serious issues and you only take probiotics, you'll probably find that your issues return if you stop taking them. Why would a money-making business formulate something you can wean yourself off of?If you have an extreme case of bloat, 'leaky gut,' yeast overgrowth or candida, I suggest following a candida diet & shoring your regimen up with P73 oregano oil for a couple of weeks (or up to two months), in order to kill over any fungal overgrowth. The probiotics will only restore the beneficial bacteria, not kill the overgrowth. Prepare for the crappy feeling when the fungus dies-off and exits the body. This is *not* the time to stop what you're doing because it doesn't feel good unless you want to me hooked on probiotics for the rest of your life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLRKOYKG6K16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SZXM4O#wasThisHelpful","R2HLRKOYKG6K16","A14EF1PPKMSEPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EF1PPKMSEPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second Urbane thermos and I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the temperature control properties with the first one and am equally impressed with this one. Whatever you put in it (hot or cold), this thermos does a fantastic job of maintaining temperature. In fact, it's almost *too* good as very hot liquids don't tend to cool down over time. My husband uses one of the two we have and we have had to send a mug to work with him so he can decant his coffee and allow it to cool. Even leaving the top off doesn't cool it down appreciably. If temperature maintenance is your concern, you really can't beat this thermos.The interior has a small strainer with a little handle that you can put in if you want to drink tea while leaving in the leaves. It would also serve to slow down the flow of whatever beverage you're drinking. The only point about this which some may not favor is that it has no push-button drinking ability (like Contigo designs often do). I've been using the push-button design and I would prefer this screw on/off cap type because the push buttons always have problems with leaking or build-up around the mouthpiece as time goes by. This seals perfectly - no leaking risks with this design.The design seems to be a sticking point for some people because it has a cute little saying on it. I lived in Japan for a long time, and the saying just reminds me of being there. It's cute and nonsensical and these types of things were super common there. I take the presence of the saying as a good conversation starter and I rather like it. It gives the otherwise staid black tube design some interest value without being gaudy or ostentatious.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R258Z01FQHNI7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G63YUG#wasThisHelpful","R258Z01FQHNI7P","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second experience with packing cubes/organizers and I am liking them more as time goes by. Part of the reason for this is that I've moved 7 times in 3.5 years and being able to sub-divide what is in my suitcases has shown its value. It is much easier to pack and unpack if you can divide your possessions rather than tossing them all into one cavernous space.This cube is very light, but seems to be pretty strong in terms of the fabric and zippers. It has mesh insets to allow the packed items to breath so there won't be as much of a chance of musty smells if you're packing long-term. The size for the price is the only disappointment. In the picture I've included with the review, you can see the empty interior and the filled size both in comparison to a standard large suitcase (this is the largest most airlines will accept as a checked bag). You can also see how it compares to other packing organizers in terms of size and capacity (the blue things are also luggage organizers). This cube is better than the others that I have because the fabric is sturdier and it has a nice handle on top, but it could be deeper. The size is pretty perfect for underwear, socks, or rolled up dress shirts. In fact, I think it'd do a great job of keeping shirts packed in rolls from wrinkling or unfolding as well as making it simple to keep undergarments (which can be small and get lost in the mix) together for simple packing and unpacking. All in all, this is a pretty good packing cube, but I wish that they were offering two for about 50% more rather than a single one at the current price.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MIE5Y6GGJODL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S7YVB0#wasThisHelpful","R2MIE5Y6GGJODL","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I have no doubt that this is a high quality product that is highly pure and has benefits for specific health issues (particularly magnesium deficiencies and muscle fatigue issues). I found that it helped with achy joint and muscle pain after a day of heavy exertion. I rubbed it on my legs from my knee to my ankle and put it on the bottoms of my feet. My feeling is that this accomplishes some of what a hot bath in Epsom salts will accomplish without the time and effort of taking a bath (though the bath would bring the other effects related to hot water immersion). If you don't have time to deal with an Epsom salts bath and have a diet which may be deficient in Magnesium, I believe this would be an efficient and quick means to supplement Magnesium (which does permeate the skin, though I don't know if ingested vs. absorbed Magnesium operate similarly - there is little research on the effects of things like topical Magnesium preparations because it is not particularly profitable to sell such things).The main issue with this is that, while I do believe it is beneficial, it is not really enjoyable to have it on your skin. It burns/tingles/stings after application because of the salt. The most unpleasant aspect though is that it leaves our skin tacky and sticky throughout the day. I think the oil is actually a good addition to keep your skin from drying out from the salts, but it does have the side effect of leaving your skin feeling sticky.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQMQUTSW3I5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N48BNGK#wasThisHelpful","R1EQMQUTSW3I5I","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When purchasing spices, there are several important criteria. The primary one is freshness as that affects nutritional content as well as flavor. I cannot guarantee the age of this spice, but it smells fresh and appealing and is flavorful and tasty. It is also brilliantly colored and shows no sign of being faded by age. Another aspect is quality and that is reflected both in the origin and the growing process. This is organic, which should mean that it hasn't been grown with toxic chemicals. The origin is given as ""indigenous organic farmers"" and the Iza Organics web site doesn't specify the location of the farmers, but photos and other information indicate it is grown in India. So far, so good.The price is also a consideration, but even that is promising. I did not research the cost of every bit of turmeric on the market, and I know that you can buy cheap spices in some stores in small portions. This is an enormous amount which, on a per ounce basis, costs about half of what you'd pay for mass marketed spices such as that made by McCormick. It is ideal if you want to incorporate regular consumption of turmeric into your diet on a daily basis because you will need to consume it in a timely fashion to take full advantage of the freshness and nutritional benefits.Note: I purchased this product at a discount for my assessment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVWHR0OO6N9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SL8FI0U#wasThisHelpful","RNVWHR0OO6N9M","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried this product in two different ways. First, I applied it to damp hair after a shower to the ends and the mid-portion of my hair (as instructed). Second, I applied it to my dry hair in the morning. It was the second type of application that I found most useful. You can see in my picture a comparison of my  hair with oil (left) and without (right). The hair with the dry application of oil is darker, smoother, and shinier than the hair without it.The oil itself is thicker than common mineral oil (which is one of the ingredients) and smells very, very lovely. You don't need much to get a good application. I strongly recommend putting a small amount (about the size of a dime) on your hands, rubbing them together to distribute it more lightly over your palms, and then rubbing it into your hair from the tips upward. If you apply it too thickly or directly, it'll saturate your hair at that point and make it clumpy and greasy. You can rub it more evenly over your hair using both palms with a light coating of oil. This was what worked best for me and left my hair shiny and manageable.This worked great on my hair, but my hair is very thick, very long, and has good body. Since this is a direct oil treatment, I can't speak to how it would work on finer, thinner, and limper hair - it might be too heavy for such hair. I would recommend it for hair that can take some heavier treatment and needs shine and smoothing of frizzies and flyaways.Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M6P600GG12P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOM18G#wasThisHelpful","R34M6P600GG12P","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some products are marketed to fill a particular niche in a market and these should not be confused with paper towels. They are disposable clothes that are thicker, more durable, and more re-usable than a paper towel. The type of job you would want to use these with are those that might burn up a lot of paper towels (each of these costs about the same as 20 standard paper towels if you assume 2 cents per sheet for regular towels) or require something sturdy, but disposable. Certain types of jobs, especially those which handle jobs that would destroy a rag or make it impossible to re-wash and sanitize, would benefit from this type of cloth. These would also be good for situations in which sanitation is an issue and you don't want to keep using rolls of paper towels throughout the day. These cloths are appropriate for things like greasy food clean-up or an exterior cleaning job (like patio furniture) in which you would need to use many towels. I found that you can rinse these out and wring them out. I used them to clean some pretty dirty outside surfaces and could rinse them in a bucket of water repeatedly and they did not fall apart.I think that this is the sort of product that you will only want to buy if you engage in very specific activities. Another reviewer has mentioned that they do contain natural oil because they are made from flax so that is something to consider. Since they are marketed for food service, my guess is that this is not something the manufacturer's consider an issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RBPN7HXA0CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZR9QKS#wasThisHelpful","R11RBPN7HXA0CT","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The design is simple and elegant and looks hand-painted. The edges are evenly painted with gold and the dish is a good white with a glossy finish which isn't so shiny as to look cheap. My dish arrived in a small holiday box wrapped in bubble wrap. It seemed adequately protected, but the outer box was form fit to the gift box and I think it could have been padded a bit better.

"This is an oil-type moisturizer that has a fantastic scent and feels great on your skin. It's hard to explain if you've never tried one, but it's not greasy while still being satiny and moist. It is absorbed more quickly and easily into your skin than you might expect. Depending on skin type, applying an oil-like moisturizer can provide a much better experience than a cream-based one. I found that a straight oil, provided that it is pure and refined, makes an excellent post-shower, night-time moisturizer without leaving your with residue that can transfer to your pillow when you go to bed. I recommend using it sparingly by dotting it on your face and rubbing it in rather than pouring on a lot. You don't need a lot and the bottle will last you for a very long time.My experience with creams tends to more frequently be either something which is dry and powdery and doesn't provide long-term softness for your skin or they don't get absorbed and are wet-looking and shiny (though I have had some good experiences with creams as well). If nothing else sold me on this, the scent would certainly pull me in. It smells mild and exotic without being perfumey.

"These solar lights are waterproof and have multiple modes. They have little rubbery caps on them that make them look like flowers which help to reflect the light and make them appear bigger and brighter than the tiny lights behind them. They are ideal for putting outdoors in trees or bushes since they are activated by darkness, solar powered, and you can just set their mode and forget them. There are two buttons on the back. One turns them on or off and the other sets the mode (flashing, fading, alternating).The box comes with the lights, solar panel, and a stake to put in the solar panel in the ground. I charged mine for a day before trying them out. It does need direct sunlight to charge the panel. Everything was pretty simple to manage except untangling the lights.

"There area lot of sellers offering this product and I chose this deal because it is the cheapest one at the time of my review. I've been buying this cocoa now for years and I love it and hope that it continues to stay on the market despite the high cost. Though this is only 20 calories per serving (3/4 cup), it tastes rich, sweet, and chocolate-y. Be sure when you make it to measure the hot water because it won't taste nearly as good if it is watered down.I used to pick this up at Safeway when it was on sale (for around $4.70, but the usual price is around $6 in retail stores - but it is generally not available). If you're trying to lose weight, this is an amazing way to satisfy a chocolate craving without blowing your diet.

"I've tried a variety of Luseta hair care products and they are attempting to product salon quality results at a consumer-level price point. For the most part, I'd say that they succeed, though the way in which their products perform varies based on hair type. Part of professional formulation seems to mean that the products aren't a one-size-fits-all type of experience. That being said, the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner struck me as being the  most accessible to people with all types of hair. The shampoo cleans well, but doesn't leave hair stripped. My scalp felt clean and my hair's shine (what is left of it, I'm 51 and have aging hair) was enhanced.The conditioner is pretty effective for all issues. It contains flyways to some extent, frizzies to a greater extent, and does a good job in improving comb out (and this is important for me because my hair is super long and thick). My  hair felt super soft after using both the shampoo and conditioner together and the body and waves were definitely maintained if not enhanced. The scent of these products is amazing.

"Most people are using digital planners in this day and age, but I find that being able to put the schedule in front of me on paper where I can look through it helps me conceptualize the schedule better. This planner is ideal in that it has both a monthly calendar and weekly ones so you can note appointments for at-a-glance reminders and detailed information in the weekly calendar. There are spaces on the sides and bottom to jot down notes. The size is also quite good in that it's big enough to write comfortably in, but not large and unwieldy. It's easy to carry in a briefcase or backpack. It also has the nice touch of a ribbon bookmark to allow you to mark the current date.

"Jump ropes are one of the cheapest and most compact pieces of exercise equipment and, though they are very simple in general, certain features can be added to make them better to use. In the case of this rope, the handles are much better than a basic rope. They are thick and padded with grooves for your fingers so they're easy to grip and won't slip out of your hands easily. The rope won't twist up because the string rotates inside of the handles so it moves rather than twists up.The only weak point to this is that there are no instructions about how to shorten the rope. The rope comes in a box with information on the back so there's no reason those instructions couldn't have been printed on the box. I figured out that you have to remove the cap from the bottom of a handle and pull it through to the length you want. The tricky part then is getting the metal clamp off the part you're trimming off and then re-attaching it to the new end. You'll need a pair of flat-nosed pliers to bend it both to get it off and back on. If you're not handy, this can be a bit tricky.This is an excellent jump rope.

"The primary function of a watch is that it keeps time and this one, in my short experience with it, seems to keep time very well. It's actually not difficult to get a decent watch that keeps time, so the other properties of value are comfort, design, and usability. This watch scores big points on at least two of those. First of all, it's a beautiful watch with a warm and natural look and feel. The wood is smooth and polished so it's comfortable against your skin. It feels quite sturdy and not brittle. As the marketing blurb for this mentions, wood is neither hot nor cool against your skin so you can wear it in all temperatures without risk of sweating under the band or getting cold damage to your skin in super cold weather. I grew up in the northeastern part of the U.S. and we were explicitly told to avoid metal jewelry on super cold days because the metal could get colder than your skin and damage it.The usability in terms of daily wear is very good. There's a button on the side of the clasp that you push to release it and it's a folding/unfolding type that lies flat against your skin. In the short term, setting the time if your fingers aren't sufficiently padded is a little troublesome as the crown is fairly flush against the wood. Once it's set though, you're not going to have to bother again. The watch has a very large face (see picture against my wrist) so it is easy to read at a glance. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Extra links are included in the box to re-size it if you need a larger band. Chances are you will need to remove links rather than add them, but given the unique quality of the watch (the wooden band), it was a nice touch to include more links.The first thing you notice when you open the box is that the watch smells great. It would make a good gift not only because it is unique in appearance and presentation, but also it is packaged beautifully. It is both memorable and functional. The watch arrives wrapped around a tweed pillow in a wooden embossed box. The top slides open and the empty box could be used for other purposes or for storing the watch in the future.Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVW1FZEJLS1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVCDW8E#wasThisHelpful","R2RVW1FZEJLS1I","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second experience with vacuum compression bags and these are more expensive than the Ziploc ones that I'd tried before. The price per bag with Ziploc's were a little more than $2 and these are a little less than $5 (at present). The main difference that I've noted, and this is either irrelevant or very, very important, is that these do not ""leak"" like Ziploc bags do when you put items in the bags for long-term storage. Within weeks, my experience with Ziploc's bags was that they re-inflated and expanded. These bags stayed compressed (or at least they have so far). If you're looking for short-term (less than a month) storage, then you can get by with cheaper bags. If you are looking for something for long-term storage, these are a good choice despite the higher price per bag. If you're looking for something which is for a temporary purpose (like a move), then you can go cheaper.As another review noted, the packaging on these bags is very utilitarian. They are sent in a plain bag with no instructions. It's not hard to figure out how they work, but if you are confused about what the little plastic parts are for (in the extra bag), you're out of luck or will have to search online for a how-to. Also, though I think the little black screw-on cap is a better seal for the vacuum hole than the plastic snap-on caps that are common in other types of bags, it would be a lot easier to lose track of them when the bags are not in use.Note: I was provided with a free sample of this product for my assessment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCDLYCREFK69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ULPCVM#wasThisHelpful","RJCDLYCREFK69","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you take any supplement or eat a particular diet in order to reap potential health benefits, you are always doing so on faith. This applies to eating an apple or a piece of fish as well as taking a probiotic capsule. It is impossible to assert with any certainty if any choice of what you put in your mouth will have a positive effect on your body. For this reason, I make it clear that my experience with any supplement is highly subjective and I mainly focus on the usability and my sense of the value of the product.I do believe that probiotics assist with increasing good bacteria in the stomach and gut. I edited research about such bacteria when I lived in Japan and this physicians research discussed the affect of ""bad bacteria"" on the development of stomach cancer and that fuels my belief in addition to other research that I've read. In my own experience, I can say that taking the Viva Labs supplement lessened my stomach distress (and eating probiotic yogurt does as well, but I don't care for yogurt that much). The relative immediacy of the relief I felt after taking this supplement was far greater than that I've had with other supplements that carried a lower price tag. I am impressed.In terms of how easy these are to take, the capsules are rather average in size - not big, but not small. They are easy to swallow and have no odor or taste.

"This is my second cable management system review (I was offered a free sample of this type) and it is far easier to use than the previous one. The package contains 4 neoprene sleeves with zippers. You wrap the sleeve around your cables and zip it up. It's as easy as that. The zippers are very easy to engage and pull up and down. Each will easily contain about 4-6 cables (depending on thickness) you can even stuff unwieldy lengths of cable back into the sleeve to tuck them out of the way. This system works best for cables that run from one location to another and is less useful for a situation in which cables are snaking off in various directions (for that, the type of system with various holes that you can pass cables through works better).I found this very easy to use, relatively attractive, and easy to clean. All of the zippers on my sleeves moved smoothly and were securely attached. The flexible design also made them easier to arrange than some of the cable management systems which are like plastic tubes. It also allows the sleeve and cables to lie flatter if the cables run behind desks or tables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVLEO9VD7FK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HWXG4M#wasThisHelpful","R2NVLEO9VD7FK0","A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a women's size 8 1/2 shoe and these socks fit me pretty much perfectly. You can look at the pictures I took to see where the toe and heel fall on the sock's pattern. That being said, they are designed for the Japanese market (the writing on the back of the tags is Japanese) so my guess is that they will run a bit smaller than socks designed for the Western market, but any woman with average feet (or smaller) should find the fit quite decent.The socks are about average in thickness and are neither warm nor cold. They fit very well in your shoes and are thick enough to prevent chafing with the edges of your shoes. They have a festive winter design and the colors are varied, but they are types that will likely match any clothing you wear as they incorporate, white, black, and red with black tending toward the dominant color. The socks are quite comfortable and made up of stretchy material. My only issue with them was that I felt the inner seam near the top of the toe could have laid flatter. I could feel the seam along the top of my foot for a little while before it conformed to my foot. After a few washes, it is fine, but those with sensitive toes  may find them uncomfortable. All in all though, I think these are attractive winter socks that would be appropriate for gift-giving in the winter season and the full set comes at an economical price.

"A few weeks ago I finish Eric San Juan's excellent book on the Mad Men TV series which ran on AMC. I decided to purchase his earlier bookBreaking Down Breaking Bad from Amazon; I am glad I did! This little book will give you a good analysis of the excellent Vince Gilligan directed series which ran five years.  The series focuses on brilliant teacher Walter White. Learning of his fatal cancer diagnosis he decided to make money to leave his family secure following his imminent demise. He and a former chemistry student Jesse decide to cook meth to make a bundle. The descent of Walter White from respected family man into a monster is a fascinating journey into the heart of darkness of a human being. The series is notable for its excellentwriting, acting and story line. The acting of Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and a strong supporting cast make this series a television event. Kudos to Eric San Juan for his sagacious and concise comments on the show!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QA8OMVX2GMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493729993#wasThisHelpful","R20QA8OMVX2GMZ","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hitler dies on April 30, 1945 in the Dantean depths of his Berlin Bunker. Poison and a gunshot ended the life of the cruel dictator and his new wife Eva Braun Hitler. The next ten days would witness:a. The dispute among the Allies (the Soviets, and the United States) on the most appropriate place to stage the Nazi surrender. The Nazis surrendered at both Eisenhower's Rheims France headquarters and also in Berlin to the Soviet conquerors of that capital of the Reich.b.

The horrible evil of the final solution was revealed as British, Canadian and American troops liberated the extermination camps.  Michael Jones is a British historian who is the book's author. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a member of the British Commission for Military History. This book is valuable for:a. The eyewitness accounts of those from several nations who participated in the final events of World War II in Europe.b. The chronology the book includes regarding the last days of the war.c.

"The authors review the lives and controversial careers of former POTUS Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Rumor or facts? Read the book and make up your own mind. The book is poorly written and edited. The reader should be aware that Roger Stone and Robert Morrow are both Republicans who are political opponents of the Clintons. The book is tedious reading as the authors regurgitate old rumors and scandals that have been hashed and rehashed for decades. Books like this make this reviewer ponder the questions of whether the American people will decide on casting their vote for someone who has many skeletons in the in their closet but benefit the majority of the people they are elected to serve. The book also represents the freedom we in the United States enjoy to criticize popular and powerful politicians. Such books never see light in dictatorships.  I am a person who reads material on our leaders from both liberal and conservative viewpoints. Use your mind and decide what your verdict on Hillary Clinton as a presidential hopeful will be as election 2016 approaches.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1H7RME95377/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=151070678X#wasThisHelpful","R2B1H7RME95377","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Salem Massachusetts was not the place to be in1692! The year saw nineteen people hanged (fourteen women and five men including clergy)and two dogs hanged! The small village had less that six hundred inhabitants. Neighbors accused neighbors, husbands said their wives were witches and parish members turned on their pastors. Schiff examines:a. The lives of the judges and accused persons including Increase Mather and his son Cotton who were famous New England Puritan preachers and theologians.b. Schiff relates many details involved in the trials of the accused.c. I felt the book went on way too long with a long list of people and cases which were hard to keep straight in the mind of the reader!d. The rational explanations for the witchery are not adequately addressed by the author.  This book by a Pulitzer Prize winning historian should have been much better.

"Charles Dickens (1812-1870) is the greatest English Victorian authors. His immortal lives will live as long as human eye can scan the thousands of pages he wrote so long ago! Every few years this reviewer travels to old England to revisit the unforgettable characters etched with humor, wit and pathos by Boz. The Everyman's Library has republished all of the Dickens novels and stories in sturdy hardbound yet affordable editions. In ""A Christmas Carol"" that 1843 classic is there for us to feast upon as well as a quartet of other fine stories. The stories are:a. A Christmas Carol was published in 1843 by Bradbury and Evans Company. The story is the most famous secular tale in all of the vast treasure of Christmas tales. Old Scrooge is a miser who is visited by the three ghosts of past, present and future. He is redeemed by love and kindly cares for his nephew Bob and his crippled son Tiny Tim. The story is the one Dickens work everyone seems to know even if they have never read it or perused any of the other Dickens works.b. The Chimes-In this story we see how the British poor were cast aside by greedy and pompous political hypocrites. Toby Vetch and his suffering family have revived hopes as they listen to the cheerful message of the bells.c. The Cricket on the Hearth: It started with a teakettle and a cricket on the hearth bringing cheer and love to the humble home of John Peerybingle and his young wife. The plot concerns John's suspicion that his young wife  is having an affair. The tale and secret of the old man who visits their humble abode is solved with the joys of an old time Christmas dance and party! One of Dickens' best Christmas tales!d. Dr Jeddler and his two daughters Grace and Marian live on an ancient English battlefield. The doctor is cynical but is redeemed by the love revealed by his two daughters. Marian yields her lover Alfred to her older sister Grace in a touching and sentimental story.e. The Haunted Man-A chemist asks a ghost to remove his memories of sorrow and pain. He regrets this and is made thankful for our memories as he sees a woman named Millie reach out in love to a suffering student. The theme is ""Lord, Keep My Memory Green.""  Charles Dickens had a way with words in which he can make the world come alive in all of its sadness, joy and beauty. This book would make an excellent Christmas gift! As Tiny Tim might put it: ""God bless us everyone!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R130XT5871Q7D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307271757#wasThisHelpful","R130XT5871Q7D6","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Timothy Snyder is a brilliant historian of the unspeakable and horrific crime of the Nazi holocaust against Europe's Jews and other victims of their crazy cruelty. Snyder shows us that:1. Hitler believed human beings were no more than animals asserting a twisted belief in survival of the fittest in which the strong destroy the weak regardless of society or morals.2. The author is fluent in Yiddish, Russian, German and Polish so his research shows us the holocaust and Hitler's war against humanity in a brutal new perspective.3. Hitler hoped to invest Poland as an ally in his war against Communism and the Soviet Union. When the Poles refused he invaded their country on September 1, 1939 launching World War II.5. The Soviets were cruel killers who killed millions of peasants in relocations and in their invasion of Poland and the Ukraine in 1940.6. The Nazis did not believe in national borders and viewed Eastern Europe as fair game for their colonization schemes.7. The key to Nazi belief was the triumph of the Germanic race over the Slavs and Jews.8. Jews were considered as poisonous and had to be removed from the universe  Snyder is the author of Bloodlands dealing with Soviet-German murder in Eastern Europe. This new book looks at Nazi and Soviet horror in the conquered lands of Poland, Czechoslovokia, Austria and other lands which they conquered. A horrible period of history is presented this book. Excellent text, strong bibliography, extensive footnotes and graphic maps of the spread of Nazism in World War II.

"Ken Follett  is a British author of countless bestsellers from The Eye of the Needle to the Key to Rebecca. This reviewer has just read Edge of Eternity. It is the third volume in The Century Trilogy. Fall of Giants dealt with World War I and Winter of the World with World War II. All three books follow the lives of English, Welsh, Russian and American families who live their  days in exciting and historic times. Edge of Eternity follow the various families in the events from the erection of the Berlin Wall through 1989 when the Wall came down and Soviet Communism ended in victory for the values of Western Democracy.

"Continental Congress Delegate John Adams wrote his wife Abigail a letter. In it he compared their lives in the vortex of revolution and social upheaval as a whirlwind. Surely the American Revolution is the seminal event in the story of the United States. Dr. John Ferling, the emeritus professor of history at Western Georgia University, is the author of several books on the Revolutionary War and the years of the early American empire of liberty. Among those books are A Leap in the Dark and Almost a Miracle. In this new book he tells the story of the American Revolution from the beginning of colonial disaffection to the Mother Land of Great Britain in the 1760s following victory of Britain in the Seven Years War against France from 1758-1763 (called in America the French and Indian War). to the Treaty of Paris ending hostilities in 1783. There is much to learn in this book even for those of us who have teeming shelves filled with books on the subject. Among the facts I will remember from my reading of this text:a. Over 30,000 Americans died fighting for Independence.b. More African-Americans served in the American military than any other war until the time of integration in Korea in the 1950s.c. About 60,000 Loyalists fled the new United States during the war.d. Great Britain had a terrible time with logistics and keeping their troops supplied in a distant war over 3,000 miles from the British Isles.e. George Washington practiced a Fabian strategy against the might of George III's Army as he continued to retreat from major battle as much as possible in an attempt to win a long and protracted war. This strategy proved to be a winning move in the chess game of war.f. Major battles include Bunker HIll, Princeton; Trenton; Morristown; Harlem Heights, Saratoga  and several key battles in the Southern Theatre from the fall of Charlestown to Cowpens and the final victory against Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown Virginia in 1781g. Washington was the indispensable man in leading the American army to triumph.  The book is well written. As a former high school history teacher this book could well be used as a resource in a unit on the American Revolution.Essential!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3TCWLFOC8V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162040172X#wasThisHelpful","R2A3TCWLFOC8V5","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When is the last time you hunkered down with a thick history book which read like a thrilling novel? My answer is today! I have just completed James Holland's excellent first volume of his projected three book history of the War in the West during World War II. Holland is a British historian, novelist and broadcaster. He has advised the British government on history curriculum and has his own collection at the Imperial War Museum  In this first volume Holland spends his time exploding old myths about the beginning of the most destructive war in human history which claimed over fifty million lives. The book is based on the latest current research, interviews, travels made by Holland to the combatant nations and an impressive bibliography. The maps in the book are easy to read and the period photos are fine. Holland asserts based on his study that:a. Germany's Army was not well mechanized depending on horses to carry their artillery.b. Great Britain was at a distinct advantage over the Nazis due to its extensive and supportive world empire which provided soldiers, equipment and needed iron ore.c. Germany made a terrible mistake when they went up against the RAF in the Battle of Britain.d. Winston Churchill and FDR were much superior to Hitler as a strategist on the world stage.e. Mussolini's Italy was a poor and agricultural land and did little to help their German allies.f. Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union was a fatal mistake.g. The British Army's retreat from Dunkirk led to their being able to rearm against the Nazis.h. Allied planes and the British Navy were much superior to the Nazi Luftwaffe and Navy.I. Germany was short on tanks, trained soldiers and natural resources to sustain a long war of attrition against the powerful Allies of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union.  James Holland's book also looks at the lives of individuals caught up in the maelstrom of war from soldiers at the front; to airman and tankersto housewives and young people. This approach makes the book more human and interesting.  I eagerly await volume II from an outstanding young scholar of an old war.

My wife and I have watched every episode in the first six seasons at least once! Doc Martin is a London surgeon who has a phobia about seeing blood. He decides to move to a small Yorkshire town where he hangs out his shingle as a GP. He falls in love with Louisa a schoolteacher and they have a child named James. The good doctor is irascible and does not entertain fools gladly! He can be rude, abrupt and hateful. He is, though, a good man and excellent doctor ! Martin is surrounded by a cast of eccentrics such as Bert Larger the fat restaurant owner and his son; his aunt who is a psychiatrist; a lamebrain policeman and several others. The stories are warmhearted and will make you both laugh and cry.

"History is never dull but how we read that history is sometimes as lackluster and banal as reading a cereal box! This ability to narrate good popular history is well exhibited in the series of ""Killing"" books by Bill O'Reilly of Fox TV fame and Martin Dugard. I have read all the books in the series and this one on Ronald Wilson Reagan is one of the best!  The authors tell the story of Ronald Reagan the smiling Irish actor from Dixon, Illinois who broadcast games for the Cubs, starred in 53 Hollywood films and served as the popular TV host of the General Electric Theatre and Death Valley Days. Reagan was divorced from Academy Award Actress and was a womanizer when he met Nancy Davis. The couple had a great marriage and were the parents of Pattie and Ron Jr. Reagan had two children from his previous marriage to Wyman (Maureen and the adopted Mike). Reagan was a New Deal Democrat but his growing opposition to Communism in Hollywood, testifying for HUAC and working as an FBI operative turned him to the right. Nancy was a tough woman who was a conservative true believer. Reagan served two terms as a Republican governor of Cal. He challenged sitting POTUS Gerald Ford for the nomination in 1976 losing a squeaker. Reagan defeated President Carter in 1980 and won a second term as chief executive against Walter Mondale. Reagan' is considered a great president. During his time in office the Berlin Wall was torn down and Communism in the Soviet Union collapsed. He survived the assassination attempt made against his life by John Hinckley  on March 30, 1981. Reagan survived the Iran-Contra scandal and led the USA to victory in the Grenada invasion. During his time in office he was a close friend of Margaret Thatcher the Conservative Prime Minister of Great Britain though he did disagree with her on British strategy in the Falklands Islands war.  Reagan became feeble and died of Alzheimer's disease.  Ronald Reagan was a man with few real friends. He could be cold and aloof but he was beloved as a father figure to a resurgent American public. He loved America and served this land well!  This book is well illustrated, contains a good bibliography and offers objective insights into the life and career of the Gipper! Well done and worth reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDGFGLGFZW12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792414#wasThisHelpful","R1HDGFGLGFZW12","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"World War II was the greatest collective tragedy in the history of the human race. The war began when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Nearly fifty million persons died during the war including millions of Jewish victims of the Nazi holocaust. All of these facts are well known. The numbers of books on Germany under the Nazis fills large libraries. Dr. Nicholas Strargardt's new book The German War is one of the best account of this horrible time. The author:a. Covers the major strategic moves of the war with skill and conciseness.b. Shows how the war impacted German people from soldiers on the front to housewives at home. Stargardt  performs this feat through a skilled use of letters and short biographies of everyday men and women.c. The book clearly shows that thousands if not millions of Germans knew the truth of the murder of the Jews in extermination camps.d. Most of the eighty million Germans believed the Allies surrounded the Reich with lethal intent to destroy their nation.e. Germans were taught to hate Jews and Communists.f. Dr. Joseph Goebbels the master of Nazi propaganda skillfully if maliciously used the media to instill hatred in the hearts of his countrymen.g. The Nazis were an evil criminal regime.h. The Roman Catholic and Protestants did little to protest Nazi atrocities against the Jews though they did oppose medical euthanasia schemes against the mentally ill.

"Jay Winik is one of America's foremost popular historians. He won a Pulitzer for April 1865 and his The Great Upheaval was an outstanding work.In 1944 the master historian takes a poignant look at Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the crucial days of World War II. Among the milestones ofthe pivotal year 1944:1. Roosevelt's health continues to decline; his impending death was only months away in April 1945. He continued to travel, govern and lead the great arsenal of democracy the United States as it and allies Great Britain and the Soviet Union squeezed Nazi Germany into an inescapable box.2. D-Day on June 6, 1944 put the allies on French soil as they drove towards Germany on the Western Front while the Soviet Army moved in on the Third Reich from the Eastern theatre.3. The plight of the millions of Jews who were being ruthlessly murdered in Auschwitz and several other death camps was, arguably, history's worst crime.4. The United States State Department was filled with Anti-Semite officials and bureaucrats who stymied immigration efforts for Jews who sought solace and freedom in this country. Winik spends many pages on this topic; his account of life in a death camp and a daring escape from Auschwitz make for fascinating though horrified reading. Man's inhumanity to man knew no bounds in the satanic world of Himmler, the SS and Adolf  Hitler's sadistic and murderous compass.5. Winik includes a good overall discussion of Western War strategy from North Africa to Sicily, Italy, the invasion of France and the Battle of the Bulge.6. Winik is a historian who knows how to write and keep the reader's interest from flagging.7. This book would be an excellent volume to give to a young person or student whose knowledge of World War II and the Holocaust is elementary. I8. The book reveals how great leaders such as FDR., Churchill, Eisenhower can inspire and lead a nation and military force with gusto, guts and a genius  get the job done.9. The book provides several short biographies of several brave Europeans who sought to inform the West of the horrors going on against the Jews and other captive people in the Nazi controlled nations.10. This book is one of my favorite reads of 2015 and should be on the bookshelf of any person who values freedom and morality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F66IQ1746UAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439114080#wasThisHelpful","R1F66IQ1746UAI","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read Judith Barker's fine historical account of the Battle of Agincourt fought on October 25,1415. However, I thought a fictional book by Bernard Cornwell would also be enjoyable and informative. I was correct on both counts! Cornwell, a very prolific historical novelist, spins the tale as he tells us the story through the eyes of an English archer and outlaw. The violence of battle is bloody and the action is swift. Cornwell includes a section on the development of the English longbow and an interview with the author is included. A good popular read backed up with good historical research make this book a page turner.

"Demelza is book two in the Poldark  saga. I first this book in 1975 when the series was featured on Masterpiece Theatre. With the new Polkdark series now on PBS I decided to reread the Poldark books. I am glad to revisit the fictional characters who people the pages of Poldark. In Demelza the fetching young farm servant has married RossPoldark. Demelza gives birth to her daughter Julia. Ross is busy trying to keep copper and tin mines open in Cornwall. The book has several interesting characters such as Jim Carter who is prison for debt; a farmhand married to an actress with a roving eye; Elizabeth who though still in love with Ross has married his dissolute cousin Francis; Jud and Trudy the feckless couple who work for Poldark  Graham's book was first published in 1946 and still holds up well.

"There are few historical figures who have an entire age named for them. Napoleon was one of this exalted pantheon. He was born in Corsica to an upper class family. His father was a lawyer and involved in the Corsican political scene as a supported of Paoli the liberator of the island. Napoleon studied the military arts in France becoming the hero of the battle of Toulon where his artillery defeated the English. Napoleon became the hero of the Revolutionary armies victories over Austria in Italy. He also won battles against the Turks in Egypt. Napoleon became one of the three consuls who governed France; led a coup and became emperor in 1802. He was the victor at Marengo and popular with the public. Napoleon was a good administrator and a brilliant general. He was married to Josephine but had countless affairs.  The author is an expert on Napoleon. This book is the first volume of a projected two book set on the life of one of history's most controversial figures. This first volume is very long at over eight hundred pages; is detailed and deals with politics, diplomatic and personal issues in the life of the little corporal. The work is not an easy read but is an essential book in the Napoleonic scholarship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PGFMMVZV0TLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674368355#wasThisHelpful","R3PGFMMVZV0TLS","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lord John is a minor character in the long string of Outlander novels (eight to date) by Arizona novelist Dr. Diana Gabaldon. This author is an accomplished modern master in the genre of historical romantic fiction. Her novels focus on the eighteenth century. In this novel she has given her readers three novellas concerning Lord John and his adventures. Those tales are:a. Lord John and the Hellfire Club: The death of one of his officer peers. John investigates his disappearance turning up at the Hellfire Club where human sacrifice, gay sex and murder comingle in an unsavory stew. This is the shortest and the least interesting of the trio of tales in this collection. Gabaldon does much better as a novelist of doorstop size novels than it these shorter worksb. Lord John and the Succubus. Lord John is posted in Germany during the Seven Years War. Many of his superstitious men believe that a succubus is abroad in the land. This is a female demon who has intercourse with unsuspecting men whom she often murders. The tale is complicated with many characters and is a mystery difficult to solve.c. The Haunted Soldier deals with a cannon explosion which causes Lord John to look into the past of the English officer and his family life. What he finds is scandal.  As one who has read all of the Outlander novels published to date I diligently read the Lord John novels. They are so-so and quite a comedown in interest from Gabaldon's huge novels about the love of Jamie and Claire Fraser.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0A1T5ES950G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342519#wasThisHelpful","RN0A1T5ES950G","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The buck did stop at the desk of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) the President of the United States from 1933-45. On December 7, 1941FDR and his team were surprised by the Japanese Empire's dastardly attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Roosevelt had fought hard to ensure America would defend freedom on the land, sea and air. His plans of lend-lease  and sealing of the Atlantic Charter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1941 were instrumental in the defeat of the Third Reich. America grew from an isolated nation with a third rate military to the mastery of global power. What began at Pear Harbor ended with the failing of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  How the United States progressed on the path to war and what made our nation great in the eyes of the world is the story told by Jonathan W. Jordan in this excellent popular study. Four men  are put under Jordan's microscope in this eloquently written and researched study. Those men are:1. Franklin Delano Roosevelt-A brilliant president who became Doctor Win the War. In alliance with Britain under the great leadership of Winston Churchill and his magical ability to reconcile feuding politicians and military men into a winning formula for victory make for an inspiring story of courage, valor and patriotism.2. General George C. Marshall-The chief of the Army was the leader into turning America's armed forces from a small force of 200,00 into the mighty brigades of millions of soldiers who defeated Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy. Marshall was a cold man who was a perfectionist brooking no levity in his command. He worked well with FDR  and was keen in the ability to reconcile feuding military associates. One of the United States greatest captains of war.3. Admiral Ernest King. An irascible, demanding, rude and very effective head of the United States push to Japan. He was hard to work for but got the job done. An essential tool in FDR's tool chest of great leaders.4. Henry Stimson-The elderly Secretary of War and a New York pal of FDR he came from old money, was a lifelong conservative Republican and did an outstanding job in directing the military effort against the enemy.  If I were teaching a college level course on America in World War II this book would be on the assigned reading list. It makes clear what an enormous effort of blood, sweat, tears, production of weapons and deployment of troops was necessary to strike the head of the viper that was Fascism and Nazism. The book contains a few maps, has  an excellent bibliography and useful footnotes. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WKDTPIX79P5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451414578#wasThisHelpful","R2WKDTPIX79P5W","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father was a staff sergeant in General Hodges First Army. He fought in the Hurtgen Forest and in the Ardennes in that bitter winter of 1944.Bringing the Battle of the Bulge the last strike of Hitler's hammer against the Allies to modern readers in a challenge. This feat is well accomplished by Dr. Peter Caddick-Adams. He has written earlier books on Monty and Rommel as well as the Monte Cassino Campaign. He is a professional soldier who has led troops in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. He is British but has a refreshingly positive attitude to American contributions to winning the global struggle against the hideous Axis powers. Snow and Steel is a soldier's eye view of the battle as we read first person accounts by both American and German soldiers. Caddick-Adams also lets us look over the shoulders of SHAEF commander General Dwight Eisenhower who had to keep peace between British General Bernard Law Montgomery and General Omar Bradley who led 12th Army in the Ardennes. The Germans launched their surprise last gamble attack on December 16, 1944 but after over a month of bloody fighting were turned back. Their goal was the port of Antwerp where massive Allied supplies were being unloaded for use in the field. The Germans had poor logistics and Hitler's plan was insane. The very readable text is accompanied by photos of the battle and a massive bibliography and footnotes. This is one of the best battlefield books I have ever read! Caddick-Adams is one of World War II's finest young historians.

"Waterloo was a turning point in modern history. The all day battle of June 18, 1815 was fought south of Brussels pitting the Allied armies under the Duke of Wellington (1769-1852) future British Prime Minister against Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821`) and his French legions. Wellington was assisted by General Blucher and the Prussians as they defeated the little corporal. Napoleon had escaped from St. Helena's and returned to France where he quickly deposed Louis XVIII and fought to protect France from her many enemies. The battlefield was small encompassing only a few miles but was extremely bloody. Wellington protected his troops with his reverse slope strategy and his strong defense destroyed the might of France. As a result of the battle:a. Napoleon was finally deposed as Emperor of the French and sent into exile on Elbe where he died six years after the battle.b. Great Britain was at last triumphant over Revolutionary France and went on to extend their already vast empire. The nineteenth century balance of power in Europe would lead to almost a century of European peace..  The book is richly illustrated with colored art work and includes many first person accounts from generals to foot soldiers. We learn how armies were armed, fed, transported and fought in this early nineteenth century milieu.  Bernard Cornwell is best known as a historical novelist featuring the British soldier Sharpe who fought against Napoleon. In this first book of nonfiction the author has done a fine job of explaining a complicated battle to general readers. I have many huge tomes on Waterloo but this is the one I will most turn to as a refresher of information on Waterloo.

"The late Winston Graham was a Welshman who is responsible for books turned into film such as Marnie and the Poldark series. I first read most of the books at the same time as watching Poldark on TV over a quarter of a century ago. Now the series has returned to Masterpiece Theatre. It features splendid acting and beautiful seasons of Cornwall. This first book in the series is excellent. It tells the tale of Ross Poldark who returns to his Cornish farm following service in Virginia in the American Revolution. Poldark's parents are dead and only Trudy and Jude, two feckless servants, are still on the property. Ross learns that the beautiful Elizabeth with whom he loves is now married to his cousin Francis. Francis is a weak character with an affinity for drinking, gambling and whoring. Ross hires the young Demelza as a maid when she is only 13. They later marrydespite criticism from Ross' gentry friends. A friend named Jim Carter is arrested for poaching and sent to prison despite Ross' plea for mercy to a cruel court. The book is lyrically written with passages descriptive of nature's changing season. There is also many pages devoted to the mining business which Polkdark operates in a tough economic time. Anyone reading this book will want to move on to volume two Demelza. Ross Poldark was first published in 1945.

"I have made the journey through all of the eight published volumes in the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. There may be future volumes in the popular series which now is running as a cable television series on the STARZ network. Now I have turned my historical romance reading to the Lord John Grey series by Gabaldon The chief character is Lord John Grey. He is a major in the British Army in the 1750s who is in London awaiting assignment to a new posting. Grey is called in to investigate the murder of Irish sergeant OConner. He is believed to have had on his person secret papers vital to government security. Meanwhile, Lord John is dealing with a family crisis. His niece Olivia is engaged to Cornish Colonel Joseph Trevelyan. While in the loo at a local pub, Gray sees a syphilis sore on Trevelyan's penis. He seeks to prevent Olivia marrying this man and becoming infected with the disease.  Much of the action takes place in low life London districts featuring the Lavender inn where homosexual men gather for assignations and liquor. There are also scenes set in brothels. The story is slow moving with several characters to keep track of as the complicated plot is unraveled. The novel runs to 300 pages making it a baby among the behemoth 1000 paged doorstopper novels produced by the author in the Outlander series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAGZGIRBPZ1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440241480#wasThisHelpful","R1EAGZGIRBPZ1Y","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rev. Charles Ludwig Dodgson (pen name Lewis Carroll) 1832-1898 is the comic genius of children's Victorian literature and a British treasure!  On July 4, 1862 he and a fellow Oxford don joined the three daughters of Dean Liddell up the Thames River on a picnic excursion. Thegirls asked Dodgson to tell them a story. The result was the story that became Alice in Wonderland published in 1865 and Alice Through the Looking Glass published in 1872. Alice follows a rabbit down a hole as her adventures begin. Along the way she will meet the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar, the Chesire Cat. the  the Duchess, Tweedeldum and Tweeldee, the Queen of Hearts and many other fabulous creatures.

"I have read over one hundred books this year. Among that century number this book by Dr. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, an Oxford scholar and author of a bestselling biography of Charles Dickens, has risen to my personal top ten books for the year. Fairhurst's book is a delightful exploration of the life and career of Charles Dodgson (1832-98) who was the author of Alice in Wonderland in 1865, Through the Looking Glass in 1872, The Hunting of the Snark and countless poems, short stories and mathematical works. Dodgson was a Church of England clergyman who was a bachelor throughout his life living in his Oxford don digs. He was also a genius who took the pen name Lewis Carroll. He enjoyed photography, word games, puzzles, long walks, poetry and short story writing, trips to London for theatre and a wide assemblage of friends. He met Mark Twain and knew the Tennyson family. Alice's creator stayed closed to the Oxford he lived but did take one long trip to Russia. The author explores Carroll's life from his birth in the north of England to a clergyman, through his study at Oxford and his writing career. Carroll was a perfectionist and a solid conservative Christian and a prim Victorian gentleman. Alice was based on his adult-child friendship with Alice Liddell one of the daughters of the Dean of Oxford.  It was on July 4, 1862 that Dodgson, a male friend and the three Liddell girls journeyed by boat up the Thames. Rev. Dodgson told them the story that became Alice. We see Alice grow to womanhood and make her trip to New York a year before her death in 1933.  This beautiful book is well illustrated including copies of the photos taken by Carroll and the original drawings done for the Alice books by John Tenniel.  Along the way you the reader will learn all kinds of facts about the Alice books and enjoy the company of Lewis Carroll. So take the plunge down the rabbit hole with a great scholar and buy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZ07VMG6SLBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674967798#wasThisHelpful","R1DZ07VMG6SLBP","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Coates (I was disappointed there was no biographical information on the co-authors)are two British authors who have written an excellent popular guide to the life and works of William Shakespeare (1564-1616) the world's greatest playwright. I did not expect much from this book. Boy was I surprised! The book is filled with information on historical information on Shakespeare's times; a brief biography of the Bard of Avon; famous speeches and quotations and how they would sound in modern English; the sonnets and how the folios and quartos came to be published. Succinct summaries of several of the comedies, history plays and tragedies are also included. Summaries of them are given and their critical reaction among scholars and the public. A section on famous Shakespearian thespians was fun to read. The tome concludes with a sixty question quiz on Shakespeare and his works.

"Who were they? A talented and patriotic group of good women who served as first ladies of the United States. From Martha Washington to Michelle Obama you can learn their fascinating stories in this excellent book published by C-SPAN. The book is based on the C-SPAN series on the First Ladies which ran a few years ago. The book does not present detailed biographies of each of America's forty-five first ladies; what it does do is present the scripts of each of the shows featuring sage comments by historians on each of the women profiled. Such scholars as Richard Norton Smith and William Seale add their thoughts and research on the first ladies. The over 400 page volume features a picture and short biography of each woman including anecdotes and the major issues facing the United States as a nation during their husband's administration. The personal lives of the first ladies is also briefly discussed. Images remain in my mind of Abigail Adams doing laundry in the East Room: Dolly Madison saving a portrait of General Washington from the invading British in 1814, Eleanor Roosevelt speaking to the nation following the Pearl Harbor attack and many more. This is an easy to read book which would be well suited to a class on the First Ladies for students. The book is well illustrated and fun and educational to read!

The book is aimed at awakening young people to the growing  soft tyranny of the federal government and the greedy claws of an overregulated and centrally administered government. Levin looks with scholarly objectivity at the following areas of the American republic experiment which need to be fixed or at least challenged by the rising generation. The chapters are:1. Plunder and Deceit-An introduction to the book and a challenge to parents and community leaders to foster a love of country in children as they become informed of the sad state of the American republic.2. On the debt-The government is in debt for trillions of dollars!3. On Social Security-Entitlement programs from Social Security to Medicare and Medicaid are wide open doors to adding to the national debt and not really helping those who need help.4. On Medicare and Obamacare-The them of this chapter is the invasion of the federal government into medicine and old age benefits.5. Education-America spends more than almost any other country in the world on educating our citizenry but our young people are failing to be educated into good citizenship. Programs like Common Core have failed. Education seems to be for the professionals involved in the endeavor rather than the students. Student loans put an intolerable burden on the present generation.6. On immigration-The overwhelming flood of constant immigration from peasant cultures is doing great damage to American citizens and our common culture and values.7. On the Environment-Levin gives an F to the EPA and the Interior Department for overregulation and their war against capitalism and the industrial age. The EPA's war on coal production was frightening to read!8. On the minimum wage-The minimum wage actually hurts young people in getting entry level jobs that  will strengthen their work resumes and give them job experience.9. On National Security-The world is a tough neighborhood from China, Russia, Iran and terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al Queda. Young Americans need to pay great attention to foreign policy since it is they who are called to fight in the nation's wars.10. On the Constitution-The seminal written document of American freedom is disregarded and trampled by many politicians and activist judges. The Obama administration has acted with too much executive power in blatant disregard of the separation of powers.11. Levin calls upon all Americans to fight for individual American freedom rather than meekly give in to government tyranny.  Mark Levin is a brilliant American patriot who is doing his best raise the Paul Revere cry to his fellow citizens to the dangers of a runaway softtyranny government.  In the last paragraph of his book, Levin calls on young people to stand up for liberty and against tyranny. I have read all of the Levin books. They are short and are based on sound scholarship. This book deserves a wide readership.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY241ZRCYMU5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451606303#wasThisHelpful","RY241ZRCYMU5V","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am slowly reading through all the murder mysteries by Agatha Christie published by Harper Collins in an attractive paperback format. The covers of these books are beautiful! The Christie series is reasonably priced and will afford readers hours of lighthearted British murder cases. Murder in the Mews was published in 1937. The four cases are:1. Murder in the Mews-A woman is found dead in her apartment without any explanation of whodunit until Hercule Poirot is called in to investigate.2. The Incredible Theft-The story reminds this reviewer of the The Naval Treaty story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The plot deals with the theft of an important letter which will determine whether a politician involved has a future in his government.3. Dead Man's Mirror-A rich old man is found dead in his study. Conflicting reports as to his mood during the day and who among the guests at his estate may have had a motive to slay the chap.4. Triangle at Rhodes-A marital triangle leads to foul murder but theending will surprise you.  A pleasant diversion of old Agatha Christie stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1FWP0BC58JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073990#wasThisHelpful","R2J1FWP0BC58JG","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Henderson the Rain King was published in 1959. The author is Saul Bellow the American Nobel Prize winner in Literature who was born in Montreal in 1915 to Russian Jewish immigrants who eventually migrated to Chicago where the author grew to manhood. Bellow usually deals with intellectual characters living in an urban milieu. Among his great works are Herzog; Dangling Man; Humbolt's Gift; Mr Sammler's Planet and other novels and short story collections.  Henderson the Rain King departs from his usual stories for the following reasons:1. The book takes the hero to Africa a continent which Bellow had not visited at the time of the novel's publication.2.The author is not an intellectual but an Ivy League School millionaire who is a veteran of World War II who has won a Purple Heart for his being wounded in the Mount Cassino campaign in Italy.3. The  subject matter is ribald and Rabelaisian as the 55 year old Eugene Henderson leaves his second wife and family for a vacation in Africa.  The book includes long philosophical and unrealistic talks Henderson conducts with the medically educated King of a local tribe. Henderson confronts a lion and experiences his love of life. He becomes known as the rain king who is able to bring rain to a drought stricken region of Africa.  I prefer Bellow to stay in more familiar territory but this foray into Africa does manifest the author's ability to convey the love and excitement of life well lived. A good read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSJ1TCZ2A9XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143105485#wasThisHelpful","R2TSJ1TCZ2A9XM","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The four novels contained in this volume I of a projected three volume set by The American Library are very entertaining to all of us who enjoy hardboiled crime works. The quartet of notable novels from the 1950 s are :a. Filled with a relish for the English language. MacDonald enjoys the use of metaphor that puts him near Raymond Chandler in this literary choice.b The evil which exists under the sunbaked landscape of Southern California is made to come alive in Macdonald's brilliant prose.c. Chapters are short and to the point. Their is little in the stories which is extraneous to the development of the plot.d. The author's stories are much easier to follow than those of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett two behemoths of the American school of hardboiled crime works.e Macdonald's characters are well drawn.f. The plots deal with blackmail of the wealthy and corrupt, family secrets which are brought to life and the violent and dark underbelly of life in and around Los Angeles.g. Lew Archer (his name derived from Macdonald's affinity for General Lew Wallace, author of Ben-Hur, and the last name Archer which refers us to Miles Archer the murdered partner of Raymond Chandler's Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon.  The American Library edition is well produced. It features a detailed chronology of Macdonald's life, letters from the author and pages of footnotes which illuminate the text. Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33F0VER4YDYFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598533762#wasThisHelpful","R33F0VER4YDYFY","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mad Men will hook you! It is a great drama series. What makes it so?Writing-Director and Writer Matthew Weiner has written smart scripts which remind this reviewer of the prose encountered in a good novel!Acting-Headed by the outstanding Jon Hamm who plays the tormented ad man Don Draper the series sparkles with acting from each of the featured actors. These actors give their roles depth and make you care about what happens to them.Costumes and Sets-Evoke the period of the late 1950s and early 1960's in beautiful pastel colors. The period detail is astounding! Evocative of the palettes drawn in his motion pictures by Alfred Hitchcock and his talented team.Plot-Sterling Cooper and its ad men and support staff show us how an ad agency worked in the days of male chauvinistic behavior in the office; constant cigarette smoking and the crass sexism and racism of this earlier era in American history.

"This book is based on the historical docudrama series Legends and Lies: The Real West hosted by Bill O'Reilly of FOX news TV fame. The book was actually written, though, by David Fischer.  It is devoted to chapters on the following legends of the American West: Daniel Boone; Davy Crockett; Kit Carson; Black Bart; Wild Bill Hickok;Bass Reeves the real Lone Ranger; General Custer; Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley; Jesse James ; Doc Holliday; Billy the Kid; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid whose stories are fascinating!

"Last year I enjoyed the STARTZ production of Outlander series. The eight books written so far deal with the lives of time traveler Claire Randall who travels back to eighteenth century Scotland. She soons weds Jamie Fraser a Highland land who joins the rebellion of Bonnie Prince Charlie the Stuart pretender to the English throne. This revolt ended in disaster for the Highlanders at the Battle of Culloden Moor in 1745. An Echo in the Bone is the seventh novel in the series. Like all the others it is huge logging 814 small print pages! The book recounts the adventures of Claire and Jamie following the burning of their home in Fraser's Ridge North Carolina. They become involved in the American Revoutlon fighting for the colonists against the might of Great Britain. All of the characters we have come to love in the series return! Such characters as Ian the nephew of Jamie who lives with the Mohawks; Lord John the British friend of Jamie; William the son of Jamie who becomes a British officer; Fergus the French lad Jamie rescued from a Paris brothel and several other fascinating people! Diana Galbadon is adept at love scenes which are tastefully presented; battle accounts and good information on eighteenth century medicine, clothing, Scottish culture, agriculture, bird life and many other subjects with which the author is familiar. Gabaldon is a great historical romance adventure novelist. Her work will delight you and fill up hours of delightful reading1 Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RG1BBIIVYSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440245680#wasThisHelpful","R29RG1BBIIVYSS","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Milhous Nixon was born to Quaker parents in Southern California in 1913. He graduated from Duke Law School and served as a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Nixon became a congressman and United States Senator. He served two terms as Vice-President under Nixon and after losing to JFK in the presidential contest of 1960 returned to California. Nixon lost the gubernatorial contest for the golden state in 1962. Many Cassandras thought he was done in politics. Nixon returned to win the 1968 race for the White House against Vice-President Humphrey and slaughtered George McGovern in the 1972 reelection battle. Nixon was forced to resign from office in August 1974 as a result of the Watergate scandal. He became an elder statesman and author of several books on world leaders and issues.  All of the above facts are well known. What Thomas is able to do is to get inside Nixon's brilliant but flawed personality. Nixon hated the eastern elite epitomized by communist spy Alger Hiss whom he was able to bring down. He also hated the press and preferred foreign issues to domestic affairs. While in office his administration did inaugurate the EPA. Nixon was a crafty Machiavellian politician who was also personally kind and sensitive to the needs of others. He loved his wife Pat and his daughters Julie and Tricia but was adverse to wearing emotions on his well tailored sleeve.  Evan Thomas has written a good book which all persons interested in Nixon or American politics will enjoy./ Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TW2KQJDZEQT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995368#wasThisHelpful","R1TW2KQJDZEQT7","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father was a combat veteran of the Battle of the Bulge. I am proud of his service along with all the others who fought for freedom against tyranny. As a longtime student of World War II and the holocaust this new book on Ravensbruck stands out! Sarah Helm,a British author, has done holocaust studies a favor by her detailed study of the little known atrocities which occurred in this hellish SS run camp. Ravensbruck is located about fifty miles north of Berlin. The Nazis opened it in 1939 to serve as a detention camp for asocials, lesbians, freedom fighters against Nazi tyranny and foreign nationals held in detention. Almost 50,000 women from over twenty nations would die in this hellhole. Death came by starvation, gunshot, gassing and disease. The famous ""rabbits"" were women forced to undergo terrible medical experiments which ruined their health and in many places led to their deaths. About ten per cent of the inmates were Jewish.  This book is not an exercise in dry statistics since Sarah Helm tells the stories of many of the women who spent time in this Dantean hell on earth. The book is quite lengthy running to over seven hundred pages but its grim story needs telling. Kudos to Helm and her research and to the memory of the brave women who died at Ravensbruck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T08SJ7I99JLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038552059X#wasThisHelpful","R2T08SJ7I99JLM","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saul Bellow grew up in Chicago though born in Montreal.  He emerged from Jewish culture and was one of the most intellectually and gifted authors in American literary history. The Penguin Classics Edition contains three good stories by Bellow.  The Bellarosa collection is a humorous story of the attempts made by Harry Fonstein to thank Broadway producer Billy Rose for helping him to escape from Fascist Italy. The story is narrated by a  man who has known the Fonsteins for many years. An interesting story about Jewish life at them midcentury in a New York milieu which no longer exists.A Theft is a story about Clara Velde a wealthy, beautiful and much married woman who loses a jewel given her by her longtime lover Teddy Regler.The story is told by Bellow with warmth and wisdom.Something to Remember Me By is a Great Depression era story set in Chicago. A young boy is enticed into a sexual encounter in a hotel room by a woman who steals his clothes.  Saul Bellow is always worth reading.

"Swan Song is a collective diary of the final days of the infamous Third Reich. The author is Walter Kempowski (1929-2007) who was a famous German novelist and historian.  Swan Song is the final of ten volumes in which the author used diaries, letters and memoirs to tell the story of Nazi Germany. This volume is 479 riveting pages of first hand accounts of the horrors of the final hours of the 2,007 days of war and murder in the European Theatre of Operations. The material is translated from the German by Shaun Whiteside and published by W.W. Norton Inc.The chronicle provides first hand accounts of the mopping up of Nazi Germany written by persons who were German, Russian, Italian, Polish, English and Americans as well as other nationalities. Many famous names appear in these pages including Winston Churchill; Dr. Albert Scweitzer working as a medical missionary in Africa; Benito Mussolini; Adolf Hitler; Harry Truman; General Dwight Eisenhower; novelist Thomas Mann; German General Keitel and several more. The stories they tell are sad, funny, tragic and heartbreaking. The stories recounted by survivors of the Nazi extermination and death  camps are especially horrible to hear and ponder.

"This fine  murder mystery novel was published in 1934. It features Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot working in tandem with Mr. Satterthwaite the eccentric and wealthy gentleman who often appears in the Harley Quin stories. The case concerns the murder of a clergyman which is Act one of the story. Act two culminates in the murder of a doctor and act three with the murder of a woman in a nursing home. The plot is energized by the young and beautiful girl Hermioine ""Egg"" Lytton Gore. It revolves around the English stage star Charles Cartwright. The book is not overloaded with characters and the plot is easier to follow than in many of Christie's complex novels. It is one of my favorites by the Queen of Crime and is a good novel to begin a relationship with the doyen of murder.

"The Fiery Cross weighs in at 979 text pages in this edition! The large book is the fifth in the series of Outlander novels written by Diana Gabaldon the famous author of historical romance fiction. The action takes place in colonial North Carolina on the eve of the American Civil War. Claire and Jamie Fraser are now middle aged. They live with several family members. During the book, Jamie takes up arms as a leader of the state militia to suppress the Regulator movement. This group demanded fairer taxes and better government in the Royal British colony. The revolt was a foretaste of the impending American Revolution.  The book gives us a good look at life on an eighteenth century farm. Many pages are devoted to medicine procedures and prescriptions as everything from a snake bite to bullet wounds are treated by Dr. Claire Randall Fraser. There are generous accounts of sexual episodes recorded in a tasteful way by Galbadon. The book is good but is too long!

"Joseph Stalin was a cruel and evil man. He was also a person with the ability to move up the slippery slope of political life in the newly formed Soviet Union. Stalin was born in Georgia in 1879; his drunken father was an alcoholic while he worshipped his hardworking and religious mother.Stalin attended a Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tiflis which he hated and left before graduation. He became  bold revolutionary and spent several years in Siberian exile. He became the right hand man of Lenin but prior to the latter's death in 1924 he turned against Stalin. Stalin assumed total control over the Politburo and the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. He murdered millions during the Great Famine and Great Purges of the 1930s. He allied with Hitler in the rape of Poland in 1939 but was attacked by Germany in a massive invasion in 1944. Over 20 million Soviet citizens died in the Great Patriotic War. Stalin ruled the eastern European nations take by his armies during World War II. He died in 1953.  This new biography of the dictator is by Oleg V. Khlevniuk a Soviet scholar of renown. The book is written in an interesting way as alternate chapters deal with the life of Stalin chronologically while the every other chapter deals with the death of Stalin in March, 1953. The book is not as detailed as many other Stalin biographies now on the market. The text is written in a scholarly style which makes it a good resource for teachers of Russian history.

His favorite actress was Barbara Stanwyck and his greatest pleasure was spending time with his family.  As one who has a teeming shelf of books on Hollywood history I consider this Wellman biography as one of my favorites! It is filled with period photographs on almost every page; a  detailed filmography and  a personal touch on the life of the Hollywood icon by his son Bill Jr. Wellman was a good man, an American patriot and an outstanding director. His story is fascinating and worthy of your attention.

"Raymond Chandler was born in Chicago in 1888 but spent most of his youth and young manhood in Great Britain. He attended Dulwich Collejge a fine secondary school near London. He served in the Canadian Army and later in the Royal Air Force during World War I. Chandler moved to California in 1919 where he worked in business and began  career as  a professional writer. His greatest creation is detective Sam Spade. Many of his novels have been turned into movies including The Big Sleep[ with Bogart and Bacall, the Glass Key with Ladd and Lake and The Lady in the Lake. His short stories were published in hardboiled magazines and collections. He had a major drinking problem and was a faithful husband to his wife Cissy who was several years his senior. Chandler loved cats and hated the Hollywood Studio system in which he earned a living as a screenwriter. Chandler is best known for his brilliant use of similies and his graphic painting of Los Angeles between the wars. His plots are weak and quickly forgotten. It is the poetry of his language that we remember and celebrate.  Author Barry Day has compiled many of the best of quotations culled from the works of Chandler and also included many photos of Chandler and the Los Angeles he would have been familiar with during his life. As I read the book I listed many of the quotes from Chandler's pen which I thought to be of interest. A small sampling:""The average ""educated"" American has the all round mental equipment of a fourth form boy in an English public school.""-p. 26""Hemingway with his eternal sleeping bag got to be...tiresome.""-p. 31""Phil Marlow...the shop-soiled Galahad.""-p. 41""I watched the last of the sunlight sneak over my windowsill and drop into the dark slit of the valley.""-p.77""Organized crime is just the dirty side of the sharp dollar.""-p. 86""The swell is as gentle as an old lady singing hymns.""-p. 109""Spring rustling in the air like a paper bag blowing along a concrete sidewalk.""-p. 111""The memory of old cigars clung to its lobby like the dirty gilt on its ceiling...""-p. 115""I smelled Los Angeles before I got to it. It smelled stale and old like a living room that had been closed to long.""-p. 122""Good original screenplays are almost as rare in Hollywood as virgins.""-p. 136""Trouble dwelt in her eyes.""-p. 163""Put some rouge on your cheeks...You look like the snow maiden after a hard night with the fishing fleet.""-p.167""A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window.""-p. 174  This little book is a small gem which is fun to read.

"Diana Preston is a wonderful popular author of historical subjects! The London born and Oxford educated Preston has written about such subjects as The Boxer Rebellion, The Road to Culloden Moore, Antony and Cleopatra and The Lusitania. In this latest volume from her prolific pen she delves into three horrible innovations in warfare which transformed warfare in the twentieth century. During 1915 battle in the air, on land and under the seas was forever changed by:a. The invention of the Zeppelins led to aerial warfare in France and to bombing in England by the German Air Force.  This was a forecast of the Battle of Britain in 1940. The author traces the development of the zeppelins and World War I combat in the skies.b. The use of poison gas by the Germans at Ypres in 1915 led to terrible deaths in the trenches. Poison gas was used by both the Germans and Great Britain during the war.c. The German navy resorted to undersea warfare against shipping in their unrestricted submarine warfare by the U-Boats. The attack on the Lusitania in May 1915 is covered in detail by Preston.  This book is a good study of warfare as we remember the one hundred year anniversary of the tragedy of World War I and the beginning of the bloodiest century in human history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLYYK7V8UFMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620402122#wasThisHelpful","RLLYYK7V8UFMW","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The lives of most professional writers is somewhat dull! Hours spent before a computer or doing research online or in a library is not the stuff of drama. However, the life of Saul Bellow (1915-2005) dispels that perception. Bellow was born in Montreal to Russian Jewish immigrants. His father had a volatile temper but finally made good money in a coal company. When a young boy the family moved to Chicago where Saul grew to adulthood. Bellow was a brilliant lad who was street and book smart. He studied at the University of Chicago and Northwestern studying anthropology and working at his writing craft. Bellow held many teaching posts though he only had a bachelor's degree at such prestigious universities as Princeton, Bard and many others. Bellow was a charming ladies man who wed five times. Three of his wives and his relationships with him are covered in this book which ends in 1964 with the publication of his blockbuster 'Herzog."" Bellow soared to fame with his ""The Adventures of Augie March"" in 1953. SB served six months in the merchant marine in World War II and traveled widely in this period to Europe, Israel and Mexico. Bellow won three National Book Awards, a Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize.  This book by Dr. Zachary Leader an American born professor who teaches in London is a detailed account of the first half of Below's life.All the bitchiness of life among the New York Literary set and academia is captured in these pages. Bellow was less than an angel in his dealings with women and fights with fellow writers. He, Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud were the top Jewish writers of the era. Leader is very detailed in discussing Bellow's family and Jewish culture in the early twentieth century in America. Bellow could speak Yiddish and French learned in his days in Quebec Province. Bellow loved America and his hometown of Chicago and celebrates this culture in his many novels and short stories. He is a cerebral writer willing to experiment and expand the novelistic form. His influences were wide from Dickens to Flaubert to Henry Fielding and many others. The reader awaits for the second volume of this sterling biography of a great American and world caliber author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSMNHNKL4DGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307268837#wasThisHelpful","R3VSMNHNKL4DGP","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Presbyterian minister I was intrigued by Stephen King's novel ""Revival.' The story is narrated by Jamie Morton as he recounts growing up in the rural backwater of Maine in the 1960s. One day a new minister named Charles Jacobs arrives in town to begin his first pastorate. Charles and James become close friends as the preacher wows the youth group with his electric Jesus and ability to make electricity a teaching tool. Rev. Jacobs even heals people until a horrible accident ruins his ministry in Maine. Over the years we see how Jamie becomes a rock guitar player strung out on heroin until he meets up with Rev. Jacobs. This reviewer does not want to reveal the plot as it will decrease the reader's enjoyment of another strong entry. Stephen King is an American icon despite what ivory tower professors may say about his writing style. What a mind this man has as he tells his story. A relatively short novel but one that is hard to put down!

"Ludwig Von Beethoven was born in Bonn on December 16, 1770. His father Johann was a professional musician at the ecclesiastical court of an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. His mother was beloved by Beethoven,. The genius spent years learning the piano under the harsh tutelage of his father and several outstanding teachers. At the age of eighteen he traveled to Vienna to make his reputation as a freelance musician. Beethoven studied with Papa Haydn and met the incomparable Mozart. Fame followed for him as a great pianist and composer of nine symphonies, countless choral and instrumental works and his only opera Fidelio.  Beethoven was a hard man to love and had a complex personality. He was a functioning alcoholic, was sloppy and ugly with a pockmarked face. LVB courted several aristocratic women though he remained a bachelor until death. His was combative and aggressive in business but underneath all he had a good heart. Beethoven suffered greatly from encroaching deafness and stomach ailments. His health was poor throughout his life. Swafford states that three supreme artists represented genius in the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century in Germany: Kant in philosophy; Goethe in literature and Beethoven in music. Along with Shakespeare he towers as one of the greatest geniuses of all time. This long biography of nearly one thousand pages is difficult to read for those like myself who are unable to read music. Swafford spends many pages in a detailed analysis of the major Beethoven works. Nevertheless, the book is outstanding for general readers who want to examine the beautiful and profound music of Beethoven. This is a great biography which every music lover should read and savor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKFLR2I1DFSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061805474X#wasThisHelpful","R1CKFLR2I1DFSS","A1G37DFO8MQW0M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G37DFO8MQW0M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review: CAESAR AMERICANUS: AN AMERICAN CIVIL WAR -INTO TYRANNY by John-Allen PriceOne of my special interests is alternative history. Since childhood I've been a ""what if?"" person. I am overjoyed to discover (thanks to NetGalley) the exceptional independent historian and author John-Allen Price. INTO TYRANNY is the first volume in an incredible alternate rendering of not just the U.S., but Europe, on the eve of World War II. [Socialist France! The U. S. on the verge of Fascism!]Mr. Price not only paints the broad landscape of politics and politicians, of war and peace, of the American economy post-Depression. He also delineates human emotions: greed and respect, aggression and compassion, ego and altruism, grief and surrender, vengeance and hope. His chapters on the American populace's grief at FDR's early and untimely death in 1939 made me weep; it was similar, for me, to the grieving at the assassination of JFK. Even the characters who loom larger than life are still clearly individualized: the late FDR and Hitler, MacArthur and Patton, Hoover, Father Coughlin, Huey Long.INTO TYRANNY is an incredible novel.

"REVIEW:  WE ARE MONSTERS by Brian KirkDon't come to this novel expecting only light-hearted horror [is that an oxymoron?]. WE ARE MONSTERS will inspire you to think, ponder, consider, and wonder. WE ARE MONSTERS is psychological horror, suspense, mystery, thriller. Brian Kirk pulls no punches. Clearly he has researched the spotty and often unpleasant, even ugly, history of mental health ""treatment."" His two opposing protagonists, Dr. Eli Alpert  and Dr. Alex Drexler, are both highly-educated, intelligent, psychiatrists, with experience. But they are so divergent-how can they harmonize? Eli believes in respect, Alex in pharmacology. Indeed, Alex is working on a formula to affect a complete cure from mental disorder.WE ARE MONSTERS poses a conundrum pondered for centuries by great minds:  what constitutes insanity? Who is insane? Who is qualified to determine? What treatment can be effective, and at what cost to the patient?

"Review: THE BONE BOX by Jay AmbergAn archaeological excavation in Turkey uncovers an ossuary with documents possibly dating from the first century A.D. If verifiable, these documents could change both religion and history. Now the race begins, either to translate, expose, and publicize; or to literally and figuratively bury the discovery and discredit the archaeologist. A grieving American businessman is trapped in the middle, coming to Turkey at the behest of the site's philanthropist, but kept very much in the dark as to the recent discovery, its wide-ranging ramifications, and all the hidden agendas involved.I reviewed  a digital copy provided free of charge by Partners in Crime Book Tours, for review and blog tour.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUABZ0KB9ZCK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP7ON9M#wasThisHelpful","RUABZ0KB9ZCK1","A81S2CYRRJGHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81S2CYRRJGHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

THE ENFIELD HORROR is the first of a trilogy also, set in a bleak New Hampshire landscape where the residents are hardened and taciturn from decades of hard winters, and a failing economy. Up in the woods, violent storms have uncovered a long-abandoned hunting lodge. Abandoned, but not uninhabited, the lodge appears newer and newer, attracting the attention of hikers. Unfortunately for area residents, that which had been confined deep inside the lodge has now been released, and it's very, very hungry.THE ENFIELD HORROR presents an entity new to me, sentient and willful.

"REVIEW: CRIMSON SHORE by Douglas Preston & Lincoln ChildI am ecstatic to discover with CRIMSON SHORE that  my decades of fascination with the elusive, eccentric, and deep FBI Special Agent A. F. X. Pendergast (of New Orleans) has returned, after 2014's BLUE LABYRINTH (which I still haven't completed). CRIMSON SHORE unfolds with the high quality and puzzling multiple mysteries of which Pendergast is past master. Incited by a theft case at the isolated Massachusetts lighthouse residence of a sculptor and oenophile. Where the useless police chief is clueless, Pendergast uncovers mystery after mystery, this time allowing his ward Constance Greene to accompany him in the investigation.The small Massachusetts community near the sculptor' s home immediately reminded me of Lovecraft' s Innsmouth, that fishy seaside community, and indeed, as Pendergast and Constance soon discover, Exmouth has over the centuries been noted for its contingent of evil, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Pendergast uncovers evidence of demonisn and a 19th century ship disappearance. Quickly it's  evident that the wine theft was not the point, but a cover-up for the actual theft.. .and the brutal and bizarre murders continue.I gladly reviewed a digital ARC generously provided by the authors and publisher via NetGalley, for review purpose only, at no remuneration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAUPTB1RUZ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIDJ02A#wasThisHelpful","R1DAUPTB1RUZ3H","A81S2CYRRJGHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81S2CYRRJGHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"REVIEW: SENTINELS by Matt ManochioAuthor Matt Manochio debuted with THE DARK SERVANT in 2014, a novel which subsumed contemporary suburbia into Teutonic medieval legend, and consequently scared me senseless. In SENTINELS, he tackles an ugly historical era and turns it inside out. Reconstruction in the American South was probably, along with the Civil War, the most widespread brutal period in U.$  history. In SENTINELS, the horror is both man-made [ignorance, bigotry, jingoism, the Ku Klux Klan] and otherworldly: unearthly, destroying both friend and foe, good folks and bad. But there are also strong characters, such as Sheriff's Deputy Noah Chandler and freedman Toby Jenkins, whose integrity shines in an era of dross.

"NOVEMBER MOD READ: THE PROFESSOR by Robert BaileyTHE PROFESSOR is an incredibly polished, truly larger-than-life novel. I'm not fond of converting books to film, but the nature of this novel is so vast that in itself, it resembles the Big Screen. From the first episode, I felt as if I viewed the events, not visualized them. Secondly, there's so much here that in a lesser hand than author Robert Bailey's, would have been rendered trite and flat, two-dimensional. Good VS. Evil. Greed vs. Common humanity. Lust vs. Integrity. Instead, it is all fully rendered, consuming, encompassing, and engrossing.I won't go into deep detail--the novel speaks for itself--but you owe this immense reading experience to yourself. According to the author note, Mr. Bailey went through 3 complete rewrites. Whatever he did produced a seamless and perfect narrative. I can't speak to the legal matters, nor to the Alabama settings, but characterization rings true and powerful, and the pace, especially during the trial, is rapid-fire.

"Review: SHUNNEDThis novel, a literary exploration of the inroads of the pharmaceutical industry and of a marriage after one of its foundations has been knocked asunder, has strong and intentional overtones resonating of Nathaniel Hawthorne' s classic tale ""The Scarlet Letter"" (the minister's wife commits a crime, is jailed, then shunned and ostracized; the CEO' s surname is Dimsdale; the community is small and insular). Yet throughout I was constantly reminded of the Old Testament Book of Hosea, in which a humble, godly prophet is commanded by God to forgive and forgive and forgive his philandering wife, demonstrating mercy. In SHUNNED, Baptist minister Amos experiences the call to prophet role following the suicide of his son John due to an overdose of antidepressant medication. Simultaneously his wife Carrie experiences a call to activism, vandalizing  the local pharmaceutical plant, being jailed instead of receiving community service. The ""A"" on her jail uniform, for her surname, symbolizes the immediacy and extent of her ostracism from a community which ignores her very present grief and labels it insanity.SHUNNED is a very thought-provoking tale, not easily overlooked, nor forgotten.I reviewed a digital copy, generously provided by the author, via NetGalley, for review purpose only, at no remuneration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGD9OGG72UIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QO4EEK#wasThisHelpful","RIGD9OGG72UIV","A81S2CYRRJGHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81S2CYRRJGHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His choices now are three: bill even more hours for the calendar year of 2008, providing yet more immense profits for the partners; resign; or get revenge. He chooses extortion, of the managing partner and the other senior partner, and corporate espionage on a potential client bank, of an account handled by the man who is David's ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend. He seems determined to take down everyone who's crossed him!I enjoyed the novel, but I was never sure how to feel or think about the protagonist, David Friedman. I tried to empathize, but he often seems so emotionless and robotic [witness his ""speech"" about how everything is business, all choices are actually business decisions (I.e., survival, money, greed, ""getting ahead."") And all this delivered to his former girlfriend] . Then, as revenge against his firm, he takes on a client he should have left well enough alone. It's almost like he's living out a death wish.I chose FORECLOSURE as the October Mod Read at Goodreads group Anything Legal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMERB5HILPS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RC0NFI#wasThisHelpful","R2MMERB5HILPS3","A81S2CYRRJGHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81S2CYRRJGHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Set in a West Africa treatment center in the jungle, staffed specifically (and allegedly) to treat Ebola symptoms and strive to mitigate the suffering.

"This book could use some editing.  I'm not sure if it's because she's not originally from America, or if it's just bad altogether.  With that being said, I was rather disappointed in this book's delivery.  While I don't expect anything profound from a supermodel, I do expect to be somewhat impressed.  I'm not a supermodel (most of the audience isn't), so it would have been interesting to read what her supermodel life is like - the trials and tribulations of a supermodel. While I do appreciate her vulnerability, the advice she gives is rather basic.  For instance, she had on shoes that was too big, and one flew off her foot as she was on the runway.  She smiled and walked on her toes, with one shoe on and one shoe off.  Well, I've had a shoe fly off before and life goes on, you can't just sit there and cry.  ""Smile"" is rather basic advice.  Maybe this book would have been better suited for a teenage audience?  (Her writing style is a little choppy, so it doesn't necessarily flow like Louise Hay's books or Doreen Virtue's books.  I would expect a published work to be polished, and the more I think about it, the more I think that this should be geared towards teenagers, or people with less life experience.)What I did enjoy and found impressive was her background and how she got in Dolly magazine.  This is what stood out for me.  Sharing more of those types of things (like her eyes being burned on shoot) would have made this book stand out from the rest of the other hundreds of thousands of self help books on the market.  Writing about a shoe falling off, not so much.  As a woman, I feel like most women have had that happen to them at some point in their lives.  I would not be opposed to reading ""Embrace Yourself"" though because her vulnerability is engaging and she is likable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPI5P7VF3SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401941893#wasThisHelpful","R2UPI5P7VF3SX","A1QI6PI0HH4H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QI6PI0HH4H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the plot twists.  I always try to stay one step ahead of whatever I'm reading, and I couldn't do it with this book.  The ten horses had me guessing until we find out what that meant.I can overlook a few typos.  Unfortunately, there were some major issues with this book, which discredits Kendra as an English teacher.  I don't remember the exact passage, but I think she was discussing something along the lines of  ""Janette and Pia . .  . her brother"", referring to Justin.  If that's the case it should have been ""Pia and Janette...her brother"" (as the pronoun refers to the noun directly in front of it).  There were other issues, but this is the most glaring one.I knew that this was the fifth book of five, so it was disappointing that the very last thing the author has us focus on is Carl's letter, which we don't even hear his side (Kendra reads the letter fade to black).  What a cop out!  So there's no good excuse for them not to have stayed together, but what was his excuse?  We, the audience, would like to know.  Don't just leave us hanging.  This was a good book until the lame end about Carl.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FY4HT8NG0TLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8Q7VO4#wasThisHelpful","R1FY4HT8NG0TLS","A1QI6PI0HH4H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QI6PI0HH4H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the plot twists.  I had an inkling who the murderer was, but for different reasons than Kendra laid out.  (I wanted to scream when it was Trish with Rollins. Really, Trish?)Answers to Discussion Questions (which is a nice addition to this particular book):I enjoyed high school.  I'm a nerd and love learning:-)Kendra is a nosy, busy body, so I can only imagine that she had those traits in high school.  She reminds me of Lt. Columbo.  She's very persistent and pesky.  It isn't that surprising that she wasn't all that popular.Yes, Kendra had reason to be on high alert with Carl spending time with his ex.No, as Kendra didn't have secrets.Kendra was wrong and obviously doesn't listen to reason, but there wouldn't be a story if she did the right thing.I'm undecided on this question.  Some people can change, but most people don't.I was a little surprised that she was conflicted because she knew she was going to get married and get payback on Lynette for putting her in that mermaid bridesmaid's dress.  I think she just didn't want to marry Carl.  Had someone better offered her a proposal she definitely would have swooped up on it.  I have turned down a marriage proposal or two and it was because of the guys in question.  I think Kendra got caught up in the right now.  Rollins isn't the one either.It's a no brainer, what the heck is Trish doing with Rollins?  URGH!!!

"I was laughing all throughout the book. These books (the Kendra Clayton books) are quickly read in about 12 hours, give or take an hour or two.  As usual, the perp is not who you think it is, and that's what I love about the series - the plot twists.  What I don't particularly care for is the unbelievable or unrealistic endings, which usually consists of the antagonist's unlucky demise, so I took away a star for that, otherwise it's a great book.

"I've followed Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton and other female protagonists for years/decades, the Kendra Clayton series is the first-time I've been not only introduced to an African American ""detective"", but also to a predominantly African American community. It was very refreshing. Although I must say I was vaguely reminded of Sue Grafton/Kinsey Millhone when Kendra wrote down what she knew - the cast of suspects.I liked the pace of the novel and I liked how Kendra would reflect back on events to catch the audience up. I've not seen that technique used before, so that was rather refreshing as well.I thought the ending was rather unlikely, however, but given how the audience was previously acclimated to dangerous stairs it was possible.

"Ah, yes.  It all started a couple of weekends ago with a Dirty Harry marathon.  He had me at, ""Do you feel lucky, punk, well do ya?""  I've been bitten with the love bug ever since.  He always plays a loner (from the movies I've seen) and the strong, manly type, a man of few words, but wise words they are.In Unforgiven he still plays the strong, silent type, where he personifies loyalty to his friends and gentleness to the woman who got cut up.  He's noble in his revenge and he gets down to business and even has compassion for someone he shoots.  This movie along with the Dirty Harry movies makes me want to see everything he's ever starred in or has directed.  I'm glad he's still alive and hopefully he has a few more movies left in him.

"I'm still reading other OM books to compare this one too, but I was having a hard time following the text in this book and it isn't very captivating.  (My professor was an OM genius and everything he taught was fascinating.  He made the topics come alive.  Although, he didn't necessarily follow the order of the book.  For instance, some chapters he used the book's PowerPoints, and for some chapters, like the one on forecasting, he used his own PowerPoint notes.)Also, this book skipped topics and then came back to them, which I found rather annoying.  I would rather the topics be explained entirely first versus bouncing around.  Which brings me to this, a lot of times the author would say, ""we'll cover this later/to be discussed later"".  Why bring up a topic to only say more about it later?  That's a general pet peeve of mine for the textbooks that I've read that does this and so I have a negative bias already.  These ""to be discussed later"" statements tend to be in quantitative books.  I would think that there would be another (and better) way to present concepts in a more cohesive and creative manner, but I have never tried to articulate OM or accounting or finance or Econ on paper, so maybe this is the best that these authors can do when it comes to explaining quantitative concepts?

"""The whole world should be demilitarized"" - truer words were never spoken.  Yet, living in the world as I do, that's just not realistic (yet).  I am inspired by this book as it has many ideals to aspire to.  The Dalai Lama stands for peace for all living creatures.  I'm not sure that I'm there yet.  Ideally I would like to not step on a roach or spider should one cross my path, but that is not guaranteed because a lot of it is muscle reflex and muscle memory and instinct.Also, he tells of a story where his friend was held captive and the friend told him that he was fearful that he was in danger. The danger was not safety related like many people would suspect, but the danger was fear of losing compassion for his oppressors.  I don't know if I'm there yet - to have compassion on someone oppressing me.  Great ideals to aspire to.The only reason why this book didn't get five stars is because the introduction and some of the text lost me at times (a little dry), but I really do like this book and what the Dalai Lama stands for (never give up).21 Books 21 Days Challenge 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2I7XPVVHA6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590300017#wasThisHelpful","R3L2I7XPVVHA6N","A1QI6PI0HH4H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QI6PI0HH4H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The twelve year existence of the Third Reich is a fascinating subject to study.  That such an advanced/modern culture could so wholly and quickly immerse itself into following an absurd ideology that would inevitably lead to the deaths of millions of its own people (let alone those of other nations) is quite mind-boggling.  Understandably, most of the research, books and documentaries are devoted to the Nazi hierarchy and the military  in other words, evil men.  Anna Maria Sigmunds WOMEN OF THE THIRD REICH offers a provocative look at a select group of women who were nestled in the black heart of the Nazi regime.WOMEN OF THE THIRD REICH provides a thorough look into the lives of eight women who were either married to or closely associated with Nazi leadership:Carin Goering  married to Hermann Goering until her death in 1931.Emmy Goering  second wife to Hermann Goering (following Carin Goerings death)Magda Goebbels  notorious spouse of Joseph GoebbelsEva Braun  mistress and eventual wife of Adolf HitlerLeni Riefenstahl  talented German filmmaker/producer/photographer and actressGeli Raubal  neice adored by Adolf HitlerHenriette von Schirach  wife of Hitler Youth leader and eventual Reich Governor of ViennaGertrud Scholtz-Klink  Head of the Nazi Womens LeagueWhat I liked about this book was that the author provides a well-researched and intimate view into the lives of these women and, in some cases, the considerable power they wielded.  The books presentation is simple; a concise introduction that summarizes the role of women in the Third Reich, followed by individual chapters dedicated to each of the eight women.  The chapters read less like a story and more like thoroughly detailed bullet points that chronologically capture significant events in the lives of these women.  As much as Ive read about World War II over the last 30+ years, I found this book providing me with a treasure trove of new information and a better understanding of individuals who are generally identified as tag-alongs to the men they are associated with.  While I knew Hermann Goerings devotion to his first wife Carin led to him building his infamous hunting estate in her name (Carinhall), Ive never found anything substantive written about Carin Goering until I read this book.  Likewise, the notoriously evil Magda Goebbels (whose total devotion to Hitler led her to poisoning her six children) was also a feminist pioneer in Germany.  The information provided fills a lot of gaps and certainly answers a lot of questions, like the alleged romantic ties Hitler supposedly had with his niece Geli Raubal.  Sigmund digs deep into each womans life and reveals many intricate and intimate details that made it easy to understand why these particular individuals were chosen as subject matter.  It is quite clear that the mind of a Nazi wife was no less evil.  The lives of each are extremely varied in many ways, with Leni Riefenstahl being the most interesting, in my opinion.  Ive known about Riefenstahls ground-breaking work in film and shes responsible for providing the iconic footage of Jesse Owens (watch Olympia to see her handiwork).  Of all the women covered, she stood out as being less dependent on Hitler (as her post-war life would prove).  Accompanying each chapter are several pictures, many of which Ive never seen before.I really liked this book.  I appreciated the unique topic and the rich content.  WOMEN OF THE THIRD REICH is a significant addition to my World War II library as it details a lesser-known, but no-less significant, side of the Third Reich.  If I were to find any fault in this book, it would be the omission of some women, such as the wife of Heinrich Himmler or the aviation pioneer Hanna Reitsch (although she is mentioned in the summary at the books beginning).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GEQ6LXFXM88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1553211057#wasThisHelpful","R17GEQ6LXFXM88","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still have the original Magic 8 Ball I received one Christmas in the 1970s  it functions perfectly and it still captures the attention of my daughters.  While the DISNEY FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALL captures the basic features of the original, I find it lacking the overall quality and appeal of my 40 year old Magic 8 Ball.WHAT IT IS:A Disneyfied version of the standard Magic 8 Ball that has a metallic, baby-blue surface, encrusted with snowflakes, the Disney and Frozen logos and a multi-sided die inside that reveals some of the standard Magic 8 Ball answers with some additional Frozen-inspired answers (hugs and happy stuff).WHAT WORKS:- One word:  Frozen.  I have 2 young daughters  they love the movie and pretty much anything associated with it.  While I am not a fan of the tacky habit successful corporations (Disney, NASCAR, NFL, etc.) have when it comes to splattering their logos on every single thing produced these days, I have to realize this is what todays of kids want (and expect).  My Magic 8 Ball comes across so pedestrian and utilitarian when compared to the FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALL.  Considering the essence of the original Magic 8 Ball concept are present (and, thankfully, a few of the original answers on the multi-sided die)  I will certainly applaud the effort of making much-loved items from my childhood relevant for my kids.NIT-PICKING:- The quality.  Why does my 40 year old toy look and feel better than something made in 2015?o The original 8 Ball is seamless  aside from the answer window at the bottom the entire surface is smooth. The FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALL has a gaudy seam running around the side.o The originals liquid is blue, but toned down enough to easily read the answers on the die.  The FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALL liquid is too blue and makes seeing the answers more difficult.o The original has the number 8 imprinted (angled) in a place where one can see it when the 8 Ball is standing (resting in place on the answer window).  The FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALLs 8 is smack dab on top  you have to be over it to see it.o 8-Balls are black, plain and simple.  If youre going to color it anything but black, dont call it an 8 Ball.  Maybe Disneys Frozen Magic 2 Ball would have been more appropriate (likewise, incorporating a Disney Cars theme would generate the Magic 3 Ball).For those parents who want their children to experience a slice of their childhood, you take what you can.  The FROZEN MAGIC 8 BALL is not as good as the original Magic 8 Ball, but it covers the basic elements that allow kids to share a toy their parents may have enjoyed when they were kids  something I certainly appreciate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5EK6XKO4GEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVIFUU2#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5EK6XKO4GEP","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, I purchased the original Moon in My Room as a unique night-light for my daughters and it was awesome; they loved it.  Subsequent Uncle Milton products Ive accumulated (Earth in My Room, Rainbow in My Room, Torch in My Room and Mars in My Room) are certainly well-received, but not comparable to the quality of the Moon version.  The SUPER MOON IN MY ROOM version has some nice attributes that make it a worthy upgrade.WHAT IT IS:An accurately replicated version of one side of the moon that mounts to a wall and has several unique light and sound functions that realistically brings the moon to life.  3 x C batteries are needed for the moons lights and 2 AAA batteries are need for the remote.  There is an outlet on the side of the moon for a power cord (not included).WHY THIS MOON ROCKS:- Its bigger!  The original Moon is 10 tall and 10 wide; SUPER MOON is 13 tall and 13 wide  the increased size makes it more prominent on the wall and generates more light.- The rocky moon surface accurately replicated.  The look and feel of the Moons surface is one of the reasons why this is one of my favorite Uncle Milton products.- While the original Moon product allowed the user to manually display the moons phases, SUPER MOON can be programmed to mirror the exact phases by simply entering the current date on the wall-side of the Moon.- The eclipse mode is what really makes SUPER MOON so cool.  Orange lights under the sides of the moon project light toward the wall in a manner that realistically generate a glowing Sun behind the dark shadow of the Moon.- Multi-purpose remote allows user to decide how they want to present their Moon  eclipse mode, accurate moon phase or any of the 12 moon phases.- Another addition to SUPER MOON is sound:  nighttime (crickets) sounds or the lunar landing.  A switch on the back controls the volume.NIT-PICKING:- The 3-way (off and volume) switch, + and - buttons (for adjusting the date) are on the back (wall) side of the moon and require the moon to be removed from the wall to operate.  I wished this could have been on the side or through the remote.- The sound effects could be better presented as they come across somewhat screechy (high-treble and tinny sounding).Overall, SUPER MOON IN MY ROOM surpasses the quality of the original by being larger and having the ability of replicating the accurate moon phase.  The biggest plus in my opinion is the addition of the eclipse mode because it adds a cool color alternative to the standard chalky-white light the moon generates.  SUPER MOON IN MY ROOM is not only super cool; its also educational.  If I didnt have kids, this thing would definitely be hanging on my home office wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FEN6K890R4VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5CC828#wasThisHelpful","R3FEN6K890R4VW","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two aging Yellow Labs (10 and 11 years old) will still eat anything/everything, but are certainly less active.  While I was originally quite skeptical about the benefits of the slew of high-quality dog food on the market these days, my attitude changed somewhat after my younger Lab overcame a bout with pancreatitis with a change in diet.  SOLID GOLD FIT AND FABULOUS was well-received by my dogs and I really like the ingredients.  Unfortunately, the recommended serving sizes, especially for those with large breed dogs, will likely put a ding in the household budget.WHAT I LIKED:- The ingredients are diverse and natural:  berries, vegetables, grains and fish meal (Alaskan Pollock).  The fish provides a healthy dose of protein and the wide variety of the other ingredients appears quite balanced.- This is the first fish-based dog food Ive tried that doesnt have an overwhelming fishy odor.- The most notable effect of this food are that my dogs coats are softer/silkier.  Ive been purchasing premium food for my dogs over the last several years and aside from the healthier coat, I definitely notice an improvement with their joint health  less hobbling and definitely more energy when climbing stairs and jumping on the bed.  Eating FIT AND FABULOUS maintains this positive trend.- The progressive switch to this food did not cause any disruption to my dogs digestive systems.THE DOWNSIDE:- In my opinion, the only downside to the FIT AND FABULOUS is the cost.  The recommended portion size for my dogs are up to 5  cups per day (x2).  While we dont need to feed them as much because of their age, I cant imagine how many bags of this food wed need to purchase a month if they were younger and eating more than they already do.  The cost may be manageable for those with small breed dogs, but large breed owners will definitely take a hit (the largest bag is only 24lbs.).I found FIT AND FABULOUS to be a nice change-up from the premium dog food we generally use.  Although I will definitely add it to the dogs menu occasionally as a treat, the cost will likely deter this from being a go-to food source.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPH8XCEDO3CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGNKQ#wasThisHelpful","RUPH8XCEDO3CA","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally, I prefer stainless steel vacuum mugs for several reasons:  They tend to insulate contents better, are easier to clean, more durable, simple in design and more aesthetic in appearance.  The ALADDIN 16oz STAINLESS STEEL VACUUM MUG has several positive attributes; it is leak-proof and visually appealing (the Marina color is simply beautiful).  Unfortunately, the mugs looks and sealing prowess didnt override some of the issues I experienced.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE MUG:- 16oz means more java for the morning commute.- Tall, subtle hour-glass design is nice looking and the color options are quite exquisite.- The screw-on lid has a nice, snug fit that seals well.  When the flip lid is fully closed, the mug lives up to its claim of being leak-proof.- For the most part, I like the simplicity of the lid design and how the flat flip-arm uniquely provides access to the mugs contents.  The rubber edging around the flip-arm provides a nice contact surface that allows easy access to the mugs contents (those with longer fingers should be able to push the arm up with the thumb and flip it back with the index finger  one hand access).- The stainless steel design makes this a very rugged mug that can take a beating without hindering its functioning.  Drop the mug in the parking lot getting out of your car?  No problem.  Taking a hammer to this thing wont matter; the mugs contents remain intact and sealed shut.WHAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THE MUG:- Leak-proof, not drip-proof.  While Im glad (and fully expect) such a mug to keep its contents from spilling all over me, it doesnt factor the excess liquid that pools into the drinking area.  This pool of liquid remains when the drinking access is closed and remains free to dribble down the sides of the mug and accumulate in your vehicles cup-holder.  I find this bothersome and I dont believe my co-workers view the coffee rings on my khakis as me starting a new fashion trend.- The bottom of the mugs interior is flat, not bowl-shaped; an angle is created around bottoms edge that is harder to keep clean.  While the mug and lid are dishwasher-safe, I prefer to hand-wash travel mugs because they are used daily and the bottle brush doesnt reach the edging very well.- The flip-lid is nice, but when driving, I find a button or trigger much easier for single-handed/mindless operation.  Playing with the flip arm, combined with eying the mugs lid for excess liquid pooling doesnt make this an ideal travel mug for me as too much attention is going to the mug every time I drink from it.- The mug doesnt live up to its claim of keeping liquids hot for 4 hours  hot coffee was tepid within 2 hours.- The bottom of the mug could use a skid-proof surface.  The subtle curvature along the sides of the mug provided and adequate grip for my large hands, but I can see this mug offering a less sure grip for smaller hands (or even dry hands).  I think knurling around the mug would provide an effective gripping surface without killing the mugs attractive design/color.The ALADDIN 16oz STAINLESS STEEL VACUUM MUG is definitely a step in the right direction with its rugged design and stylish appearance.  While I find the mug visually pleasing and functional in many ways, there are several issues that hinder its overall quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SL02WD67VJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142JR5YI#wasThisHelpful","R18SL02WD67VJJ","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WOODS 6-OUTLET SURGE PROTECTOR WALL ADAPTOR certainly makes sense in more ways than one.  First, you get 750 joules of protection that is certainly decent for general appliances (lamps, clock radios and small appliances).  Second, the standard 2 receptacle wall outlet is multiplied x 3.The design of this adaptor is simple and functional.  I really like the ability of tripling the capacity of a standard wall outlet to accommodate beside lamps and clocks.  Additionally, the extra outlets always allow a space for emergency charging of a cell phone or tablet (every outlet in our house seems to have something charging on it at some point each day).  Each outlet has its own sliding cover that keeps out dust or prying kid fingers when not in use.  A red/orange light indicates when the unit is on (plugged-in and functional).  750 joules is more than adequate for this moderately priced surge protector (>600 joules is considered as offering better protection).  A $100k warranty for any items damaged while plugged into the adaptor is offered by the company is certainly a sweetener.While I personally prefer more protection for my computer and televisions, I like the general protection THE WOODS 6-OUTLET SURGE PROTECTOR WALL ADAPTOR provides for most items plugged into my walls.  I find this adaptor to be a good value in terms of functionality and protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6HZDTCENAPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHML1W#wasThisHelpful","R1B6HZDTCENAPA","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a big fan of functional gadgets and with so many gadgets to choose from, you quickly realize there is certainly a lot of junk out there.  The SOG POWERLOCK TRAVELER certainly proves itself with its functionality, design and solid construction.WHAT YOU GET:- The packaging only consists of the multi-tool itself and a rugged nylon carrying pouch with a Velcro closure and a solid belt clip.  The back of the package details each tool and additional specs.- The satin polished stainless steel tool itself is 4.6 closed (7 unfolded) and weighs slightly over 9 oz.- The POWERLOCK TRAVELER has the following tools (13):o Plierso Hard wire cuttero Wire crimperso File (3 sided)o Phillips head screwdrivero Gripper (curved cut-outs on each of the plier arms)o Large flat head screwdrivero Small flat head screwdriver (shaped to also be used as a can opener)o Scissorso Square/Robertson drive (Scrulox)o  driveo Medium flat head screwdriver (with a cut-out that can be used as a bottle opener)o One outer side of the handles serves a rulerWHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MULTI-TOOL:- First and foremost, I liked the solid construction.  The POWERLOCK TRAVELER is well-made and this was evident when I saw the sprockets engaging as I opened the tool the first time.  While my tool opened quite smoothly, it could not be flipped open like a butterfly knife (as seen in the products video).- The 8 tools that fold out of the handles (4 on each handle) not only open smoothly, but can be locked into place with a spring lock that catches a cut-out on each of the tools.  This ensures the tool wont unexpectedly close or move when in use (a problem with many multi-tools).- The tools provided are designed for industrial use, but are handy for almost any situation.- The satin finish, while looking sharp, was a little slick for me.  While the weight of the multi-tool was hefty enough to ensure a decent grip, I would prefer some sort of knurling on the handles.- The pliers are heavy-duty.  The lack of a spring in the pliers bothered me at first, but the solid construction and smooth operation quickly eliminated that issue.  The scissors are spring-loaded, of descent size and cut well.A WORD ABOUT THE TSA:- The POWERLOCK TRAVELER claims to meet TSA specs and is suitable for carry-on.  But, once you hold this tool in your hands, open it up and tap the tip of the pliers, you really start wondering how on earth things like this are allowed and 3.5 oz. of maple syrup isnt (per the TSA website).  One only has to view a prison documentary to see that even a magazine can be transformed into a lethal weapon if one is so determined to have one.  With that being said, Im not so confident that the POWERLOCK TRAVELER is a sure bet as a carry-on item (compounded by the fact that the TSA website clearly states the final decision rests with the TSA officer on whether an item is allowed through the checkpoint).I found the SOG POWERLOCK TRAVELER to be a solid, functional multi-tool designed with common-sense.  SOG is one of the premier manufacturers of such tools and this particular tool solidifies that reputation in my mind.  The individual tools are common and useful for such a wide variety of everyday tasks that the POWERLOCK TRAVELER is something Ill carry daily  I just wont try bringing it on a plane.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LI1341BNHLR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0UR5SG#wasThisHelpful","R2LI1341BNHLR2","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although cinematic portrayals of the Mafia have generated plenty of cringe-worthy moments, reading about the real-life deeds of Nino Gaggis murderous underlings makes the Sopranos appear like a series more suitable for Nickelodeon.  MURDER MACHINE details the rise and fall of a Gambino-family crew that may have been responsible for up to 200 murders and how the legal system finally caught on to them.While I thought this was going to be a book exclusively about the notorious Roy DeMeo, it actually isnt.  MURDER MACHINE presents a broader perspective by illustrating DeMeo and his gang of thugs as an efficiently effective cog in the Gambino family wheel of criminal activity.  The main underlying theme that runs throughout the book is the tempestuous relationship between Nino Gaggi and his nephew, Dominick Montiglio  a relationship that eventually gave law enforcement the tools necessary to shut down the Murder Machine.What I really liked about MURDER MACHINE is that the authors provide readers with a complete picture of Mafia serial killing.  A story that starts with a patriarchal Nino Gaggi essentially stealing his nephew, Dominick, to serve as his pseudo-son and how that tenuous relationship ultimately implodes and ends with Dominick providing prosecutors the nails needed to seal the Gaggi/Demeo coffin.  While the Gaggi/Montiglio team serves as bookends to the storyline; DeMeo and his crew provide the (no pun intended) meat in the middle.  Mustain and Capeci do a good job illustrating the seedy atmosphere of New York in the 1970s that suitably caters to the criminal activity and grisly murders committed by the  DeMeo gang.  The detailing vividly covers events in a manner that make it easy to image the entire storyline in movie-like fashion.  I particularly appreciated this aspect of the book as it thoroughly illustrates the depravity of Gaggi and DeMeos activities.  While some may feel the minutiae bogs the story down, I considered it critical in providing the clarity needed with so many individuals and events meshing together.What separates MURDER MACHINE from so many other Mafia-related books is that it covers a particularly bloodthirsty group of men that seemed wired to kill and did so with relish.  Roy Demeo angle was certainly interesting and it is clear that the man was an insecure thug without a conscience.  DeMeos name gets all the attention, but his crew of underlings were just as bad, if not worse  and all killing was generally done with capo Gaggis unspoken approval.  As long as the money flowed to Gaggi and his superior, Gambino boss Paul Castellano, no one seemed to care who was killed, how they were killed or how the money was made.  The book eerily illustrates how the Mafias tendrils crept into the everyday lives New Yorkers and it didnt just involve drugs or loan-sharking.  DeMeos crew was responsible for stealing thousands of cars  every year.  Paralleling the criminal activities is the slow creep of law enforcement linking murders to Gaggi/DeMeo and eventually building an operation to take them down by getting Mafia underlings to become witnesses for the prosecution.While murder and dismemberment are the books trademarks, I found the machination within the Gambino crime family and the characters involved more compelling.  MURDER MACHINE continuously introduces readers to a cast of characters that keep things interesting.  Aside from the insecurities of Gaggi and DeMeo, there is Dominick Montiglio, the Green Beret who fought with valor in Vietnam only to become embroiled in his uncles criminal empire and eventually succumbing to the debauchery associated with his uncles Mafia life.  It is Dominick who seems to provide much of the books details.  The other characters in the book give the stories color:  Vito Arena, the obese gay hitman, the Gemini Twins and their enthusiasm toward dismembering victims, Dracula the creepy old mobster who actually lived in the apartment where the dismembering was done and a host of other interesting criminals and victims.  In some cases, even friends become prey for the murder machine.  We also get a clear picture of the guiltless lust for power and money exhibited by Mafia members and the paranoia it infuses within the ranks  no one is truly safe or invincible  as most of the characters, including DeMeo, find out.One thing I did find quite interesting is that Richard Iceman Kuklinski is NEVER mentioned in the 458 page book.  My initial introduction to Roy DeMeo was from watching HBOs The Iceman Tapes in which Kuklinski coldly places himself as a major hitman in DeMeos crew of killers.  MURDER MACHINE either debunks Kuklinskis claims or simply ignores his contributions.  Considering the number of unsolved murders/missing people possibly linked to DeMeo, it is still hard to tell whether or not Kuklinski was or wasnt involved with any of the killing.While I didnt find MURDER MACHINE particularly chilling, it does reveal how ruthless the Mafia is and how indiscriminant its members can be when it comes to killing those whove crossed or inconvenienced them.  The criminal activity and the story of those committing the crimes comprise the soul of MURDER MACHINE, not the grisly method of disposing bodies.  This is certainly one of the better Mafia storylines Ive read over the years and it seems to work hand-in-hand with the filthy, run-down image of New York City in the 70s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1XSPM5W93O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0091941113#wasThisHelpful","R1O1XSPM5W93O","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I opened up the THAMES & KOSMOS MASTER DETECTIVE TOOLKIT, I somewhat fondly remembered the little black plastic doctor bag that most kids had in the 70s that held the yellow and red doctor instruments.  I chuckled thinking about how cool that doctors kit really was back then.  My, how times have changed.WHAT YOU GET:- What you get is real, useable stuff that will certainly keep kids interested for the long haul (when they learn how to use everything).  Rather than simply throwing together cheap imitations of the real-thing, the THAMES & KOSMOS toolkit is stocked with many items that may actually lure adults into playing with the kids.  Sure, there are the staple items one would expect:  roll of crime tape, chalk to draw a body outline, magnifying glass, tweezers, detective ID card, Petri Dish, etc.  But, the kit also includes graphite powder for fingerprint dusting, fingerprinting inkpad and print sheets and real plaster-of-Paris to make a mold of footprints.  There is even tape for lifting prints, evidence marker tents and door-sealing tape.- Rather than simply sticking to the detective theme, this toolkit adds a little spy paraphernalia to expand the fun:  code wheels, invisible ink and an ultraviolet flashlight (to read the invisible ink).- Additionally, there is well-presented instruction manual that explains how to use everything in the kit (as well as alternative methods), as well as providing several cases requiring use of all the tools in the kit (the solutions are provided at the end of the manual).- A solidly built, double-snap locking briefcase holds everything inside (not necessarily in place, though).My daughters are obsessed with this toolkit and I love it because it requires them to actually problem-solve using a bunch of cool tools.  No make-believe plastic syringes or stethoscopes here.  While, I feel the kits contents are of descent quality for getting things started, I found myself replacing some of the lower quality items:  a tailors tape in lieu of the paper measuring tape, for example.  I also found myself throwing in some disposable plastic gloves, pen, pencils, zip-lock bags and a sticky note pad.  Essentially, this is a well-designed starter kit that gives you the necessary tools to get things going  there is certainly room to get creative and expand the kit even further.  The only downside was that I couldnt find anything in the kit for replenishing any of the supplies, but the manufacturers website has a link for replacement parts (not sure if replenish and replacement are considered one-and-the-same, though).Overall, the THAMES & KOSMOS MASTER DETECTIVE TOOLKIT is a fun way to get kids active in finding clues and solving problems instead of watching Scooby-Doo doing it on TV.  I am impressed with the contents of this kit and will definitely be looking at the other science kits made by this company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CH9CE9PWUT2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8Z7NS#wasThisHelpful","R1CH9CE9PWUT2O","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These disposable gloves are perfect for a number of tasks.  They are thin enough to maintain a sense of touch without sacrificing toughness.  I frequently bust-through similar products simply trying to put them on my hands  not these gloves  they stretch a great deal more without tearing.  Ambidextrous and latex free, they are the perfect alternative to avoid using the standard rubber surgical gloves that tear apart so easily.While they dont look like it, the gloves are subtly textured with a rough surface that looks smooth at first glance, but offers a solid grip.  Great for household chores involving cleaning chemicals or for changing a vehicles oil.I find the small size gloves perfect for getting my kids involved with household chores  like cleaning their bathroom.

"My 9 year old daughter loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books (and movies) and I figured Captain Underpants would be another illustrated series of stories for her to sink her teeth into  the titles alone are enough to generate interest.  But, the SENSATIONAL SAGE OF SIR STINKS-A-LOT didnt interest her the way I thought it would.My daughter wasnt familiar with Captain Underpants and neither of us knew how shed react.  This was the first book of the series she read and I like that the author didnt punish her for not climbing on-board from the beginning.  A 7-page introductory chapter primed her for SIR STINKS-A-LOT and at no point did she feel that she was out-of-the loop regarding the main characters and the storyline.  I, on the other hand, wasnt so sure that jumping into the world of Captain Underpants at volume 12 was the best move.While these frenetically illustrated books seem to be the rage for young kids these days, I find them a little over-the-top (like a video game on paper).  My daughter generally consumes these type of books at a decent clip, but she felt this story jumped around a bit and found some of the vocabulary a little more challenging.  Overall, however, it was a relatively easy read (with the exception of the Smart Earth chapter, which she described as complicated and weird).  I assumed that Captain Underpants was more a boys book, but it wasnt.  The potty-humor generated by the book is universally appealing to all kids and is sure to generate a gross-out chuckle or two, but nothing extreme.  I admit I was a little surprised to find a number of adult-themed/political issues slipped into a book, but most of these instances were (thankfully) over my daughters head (I still appreciate her political innocence).SIR STINKS-A-LOT elicited a mixed bag of reactions from both my daughter and I.  I found the subtly mature humor and even some of the vocabulary peppered throughout the book to be a little advanced for a child to comprehend.  The much-celebrated flip-o-rama picture sections didnt measure-up and elicited a simple meh from my daughter.  While she found the book somewhat entertaining/funny, it didnt grab her interest like the Wimpy Kid books.  Overall, I wondered whether is particular installment was the best way to introduce her to the series.  After this book, Im wondering if it may have been best to simply start with the first Captain Underpants book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROHAJMBDOLLYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545504929#wasThisHelpful","ROHAJMBDOLLYO","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The supplement frontier is a lot like the California Gold Rush  a world of promise, but only a few may reap any reward, yet we keep digging.  Ive experimented with the promises of (legal) supplements for over 20 years as both a powerlifter (20+ meets) and a bodybuilder (2 shows).  I have trained for competitions with the assistance of supplements and without.  Overall, I have a more pessimistic view toward the actual benefits many supplements claim to offer and Im not sold on CELLUCORS SUPER HD.First of all, common-sense dictates that because everyone is different, no supplement (or natural food item, for that matter) is going to be universally beneficial.  Body constitution, nutrition, exercise, physical/mental health, metabolism, other supplements/medications, stress levels etc. are ingredients that will dictate how positive or negative your bodys reaction will be to supplementation  if any reaction actually occurs.  Just read the microscopic warning label on the bottle of SUPER HD.In discussing my opinion of using SUPER HD, I must factor that Im a healthy 49 year old male working a full time job in a stationary environment.  I get some moderate exercise in each day and lift heavy/intense 2-3 days a week.  Im 511, 210 lbs with ~12% body fat  I drink A LOT of coffee in the morning and again at night and water with every meal.  I eat clean most of the week (emphasis on protein with each meal), but finish an entire extra-large pizza every Thursday as a cheat meal.  My existing supplementation includes daily vitamins and 1-2 powdered protein shakes.  I do take a pre-work out drink on gym days and a BCAA mix during throughout those workouts.  I learned from my bodybuilding comps that fat is a source of energy for me, so I will eat several tbsp. of peanut butter throughout the day to avoid feeling run down/sluggish.I added SUPER HD to my routine and followed the 1 capsule in the morning and 1 at mid-day routine for almost 4 weeks without interruption.  Because of my generous coffee intake, I opted to forgo the suggestion of an additional capsule in the morning for an energy boost.  At no point during my use of SUPER HD did I feel any jitters or buzz after taking a capsule  something I thought might happen when adding it to my coffee consumption.I made notes after each week, expecting to see some change.  The only change noticeable from week to week was internally  my digestive tract.  Im pretty regular in that department, but SUPER HD seemed to want to make me SUPER regular.  I was not a fan of the undesired laxative effect generated by this supplement (thankfully, I telework from home 3 days a week).  Dealing with that issue, I decided to press-on to see if this product had any of the sculpting ability it claims to have.  Id previously used a popular fat burner years ago in the final weeks of prep for bodybuilding to get down to 3% body fat, so I kind of know what I was looking for  it just never happened.  As a matter of fact, after 3 weeks, the only offering I received from SUPER HD was a grumbling gut  something I could certainly do without.Is SUPER HD an ineffective product?  For me, it was.  But, that does not mean that someone else (with their own set of personal/physical ingredients) wont see positive results from using this fat burner.  These supplements are basically chemicals that are mixing with the chemicals in each persons body  the results will certainly vary.  I do believe, however, that in order to get anything positive out of SUPER HD, one has to put in the work ahead of time by developing a metabolism that naturally burns fat through diet and exercise and use the fat burner as a kicker.  The key to remember is that SUPER HD is a SUPPLEMENT, not a cure  it may give you that final burst at the finish line, but I wont run the race for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EPPQY3A6S6WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAPRSP4#wasThisHelpful","R3EPPQY3A6S6WM","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for an affordable high-security shredder that eats CDs and credit cards as well as paper?  I say look no further than the SENTINEL FM120P 12-page shredder.  This shredder is compact powerhouse that should address most any home/small business shredding needs.I was content with my cross cut 6-page shredder, it was fine until I started teleworking and felt the need for higher security shredding and grew tired of the shredders 6-page limitation.  THE SENTINEL FM120P proved to be a real workhorse that addresses every need and comes with a few unexpected, but appreciated features.WHAT I LIKED:- The shredding motor is powerful.  It can handle 12 pages at a time and will grind credit cards and CDs with ease.  While the ability to destroy credit cards is nice, I have a more realistic and pressing need to destroy data CDs than credit cards.  No need to pull staples or worry if you fail to remove a standard paper clip  the FM120P chews them up with ease (just dont let the larger paperclips go through).  The shredding face has 3 designated slots for paper, credit cards and CDs.  The user interface is a simple 3-way slide for forward, reverse and stop.- I like the security this shredder offers.  The resulting shred-waste is not comprised of small strips, but pellet-sized curls that easily pour out of the bin and can simply be swept into a dust pan if they spill on the floor (unlike the cross-cut paper scraps that require a vacuum if spilled on the floor).- The shredding bin is a 5 gallon drawer that easily slides in and out.  A window on the middle/front of the drawer gives you an at-a-glance idea of how full the drawer is.  Most personal shredders Ive owned required me to lift the shredding motor off the bin to see if it was full and this act usually resulted in paper dust and shreds spilling on the floor, even when the bin wasnt full.  I like the safety feature that turns the shredder off if the drawer is opened.- The weight of the shredder is displaced so it isnt top-heavy, like most others Ive owned.  Additionally, the 4 roller-wheels on the bottom make the FM120P conveniently portable.  At roughly 20 tall, 10 wide and 13 long, it certainly isnt a space-hog.- While the shredder is powerful, it is no louder than my 6-page shredder (manufactured lists noise output at 72 db).- Ease of use.  Other than occasionally lubricating the blades by feeding a little shredder-oil into the paper/credit card/CD slots, just plug this thing in and start shredding.Overall, I would expect to see many of the features on the FM120P on an expensive office shredder.  I am impressed with the performance, presentation and value of this shredder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGG7M9V85SIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ1VZGY#wasThisHelpful","R3FGG7M9V85SIJ","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After replacing my old, but much beloved XTerra with a new one, I was looking for an affordable solution to biking with my young daughters as I was no longer willing to stuff our bikes into the back of the vehicle (not only trying to avoid unnecessary damage, but I was tired of constantly removing/re-attaching the front tire of my mountain bike every time).  Living in a town that is over-the-top bicycle friendly, I received plenty of recommendations for a decent bike rack that wouldnt force me to install a trailer hitch and settled on the THULE PASSAGE TRUNK MOUNT CARRIER (for 3 bikes).  For my particular needs (short trips), this bike rack is great, even though I have some valid concerns.WHAT IT IS:A relatively universal trunk mounted 3-bike rack that is fairly easy to assemble, attach and remove.  While the range of vehicles that can accommodate this rack is wide, I would definitely recommend checking Thules website to ensure it will work for a specific year, make and model.WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT:- First and foremost, it is designed so it wont scratch your vehicle.  All 6 trunk hooks have a rubberized coating, eliminating scratching potential.  When the straps to the hooks are properly pulled to ensure they are taught, the hooks should easily stay in place.  4 large rubberized foam rollers cover the bars that make contact with trunk/back of vehicle are soft and spongy.  You will need to be patient when attaching and detaching the rack to ensure the loosened hooks dont smack into your vehicle.- The rack is designed not only to secure the bikes, but also the front wheels.  The two arms that actually hold the bikes each have 3 rubberized wells that accommodate most standard frame bikes  even the fatter tubed frames.  Additionally, the rubber straps that hook to each side of the well have multiple holes to ensure the bike is firmly in place on the rack.  I have an odd-framed Specialized mountain bike and had no problem securing it to the rack.  3 attachments with the rubber straps keep the bikes front wheels in place (no bungee cords needed).  If your bike frame doesnt have a top bar that inhibits racking, there is a handy top-bar add-on you can purchase for < $20 that solves the problem.- The racks arms can be quickly and easily locked in a down position when not in use.  This is a great feature that allows you to keep the rack mounted when no bikes are attached.  No more riding around town worrying about the two prongs jutting out the back of your vehicle or worrying about clearance for your garage door.ISSUES:While I love the convenience and sense of security offered by the THULE PASSAGE, I have two security-themed issues and one accomodation issue with this rack.1.  I have no problem using this rack around town or for short trips.  But, my confidence wanes somewhat when I think of long stretches of interstate travel.  The rack is designed to give a little, even though its secure (kind of like how tall buildings are designed to sway), but the thought of driving long stretches of 70+ mph highway with 3 bikes strapped to the back unnerves me a little.  Then again, this may be an issue of adaptation and I havent had the rack long enough to build the necessary confidence.2. Theft.  The rack is so easy to mount/dismount, anyone can do it  and I mean anyone.  I would hate to return from the trails only to find out my bike rack was stolen.  While I wish some sort of anti-theft measure was factored into the packaging of this rack, there is none  you have to buy it separately.  In a pinch, I simply looped a kryptonite lock through the rack and my XTerras trunk latch, but honestly never even thought of this rack being stolen until I had the bikes off the rack.3. While my daughters bikes could be racked, I can see issues with some kids bikes being too small for this rack.Overall, the THULE PASSAGE gives me the tool I need to ride bikes with my family.  It is sturdy, convenient and well-designed.  Even though I have a few concerns, I do believe my issue of using the rack on long trips is simply a matter of gaining confidence.  Dealing with theft is an unfortunate fact of life  just wish Thule would have included a simple anti-theft device with the rack instead of forcing us to make an additional purchase.UPDATE (10.21.2015):I recently returned from a cross-state trip where I used this rack to carry 2 mountain bikes.  After 10 total hours of interstate traffic at an avg. speed of 65-70 mph, I can say my weariness of using this rack for long trips has been completely eliminated.  The rack performed flawlessly.  On the first half of the trip, I stopped for gas and felt compelled to check to rack's need for tightening ... nope, the rack never loosened (and there were a few high-speed road bumps encountered on the way).  My confidence in the rack was secure enough to completely ignore the rack for the 5 hour return trip.  I feel this was the necessary test that proved the overall value of the THULE PASSAGE and I've upgraded my review of the product to 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1273C42MZH7C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00152VYZC#wasThisHelpful","R1273C42MZH7C6","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was totally immersed watching episodes of Inside the American Mafia on Netflix, I realized that Selwyn Raabs interesting and invaluable commentary was what made the series so great.  His authoritative knowledge and storytelling ability compelled me to order his book, FIVE FAMILIES, as I was watching the series.  If there is one source I would recommend about understanding the nuts and bolts of Mafia in America, it would certainly be FIVE FAMILIES.The basic premise of FIVE FAMILIES is to illustrate how the crux of the American Mafia evolves around the happenings of the five major crime families in New York City (Luchese, Gambino, Genovese, Colombo and Bonnano).  Paralleling the families stories is the gradual acceptance of the US government to acknowledge the Mafias existence and eventually formulate a plan to combat it.  Raab does a magnificent job in presenting the birth, rise, decline (and likely resurgence) of these families and does so in a manner that is both entertaining and absorbing.  Even more impressive is that FIVE FAMILIES manages to simplify the massive, interweaving complexities associated with these organizations to a level that most readers will appreciate.  This meaty volume of 700+ pages provides an abundance of detailed information, but Raab graciously divides the material into 60 digestible (10-12 page) chapters that keeps readers focused.  Miraculously, the book never became a tedious grind; I find it rare to read books this size that dont either bore me to tears or eventually challenge my will to finish.FIVE FAMILIES is pretty much a chronological affair through the 1960s, when the families began to exploit their power.  The period from the 1970s to the early 2000s, Raab informally groups chapters by family to better illustrate their peaks and subsequent downfalls in a more concise manner. This 70s-00s era provides much more intricate and juicy storylines as the US governments willingness to fight the mafia resulted in a number of Mafiosi willing to violate their codes of silence.  Much of the book describes the nitty-gritty of the violence perpetuated by the families (both within and outside the families) and the shady rackets that pretty much explains why everything in New York City costs so much (even candy bars).  The power and the reach exerted by these families is eerily shocking.  Ironically, the  pages of mindless bloodshed is accompanied by stories that are both humorous and quirky.  The plethora of gangster nicknames peppering each page (and the rationale behind the names) is a gem in-and-of itself.  It was easy to see the basis for almost every significant Hollywood presentation of the Mafia being outlined in the book  even the fictitious Sopranos.What I appreciated most about FIVE FAMILIES is that it easily presents itself as being an authority on anything-everything related to the American Mafia.  No stone is left unturned in this book as every major gangster from Luciano to the last Don Joe Massino (and everyone in-between) is addressed.  Additionally, every significant mafia-related event is covered in satisfactory detail.  Whether it be the famous Apalachin bust in 1957, the Kennedy assassination(s), the brutality of Gaspipe Casso, Chin Gigantes decades-long mental illness ruse or the Teflon-turned-Velcro John Gotti trials  FIVE FAMILIES covers it ALL.  More interesting is how the federal government went from turning its back to the Mafias existence to aggressively tackling each one of the five families by using the most powerful and effective tool in its armory:  RICO.  Each subsequent chapter is as engrossing as the previous.For anyone interested in the American Mafia, I cannot think of a better primer than FIVE FAMILIES as it provides such a comprehensive understanding of the entire organization (as a whole and each individual family)  its a one-stop-shop type of resource that entertains from beginning to end.  While I have read several books that focus on specific mafia stories or individuals (Roy DeMeo, Nicky Scarfo or Richard Kuklinski), I have yet to see a book that ties everything together as well as FIVE FAMILIES manages to do  Selwyn Raab bats this one out of the park.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOQ4N8O67I8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312361815#wasThisHelpful","R1TOQ4N8O67I8G","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been involved in athletics my entire life (Im 49 years old)  from the basic 3 (football, baseball and basketball) as a youth, rugby in college to mountain-biking, bodybuilding and national-level powerlifting as an adult.  While my competitive days are unfortunately over (career, parenthood and a few nagging injuries), I am an avid snowboarder and can still post highly competitive lifting totals.  During this span of 40+ years, I have seen the supplement industry explode (exponentially) and Im reminded of my first supplement as a youth:  mixing a packet of Carnation Instant Breakfast into a glass of whole milk  or a glass of Tang.  While Ive mainly stuck with protein supplementation over the years, I was impressed with a workout supplements results and decided to stack it with CELLUCORS C4 PRE-WORKOUT SUPPLEMENT.  I found the results quite encouraging.WHAT IT IS:A pre-workout powder designed to be mixed with water and consumed about 30 minutes BEFORE exercise so the ingredients have enough time to work their way into your system and become effective from the start of the workout (drinking it at the gym, before your first set, defeats the products purpose).  C4 claims to boost energy, focus and provide a pump.HOW IT WORKED (FOR ME):- First of all the taste (Fruit Punch).  I actually thought the taste was pretty good.  After shaking 1 scoop in 8oz of water, I waited for the foam to subside and chugged it.  A slight aftertaste (akin to many caffeine drinks) but pleasant nonetheless  a little on the sweet side.- After about 10 minutes, the niacin starts to kick in and I felt a warm tingling sensation on my neck and shoulders.  People react differently to niacin as it commonly generates a flushed feeling with tingling.  Some may not be affected at all by it and others may find it unbearable.  Another reason to read the ingredients before spending the money on such products.- I tried the C4 by itself and didnt notice any significant impact throughout my workout other than I felt hydrated throughout.  But, when I took the C4 and stacked it with a workout supplement (Core Nutritionals ABC), I did notice a difference  endurance, motivation and focus were definitely up and this eliminated negativity/uncertainty when pushing myself with heavy weights.  Confidence is extremely important in making gains in powerlifting.- I generally get a pumped feeling from working out and didnt notice anything different with the C4.- The endurance was noticeable throughout the workout (2 hours) and I never crashed anytime afterward  the effect tapered off gradually.Overall, I was impressed with the C4 and plan on adding it to my workout routine.  I like the taste and the sensations it delivers.  However, I felt the increased blood flow from the niacin; the caffeinated energy burst and the creatine nitrate in the C4 were best suited when complimented by a BCAA-enriched workout drink.  I believe CELLUCORS C4 is a good product that provided me with some tangible results, but everyone is different.  You may want to determine your tolerance to niacin before purchasing this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQO38JQ2PYKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U464HYK#wasThisHelpful","RLQO38JQ2PYKL","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burts Bees products have been a staple in our household since our daughters were born.  While I really like the idea of a glue stick-like sunblock (Im not a fan of most any suntan lotions/oils and detest the sprays), I felt that the SUNSCREEN STICK was a little harsh to apply on the skin of infants (the products intended target).  With that being said, I found it better suited for older kids and adults.THE PROBLEM:Imaging coloring on the soft, fatty skin of an infant with a fat crayon and youll get the idea of how the SUNSCREEN STICK applies  not easy and not so comfortable for the child.  While the SPF 30 formula was certainly effective (fortified by the zinc oxide in the ingredients), it was easier rub the stick on my hands and fingers before applying it to the skin.  If this product is designed for infants, the composition of the stick should be softened to a degree.ALTERNATIVE USE:I felt the SUNSCREEN STICK was perfect for older children and adults.  I like the ability to target an area without having to slather greasy lotion all over my hands or even worse, use an aerosol sunblock is advantageous.  Even better, the size of the stick makes it so convenient and transportable  just stuff it into a pocket or purse and go.  This is great for protecting the neck, face and the tops of ears.  The zinc oxide will leave a white residue, but that can be worked into the skin with a finger or two.While the product is effective, I cant say that this is best-suited for babies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N4HDZEAAXXER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUBYV66#wasThisHelpful","R3N4HDZEAAXXER","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I thought of Cubic Zirconia, the words gaudy and cheap always came to mind  that was a mistake.  These cushion shaped (square cut with the corners rounded) stud earrings are both beautiful and elegant.I was a little concerned that the size of the CZ (2 cttw) would be a little over the top.  Not at all.  The ornate Sterling Silver encasement for the CZ stone has an intricate, antique appeal that tones down the size of the gemstone.  The Rhodium plating of the silver generates a dazzling brilliance that gives these earrings their sophistication.While the generous cttw and cushion shape are initially striking, the antique look of the setting is what warrants a second look.  These earrings have the appearance of being family valuables that are passed down through generations.  They certainly attract attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJI3P5HKU3DHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGXZXXG#wasThisHelpful","RJI3P5HKU3DHN","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With World War II still being a newsworthy topic, the horrors of the First World War have pretty much been forgotten.  Even though this significant historical event now seems like ancient history, it is still a valid subject to read about when one considers it arguably being a starting point for many of the worlds ills 100 years later.  Honestly, Id never heard of Ernst Jungers STORM OF STEEL, but considering the standard German perspective of the war is a novel (All Quiet on the Western Front), I felt compelled to read this book  and Im glad I did.While the misery of trench warfare has been well-documented by historians, there is a distinct difference in reading a historians version of what the experience must have been like versus the account of someone who actually lived through it.  Written in 1920, Junger vividly recollects his wartime experience in a manner that reads a little like a diary/journal.  Enlisting at age 19 (73rd Hanoverian Fusiliers) and experiencing combat over the wars entire 4-year span (including the bloody battles of Flanders and the Somme), there is arguably no better first-hand account of World War I available.STORM OF STEEL is both honest and blunt  its pages are full of destruction and death.  Jungers writing doesnt come across as a cathartic release of the horrible events he experienced, but more as a documentation of an extraordinary event being left for others to interpret.  As a commander, Junger led his men in over the top charges against enemy trenches and organized defenses when the enemy reciprocated.  Most of the books pages account for some form of combat, whether it be enduring artillery barrages, poison gas or repelling enemy infantry attacks. Junger brings the battlefield to life in vivid detail in describing the persistent smell of death from the torn bodies left to rot in no mans land between the trenches.  His remembrances of seeing men ripped apart or horribly disfigured changes as the book progresses  hardened to the sight of death, such images simply become part of the terrain he describes.  Remarkably, Junger survived being wounded seven times  most of his friends did not.  Reading STORM OF STEEL, I was reminded of two similarly written accounts of World War II:  Guy Sajers THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER and Eugene Sledges WITH THE OLD BREED.  I found the similarity centering on how these books not only provide readers a visual experience of combat, but an extremely personal experience as well.There is no glory in this gritty account of war and while Junger exudes a sense of pride in fulfilling his duty as a soldier, he never expresses any significant emotional thoughts on what he sees or what he does.  Unlike All Quiet on the Western Front there is no expression of emotional guilt associated with war, just the raw facts of what war brings.  I found it noteworthy that Junger could write such a straight-forward, apolitical account of his wartime experience, after simmering on his wartime experience for two years.I am somewhat surprised that I not previously been aware of STORM OF STEEL.  After reading it, I find it hard to believe there is a single work of literature that provides a better understanding of World War I from an individual perspective (or any war for that matter).  After reading Jungers book, I am confounded as to why Erich Maria Remarques NOVEL is deemed so important  STORM OF STEEL should be considered a classic literary work of historical importance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARWB56Z553QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142437905#wasThisHelpful","R1ARWB56Z553QE","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Free copy provided as an Amazon Prime member.PRESCRIPTION: MURDER! VOL I represents a handful of stories that detail several odd cases of doctor-related murder cases.Generally, I prefer more modern crime stories, but admit that I found the handful of cases in this particular volume rather interesting.  The stories illustrate doctor-involved murder plots that (for the most part) center on life insurance benefits.  These accounts are relatively brief and told in a story-telling manner that keeps the reader focused from beginning to end.  While the dated nature of these murder cases harken the days when potions and elixirs were considered medicine, the plans for murder were arguably elaborate and innovative.  I particularly enjoyed the tale of a diabolical World War I hero imprisoned for murder who was later deemed a hero again  in another country.For those who enjoy murder mysteries, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER!

"The brunt of mankinds biggest catastrophe (World War II) fell on the shoulders of the Soviet Union.  Struggling in a total war of annihilation against Nazi Germany (something the West did not have to experience), every resource was utilized to save the country, including almost one-million women serving in a military capacity.  Of these women, nearly a quarter of them earned medals/decorations of some sort with almost 90 receiving the ultimate honor:  Hero of the Soviet Union (militarily comparable to the US Medal of Honor).  Kazimiera Cottoms WOMEN IN WAR AND RESISTANCE accounts for the lives of these female Hero of the Soviet Union (HSU) recipients and sheds light on their dedication, courageousness and the respect they earned from their compatriots.Essentially, WOMEN IN WAR AND RESISTANCE is an extensive compilation of 94 mini biographies.  Of these biographies, 4 represent the contributions of pre-World War II individuals (all of whom later served during World War II in some capacity) and 4 heroines who earned the title during the Russian Civil War.  The bulk of the book, however, is dedicated to those who served during World War II (which the Soviet Union referred to as The Great Patriotic War).  The biographies are grouped into chapters that detail the manner in which they served (airwomen, infantry/tanks, partisans, medical field, etc.).  Each of the biographies vividly illustrates the lives of each woman, not just their wartime exploits.  While many of those in the book perished during the war, when applicable, the biographies extend past 1998 (my book is a 2012 updated edition).  I liked that the author provided photos of these women as many of them serve to contrast the non-feminine stereotype of a woman serving in the Red Army.Initially, the Soviet Union had restrictions on women serving in combat roles until the war reached a desperate all hands on board level and no able-bodied citizen was to be spared service.  While I have been well aware of Soviet women serving in combat for some time, I was only familiar with the exploits of Lilya Litvak (one of historys two female air aces with 5+ kills) and a handful of successful snipers.  Many of my books contain images of Soviet women in uniform, but mostly in non-combat roles, like signalers.  The women in this book basically performed in the same capacity as men (including driving a T-34 tank or serving as a machine-gunner) and many of them sacrificed themselves to save comrades or fulfill a mission goal.  Cottam really took an exhaustive and dedicated approach to the subject matter as the biographies are thorough and well-researched.  I appreciated seeing that there was no standard background to the women (some had privileged upbringings and some came from extremely poor families) and they came from no specific part of their country.  The lives of these women were as diverse as their roles in military service.While I enjoyed the books content, I will admit that reading 94 biographies in succession was, at times, a tedious affair; especially the section on airwomen (which comprises the lions share of the book).  With that being said, I found it hard to ignore the value of being educated on a subject matter that most of the Western world has little or no awareness.  While the debate about women in combat flares up in American politics from time-to-time, I have yet to hear ANY reference of the only structured example of a modern nation allowing women to serve on the front  from either side of the argument.  Reading Cottams book does, however, illustrate another scenario the Western world has yet to experience  a nations desperate struggle to avoid complete annihilation (Hitlers plan for the Soviet Union), not merely oppressive, exploitative occupation.  In other words, when the war reached a critical point, these women served on the front lines  and performed more than admirably.  This desire to help save the nation from barbaric invaders was a common motivator in these HSU recipients desire to serve.  On a sad note, many of the biographies reveal that the demise of the Soviet Union represented the nation steering away from acknowledging the one arguable accomplishment in its history  the sacrifice its citizens made to save the country and ultimately defeat Nazi Germany.WOMEN IN WAR AND RESISTANCE proves to be both interesting and educating and Cottams passion for the subject matter really comes through.  I have yet to find a more exhaustive and informative source detailing the issue of Soviet women fighting against the Nazis in World War II, let alone accounting for such heroism.  Certainly a one-of-a-kind book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0DJB2QG0GOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0968270220#wasThisHelpful","R3L0DJB2QG0GOW","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually remember picking up this book at our schools Scholastic Book Fair back in the mid-1970s after seeing Brians Song (ABC Movie of the Week)  and never read it.  Like many people my age, the movie tends to stick with you over the years (in my case, some 40 years) and after seeing both versions with my 9 year old daughter, I finally decided to read A SHORT SEASON.  The book certainly paints a more complete image of Brian Piccolo than either of the Brians Song movies even attempted to do.A SHORT SEASON is written in a somewhat choppy style with readers getting an early understanding of Piccolos progressive struggle with cancer.  In between the medical issues being faced (which are explicitly detailed in medical vernacular), we are provided with remembrances of Pics life that include childhood, college, family life, and of course, his time with the Bears.  Many of these remembrances/stories are told by Piccolo himself (italicized text).  The entire book is essentially a single, 150+ page chapter and you somewhat need to get into a rhythm to handle the ongoing back-and-forth nature of the book.While I certainly wasnt expecting A SHORT SEASON to jive completely with the movie adaptation of Brian Piccolos short life, I was quite surprised at how much of the mans character was left out of the screenplay.  First of all, the books depiction of Piccolos relationship with superstar Gale Sayers certainly didnt seem so exclusive  Pic was close to many of his Bears teammates, especially the legendary Dick Butkus.  In fact, the entire Bears organization, including owner George Halas, adored Piccolo for his self-deprecating humor, work ethic, dedication to the team and his big-hearted personality.  It is certainly thought-provoking to see how the entire Bears organization coalesced around Piccolo when his cancer was discovered  management and teammates.  A scenario quite unimaginable today, when even the top players on a team (which Pic was not) are often casually dismissed.  The depiction of unwavering loyalty by the organization toward its injured teammate/employee was one of the more endearing aspects of the book.What I appreciated most, though, was getting a better understanding of who Brian Piccolo really was.  As I read the book, it was hard not to envision James Caans Brians Song portrayal of Pic as a wise-cracking, fun-loving family man and consummate teammate (the better of the two movies  in my opinion).  But, the book proves Piccolo to be a much deeper person, especially when it came to his limitless love and support of Carol, his wifes mentally-challenged sister  a prominent part of the mans life that never appears in either of the movies.  It is easy to understand how and why the mans early demise was so heartbreaking  Brian Piccolo was the kind of person most people want to have in their lives.Up front, we know this is a tragic tale as most who will read A SHORT SEASON have likely viewed at least one of the Brians Song movies.  But, this is one instance where the movie simply isnt enough.  While the movie is a bona-fide tear-jerker (for men and women alike), the book is just as sad (even seeing the text of Sayers courage award acceptance speech left a lump in my throat).  But, along with the sadness of losing such a decent person at such a young age (leaving a wife and three young daughters) is the uplifting/offsetting courage demonstrated by Piccolo during his struggle with cancer.  While I love (the original) Brians Song, I never really understood why the story of a relatively obscure football player deserved so much attention  A SHORT SEASON provides that explanation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IY25M3NUO8UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566250242#wasThisHelpful","R1IY25M3NUO8UQ","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With DIPLOMATIC AFTERLIVES, Andrew Cooper touches on a more modern trend of prominent world leaders who simply refuse to retire following their terms in office.  Cooper selectively highlights a few of these hyper-empowered individuals and illustrates how they cash-in (figuratively and literally) on their global political clout.  The results of his study shed additional light on the deeds being done by a handful of individuals (most of which the media readily reports), but never attempts to flesh out what really drives their efforts  altruism or ego?Coopers book is a narrowly-focused work that centers on a select few leaders who have seemingly never retired from their former day jobs.  Nowadays, it seems, leading a country is merely a stepping-stone to reach the political and financial pot-of-gold they were unable to attain while in office.  These former leaders, freed from the confining chains of an electorate, roam the world to spread their power and influence on an unprecedented scale and making a lot of money for themselves in the process.  Cooper claims the model for post-statesmen globe-trotting is Jimmy Carter, a man whose post-presidential passion may be rooted in honest altruism or simply serve as a means to right an arguably flawed presidential legacy.  While the author acknowledges both as being possible motivators for Carters still-active presence on the national and global stage, he prefers to show support for the more favorable motivator:  altruism.  And with that, readers are spared from any recap of Carters polarizing and reckless meddling in US domestic and foreign policy.  Unfortunately, this sets a somewhat skewed tone throughout the book, especially when one considers the individuals Cooper chooses to highlight and how he encapsulates their political afterlives.With Carter providing the initial template, Cooper delves into the post-office careers of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela and, to a lesser degree, Margaret Thatcher.  The majority of the book is dedicated to Clinton and Mandela and the author documents how they have considerably expanded Carters more modest approach to a politically-active retirement.  While one cannot argue the personal motivators when considering Mandelas storied life, Clintons motivations are not-so-easily defined in the book.  While much of Clintons involvement on the world stage following his Presidency are shown as successful and for just causes, Cooper presents an overly glorified image that tends ignore the considerable wealth amassed by Clinton in his political afterlife and really only factors the political ambitions of his wife to the year 2008.  The controversial financial element of Clintons globe-trotting has been newsworthy for a while, but really isnt explored by Cooper, who seems to take the end justifies the means approach to Clintons post-presidential life.  The post-office lives of Gorbachev and Blair are less-favorably presented as being more dash-for-cash driven and tend to elevate the statures of Carter and Clinton.  Toward the end of the book, we see how the author views those he has selected to examine for his book:  the earnest commitment of Carter, the charisma of Clinton, the iconic status of Mandela, the historical importance of Gorbachev and the mixed legacy of Blair.  It may be hard to argue with the list of successes associated with some of these leaders when only the successes are presented.  I would have preferred a more critical analysis as to what these individuals could have done, but for some reason, did not or could not.  Did some of their efforts make matters worse, was all the money received wisely appropriated?  Are these globe-trotting second careers simply a means of supporting a healthy ego and amassing wealth under the guise of being helpful?In addition to being a rather dry read, DIPLOMATIC AFTERLIVES comes across as an incomplete work.  While Cooper brings forward other world leaders towards the end of his book (mostly by listing their participation in post-office diplomacy/cultural gatherings), it is a Carter-Clinton centric work the mostly shows how Clinton expanded/exploited what Carter started.  The inclusion of Mandela serves to parallel/support the more positive Carter-Clinton post-leadership careers with Blair, Gorbachev and Thatcher being presented in a negative, contrasting manner.  I was hoping for a better picture of the post-office careers of more world leaders than a stereo-typical presentation of a select few.  Understandably, Cooper feels that those he selected were the most important (the hyper-empowered), but are they necessarily the best choices?  Ive never sensed Gorbachev and Blair as being as overly-involved following their terms in office.  Hard to believe the political afterlife of Al Gore wasnt included (even though he was a VP, he certainly threw his weight around the world enough to get a Nobel Prize).  It would have been nice if the book could have presented a broader scope of leaders and their post-political careers.  While I dont have a problem with Cooper favoring the works of Clinton or Carter, I felt a more thorough approach could have been taken toward examining the controversial aspects of their legacies to present a more well-rounded understanding to readers.Are these former leaders working for the good of others or are they simply self-aggrandizing, money-grubbing overnight guests that refuse to leave?  DIPLOMATIC AFTERLIVES provides some food for thought, but presents too narrow an approach to the subject matter.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W4U6FXT3YCV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745661998#wasThisHelpful","R3W4U6FXT3YCV5","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Americas global dominance being challenged and even usurped both internally and externally, it is hard to ignore Chinas steadily growing presence on the world stage, let alone the shadow its casting over its Asian neighbors.  Jonathan Holslags provocatively titled CHINAS COMING WAR WITH ASIA draws attention to the collision course being created by Chinas planned growth and the negative impact it will likely impose on bordering nations  with force, if necessary.Holslag postulates an eventual diplomatic/economic/military logger-head in Asia due to Chinas fulfillment of four great aspirations (authors term):  adding frontier land, recovering lost territory, strengthening its populations faith in the Communist state and garnering respect for its authority (both locally and globally).  While China claims to be achieving its growth peacefully (and has done so to this point), the massive investment in modernizing and strengthening the military indicates force as being an available option.  Holslags provocative scenario of China using its growing military might as a bargaining tool doesnt totally mesh with the alarming sentiment of war that books title indicates (including a cover featuring a ticking clock with a missile and military jet for hands).  But, it is certainly hard to ignore the logic of China using its military as a tool to achieve its goals  especially when disputing territory with a nuclear power like India or nearby nations backed by the US (Japan, for example).The book kept reminding me of a familiar 20th century theme of hegemonic expansion exhibited by Germany and Japan to achieve similar aspirations.  While the author states Chinas rise is centered more on security than hegemony, I felt the supporting data somewhat marginalizes Chinas long (dynastic) history and a general principle of communism  ideological expansion.  With onetime ally Russia no longer retaining superpower status, the US and its strong economic and military presence in Asia seems to be the biggest issue for China.  Without directly saying so, Holslag appears to illustrate an escalating proxy war in Asia between China and the US, both economically and militarily (the author even refers to the military situation as being Cold-War like).  Holslag doesnt venture into predicting the outcome of the coming war.CHINAS COMING WAR WITH ASIA is certainly provides food-for-thought, but I felt the book was a little narrow in focus and/or somewhat incomplete.  While it is hard to disagree with many of the issues Holslag presents, I was somewhat bothered by what ingredients werent added to the mix.  How do a billion+ Chinese people factor into this scenario, what about Europe and its connections to Asia and most notably, what about North Korea (an unstable, bordering nuclear power that has presented a host of problems for China over the years)?","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AXBA1J5BD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074568825X#wasThisHelpful","R10AXBA1J5BD7","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive always felt the little pistachio nut was a worthy prize for dealing with the shell.  But, DIAMOND OF CALIFORNIA offers a 6 oz. bag of shelled, unsalted pistachios that gives us the wonderfully, subtle sweetness we love without the manual labor.This bag of nuts is a convenient way of adding pistachio sweetness to just about anything.  Throw them into a bowl of ice cream, oatmeal, cookie dough or a salad.  Toss them into waffle or pancake batter  with dark chocolate chips (my favorite use of pistachios)  or simply grab a handful and eat them on the go.  No fuss, no mess  no need risk cracking your teeth trying to break into closed shells (I waste NO pistachios).These pistachios are softer and chewier than the roasted/salted nuts, but they are great for cooking and plain pistachios are quite nutritious (14g of the good fat, relatively low carbs and 0 sodium).  The nice thing is that if you really prefer the salty/crunchy kind of nuts, you can easily toast them.  But, If you like the distinctive, sweet flavor of the pistachio nut without having to deal with the shell, you cant go wrong with this DIAMOND OF CALIFORNIA product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H0OJ2ED1BRE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOE88I0#wasThisHelpful","R3H0OJ2ED1BRE1","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, Id never heard of a pellet grill before  its always been either gas or charcoal.  But, the described capabilities of the PITMASTER Q3 PELLET GRILL/SMOKER certainly made it worth trying.WHAT IT IS:The PITMASTER Q3 is a sharp-looking fire-engine red 36 inch barrel-shaped electric grill/smoker that burns wood pellets as a heat source.  The grill arrives unassembled and weighs about 120 lbs.  In addition to all necessary parts, the box included instructions.  Unfortunately, there are several items you will need to purchase separately to use and safely store the grill:  wood pellets, grill cover and a water pan.ASSEMBLY EXPERIENCE:When the grill arrived, even the UPS driver commented on how much of a monster the grill was (size/weight-wise).  My grill had a little scuffing damage on the front of the grill lid (some of the red paint was scraped off), but no noteworthy dents or dings.  Overall, I found the assembly process quite simple and the instructions for piecing together the main parts easy to understand.  Unlike the standard propane grills Id previously assembled, the panels of the PITMASTER Q3 are thin, but heavy and awkward to handle at times (especially the grill lid with its pointed corners).  I managed to assemble it by myself, but another person could have made things easier (and safer)  total assembly time = 45min  1 hour.SOME PRE-USE ISSUES:I did run into problems in figuring out how to assemble the interior unattached parts (the drain tray, heat damper, etc.) as the instructions dont directly address them.  While I figured things out (at least I believe I did), a simple diagram or picture of the grills interior would have been helpful.Another issue is the water pan  its mentioned in the operating instructions, but not as part of the grills assembly.  I had to scour the internet to figure this one out:  you basically need to create your own water pan.  Others have stated that using a small aluminum loaf pan that you get in multi-packs at the grocery store will suffice.  I couldnt find anything that fit the square slot that I assumed was designated for the water pan and basically had to shape the loaf pans myself  looks sloppy, but it works.  I believe a pre-made water pan should/could have been included.Buying the fuel was not as simple as I thought.  I live in a large college town  we have Lowes, Home Depot, Walmart and Target  not one of them carried grill pellets in-store and it took me a while to explain to the individuals helping me that I wasnt looking for heating pellets or wood chips for grilling  they had no idea what a pellet grill actually was.  Eventually I had to order them online and wait for delivery.It took me a minute to find the grills electrical cord  it was tucked up into the auger box and was completely out of view.I would suggest buying a grill cover ahead of assembling.  Even the instructions strongly suggest getting a cover due to the sensitive components in the grill (and the fact that the grill is an electric device).  I believe something this important should have been included in the box.FIRING IT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME:Word of caution:  Dont immediately gather friends and family when you first plan to use the PITMASTER Q3  a 45 minute seasoning process is needed before you can begin cooking food.  With that being said, you may want to give yourself an extra 30-45 minutes to let the auger S L O W L Y transfer the wood pellets to the heat source  then, you can let the grill burn (season) for 45 minutes.  Fortunately, this seasoning ritual is a one-time gig  but always keep an eye on the supply of pellets in the grill to avoid having to relive the 30-45 minute pellet transfer step.When the pellets (I chose hickory) started to burn for the first time, I was engulfed in a pleasantly aromatic, but blinding smoke that eventually subsided and I could then start controlling the temperature for the task at hand.  As a gas-griller, I had to get used to the pellet method of grilling.  There are differences: no roiling flames, using electricity to operate the grill and adjusting heat levels with a thermostat.  But, there were some distinct positives:  No roiling flames, the awesome wood-burning aroma, easier heat control and no more throwing lit matches and waiting for that minor explosion (due to the push-button starter not working past the first 3 uses).Cooking with the PITMASTER Q3 was easy and I love the ability to try smoking food (a first for me).  The coordination between the thermostat and the thermometer is accurate and consistent  giving me the control I need to differentiate between grilling, cooking and smoking.  The wood flavoring wasnt as prominent as I thought it would be in the grilling process, but it certainly was when using the smoker.OVERALL OPINION:The frustrations I experienced prior to using the grill wore off shortly after the first steaks were being plated, but I do believe these frustrations should factor in the overall evaluation of a product as pricey as the PITMASTER Q3.  I cant complain one bit about this grills performance, but it took me a full week after I put it together before I could actually use the thing (waiting for the delivery of the wood pellets was a big part of that wait).  The instructions could have been more thorough and the entire ensemble was missing a few essential items  especially a grill cover.  If you plan on purchasing a PITMASTER Q3, it would be advisable to get a grill cover, loaf pans and wood pellets prior to putting the grill together.  Once youve gotten through the initial teething process  grill on!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJ67KMYE9NP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMAPD74#wasThisHelpful","R3AJ67KMYE9NP6","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I live in a college town and do enjoy tailgating for games in the fall, I was attracted to the COOL-N-CARRY COOLER more as an organizer than a cooler.  The nice thing about this product is that it gives me both options  a cooler with benefits.WHAT IT IS:A collapsible cooler with large, open box pockets on 2 of the coolers sides.  The cooler is 12x12 with a vinyl-lined interior and a zippered top.  The 2 side pockets are 10x10 and the cooler exterior are made of rugged polyester.  Straps are attached to the cooler for easy shoulder transport and additional Velcro straps allows the user to collapse either/both pockets as well as the entire unit.  The entire assembly can be easily collapsed.WHAT I LIKED:- First and foremost, I love the storage capacity.  For years, I was using an old snowboard bag to store emergency gear in the back of my XTerra.  When I expanded the COOL-N-CARRY, I was able to place all the contents of the board bag into the coolers side pockets:  tow strap, large water bottle, jumper cables, 2 rolled-up towels, 2 rolled-up blankets, bungee cords, socket wrench set, tennis balls (for the dogs) and more.  The pockets are deep and the polyester sides stay rigid, keeping everything in place.  The pockets were big enough that I didnt even need to use the cooler for storage.- Each pocket has an additional stretchy, meshed outer stash pocket to store smaller items.- The cooler compartment is similar to the design of most collapsible coolers, with the interior vinyl insulation.  It is rugged both inside and out and will not leak unless something sharp tears the liner inside.  If cared for, there is no reason this cooler shouldnt last for years.  I have several soft-side stand-alone coolers with zippered tops and this is as good as any of them.- I really like the fact that I can collapse one or both pockets if necessary and secure them to the sides of the cooler with the Velcro, depending on the amount of storage needed.- When collapsed, the entire unit is relatively flat and takes up minimal space  in this state, I found it serving as a decent seat cushion.I love products that have multiple uses and the COOL-N-CARRY certainly provides me with that luxury  this is a smartly designed and well-made product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L16XDQNPBXEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJNLXTA#wasThisHelpful","R2L16XDQNPBXEH","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I reached a degree of political burnout years ago, Im still temped to dip my toe in the political book pool from time-to-time when lured by the promise of intriguing (salacious) scandals or reasonable (non-sycophantic) debate.  Authors Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson may be labeled as conservatives or even right-wingers, but they present a rather convincing argument how freedom of speech is gradually being shaped by one voice that demands to be heard over everyone else.  What I found enjoyable about END OF DISCUSSION was that Ham and Benson make their point in a humorous, relaxed manner  sans the bitterness.  In other words, they offer their take on issues in a way that most sensible people can appreciate.Sure, many of the issues presented in END OF DISCUSSION are nothing new to those whove grown accustomed to the rantings and ravings of the us vs. them mentality that dominates every facet of political discussion these days:  the war against women, same-sex marriage, Islamophobia, racism  and the list goes on.  These are provocative in that they involve people, which tends to make things personal and emotional ... the essential ingredients needed for rage.  Rather than focus on the topics themselves and take sides, Ham and Benson take a step back to examine how and why these issues have become so volatile.  Their conclusion is that the sensible manner of resolving differences using rational debate is being usurped by one sides effort to silence the other by employing the same tactics kids use on a playground (fear, shame, finger-pointing and yelling louder).  The authors claim this lack of debate has amounted to a one-sided argument in which a minority opinion ultimately controls the national discussion because anyone taking a different viewpoint must be a (insert derogatory label).  In other words, were gradually losing our civility and the authors simply want to show us how and what can be done to improve things.I caution those who may dismiss the book simply because the authors are labeled as one of them, because both authors express their open-mindedness on many of the issues at hand.  Ham and Benson manage to offer candid opinions and solutions without being bitter or emotional  humor and simple common-sense make the book a relaxing and enjoyable read.  They provide plenty of examples and evidence to convincingly back their points and never stoop to ranting.  In many ways, END OF DISCUSSION reads a lot like Alinskys Rules for Radicals in that it manages to present one sides perspective in a manner that is easy to digest by all.  Like Rules, readers may not ultimately agree with the books message, but can appreciate the manner in which the message is delivered.I enjoyed END OF DISCUSSION because I appreciate political books that make points using common-sense and humor.  I also see value in the book because regardless of what side of the political aisle we belong, it illustrates how we should be cognizant of the dangers associated with one side controlling the national discussion.  Inevitably, the other side will have its day at the helm ","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4DQJBKJISFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553447750#wasThisHelpful","RI4DQJBKJISFM","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NIA 24 NECK SCULPTING COMPLEX is a cream designed to firm and lift the skin along the neckline.  My wife used this for 1 month and noticed both immediate and longer-term positive results.POSITIVES:- The cream is thick  a little goes a long way.- A big plus was that the complex was not greasy and did not cause any outbreaks.- Upon application, there was noticeable softening of the skin and over time (2-3 weeks), the firming qualities of the cream became evident.- My wife experience no side effects/rashes at all using the NIA 24.WORD OF CAUTION:- The active ingredient is Niacin which is a stimulant that is known to generate a wide range of reactions that range from slight (a warm, flushed and or tingling sensation to the face/neck) to more severe (headaches and stomach pain).  My wife takes niacin daily as a supplement and experiences no side-effects and this cream was fine for her.  It may be wise to buy a bottle of niacin tablets at a grocery store (its cheap) and test it before wasting a considerable amount of money on a product that makes you miserable to use.My wife loves the NIA 24 NECK SCULPTING COMPLEX because it actually delivers on its promise to soften and firm her neck.

"I trust Thule.  My first experience with a Thule product was a truck bed bike rack almost 20 years ago  it performed flawlessly and even outlasted my truck.  My search for a snowboard roof-rack also ended with Thule offering the type of pack I was looking for.  While I had no doubt that the THULE WOMENS CAPSTONE HIKING PACK (32L) was going to be a quality product, my hands-on experience with the pack left me thoroughly impressed.WHAT IT IS:- This 32L pack is designed for day/overnight hikes, but is great for just about any situation requiring storage while on the move (biking, school, taking the kids to the park, etc.)- The pack has a main zippered storage compartment that contains another zippered compartment and an open pocket inside, there is a large, open stash pocket on the outside and water bottle sleeves on each side of the pack.- Padded shoulder and waist straps can be harnessed to keep the pack in place.  The straps have jersey lining for additional comfort/breathability and the waist straps provide additional storage space (one side has a zippered pocket and the other has a mesh open pocket).- An adjustable suspension system is integrated into the pack that allows the weight of the packs contents to be distributed for desired comfort.- An attached rain cover that envelopes the entire pack is conveniently zippered into its own compartment at the bottom of the pack.- Loops are attached to hold trekking poles.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS PACK:- The common-sense and simplicity incorporated into the packs design indicate that the creators of the pack know the market they are serving.  The location and accessibility of all pockets on the pack accommodate a variety of needs.  Too many packs are zipper-happy and that can be an inconvenience at times.  I like the balance of stash pockets for easy access and zippered storage for added security.  All zippers have extended loops or finger hooks that provide a sure grip, even when gloves are worn.- The pack is made of Cordura which is both lightweight and very rugged/durable (not susceptible to tearing or scuffing).  The color (Crown Jewel/Potion) is tasteful, not gaudy.- The waist and shoulder straps are adequately padded and completely adjustable for desired comfort.  The ability to harness these straps (at the chest and at the waist) provides additional comfort and stability by keeping the pack from shifting around on the back.- I found the adjustable suspension a little tricky to access/adjust (my hands are large), but it does allow the user to shift the load of the pack to a more comfortable position.  A taught meshed webbing strip effectively keeps the suspension system (two aluminum bars and a plastic locking mechanism) from coming into contact with the wearers back.  Even when laying down or sitting with your back against a wall, your back will not touch the suspension system.- While no hydration system is provided, the CAPSTONE is designed to hold a reservoir (by using the stash pocket inside the main compartment).  There is an opening at the top of the pack that allows for the reservoirs drinking tube to be pulled through and there are two elastic Cordura bands on each shoulder strap to hold the drinking tube in place on the desired side.  While I was able to place a 100 oz. reservoir in the pack, a 70 oz. reservoir would be optimal.- I love the built-in rain cover  its smartly zippered into its own compartment in an unobtrusive place at the bottom and is large enough to completely cover a full/expanded pack.- I also like the stretchy, meshed pockets on the waist straps.  The zippered pocket is large enough to hold an average-sized camera (but the protection the pocket offers is minimal).The CAPSTONE 32L HIKING PACK is a wonderfully rugged and completely functional pack that is extremely comfortable.  While this pack is designed for women, it felt just as comfortable on my back as it did my wife and daughters backs.  The CAPSTONE has all the essentials I would deem necessary in a quality pack:  rugged, yet lightweight  plentiful, easy-access storage  hydration system compatible  chest and waist harnessing  adjustable suspension and protection from the elements (rain cover).  A superior product built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYCOUWQ48643/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KBTHS#wasThisHelpful","R2RYCOUWQ48643","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchasing a razor/brush stand was the last step in my transition from shaving with disposable razors to a single-blade safety razor.  I simply was tired of resting my shaving brush on its side to dry and putting my razor in an old jewelry bag.  The SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL DELUXE RAZOR AND BRUSH STAND (chrome) proved to be a much better alternative for my brush and razor storage; it also looks good.When I pulled the stand out of the box, I was surprised at how solid it was.  The stand has a weighted base attached to a post with a twin-forked attachment at the top for holding most standard safety razors and shaving brushes.  The design of the stand is simple, but seeing and handling the stand proved that the picture of it does it no justice.  The weighted base has a foam rubber disk underneath that keeps the stand in place.  The forks for holding the brush and razor are tilted up at the ends to keep the items in place.  I use a long handled Merkur razor and an Escali brush  the stand holds both like a champ.I can see that using a stand is the best way for letting the brush dry (as you arent supposed to let it dry by sitting it with the bristles facing up).  Aside from its function, I really like how the stand looks and Im impressed with its solid construction.  The knurling in the middle and top of the post provide nice accents to the overall appearance and the chrome really shines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBN48V0BSEV3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFCV5JM#wasThisHelpful","RBN48V0BSEV3K","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The market is flooded with portable chargers, so there are plenty of options available to suit a variety of personal needs and budgetary tastes.  Although the OUTDOOR TECH OT1700 charger possesses average charging capacity, its good for emergencies and its rugged design is a big plus.WHAT IT IS:- A tube-shaped charger is roughly the size of a glue-stick encased in lattice-textured rubber.- The top of the tube flips open on one end to reveal one micro and one standard USB port.  Also provided is a 12 cable with a micro-USB plug on one and a standard-USB plug on the other.  The cable serves as the conduit to charge the charger itself and provide juice from the charger to your desired electronic device.HOW IT PERFORMS:- It takes about 4 hours to fully charge the OT7100 (an indicator light shows red when charging and green when fully charged).- The 2600 mAh capacity of the OT1700 is not overwhelming, but it was enough to fully charge my Blackberry Z10 and half-charge a second Blackberry.- All operations (charging the charger and charging devices from the charger) are simple processes.- I only wish it was designed so the cable could be stored in the tube.WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE OT1700:- That the charger is encased with textured rubber is a big plus for me.  When the rubber cap (which is tethered to the charger) is closed, the sensitive ports are sealed from dust/dirt and moisture/water splashes (not submersion); it is also protected from being dropped.  The texture of the rubber and tubular design allow for a solid grip.  The overall protective design of the charger makes it great for stashing most anywhere without fear of it getting damaged (when cap is sealed shut):  pocket, purse, gym bag, glove box, tackle box, etc.While there are chargers with higher capacity, this is charger is more than adequate as an emergency charger or for using in a non-office/home environment.  Its tough, easy to handle and easier to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0Z30I5TFZPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYJRT3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2G0Z30I5TFZPR","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a retired powerlifter, I started noticing the effects of my heavy lifting as I entered my 40s.  First, the longer recovery period, then the joints started acting-up.  Being a heavy squatter, I had a decision to make; give up lifting heavier weights I still was capable of handling (but less comfortably) or find ways to work around the problem (lift smarter).  My brother-in-law (a professional natural bodybuilder and personal trainer) strongly suggested the REHBAND 7mm KNEE SLEEVES and I couldnt be more satisfied with the results Im experiencing.WHAT THEY ARE:- 7mm thick neoprene sleeves that slide over the knees for support and warmth.  The sleeves are long enough to completely cover the knees, as well as several inches above and below the knees.  They are articulated to provide both comfort and flexibility even when your knees are fully flexed.- These sleeves are sold INDIVIDUALLY (not as a pair).WHAT THEY ARE NOT:- The REHBAND 7mm KNEE SLEEVES are NOT designed as a strength aid and shouldnt be considered as a substitute for knee wraps.  In fact several Raw (no-equipment) powerlifting organizations now permit use of sleeves for support/safety purposes in their meets.  Although some sleeves (SBD) appear to be designed for achieving gains, the REHBANDs are not.HOW THEY PERFORM:- The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it was wearing these sleeves at all times (standing, partial and full knee flexion).  The articulated design allows full flexion without any feel of pinching behind the knees.- The thickness of the neoprene creates a snug fit and retains heat well  your knees WILL sweat (but you wont know it until you take them off).  This combination of snugness and warmth is the support I needed to ease/eliminate the aggravating aches/pain spikes (from age, not injury) I was experiencing when doing squats and leg presses.  The support was effective enough to allow me to lift with more confidence and peace-of-mind.- The fit was perfect (I ordered a size down) and the sleeves stayed in place  no need to keep pulling them up or make adjustments.  The seams are strong and I have no concern of any material tearing.- You will need to hand wash them periodically (let them dry naturally) or they will smell over time from all the sweat they soak-up.A WORD ABOUT SIZING:- This is a tricky issue.  Rehband states you should measure your knees circumference from the middle of the knee (in cm) and use their sizing chart.  My knee measured at 40cm which was considered an XL.  After some consideration, I opted to order a size down because the Large was up to 39cm and XL started at 39cm (1cm difference was close enough).  Im glad I did as I am fairly certain an XL would have generated a looser-than-desired fit for me.  I wanted snug, not super-tight and ordering a size down gave me the fit I desired.  To some degree, I think it helps to consider the general size of your legs (quads and calves) if youre thinking of deviating from the size chart.I love the REHBAND 7mm KNEE SLEEVES; the warmth and support they provide have considerably helped my aching knees and makes leg day a more enjoyable event.  I bought a smaller sized 7mm knee sleeve to use for my elbow (in lieu of an arm-specific sleeve) and its performance is what led me to get the sleeve for my knees.  Not cheap, but worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317MB98FDY4D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088KPT64#wasThisHelpful","R317MB98FDY4D3","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the recent Rolling Stone/UVA fraternity rape issue being national news, I was interested in seeking literature that detailed fraternity/sorority life.  I was surprised at what little there is to offer on the subject matter (there are more books discussing IBS than the Greek system).  TORN TOGAS was the first book I picked up and boy what a hot mess it proved to be.With the books subtitle being The truth about fraternities and sororities I was expecting TORN TOGAS to be a hit piece  but it proved to be much worse than that.  Instead of taking an objective approach to the subject matter, the author opts to personally generalize and condemn the Greek system (nationwide) with such emotional vigor that it makes one question the books veracity.  Esther Wright obviously had an axe to grind.  Wrights personal input amid a hodge-podge of studies and random headlines (spanning decades) turn TORN TOGAS into an over-dramatized, preachy diatribe that seems more suited as a network drama series screenplay than an honest attempt to explain the Greek system.  The book reminded me of a scene in The Goldbergs sitcom where Beverly reacts to her sons desire to play hockey:  How much will you be moving when a skate glides over your windpipe? It happened to Judy Muntz's nephew and now he can only communicate with a Speak & Spell he wears around his neck.  TORN TOGAS is laughably similar as it seriously attempts to portray joining a Greek organization as being a life or death decision.So, whats wrong with this book?  Most everything.  First of all, if you are not in a fraternity or sorority AND you have no friends or family in such organizations, then Esther Wright has you in her sights.  TORN TOGAS warns nave students and parents that the worst things that can happen to a college student (other than being drafted and sent to war) are waiting for them behind the walls of sorority and fraternity houses.  Armed with the eye-catching list of provocative dangers, she aims to lead you through the mine field of the Greek system; a minefield that includes:  rape, humiliation, rampant drug/alcohol abuse, risky sex/abortions, beatings, roid rage, plastic surgery, eating disorders, massive debt, racism and even death.  Amazingly, the author experienced (directly or indirectly) all of these events as a fraternity little sister and member of a sorority during her college years  Florence Nightingale or even Seal Team Six cant compete with Wrights exploits.  The sheer number of worst-case scenarios notched on Wrights belt generates the biggest ding in the books credibility.  But, this is what she believes the Greek system offers:  personal injury and/or death.Another issue I have with TORN TOGAS is that Wright paints the entire Greek system with her opinion:  most fraternities present awards to those who sleep with the most women, monogamy is considered taboo in most fraternities or While many Greek members are spending their time focusing on who can hold the most shots before puking, other students are getting an education and planning for their future.  These type of ridiculous statements are peppered throughout the book.  My personal experience and those of friends who were also in Greek organizations around the nation (including my wife) dont reflect these stereotypes.  I was in college the same time as the author, but after reading her book, she may have attended school in another galaxy (California).  TORN TOGAS paints Greek organizations in an unnecessarily bad light.  Sure, members of such organizations can and will do stupid, reckless things  that will never change.  But, bad behavior exists in other student organizations as well:  athletic teams, ROTC, marching bands, academic and other social clubs.  Unfortunately, the book doesnt even consider that; to Esther Wright, Greek organizations are no different from outlaw motorcycle clubs, prison gangs or Al Qaeda.  Ironically, the author waits until page 172 of the 175 page book before she lists anything positive about the Greek system (a system she willingly stayed a part of throughout college).  To offset those few paragraphs of positives, she follows the books afterword with about 7 pages of crisis organization info covering everything from gang-rape to toenail fungus.The author, when writing of her own behavior, provides some of the most absurd parts of the book.  Many of her accounts are so over-the-top, it became hard to take any aspect of the book seriously.  In one passage, referring to the supposed peer pressure Greeks exhibit toward consuming alcohol, Wright gripes about being made to feel guilty for not drinking  because she was scheduled for a surgery the next day.  Going to a beer party the night before surgery  simply brilliant.  She also says the obsession to achieve the Greek image of a perfect body led her to get a medical procedure (the Glamour Shot portrait of the author on the books dust cover alludes to the continuance of image-issues).  The same physical obsession has her claiming 25% of her fraternity friends were on steroids which leads her to indulge on the myth of roid rage (which all these friends, of course, exhibited).  Another part of the book, Wright describes how a night of drinking led to a hangover that required her to miss a few days of school and that shed often heard fraternity members talking about women theyd gang-raped.  But the crme-de-la-crme is when she (as a fraternity little sister) claims she interrupted two of her fellow little-sisters being raped by fraternity brothers but did nothing:  We all knew it was rape, yet we kept quiet for FEAR OF LOSING OUR SOCIAL TIES.  If Im not mistaken, she basically admits participating in the cover-up a violent crime against two of her friends so she could still be viewed as cool  now, THATS sisterhood!  Throughout the book, Wright blames fraternities and sororities, but all the evidence she provides leads to the problem being more about she and her friends inability to think for themselves and act rationally.TORN TOGAS is nothing more than a personal vendetta aimed at steering people away from organizations based on the supposed behavior exhibited by the author and her cohorts.  Its both preachy, misleading and relies on assumptions and questionable personal accounts to illustrate points.  Honestly, joining a Greek organization is a personal decision that requires one to think for themselves and like ANY organization/group there are always going to be positives/negatives and good/bad people to contend with.  Most rational people (and I include myself) wouldnt have put up with a fraction of the garbage the author claims to have suffered through.  Bottom line, you can always quit an organization if it behaves in a manner you dont like, which is something Esther Wright either refused or didnt have the wherewithal to do herself.  Obviously, Im still looking for a more objective book on the Greek system.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3X37WHWFNZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0925190942#wasThisHelpful","R3O3X37WHWFNZ9","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the life of Adolph Hitler has been well-documented in text and film, our understanding of his ultimate demise is heavily based on words and memory of Traudl Junge (nee Humps).  HITLERS LAST SECRETARY provides a fly-on-the-wall perspective that reveals one of historys most notorious figures as being rather dull.I first saw Traudl Junge on several episodes of the World at War (the fabulous and comprehensive British documentary of the Second World War) and found her eyewitness account of Hitlers last days quite memorable.  As Hitlers youngest secretary, she became a trusted member of his inner circle (he even dictated his last will and testament to her).  From the peak of his power in 1942 to his cowardly demise underneath the ruins of Berlin, Junge saw Hitler in a variety of lights:  relaxing atop the Eagles Nest, bantering with Nazi lapdogs, surviving an assassination attempt and his somewhat odd relationship with Eva Braun  she saw it all.  While much of the book centers on her casual observances, Junge provides enough extraordinary details to make it all worth reading and I found it hard to put the book down once I started reading.Even though Junge wrote the book a few years after the war, I never sensed that absolution was her purpose in writing the book  she simply had a story worth telling.  There are points in the book where hindsight comes into play, but most of her story is pretty straightforward.  She makes no bones that Hitlers charisma and power were hard to ignore and admits that working for him was a pleasant experience overall.  Of course, one wonders to what extent she was aware of the atrocities being committed under her boss order.  There are instances in the book where the Nazis pervasive attitude toward Jews is known/accepted (including one moment where a respected woman with Jewish lineage appears to have been spared by Hitler), but this is an issue that Junge opts not to indulge  the war is what takes front and center.  The reader is left to judge whether Junges account was intentionally void of such particulars or that she simply wasnt privy to certain matters.  The individuals she is exposed to on a regular basis represent a whos who of Nazi war criminals (Himmler, Boremann, Goebbels, etc.), so it is plausible to assume she was aware (to some degree) of Nazi atrocities.While the movie Downfall (which draws heavily from Junges experiences), portrays Hitler as a raging madman reaching the end of his rope, the book doesnt deliver any of the movies intensity. In fact, much of the book details a different side of Hitler  less of a madman and more of a simple, boring and somewhat strange man.  Junges interactions with Hitler are always described as being pleasant.  She notes many of the mans idiosyncrasies, including his hypochondria (requiring daily injections), his penchant for napping in front of guests, the affection he has for his dog (Blondi) and his oddly platonic relationship with Eva Braun.  In fact, Junge speaks more negatively about Hitlers bootlicking followers and confidents.  Simply put, the book does not paint Hitler as the detestable person we know he proved to be.  But, it is not difficult to believe that Junges experience with the man never led her to draw such a conclusion at the time as he was always kind and respectful toward her.  While some may view her book as humanizing such a despicable figure, I have always felt the stereotypical depiction of ruthless dictators as a monstrous supervillains tends to inadvertently aggrandize these people and make them larger than life.  Junges observations of Hitler do not portray him as anything special.HITLERS LAST SECRETARY offers a smooth read, even though it mainly consists of one long chapter (one reason it was hard to put down).  I found the details provided about Hitler and his inner circle quite fascinating:  the interior of the Berghof retreat, Eva Brauns clothes and demeanor, Hitlers eating habits, his opinions on mundane topics (like his disdain for smoking) and frank commentary on those close to Hitler.  Junge provides a much clearer image of the chaos that erupted deep within the bunker in the wars final days, including Goebbels decision to poison his six children, Hitler/Eva Brauns wedding ceremony, as well as their suicides and the subsequent disposal of her bodies (which she doesnt witness first hand).  Even though Junges own account ends with her emerging from the bunker, Melissa Muller provides an informative and interesting final chapter that picks up where Junges writing stopped.  This final chapter serves as a biography of Traudl Junge from the wars end through the 1990s.HITLERS LAST SECRETARY is a worthy read as it offers a fascinating peek inside the machine responsible for mankinds greatest tragedy.  While some readers may question the authors intent or be turned off by her unapologetic/straightforward approach to the subject matter, it is hard to ignore the historical significance of Traudl Junges observations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188IXZN8D9P9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611453232#wasThisHelpful","R188IXZN8D9P9B","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our family has been using the same brand of jarred marinara for years and regardless of the wide variety of flavors offered; other than differing levels of spiciness, they all pretty much taste the same to me.  I was more than impressed with BARILLAS marinara (specifically, its Bacon & Cheese and its Meat sauce)  the texture and flavors offered by both were certainly unique.Bacon and Cheese:- I initially thought this unique flavor combo would be too much, but I was quite surprised.  By far, the most unique flavor of jarred marinara Ive tried.  This particular sauce has a distinctive cheese aroma with a hint of bacon.  The sauce is thick with a wonderful hint of sweetness that reminds me of the homemade sauce used by our favorite Jersey-style pizza joint  very tasty!  What I liked most was that the sauce isnt overwhelmed by the bacon and cheese flavors; they blend well with the tomatoes and offer a distinctively different flavor.  So many sauces disappointingly overwhelm the natural sweetness of the tomato with Italian seasonings, like basil  not this sauce.- A single serving (1/2 cup) contains:  1.5g fat, 480mg sodium, 12g carbs (8g sugar/1g fiber) and 2g protein.Meat sauce:- I generally add my own ground beef and/or sausage to jarred marinara, so I was somewhat skeptical about jarred meat sauce.  But, this sauce manages to provide a rich meaty flavor and a thick enough texture to stand on its own.  This marinara is somewhat mild and the meat accents rather than overpowers the distinctively (naturally) sweet tomato flavor I prefer in a marinara.- A single serving (1/2 cup) contains:  1g fat, 480mg sodium, 13g carbs (7g sugar/3g fiber) and 2g protein.I really love the slightly sweet tomato flavors offered by both types of BARILLA marinara.  These sauces offer a nice alternative to the standard over-spiced, salty sauces Ive been stuck accepting over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3SKKWJP1LYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP7O7CG#wasThisHelpful","R2R3SKKWJP1LYR","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My chopping choices at home are the cheap as seen on TV Slap Chop (dont laugh  it works, but disassembly/re-assembly makes it a pain to clean) or the cumbersome Cuisinart (also a pain to clean).  The BLACK & DECKER ERGO CHOPPER combines the convenience of a hand-held chopper, decent power, practical storage and easy cleaning.WHAT IT IS:- A 3-cup electric (the product photos dont reveal a cord, alluding to it possibly being battery powered).  The 200 watt motor can be operated at two pulse speeds.- In addition to the motor, the chopper comes with:  two 3-cup clear plastic containers for chopping and storage, 2 plastic disks that serve as both lids to the containers and baseplates to keep the bowls in place when chopping and a single, removable stainless steel chopping blade.HOW IT PERFORMS:- Assembly and operation is a cinch:  simply place the blade in its slot at the bottom of a container, fit the motor over the container so it connects to the blade arm and chop away.  The two speed pulse buttons large and positioned for easy use.  The clear containers allow you to clearly see results to determine necessary chopping speeds.- The lid doubles as a coaster/skid plate for the container to keep the container from sliding or (more importantly) tipping when chopping.  After chopping, the lids can be snapped on the container to store the contents.- The BLACK & DECKER ERGO is a solid, tough chopper that performed better and more smoothly than I expected.  My first experience was chopping almonds for pancakes and it did the job easily and effectively  good-bye Slap Chop.  It cuts through vegetables and fruit with little effort.  I was surprised at how effective the little blade was  it is sharper than it looks.- The container bowls have measurements on the side and nest.  The entire ensemble leaves a footprint that is smaller than a stack of cereal bowls  a true space saver.- Clean-up is just as easy.  The bowls and blade are dishwasher safe and the motor can simply be wiped clean.ONE GRIPE:- It only uses a chopping blade (so far).  Would love to see slicing or whipping attachments being available in the future to increase the ERGOS versatility.The BLACK & DECKER ERGO is a handy, convenient and efficient kitchen tool.  It is perfect for those who want the benefits of having a solid chopper, but want to avoid the expense/bulk of a food processor or the complications associated with a cheaper hand chopper.  A solid, thoughtfully made product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J88EKSIKRQL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDVJHZK#wasThisHelpful","R2J88EKSIKRQL4","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no doubt that I would get around to read Joe Perrys autobiography; Perrys outro solo on No More, No More is what inspired me to pick up a guitar almost 40 years ago.  While fame/infamy seems to go hand-in-hand with the rock-n-roll memoirs being cranked out these days, surprisingly few include anything of substance and most seem to rely on shock value over a worthy story.  Arguably, ROCKS proves several things:  1. in some cases, an individual members perspective of a band is necessary, honest and believable, 2. the experience of surviving 40+ years in the unforgiving world of rock-n-roll and remaining on top is a tale worth hearing about, 3. Joe Perry is a pretty damn good storyteller.Aerosmith, one of rocks preeminent American bands, has certainly provided a cautious template for every band that followed it.  That template includes the bands hard-scrabble beginning, rise to fame, exploitation, fall from grace and resurrection.  Joe Perry, as a founding member and half of the Toxic Twins (the name given to the drug-fueled, but prolific songwriting partnership he shares with Steven Tyler), arguably has the best perspective (and best demeanor) to honestly divulge the bands dirt.  While ROCKS is NOT a flame-throwing, bomb-dropping shocker, Perry certainly delivers the hard truths about Aerosmiths tumultuous history, his tempestuous relationship with Tyler, the women, the drugs and the resilience needed to bring life back to a band that he left for dead.What impressed me about ROCKS more than anything was Perrys open and even-handed approach to the book and the band.  Ever since I first got into Aerosmith (mid-to-late 70s), I was not only intrigued by their bluesy, edgy, hard-driving sound, but also the bands general POd appearance (check out the cover of their first album)  they looked as edgy and hard-driving as they sounded.  While we all are aware that Steven Tyler as the screaming, screeching mouthpiece of Aerosmith (on and off stage), Perry always came across as the silent, brooding union-shop leader representing the blue-collar team comprised of the other band members (Brad Whitford, Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton).  With ROCKS, Perry sheds that quiet persona and truly opens up by sharing vivid details of his life in and outside of Aerosmith.  While the crux of the book certainly centers on his band, we also get an interesting and somewhat un-stereotypical image of his personal life and family.  Sure, drugs and alcohol share a sizeable chunk of the books pages, but his devotion to family is an underlying theme from beginning to end.  Perry reveals that behind the thunder of his Marshall stacks, the clouds of coke-dust and mobs of screaming fans is a surprisingly grounded, savvy man who admits hes always been the type of guy devoted to the woman hes with (somewhat astonishing considering the bands first apex occurred during the golden era of groupies).  I found the manner in which Perry discusses his life to be quite engaging  he has a knack of generating a vivid picture of events without being verbose or getting off track (unlike many memoirs Ive read).  Perry actually comes across as quite humble and respectful  even when discussing the trials and tribulations involving his relationship with Tyler and his ex-wife Elyssa.So, what makes ROCKS rock?  To put it simply, the journey.  Readers dont have to be a fan of Aerosmith to enjoy the front-car view of the 40+ year rollercoaster ride that is Perrys life.  It details the hedonism we expect from a rock icon, without the bombast.  And, while he delivers the goods on his relationship with Tyler, he does more to debunk the myths associated with their relationship than pour gasoline on a simmering fire.  For example, I distinctly remember (as a kid) going to a pizza joint with my baseball team after a game and hearing someone tell us than the Aerosmith concert was cancelled because Tyler and Perry got into a fistfight on stage the previous night  well, that never happened (Perry states the brotherly animosity between he and Tyler has never come to blows).  Sure, there are a few barbs thrown at his toxic twin, but overall, regardless of what the media may depict, there has always been a brotherly bond amongst all members of the band  even when things fell apart in the early 80s.  Despite the lack of overt drama and gotcha moments, the book delivers a steady rolling account of minor and significant events that keeps you interested the whole way through.  Surprisingly, its not solely a Perry/Tyler affair, the book provides a nice overview of the band that sheds light on the other members contributions.  Additionally, we get some insight on the business side of rock music (including a cult-like manager whose control creeped into the bands' personal lives) and the interaction amongst fellow rock icons (the pages are filled with such contacts)  Perry paints himself quite humbly throughout.  While Ive always been a fan of Perry and Aerosmith; reading his story makes me appreciate the band even more as it is evident their success is hard earned.  I loved getting the details on how Aerosmith became the villains (and the only segment worth watching) in the Sgt. Pepper movie with Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees.  Or, how they re-worked Walk this Way with RunDMC; vaulting them into the realm of MTV and generating more fame and wealth than ever.  Through it all, Perry has remained grounded and focused (on his music and family).  I guess I was expecting a controversial expose (like so many other rock memoirs), but found myself immersed in a more believable story that proved to be just as interesting.ROCKS is a worthy read because it is entertaining, informative and more importantly, well-written.  A must read for fans of Aerosmith and rock music alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5FSYP6I9W4HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476714541#wasThisHelpful","R5FSYP6I9W4HP","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting an early reader excited about sinking her teeth into a 250+ page book that wasnt half filled with pictures is no easy task.  But, THIRTEEN CHAIRS provides enough varying and tantalizing content to prove that well-written stories often evoke the best imagery.THIRTEEN CHAIRS centers on a young boy (Jack) who is drawn to a creepy house with a flickering light emanating from its windows.  Upon entering, he sees the light source, a candle resting in the center of a large round table.  Surrounding the table are twelve chairs occupied by a variety of people (young and old) and an empty chair  for Jack.  He has a seat and the reader is drawn into the meat of the book when the other twelve individuals tell their tale, one after another.  Each story is represented by an individual chapter and content/subject matter differs from one another.  The only pictures in the book are at the start of the chapters and the pictures serve as a means to lure readers into the tale about to be told.  While the book is designated for ages 12 and up, my almost 9 year old daughter (prepped by her interest in World War II and the Holocaust) did not find the stories difficult to understand and was not frightened by the subject matter of some of the more ominous tales (which often include death/dying  even murder).  What she enjoyed best was the rather wide variety of each story, including:  a boat accidents sole survivor, a trip to Antarctica, cats, a deceptive tree and a pickpockets surprise.  Her favorite, however, was the chapter titled The Girl in the Red Coat which is a story about a group of school/playground bullies as the atmosphere it generated was more tangible.  She especially enjoyed the twist provided by the last chapter, when Jack finally gets the chance to tell his story.Overall, THIRTEEN CHAIRS provides a nice grouping of well-written, interesting and chilling tales for young readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZZ83GA9Q5N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545816653#wasThisHelpful","R2VZZ83GA9Q5N2","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike other historical eras, the 20th century is mostly defined in decades.  Whether it be the roaring 20s, the war-ravaged 40s or turbulent 60s, each 10 year cycle seemed to leave a definitive cultural footprint on the path of (American) life.  I admit that Im partial to the decades of my childhood/college years (70s and 80s) and still maintain a historical interest in previous decades, but, I simply cant stand the 90s.  THE TOTALLY SWEET 90s, while humorous and informative, seemed to validate my negative sentiment of a decade where style firmly overtook substance on almost every level (a trend that started in the 80s).THE TOTALLY SWEET 90s is an A-to-Z encyclopedia that covers a myriad of iconic toys, foods, clothes and entertainment that defined a decade probably more memorable for its projected doomsday ending (Y2K) than the preceding 10 years.  Each entry consists of a brief description in which the authors inject their own sarcastic take on the subject matter, followed by a current-day status update and an informative fun fact.  The authors have provided a nicely organized 1990s time-capsule with plenty of research and several photos to jog your memories.  I must credit the effort in developing such a comprehensive list that includes many forgotten/obscure items (Surge Soda and Gak) on top of the obvious (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).  As expected, there will be those disappointed in the exclusion of some 90s-related item that only a handful of people care to remember, but youd be hard-pressed to find a more comprehensive list (for crying out loud, even the Its Pat movie is mentioned in the book).  I do wish each and every entry included a photo.Even though I enjoyed the light-hearted trip down memory lane, the ongoing list of mindless techno-junk (Tamagotchi and Furby), completely unnecessary food experiments (Doritos 3-D), music (Macerena) and fads (Beanie Babies) started to annoy as well as rationalize my disdain for the 90s.  I was reminded me how mindless things started to get; when things began to matter more than people.  A decade defined by Riverdance, Jim Carrey, the Spice Girls and Zubaz is something Id rather forget.  Sure, the decade wasnt all bad, after all it did deliver Seinfeld and Snapple, but those gems are buried in a mountain of sludge that includes MMMBop, the Ebola Virus, OJ and the boxers or briefs debate.While the 90s werent memorable for me, I find THE TOTALLY SWEET 90s to be a nice resource documenting that moment in time  for better or for worse.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQX3I3VIC2LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160043#wasThisHelpful","ROQX3I3VIC2LG","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive known about The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (a two-night circus-themed concert in 1968 with several iconic performers) for decades, but a PBS push to sell a DVD of the event provided the audio-visual candy I needed to purchase a digital copy.  As a fan of classic rock and roll, I see value in this movie.  While there are some notorious oddities presented in the film, they dont come close to outshining the cumulative musical highlights of the eras more iconic performers. The ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS is definitely a time capsule of an era where weirdness became not only acceptable, but cool.  The film captures the period perfectly with the concerts circus theme, which is played to the hilt by not only including circus clown performances, but also by the attire donned by the audience and some of the performers.  It is the British adaptation of the hippie movement and everything is designed to be groovy.  The concert is seen as an intimate event; a big-top housing a small audience that enjoys the benefit of having the performers sitting among them after playing.First of all, the list of performers makes this a worthy purchase in and of itself:  The Who, Taj Mahal (with Jessie Ed Davis on Guitar), Marianne Faithful, Jethro Tull (with future Black Sabbath guitarist Tommy Iommi as a fill-in), The Rolling Stones and most notably, the Dirty Mac, an ad-hock super group featuring Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell (Jimi Hendrix drummer), Keith Richards (on bass) and John Lennonn.  The quality of the music, for the most part, is top notch (ironically, others perform better than the Stones).  I favor The Whos humorous and awesome rendition of A Quick One While Hes Away which clocks in at almost 8 minutes.  I also found Taj Mahals crunchy, yet soulful version of Aint That a Lotta Love to be another highlight.  The Rolling Stones are, as they have always been, somewhat spotty.  The value in this performance is that it is the last live performance of Brian Jones before hes booted from the band and dies shortly after (his shoddy appearance in the film is indicative of his pending demise).Probably the jewel of the film is the segment that shows the super group, the Dirty Mac.  The musical contributions of each member and how effortlessly they mesh to generate such a gritty groove is pretty cool to watch, especially considering the ad-hoc nature of the band.  Then there is Yokos unforgettable appearance in Whole Lotta Yoko where she interrupts a phenomenal Dirty Mac jam session (with added umph from violinist Ivry Gitlis) and introduces a free-range vocal session that sounds like a series of cats receiving a prostate examination.  The vocals are regrettably unforgettable but the audience somehow appears to dig it (another sign of the times, I guess).  On the other hand, it might be the best reason to own the movie (people need to see it in order to believe it)Overall, I put this movie in the same category as other classic rock concert documentaries that covered events like the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock and Altamont.  If youre into the late-60s genre of rock music, the performances of so many music icons at one stop makes THE ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS a worthy film to add to the video library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBTKKCYHLK8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8AJS7G#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBTKKCYHLK8Q","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some things you simply must have.  Things you know will cause others eyes to roll.  Things you simply cannot explain or justify the need for, whether it be your family, friends and, at times, yourself.  Its a recurring event in my life:  in 7th grade (1978) it was purchasing a piece of a guitar that KISSs Paul Stanley smashed during a concert in my area (wish I still had it) and last year it was ditching disposable razors for the classic double-edged safety razor (actually , a wise move).  The gotta have at all costs bug bit me this year when I saw this inert 30mm round that was fired from GAU-8/A Avenger  the wicked Gatling-type of gun mounted in the ominous A-10 Thunderbolt II.  I simply had to have one.WHAT IT IS:- A refinished aluminum shell casing once fired by the US military with a military-spec milled aluminum projectile inserted to give the appearance of an unfired round.- There are 2 color choices:  olive drab and flat black.  I opted for the olive drab as, for some reason, it is 50% cheaper.- The inert round comes with a folded tent card of data that explains the GAU-8/A Avenger gun system in full detail, as well as the only aircraft that uses the gun system (the A-10).WHY ITS APPEALING:- The physical size of the round:  from base to tip, it is approx. 11  or 28mm tall and looks fearsome.  The empty casing makes the round lightweight and while it stands up well on a hard surface, it isnt a reliable paperweight.- While it is a dummy round, the aluminum insert gives the authentic appearance of a deadly live round.  With that being said, be wary of your kids trying to sneak off to school with it for show-and-tell  such a scenario could cause major problems for you.- The aluminum insert can be taken off (carefully and with effort) to reveal the empty casing. You can insert sand or other material to add weight for a little authenticity or use it as a secret storage compartment.- The bottom of the round shows the indentation made from a firing pin  meaning youve got a real piece of some hardcore military hardware (though you can only assume an A-10 actually fired the round).While my daughters thought the 30mm round was pretty cool, my wife rolled her eyes.  Then, I showed her a few YouTube videos of the A-10 firing its gun.  The definitive and eerie RRRRRPPPP sound of the gun firing and the ensuing damage done to the tanks/armored vehicles was difficult for her to ignore  she smiled, indicating she understood why I bought it (validating my purchase).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZFZYKZRCTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3HD428#wasThisHelpful","RZZFZYKZRCTJ","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love gadgets and I also love snowboarding.  So, when I saw a snowboard-related multi-tool, I couldnt resist.  While the Leatherman HAIL is a handy gadget, it proves to be much more functional when nesting another Leatherman multi-tool (the PS) inside of it.WHAT IS IT?- A functional stainless steel carabineer coated with black oxide that is designed to handle on-the-mountain snowboard repairs.  It is less than 4 long and weighs only 1.6 oz.- The HAIL is shaped/designed for 5 main functions:  a dual #3 flat/Phillips screwdriver, a bottle opener, a wax scraper, a 10mm hex wrench and a boot lace assist.  It also has indentations to store a set of earbuds (the buds snap into the designated slots so you can the wire around the HAIL and secure the adaptor end into another designated slot.  The carabineer design allows it to be clipped to your boot lace or belt loop for easy storage/access.WHAT MAKES IT GOOD:- Ive taken several tools with me when snowboarding and while they get the job done, they can be both cumbersome and bothersome (they simply rest in a pocket).  The HAIL is simple and strong.  The open design offers better gripping options (even with gloves on) and the tools are solid with no moving parts or mechanisms to deal with.  It addresses emergency board issues in a simple, logical manner.  I love the carabineer design and dont have to worry about losing it.WHAT MAKES IT BETTER:- While the HAIL by itself is a snowboard tool, its only use off-season is that of a fancy bottle opener (which it does quite well).  The best all-around use of the device is when you nest the Leatherman PS multi-tool inside of the HAIL.  The PS is designed to fit/nest snuggly inside of the HAIL.  Folded up, the stainless steel PS is less than 3 long and weighs roughly 1.5oz.. In addition to a carabineer clip (which syncs with the HAILs clip), it offers a needlenose/regular pliers/wire cutter (spring-action), a nail file with a flat/Phillips screwdriver tip, a bottle opener, scissors (spring-action) and removable metal tweezers.  Adding the PS to the HAIL is a big plus in that it turns a snowboard-specific tool into an everyday tool.- While I have yet to put it to the test, Leatherman claims that both the HAIL and the PS are TSA compliant.The HAIL is a well thought-out gadget.  While the HAIL and the PS can be purchased individually, they offer a more practical 1-2 punch when theyre together.  I carry mine on a belt loop almost every day and it not only comes in handy (especially the tweezers), but garners a lot of attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XFJR9FKUNZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4ZX076#wasThisHelpful","R8XFJR9FKUNZD","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been a competitive powerlifter and bodybuilder, I first hopped on the protein shake train some 20 years ago.  While my competition days are over, I still maintain the lifestyle and consume at least one protein shake every day.  Needless to say, Ive been through countless shakers, bottles and other gadgets that seemed to function well in some areas, but fail miserably in others.  Then I got the BLENDERBOTTLE SPORTMIXER and realized this particular shaker bottle has everything I could have wanted in shaker bottle and more.WHAT IT IS:- 28 oz. contoured bottle made of tritan (copolyester).  The screw on drinking lid has a snap on cap.  A wire whisk ball drops into the bottle to ground/pulverize/mix contents.WHAT MAKES IT SO GOOD:- The shape:  The SPORTMIXER is cylindrical and contoured at the top for a better grip.  Most of the shaker bottles Ive used are conical/flared toward the top and dont allow a solid grip for vigorous shaking (especially when some bottles require a finger or two to keep the cap or top from opening).- The material:  Eastman Tritan  an uber-solid alternative to plastic that is extremely durable/strong, clear, lightweight, easy to clean, dishwasher safe and remains odorless.  No cheap plastic here  this thing can take a beating.- The lid:  the lid securely screws to the bottle and eliminates the worry of leaks/drips.  The drinking spout is large.  In my opinion, shakes are quick/on-the-fly meals that are generally chugged (even more-so if your protein powder of choice tastes like garbage and youre in function over taste mode).  Too many shaker bottles dont pay attention to such details and offer a spout akin to a sippy-cup or have you drinking from an open cup (likely causing spillage).  While we will most likely pour shake contents into the bottle with the lid off, the drinking spout is big enough to accommodate gulping, dropping berries into your shake or adding water from your kitchen sink.- The cap:  This is often a much over-looked aspect of shaker bottles, but it is pretty important.  Too many times a spout cap opens while shaking a cheap bottle and Ive developed a habit of putting my fingers over the cap to prevent this from happing.  Unfortunately, cheaper shaker bottles have caps that are poorly designed, oddly shaped or dont allow a secure place to put my fingers.  The SPORTMIXER addresses all issues with a cap that not only securely snaps in place, but has a deep recess that actually allows me to hook my finger into it.  The cap tilts back far enough to keep it from touching your nose when drinking and incorporates a ring for carrying or hooking to a bag.  Functional design.- Rubber:  The contoured portion of the bottles cylinder has a wide rubber ring for added grip.  Even better, the lid has a rubber ring with a knobs for a better grip when twisting the lid on or off the bottle.- One side of the bottle has an easy to read volume scale that shows both oz. and ml.- There are a multitude of color combinations for both the bottle and the cap.  The only problem I have with the bottle is that I opted for the black/black version which makes it difficult to see the contents unless you hold the bottle up to the light  no big deal.The SPORTMIXER provides everything I want in shaker bottle.  The folks at BlenderBottle didnt just churn out a shaker bottle, they obviously understand the needs of the market and designed a product that not only meets demands, but is built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBY7GY8AT2BL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VT9R62#wasThisHelpful","RBY7GY8AT2BL9","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally, drama is the only thing that draws me to a biography.  Down and out rock stars, actors and actresses hitting rock bottom or those whove endured/survived horrible situations  they have a tale to tell.  I find the worst biographies are written when the subject is on top (at a peak in their life)  those books tend to be a little arrogant, preachy and oftentimes, pre-mature.  I didnt know what to expect with Gretchen Carlsons GETTING REAL as she seems to be at a peak in her career  then I found out she was a former Miss America and wondered if there may actually be a story worth reading.On television, Gretchen Carlson presents herself as a strong-willed and assertive individual.  I will admit, at times, she comes across as somewhat tough and maybe even a little rigid, but I figure those traits are necessary with her line of work.  But the tough and serious image doesnt mesh with the Miss America title and I became curious to learn more about her.  GETTING REAL proved to be an eye and mind-opener for me as I discovered there is a much more complex and talented individual behind the person I was seeing/hearing on television.No, GETTING REAL is not a flame-throwing, bomb-dropping tell-all that reveals dirty, disgusting secrets that shock.  Carlsons story is more can-do than cautionary and while it lacks a certain danger, it definitely proved to be an interesting and worthy read.  What I enjoyed most about the book is that behind the on-air persona is a deep and immensely talented individual with a personal drive that commands respect.  Told in a self-deprecating manner, Carlson reveals a great deal about herself throughout and proves that success was never something handed to her  shes worked hard and earned every bit of it.  A self-described chubby girl whose immense skill with the violin earned her right to perform with the Minnesota Orchestra as a young child.  While strong bonds to her faith and family keep her grounded, it also contributed to an inner strength that has guided her independence, the ability to stand by decisions and face challenges.  The focus and drive necessary for her to maintain the highest level of academics (she was Valedictorian in high school and earned Summa Cum Laude honors at Stanford) and music is both impressive and inspiring.The chapter dedicated to the Miss America contest was particularly interesting and educational.  I learned a great deal about what Miss America is all about (much more than swimsuits) and how Carlson saw it as an opportunity to crush the negative tall-blonde-bimbo stereotype associated with its contestants.  Even though she admittedly blew the question/answer phase of the competition, she stunned judges with her violin talent (this prompted me to see her performance on YouTube and believe me, its extraordinary).  While the Miss America title served a boost to Carlsons confidence, it proved to be a double-edged sword as the pageant stereotype was still a formidable obstacle to overcome when starting her broadcasting career.  In fact, she took efforts to steer attention away from that achievement.Other revelations in the book include a struggle with self/body image (even through the Miss America phase of her life), dealing with sexism (attempted sexual assault) and a frightening experience with a stalker who haunted her for almost two decades.  Carlson has been through some trying times in her life, but always managed to pull herself together and successfully move forward, regardless of the challenge.  And while most know her for the gig she has at FOXNews, it is only a small part of the life shes lived.GETTING REAL is a relaxing read that puts you in a position of understanding the person you see on TV is just the tip of the iceberg.  Gretchen Carlson proves to be a person of substance, not appearance.  Her book not only reveals her as highly intelligent, but genuine and kind  a successful role-model for anyone, not just women.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OSEI7TV5B3VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427457#wasThisHelpful","R1OSEI7TV5B3VH","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not being one who enjoys fiction, I found the story of life in a Soviet gulag by someone who actually survived the experience to be quite inviting.  What I cant understand is why it took me so long to read ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH  a modern classic.Reading Russian the works of Russian writers (and watching Russian movies, for that matter) is a different experience (and an acquired taste), but I found Solzhenitsyn to be a vivid storyteller.  A short novel that consists of a single chapter detailing one miserable day of gulag life certainly provides food for thought regarding the cruelty the Soviet system routinely subjected its citizens  even after liberating them from Nazi brutality.Ivan Denisovich Shukhov is deemed a spy after being captured by the Germans during World War II and is sentenced to ten years at a labor camp.  Although innocent of the charges, he is helpless and must simply endure a decade of hard labor in a remote prison camp; the book gives readers an idea of the drudgery associated with a typical day at the camp.  From the very beginning, with Shukhov waking up feeling sick, we realize that every day, simple decisions will result in consequences as Shukhov opts to work even though hes sick.  As the day begins, the other members of Shukhovs team of fellow prisoners are introduced  each possessing a uniqueness that factors into the days events.  The setting is bleak:  aside from the bitter cold and snow, there is the image of the prisoners living in tattered clothing and filth (foot rags for socks and sawdust-filled mattresses).  With the work for the day centering on the construction of a brick wall, the hierarchy among Shukhovs team becomes evident and the individual personalities of the prisoners comes to light.  It doesnt take long to realize that the purpose behind every action of every day affects the one thing that matters most  food.  The beginning of the book details the meticulous care Shukhov takes in hiding a crust of bread in his mattress as an emergency ration if the days events dont result in an adequate ration of food.  That sliver of bread is referenced throughout the book. Whether it be garnering favor from the team leader, working harder, stealing or cadging, each inmate uses whatever tool or skill he possesses to survive While the title makes it clear that the entire book details a single day, Solzhenitsyn makes that day seem like eternal misery.  Every aspect of the story evokes something unpleasant and serves as a powerful image of the depressing reality of the Soviet system.  Anything and everything can be construed as a crime against the State ... innocence cant be proven. The sun shines, but offers no warmth.  The barracks are cold, the men filthy and the food is inedible.  Even the utilitarian wall being built offers no sense of purpose other than giving the prisoners something to do.  The end of the book drives home the feeling of futility involved with surviving one day of a 10 year sentence.  For Shukhov, this particular day worked in his favor, but were left wondering what the next day will bring  or the day after.  We sense that each day presents the same challenges, but yields different results and the struggle to survive is as much mental as it is physical.While I was initially hesitant to read this book, I quickly became engrossed in the story being told and found it hard to put down.  Solzhenitsyn effectively captures the depressing and oppressive nature of Soviet rule.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6ZWWKDXMYM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451228146#wasThisHelpful","R1G6ZWWKDXMYM1","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered the fate of the Wilhelm Gustloff as a child while skimming through my 1975 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.  The ships sinking was simply noted as historys worst maritime disaster on a list of several other catastrophic events causing significant loss of life.  While the sinking of the Lusitania and the Titanic are deemed historical events, the combined number of deaths associated with those ships is roughly 3x less than the number of deaths from the Gustloff.  Astonishingly, most people have never heard of the Wilhelm Gustloff.  With DEATH IN THE BALTIC, Cathryn Prince shines a much-needed light on the ship, its demise and the reasons why such a catastrophe is still nothing more than a historical footnote some 70 years later.In many ways, DEATH IN THE BALTIC underscores the huge difference between the Western Allies war against Germany and the one the Soviet Union fought.  The war in Western Europe sought to liberate while the focus in Eastern Europe was annihilation.  Had it been sunk in the Atlantic by a British or American submarine, the name Wilhelm Gustloff and its nearly 10,000 victims likely would have been a must discussed history topic.  But, with such an incident occurring on the Eastern Front, its death toll is rather insignificant  just another atrocity in a conflict defined by more deadly atrocities.Cathryn Prince provides a nice, well-rounded perspective for readers by providing ample background prior to the ships demise.  The first several chapters of the book are designed to provide us with a better understanding of how the overall scenario developed over time.  She starts by detailing the precarious situation that East Prussians found themselves facing in early 1945  an isolated part of Germany sandwiched between occupied Poland and the unstoppable, revenge-fueled Red Army rapidly approaching from the East.  The situation demanded a solution to save some 2 million German lives by sea-born evacuation (Operation Hannibal).  Similar to the British/French evacuation at Dunkirk in 1940, a variety of suitable vessels were needed, including the luxury liner Wilhelm Gustloff.  Prince provides several first-hand accounts to accentuate the experience faced by East Prussians essentially cutoff from the German homeland.  The accounts include those of young children whose lives were both enjoyable and normal when the war was far from their doorsteps.  We are also informed of the dangerous situation in the Baltic Sea, where the escape vessels are forced to contend with mines (some 60,000) and a re-invigorated Soviet Navy, including a submarine commander needing a heroic deed to save his career from insubordination.  By including all these angles, Prince sets the table for the night of January 30, 1945.Although we essentially know what happens shortly after the Gustloff sets off into frigid abyss that January in 1945, the book does a good job maintaining suspense as we are given an idea as to what it was like on board the overcrowded vessel, with civilians and soldiers alike feeling theyd escaped certain death or captivity by leaving East Prussia.  When the S-13 fires 3 torpedoes into the Gustloff, chaos and survival are evident, but there is also an element of order.  When the torpedoes strike, the story gets a little confusing as each survivors account is told after another (giving the impression of multiple attacks), but these accounts eventually even out.  While the ship sinks in relatively short order, the ordeal of those in the water is dramatic and miserable (think of the movie Titanic x 10).  Life and death decisions on the surviving, yet overcrowded life boats in the icy Baltic make it difficult to believe there were almost 1,000 survivors, including children.  The accounts of surviving in the water are some of the more dramatic moments in the book.I found one off the books most interesting attributes to be the aftermath of the ships sinking; how survivors and the sub-commander fared and how history views the incident.  For the most part, everything was forgotten  survivors wanted to avoid the shame of Germanys Nazi past and the Soviet Union did not want to draw attention to the sinking of a civilian ship (which was carrying military passengers as well).  The S-13 actually sank another vessel shortly after the Gustloff, making the sub responsible for another 3-4,000 deaths.  The details of S-13s commander (A. Marinesko), his wartime service and life, is an interesting story by itself.  Mysteriously, modern-day explorations of the Gustloffs wreckage have oddly found no trace of human existence, indicating the Soviet Union was involved in cleaning up the wreckage (possibly in search of valuable military or historical cargo).  Essentially, the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff and the lack of information following its demise (from survivors and German/Soviet records) shroud this story in mystery.  While the book sufficiently encapsulates events, we are still left with the feeling that there are questions that cant or wont be answered.I found DEATH IN THE BALTIC to be both informative and interesting to read.  It is astounding that the sinking of the Titanic garners so much attention, yet the fate of the Gustloff is relatively unknown.  This book provides an excellent overview of the before-during-after aspects of a significant tragedy that is still quite mysterious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3ZY95RO717I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279192#wasThisHelpful","R2F3ZY95RO717I","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I joined a fraternity at a large state university in the mid-1980s and stumbled upon FROM HERE TO FRATERNITY in the campus bookstore; I still treasure this book.  While the books initial purpose as an entertaining reference, I still find value in the volume for its nostalgic value as it defined a seemingly bygone era when Greek Life (fraternities and sororities) was not only fun, popular and functional, but purposeful.Watching episodes of The Goldbergs has given me a strong sense of nostalgia for the 80s.  I am fortunate to have graduated high school in 1984  meaning I had a chance to enjoy a childhood molded by the freewheeling 70s and attend college in the wacky 80s  joining a fraternity/sorority was quite common.  FROM HERE TO FRATERNITY proved to be a well-rounded reference for all things pertaining to the Greek community across the United States at the time (1980s).Egan provides the nuts-and-bolts of almost every facet of fraternity/sorority life:  history, pledging, rituals, symbols, pranks, drinking games and parties.  The book provides an interesting perspective of the times, when Wayfarers, Izod, Vuarnets, Forenza and Reebok adorned the students roaming campus grounds.  When keg parties at fraternity houses or mass gatherings for football games in the fall were rewards for getting through the weeks classes.  Simple times, when being initiated to Greek organizations required surviving pledging: a lengthy period of time that included tedious, fun and even scary moments.  Thumbing through my copy of FROM HERE TO FRATERNITY served as a reminder of how a once-mighty beacon of collegiate camaraderie has fallen to nothing more than stereotypical tabloid fodder.FROM HERE TO FRATERNITY states that it is the first and only comprehensive guide to fraternizes and sororities and statement still rings true.  While I have searched for an updated volume or a similar book, there are none available.  Even though the book is dated, its contents are still relevant and provide a handy education on the Greek system, the individual organizations, their histories and habits.  The presentation of the material is interesting and inviting with plenty of charts, lists, pictures and drawings throughout.  You do not have to be a member of the Greek system to appreciate what it offers.  All national fraternities and sororities are represented (including historically black organizations).  Egan presents the book as celebration and a touch of humor runs throughout (silly college kids).While FROM HERE TO FRATERNITY has a 1980s date stamp, it is still the most authoritative and honest education of the American fraternity/sorority system available to date.  These days, the media embraces anything negative associated with these organizations (whether it be hazing, binge-drinking or accusations of date rape); I consider myself fortunate that my fraternity experience happened in a much happier, light-hearted time 4 years of college was nothing more than an extension of childhood.  I treasure this book now as much as I did 30 years ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REILRVYI11VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553341936#wasThisHelpful","R3REILRVYI11VQ","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pulled from historian Rick Atkinsons The Guns at Last Light (the third segment of his excellent World War II trilogy), BATTLE OF THE BULGE is designed to educate younger readers about Americas epic final battle in Western Europe.  While I feel the book does a fine job condensing the nuts and bolts of Hitlers Ardennes offensive, I felt the books presentation diminished its overall quality.As someone who was first introduced to World War II at the age of 11, I developed a passion for studying the conflict that has lasted to this day (over 35 years later).  To my surprise, my 8 year old daughter has cultivated a keen interest in the conflict and I have started to assemble a small World War II library for her.  A battle book aimed at young readers seemed to be a logical addition, but I soon realized it was a little too advanced for her budding knowledge.First and foremost, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE does an excellent job encapsulating the battle and addresses almost every facet.  It sufficiently breaks down the essence of the battle into a multitude of interesting topics (weapons, personal accounts, key individuals, data, etc.); the chapters are brief and chock full of photos  the book certainly doesnt bore.  While I found the text easy to read/understand, it may be a hard pill to swallow for those younger than 10 (the suggested age range is 8-12 years of age).  Even though my daughter has a decent foundation of basic World War II knowledge, this book proved to be a challenge for her.  While it is understood that the Battle of the Bulge is a significant American battle, I am disappointed that this battle and D-Day are the only young reader adaptations offered from Atkinsons comprehensive trilogy (which covers the entire spectrum of US participation in the European Theatre) and would have preferred books summarizing each book of the trilogy to provide younger minds with a better understanding of how the Battle of the Bulge (and D-Day for that matter) were significant parts of a more significant event.  I see this book as being just one piece of a large puzzle  the other pieces are needed to see the full picture.Something else that I found irritating were the random silhouettes of planes, tanks and infantry that adorned the start of each chapter.  Rather than silhouettes of objects related to the Battle of the Bulge (an American/German battle), the images of a Soviet tank destroyer (SU-52?), an early war Soviet plane (Rata), a seaplane (the Bulge was fought inland) and what appears to be a column of infantry sporting Brodie helmets (British?) are repeatedly presented throughout the entire book.  Even worse, the section describing the weapons used in battle appears to use a silhouette of a modern day assault rifle and an image of a Soviet T-34 seems to be used as a description of a Sherman tank.  Maybe Im being picky, but there are certainly enough related photos/images readily available to match the topic being discussed and certainly no need for the use of unrelated/Eastern Front imagery.THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE provides an adequate synopsis of a major American battle in World War II, but its value is best served for young readers that are already familiar with the battles place in the war.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2HC2AW3Q5B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791132#wasThisHelpful","R1V2HC2AW3Q5B3","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I think of what kind of person it takes to pilot/co-pilot one of the most sophisticated military aircraft in the world, a 20 year old man certainly isnt what comes to mind.  But, 70+ years ago, 2nd Lt. Truman Smith was just that  too young to drink, inexperienced with women and life in general, but responsible for flying a 4-engine bomber deep into Germany at 27,000 ft. with 9 fellow crewmen much like himself.  THE WRONG STUFF clearly reveals how the war fought in the skies of Europe was never a glamorous affair and certainly no safer than the battles being fought by the ground-pounders below.Smith explains in his introduction that the books title, THE WRONG STUFF, is about Natures Law of Equal and Opposite  the good offsetting the bad and right offsetting the wrong.  While the book is one mans vivid account of his wartime experience in a B-17, its also a testament that the good of winning the war was offset by the cumulative effect of the bad  mishaps, mistakes and bad luck  the wrong stuff.  Rather than simply telling his story, Smith chooses to actually take readers back with him to experience what he went through first-hand  the movie vividly plays out while your read!The book is presented in a unique manner.  The chapters seem to be misleading and/or mistitled, the text is choppy and Smith frequently emphasizes using ALL CAPS, but it oddly works  very well.  It only took me a few pages to get acclimated with his writing style and simply become immersed in the unfolding story.THE WRONG STUFF presents that sought after you-are-there/fly-on-the-wall feeling that allows readers to have a better understanding of what these young men had to go through.  While I hesitate to classify Smiths wartime duty as anything but serious and deadly, it is hard not to read his book and sense the whole affair as a grand adventure full of fear, frustration, misery and even humor (which was more a coping mechanism to offset the general sentiment that the odds favored a fiery death, severe injury or even captivity over surviving the mandatory 35 missions).  Smith documents each of the 35 missions he achieved and while some were more exciting to read about than others, they all presented challenges of one sort or another.  I found the interaction among Smith and his crewmates to be the most enjoyable aspect of the book as they all shared the burden together and developed a bond that centered on trust.  This bond also generated a great deal of humor, even in the heat of battle.  From the superstitious habit of kissing props and peeing on tent pegs before missions to the dilemma of suffering the runs and needing to relieve oneself at 27,000 ft. with German fighters attacking, Smith offers details of things Id never previously considered.  Its hard to imagine the author being only 20-years old considering his responsibilities, but when he reveals his inexperience with alcohol and women youre reminded hes still just a kid.  I find it equally amazing how vivid Smiths memory was in recounting his wartime service.THE WRONG STUFF is a terrific and unique account of the air war in Europe.  There are numerous books that detail events, but few that actually bring events to life like this book manages to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4H2V593KBUSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806134224#wasThisHelpful","R4H2V593KBUSG","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a former powerlifter whose beloved gym is slowly transforming into a softer, more family-oriented facility; I see the gyms big money being steered toward cardio-related equipment, yoga, spinning, etc. while the free-weights section gets ignored.  Gone are the heavy-duty locking collars that we powerlifters and Olympic lifters needed to safely move heavy weights.  Instead, we get the cheap, metal spring clips that seemed to be purchased from a discount stores impulse-buy bin near the check-out line.  If youve ever experienced a side of weights sliding off a bar during a heavy squat workout because a cheap collar isnt doing its job, youre better off buying your own collars.  Im glad I opted for the LOCKJAW OLYMPIC BARBELL COLLAR.WHAT IT IS:- The LOCKJAW look and feel solidly built.  Each collar (you get 2) is made of hard nylon with molded rubber grips in the middle to grab the bar.  A simple lever serves to open the collar enough to slide onto the bar and clamp it down.  The collar fits snuggly on the standard Olympic barbells (50mm).HOW IT PERFORMS:- I generally only use Texas Power Bars for heavy lifting (squats, bench and deadlifts); but I have tested to the collars on York, Rogue and other generic bars in the gym.  The LOCKJAW provides the same snug grip on all bars I tested.- Tough.  I found the biggest test of these collars to be heavy deadlifts as the weights hit the floor rather hard.  Our gym has accumulated numerous sets of plates over the years and while the weights are accurate, they dont all line up evenly on the bar and tend to bang apart after each successive rep.  Spring clips are not sufficient in holding the plates together.  Uneven plates tend to jar spring clips loose, causing the plates to slide along the bar and make a lot of noise.  On one occasion, a spring clip freakishly flew off the bar.  The LOCKJAW works as well as the old spin collars, but they are lightweight and can be kept in my gym bag.  The collars stay secure through entire deadlift workouts and keep the plates tight and in place the whole time.- Easy on, easy off.  The thick wide lever is easy to hold and operate  good for both large and small hands.- The red LOCKJAWs look cool as well.Such gym gadgetry may seem superfluous, but I tend to enjoy the comfort and safety of using my own gear.  I find the LOCKJAW OLYMPIC BARBELL COLLAR a worthy purchase as they are easy to use, perform flawlessly and are quite durable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2K83P8IK8KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B2ZA22#wasThisHelpful","R1U2K83P8IK8KI","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A prime factor in having a blood pressure monitor available for home use is that you are apt to get more reliable/accurate readings in a relaxed environment.  The cold, clinical atmosphere of my doctor's office, combined with the anxiety of being examined for potential maladies has often led to me needing multiple readings due to odd results (which the nurse always attributes to ""office visit nervousness"").  The OMRON 7 SERIES BP MONITOR is a simple, high-quality tool that provides users a way of getting pertinent health information in the comfort of their own home.  Eliminating the cold nurse fingers, icy stethoscopes, rigid chairs, blinding fluorescent lighting and lab coated doctors scribbling who-knows-what in a file with your name on it significantly reduces one major contributor of negative BP results:  anxiety.WHAT IT IS:The OMRON 7 SERIES BP MONITOR is a rather simple device that consists of 2 major parts:  a monitor and an upper arm cuff that plugs into the monitor via rubber tube.  The device operates on 4 AA batteries (included) or AC adaptor (not included).  The arm cuff is secured by Velcro to ensure a snug fit and is suitable for larger arms.  A stop-start push button provides a one-step, no-nonsense process of monitoring blood pressure ... the user simply seats him/herself as instructed, wraps the cuff on the upper arm, pushes a button and waits a minute for the machine to test BP and show results.  The monitor offers numerical diastolic, systolic and heart-rate readings as well as light next to each vital that easily identify any exceeding the ""healthy standard"" (green light = normal range, orange = hypertension range).  The OMRON 7 SERIES is designed to separate/manage readings for 2 individuals and has Bluetooth capability for the purpose of viewing results on specified devices.PLUSES:- Commenting on the ""accuracy"" of such a device is traversing a slippery slope.  MY experience with the OMRON 7 SERIES BP MONITOR yielded lower numbers, but still in-line with my historical record of BP readings ... I contribute the lowered vitals solely to the elimination of ""doctor office anxiety"".- Ease of use:  Set up, function and readings are extremely user friendly.  The monitor unit has an angled face, grey background and large digital numbers that are easy to see.  I like the green and red light functions that offer an at-a-glance indication of ""standard health"" BP readings.  The monitor sits firmly on any hard, flat surface.  Can be set-up and used individually, with no assistance from others.- Up to 2 individuals can manage their BP in the OMRON 7; the unit will store 120 readings (up to 60 per user).  The monitor can even average readings (3 within a 10 minute period) for better accuracy.- The arm cuff accepts larger arms ... a big plus for me.  My lifestyle (powerlifter) has created problems with BP cuffs in the past.  While it states the cuff can handle arms up to 17 inches, this cuff fits snuggly on my arms (18+ inches) and yielded no deviation in my historical BP readings over the years.THE ONLY NEGATIVE I COULD FIND:- I cannot test the Bluetooth function.  No app for iPad 2 and no luck finding the android app to side-load to my Blackberry Z10.  After hijacking my daughter's Dell Venue tablet, I was able to retrieve the app but could not set up an account (the ""submit"" button was greyed-out/not functioning) ... frustrating.  While having ready access to BP history is not really a necessity for me, it might very well be for those who need such information available on a portable device (to share with their doctor).  The manufacturer states it is working on expanding Bluetooth capability to include additional devices, but nothing works for me at this point.Other than the Bluetooth limitations I experienced, I believe the OMRON 7 SERIES BP MONITOR to be a well-made, useful and reliable addition to our home's ""medical shelf"".  Blood pressure issues are related to a host of serious health problems and having the ability to conveniently monitor it any time and at home is a pro-active step in monitoring my family's health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32A47M95SI9EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQB2L0#wasThisHelpful","R32A47M95SI9EK","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, I would have considered owning a laminator as more of a luxury than a necessity, but having two children totally changed things.  Nowadays, there is desire to preserve/protect/document almost everything they generate, not just pictures.  The FELLOWS LAMINATING POUCHES are PERFECT in getting that job done.WHAT IT IS:Each pouch is 9 x 11.5 and consists of 2 sheets adjoined at one end (the term pouch is somewhat misleading) and are suitable for any laminator that can accept letter-sized documents.  The design allows you to open the pouch like a book, place your document(s) on one sheet, fold the other sheet over and slide the pouch into the laminator.  The laminate coating on the inside of the sheets effectively keeps the document(s) from sliding around the pouch (like some photo albums).  Directional arrows are embossed on the pouches to ensure proper loading into the laminator (they disappear when processed through the laminator).  The pouches are UV protected, so they are great in keeping docs/pictures from fading.  They are to be used for THERMAL laminating.3 mil POUCHES:- I found these pouches providing the perfect thickness for most laminating needs (pictures and papers).  The laminating sheets are suitable for preserving the textured artwork my kids would create (papers with glued-on glitter, sand, yarn, etc.)  the documents are preserved/protected, but the textured element still remains (not a stiff sheet of plastic).  These pouches seal nicely and (when loaded in the proper direction) do not create any air bubbles.  The laminated items are clear and yield a slight gloss.  Trimming the sheets after laminating is easy.5 mil POUCHES:- I found this thickness to be more suitable for laminating items that may be subject to heavy use or heartier protection as it results in the laminated document having the stiffness slightly less than a credit card.  Laminated items are crystal clear with a higher gloss.  Because of the thickness, these sheets are a little more difficult to trim.I am impressed with the easy-to-use design of the FELLOWS LAMINATING POUCHES and more importantly, the results.  These are high-quality laminating sheets that protect but do so without reducing clarity (very important to me).  The last thing you want to do is laminate a precious picture or document and end-up with them being cloudy.  While I believe 3 mil is the best thickness for general use, I really like the heavy duty protection provided by the 5 mil sheets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRB72J665WMYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAPL1Q#wasThisHelpful","RRB72J665WMYY","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is mind-boggling that almost 70 years after World War II, accounts of previously unknown or lesser-known (but significant) events are still emerging.  OPERATION CHOWHOUND details a unique Allied operation to feed 3.5 million starving Dutch in the final week of the war.  While the goal to feed so many people at once would seem interesting enough, the steps needed to pull of such a feat are what make the story so captivating.Stephen Dando-Collins sets the stage from the start:  After almost five years of occupation and the failed Allied attempt to liberate them (Operation Market Garden), some 3.5 million Dutch were facing starvation.  Despite the war drawing to a close, the Germans still had reinforced its grip on the Netherlands and appeared ready to defend it to the bitter end, this put the population at greater risk of dying every passing day  something had to be done to spare the unnecessary deaths of innocents.  The effort to save the Dutch required some high-level/high-stakes negotiations between the Allies and Germans, as well as the logistical challenge of safely and effectively delivering food (US Army K-rations) in enemy territory.  From beginning to end, the entire missions fragile nature seemed likely to fail, resulting in massive casualties for all sides involved (military and civilians).Dando-Collins presents this unique operation in a storytelling manner that makes for a quick and easy read.  He does a good job of illustrating stakes involved and more importantly the almost pipe-dream uncertainty that US heavy bombers could deliver humanitarian payloads in lieu of ordinance over enemy territory defended by some of Hitlers most loyal soldiers  the SS.  I found the effort of piecing-together the operational puzzle to be one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story  even more than the event itself.  The thought of high-ranking Allied and German officers/officials entering each others lairs to negotiate a cooperative effort to pull off an Allied operation that involved the use of hundreds of B-17 bombers (that were recently used to bomb German cities) is hard to fathom.  Dando-Collins puts you in the middle of these negotiations and you feel the tension, particularly the meeting that involved Eisenhowers cantankerous Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Bedell Smith.  Paralleling the planning effort, Dando-Collins injects stories of the (very) young men who would be carrying out the mission and the plight of those they were trying to save (including a young Audrey Hepburn).  The book joins everything together in a concise manner with short, but eventful chapters that chronicle pivotal moments from beginning to end without losing any of the storys momentum.  The sorties that carried out the mission reminded me of the Ploesti Oil Refinery operation in 1943  4-engine bombers flying at treetop level to deliver their payloads  the only exception being the bombers conducting Chowhound were not capable of defending themselves if the Germans reneged or were unaware of the negotiated truce (and there are moments where this does happen).  I particularly like the retrospective provided in the final chapters which brings to light the lasting impact of the entire operation.I found OPERATION CHOWHOUND to be a pleasure to read in that it highlights a rare instance of cooperation between enemy combatants to achieve a greater good.  It is a well-rounded read that tidily opens and closes a relatively unknown chapter of good amid mankinds most destructive event.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHD7IDX18M1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=113727963X#wasThisHelpful","RHHD7IDX18M1D","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember watching two co-workers participate in the Beanie Baby craze of the late 90s and was entertained as well as frustrated by the amount of money they continued to sink into their Beanie investments (one had the means to support her habit  the other did not).  Zac Bissonnettes THE GREAT BEANIE BABY BUBBLE provides a very detailed understanding of the Beanie Baby mania and more importantly the shrewd, somewhat ruthless, dark and creepy man behind it all  Ty Warner.Rather than simply chronicling the rise and fall of Beanie Babies, Bissonnette digs much deeper and presents all facets of the fad and most interestingly, a somewhat disturbing biography of Warner, the reclusive Beanie creator.  I found THE GREAT BEANIE BABY BUBBLE to be far more interesting (and educating) than I anticipated it would be; I attribute this to Bissonnettes ability to successfully merge Warners biography, economics, marketing and social aspects of the great Beanie Baby run in a colorful, informative, yet fun manner that keeps readers interested from beginning to end.The meat and potatoes of the book is dedicated to Warner and it paints a somewhat unflattering portrait of the man.  Considering the father of all things Beanie has avoided interviews for almost two decades, Bissonnette successfully worked around that roadblock and found more than enough people willing to divulge their experiences with Warner over the years  including two women romantically linked to him through the rise and fall of the Beanie craze.  I found Warners path to immense wealth (hes a billionaire) to be quite interesting  a masterful, shrewd salesman and marketing genius with added dashes of vanity, obsession (to minutiae) and control (of everything)  someone who liberally used people he found beneficial only to unceremoniously dump them when his use for them expired.  On one hand, Warners obsessive nature is arguably attributed to his financial success as his dissatisfaction with something as small as a single stich in a Beanie Baby would result in it being removed from the market and replaced by the improved version (resulting in the retired Beanie Baby gaining value and stoking the Beanie mania fire).  On the other hand, Bissonnette reveals Warner as an insecure, untrustworthy, self-absorbed loaner addicted to plastic surgery.  Regardless of Warners fortune and success, its hard not to view him as somewhat icky.The book reveals the business side of Beanies as a cautionary tale that is creepy in its own right.  Bissonnette provides an ongoing history of the plush (stuffed animal) industry that led to Beanie Babies and it is a case of innocence gone awry.  The simple concept of the Beanie Baby was to create a small, high-quality, bean-filled stuffed animal marketed for kids that was affordable  high quality at a bargain price.  What started as cute, quickly became cult as the retired Beanies became collectables  and the adults began showing up to ruin everything.  The book reveals the seediness of the Beanie craze as values of retired (rare) Beanies soared, sending collectors over the edge with a desire to find/buy the retired Beanies at all costs (whether it meant liquidating the kids college funds or even killing someone).  The whole story is as shocking as it is pathetic  how something as insignificant as a cheap stuffed animal for kids could generate such hysteria  only in America.  Bissonnette shares the stories of numerous people wrapped-up in the craze, from soccer-mom types hoarding Beanies to fund their futures to people jumping on the Beanie gravy-train by publishing self-made collectors guides sold to millions of like-minded Beanie nuts.  The whole Beanie saga (from the beginning of the craze to its sudden crash) is strange, sad and unsurprising to a degree (as these cute fads seem to flare-up like a case of the shingles every few years).  But, the money that was made during its multi-year run is staggering (Ty Inc. earned more from stuffed animals than mega-toymakers Hasbro and Mattel).THE GREAT BEANIE BABY BUBBLE certainly proved to be an enlightening, unique read.  Reading the book reminded me that we have several Beanie Babies laying around our home; dont know if they have (had) value and dont care  they were purchased for our kids (and Ill bet the TY tags are bent, if not partially chewed from one of our Labs  gasp!).  The book prompted me to check out the TY website (a gaudy ADHD-inducing visual carnival that Liberace may have designed from the grave) and after seeing the products (including a garish line of NASCAR Beanies), I still dont understand the big deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORWJNY6KDD3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846021#wasThisHelpful","R3ORWJNY6KDD3C","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe that one must approach dietary/workout supplement intake with caution as there are way too many powders and pills that promise a lot and actually do nothing.  With that being said, I dont find EAS HYDRATE providing any significant benefit to my workout other than sweetening my water with sugar.The nutritional content of a single serving (1 scoop added to 8 oz. of water) amounts to 25 calories:  270mg Sodium, 189mg Potassium, 6g carbohydrates (5g sugar) and 10mg Chloride.One thing to notice is the serving size of 1 scoop per 8 oz. of water.  If you are serious about hydration (even during a light workout), 8 oz. of water is like asking a bartender for a beer and getting it in a shot glass.  Most water bottles that people lug around hold at least 32 oz.  and many of the more serious lifters/athletes in my gym bring their water in 1-gallon milk-jug containers.  In other words, 4 scoops of HYDRATE are required for an average-sized 32 oz. water bottle which amounts to 20g of sugar.  While sugar may spike energy levels, its effect is very brief.  Basically, HYDRATE is orange-flavored sugar with a little sodium added for hydrating effect.If water flavoring is what is needed to drink more, I would stick with a simple liquid water enhancer like Mio or Dasani Drops as they have no significant nutritional value, have better flavor selection and are flavored with sucralose, not sugar.  If you want sugar in your water, Gatorade is probably the best bet.  Additionally, there are better hydration powders out there that contain BCAAs (Branch Chained Amino Acids), like Scivations XTend, that not only hydrate and taste good (without sugar), but actually contribute to protein synthesis  in other words, better taste/more flavor options, better nutrition (0 calories/0 sugar/added vitamins/minerals) and more overall function and benefits for those serious about lasting hydration through a rigorous workout.Other than improving the quality of the orange flavoring (and believe me, the taste of supplements have increased exponentially over the years), I do not feel there is any significant benefit to using EAS HYDRATE as part of my water intake during workouts.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XC28VXULQ5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9HQ5LM#wasThisHelpful","R26XC28VXULQ5Q","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two older Yellow Labs (9 and 10 years old) and weve grown accustomed feeding them premium dog food since the younger Lab experienced a bout of pancreatitis in 2013.  NATURAL BALANCE SYNERGY DRY DOG FOOD was in line with the other brands of high-end dog foods weve experimented with over the last few years.  It offers a combination quality (natural) ingredients that noticeably improve the texture of their coats, does make cleaning up the yard easier (solid), helps them maintain a heathy weight and is certainly appetizing to both.A partial list of ingredients emphasizes the natural aspects of the dog food:  Chicken, lamb and salmon meal, oatmeal, brown rice, beet pulp, barley, dried spinach/cranberries/parsley/carrot/egg, oatmeal, flaxseed and multiple vitamins.  The salmon meal and flaxseed provide good fatty acids necessary to maintain a healthy coat (our dogs are notorious shedders and we do notice the difference in the plushness of their fur as well as a reduction in shedding).  The food is presented as kibble (small, flat pellets not balls) which make it suitable for dogs of all ages and sizes.  I like the fact that NATURAL BALANCE SYNERGY is actually designed for dogs of all ages (puppies to seniors)  a one-for-all approach is nice considering the wide array of foods that cater to ages, sizes and sensitive diets.  Switching to this food on the fly had no negative impact on either of my dogs.The aroma of the NATURAL BALANCE SYNERGY is certainly not as appealing to the human nose as other premium brands and I attribute it to the mix of dried vegetables.  Regardless, my dogs certainly had no problem inhaling this food as soon as it hit their bowls.  The main issue I have is that even though I see it as a quality product, it is rather pricey.  With all the premium dog food available these days, its hard not to factor cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XN88LBBOIM6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS1J5VM#wasThisHelpful","R2XN88LBBOIM6K","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having ""mastered"" the Rookie and Original versions of the Perplexus puzzle series, I thought I was ready for the challenge provided by the EPIC and ran into a brick wall as it's definitely frustrating ... in more ways than one.WHAT IT IS:- A clear plastic sphere with a plastic ""jungle gym"" of obstacles (125 of them) inside.  The goal is to navigate a single ball bearing through the obstacles without dropping it off course.  Larger than the Original and almost twice the size of the Rookie, the EPIC feels to be about the size of a volleyball.- While it isn't necessary to have practiced/mastered the Rookie and Original versions of the Perplexus, it certainly helps as the EPIC offers little relief in terms of easy obstacles.THE GOOD AND COULD BE BETTER:- How tough is it?  Odd as it may seem, the various levels of Perplexus puzzles is somewhat like the hot sauce levels of chicken wings at Buffalo Wild Wings ... EPIC = ""Blazin'"" In other words, you need to not only like hot sauce, but crave high levels of heat in your sauce to eat (let alone, enjoy) a plate of ""Blazin'"" chicken wings ... better to start off with the milder flavors first.  The EPIC has some interesting, fun and frustrating obstacles, including a see-saw, sliding track and one level that involves a free-fall into a funnel with a large snaking tube (getting to that cool level is a serious sticking point for me).  The more-complex obstacles in this puzzle require a gentler touch, more patience and higher sense of awareness.- As with the other Perplexus models, the various obstacle numbers (and direction arrows) are etched into the plastic.  Fortunately, the light blue, white and gray plastic make it easier to see the obstacle numbers (unlike the Rookie and the Original).  While etching the numbers and arrows in black or contrasting colors for better understanding the navigation path; I accept blind navigation as simply being an added element of difficulty.- The complexity and size of the obstacle course generates other potential issues.  One issue is the difficulty in locating the ball bearing when it enters the ""guts"" of the maze as other obstacles obscure the view.  The maze's design also includes a few delicate, moving parts that are subject to precision manufacturing in order to work right (fortunately, all parts of my EPIC are working as intended).  A possible design flaw (at least with my EPIC) is that the points where the maze attaches to the sphere create narrow alleys that trap the ball-bearing.  Freeing the trapped ball-bearing requires a not-so-gentle bump to the sphere which may damage the sphere or any delicate parts of the maze.- In addition to the starting point at obstacle #1, there are 3 additional starting points (named ""Practice"" A, B and C) that allow you to begin deeper into the maze.  The multiple starting points are helpful in letting you work on developing methods to master some of the more difficult obstacles without having to start from the very beginning.  As others have pointed out, using a magnet to drop the ball in a desired location is another practice method (but not as easy to do as it sounds).As someone who enjoys these puzzles, the EPIC provides the challenge I'm seeking.  It certainly brings more to the table than the Rookie and the Original, maybe too much for some.  For a better understanding, check out the (few) YouTube videos that show how some have mastered the puzzle (level 1 to 125).  I honestly don't know if I'll ever master the puzzle, but part of the fun is obsessively trying ... over and over and over again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7X5SEJDLA4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1V5RU#wasThisHelpful","R3H7X5SEJDLA4P","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, the ubiquitous politicizing of the 2012 attack on the US Ambassadors compound in Benghazi has somewhat clouded what actually transpired that September 11.  With 13 HOURS, Mitchell Zuckoff and the members of the Annex Security Team provide a much clearer picture (and understanding) of what happened on the ground that fateful night.  Instead of sifting through a diatribe of finger-pointing, Presidential-election politics and blame, I found myself fully immersed in reading a modern adaptation of David vs Goliath.Several years ago, I was similarly absorbed in another Mitchell Zuckoff book:  Lost in Shangri-La (an astonishingly unique and amazing account of events that followed an obscure story of a transport plane that crashed in an unexplored area of New Guinea during World War II).  The author certainly knows how to present a story in a way that doesnt settle on hovering over events, but puts readers smack-dab in the middle of the action so they can see and feel the story first-hand.  That same gripping format really brings 13 HOURS to life  you are there, with the Annex Security Team, watching this small group of immensely skilled, deadly and fearless warriors working as one against an larger, unseen enemy that possesses superior firepower and a home-field advantage.Zuckoff preps readers in the initial chapters by providing background on the individuals involved in the Benghazi attack (key State Dept. personnel, the ambassador and the security team members) and the tense, but seemingly manageable American presence in volatile Libya (largely in part to Ambassador Stevens work).  From that point forward, the book is a detailed chronology of events occurring before and during the September 11 attack:  the initial assault on the Ambassadors compound, the attempt to rescue those at the compound, the evacuation to the Security Team Annex and subsequent defense of the Annex).  The attention to detail is meticulous and effective; it provides readers a fly-on-the-wall perspective of elite operators in action.  While reading 13 HOURS, I often found myself thinking of Easy Company, the American paratroopers immortalized in Stephen Ambroses Band of Brothers  a group of specially trained, brave men who volunteered to be put in the middle of extremely dangerous scenarios; scenarios that served to solidify both their effectiveness and cohesiveness.  The Annex Security Team exhibited those same brotherly qualities in Benghazi and the entire book illustrates just how tight the bonds between these special operators truly is.  With the surviving members of the Team co-authoring the book with Zuckoff, there is an added degree of authenticity that is thankfully devoid of any politically-slanted journalism  the story is told very matter-of-factly.While I have read numerous accounts of combat, most are broad in nature and cover multiple engagements.  The majority of 13 HOURS is dedicated to a single, but multi-faceted defensive battle.  The action described in the book illustrates how fearless, skilled and intuitive the members of the Security Team truly are.  We are given an opportunity of watching these men thrive in their natural element (a deadly, uncertain environment) and showcase their innate ability to react aggressively, no matter how uncertain the outcome appears to be.  The end-result of the Benghazi attack may be well-known, but the nut-and-bolts of what really happened that night have been sadly ignored until now.  That any of these men survived, let alone saved so many others (another untold aspect of the incident), isnt a matter of luck as much as it is a testament to their training, confidence and willingness to take the fight to the enemy.  Outmatched in numbers and firepower, these guys knew EXACTLY what to do with the limited resources they had in order to project themselves as a much larger force  all without the desperate need of air support.  That any survived to tell their story is hard to believe.For those wanting more than a news report of what happened at Benghazi  this is your book.  Its hard not to read 13 HOURS and feel fortunate that these warriors actually volunteer for such bleak assignments  doing so is second nature for them and a big plus for the rest of us.  A thoroughly gripping read from beginning to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78FNIQQT1IWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455582271#wasThisHelpful","R78FNIQQT1IWU","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Perplexus Rookie is a big hit in our house and once my 8 year old daughter mastered it, I was eager to get her the next puzzle on the difficulty ladder:  the ORIGINAL PERPLEXUS.  The ""Original"" proved to be the perfect challenge for her (and me as well).WHAT IT IS:- This is the one that started the Perplexus series.  A clear plastic sphere with a plastic ""jungle gym"" of 100 obstacles.  The goal is to guide a ball bearing through the maze of obstacles by tilting, tapping, turning and even shoving the sphere without knocking the ball bearing off course.WHAT SEPARATES IT FROM THE ROOKIE PERPLEXUS:- First of all, this obstacle course is less forgiving than the Rookie ... not only are there more obstacles (some 20 more), many of them leave little room for error.  Everything is stepped-up a notch:  retaining walls are shallow (so controlling the speed of the ball bearing is critical) and the obstacles are really cool.- The obstacles are definitely more challenging and require not only a more delicate handling and balancing of the sphere, but even new ""moves"" are needed to guide the ball ... one particular obstacle (I believe it's #30) actually required a quick shove or shirk to move the ball quickly across a short distance.  Additionally, the suspended ""track"" obstacles that were so fun in the Rookie are back, but they are tighter, with sharper turns and narrower tracks.- There are 3 starting points located in the same area:  one that put you at obstacle #1 and two more that puts you at obstacles further into the maze.  This allows you to practice some of the more difficult obstacles without having to start from the very beginning if you drop the ball (the ""Rookie"" only has one starting point).- Two obstacles that actually move:  a swinging arm and a bucket that flips.MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WITH ALL PERPLEXUS PUZZLES:- Like the Rookie, the maze obstacle numbers and direction arrows are simply engraved into the colored plastic and can be difficult to see at times (especially considering the glare that a light source can generate on the sphere).  I really wish the company would color the engraved numbers and arrows in black or some other contrasting color.- Another annoying issue is that a rather large Perplesus logo is impessed into the sphere ... twice.  Neither my Rookie nor Epic have this issue.  I find it rather annoying that the designer/manufacturer would/could do something as ridiculous as impede the critical element of clearly seeing the ball bearing with such a marketing ploy ... totally unnecessary and wrong.The smaller, more forgiving Rookie certainly served as good prep for this Perplexus (especially for kids), but it is not really a necessary step.  Figuring out what to do with the ORIGINAL PERPLEXUS isn't the problem, the real challenge is being consistent, patient and controlling the ball bearing's speed.  It is much easier for the ball to fall and that kicks the frustration factor into full gear ... the good thing is that the multiple starting points keeps you from starting all over again if one of the later obstacles becomes particularly troublesome.  This Perplexus is a lot of fun and after a few days, I stepped up and purchased the PERPLEXUS EPIC ... that one's a real monster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUYXTDMMAJNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNNPNQI#wasThisHelpful","R3PUYXTDMMAJNC","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first noticed kinesiology tape being used in the 2012 Summer Olympics (on volleyball player Kerri Walshs shoulder) and it took me a while to realize it was tape and not a weird tattoo.  During the course of those same Olympics, I saw the tape being used by athletes from numerous nations and in varying forms  it certainly intrigued me.  Experiencing an unpleasant case of Achilles tendonitis provided me enough incentive to test the effectiveness of KT Tape and I was quite pleased with the outcome  but it certainly wasnt easy to apply.WHAT IT IS:- KT Tape is a specially designed tape that can be stretched to provide a pulling effect between the ends when applied.  The tape is meant to be used for a variety of therapeutic and support purposes on numerous areas of the body.  The KT TAPE PRO serves as an improvement over the original tape in that it is synthetic (not cotton), washable and is intended to adhere to the skin for a longer period (up to 7 days).  The tape can come in either an uncut roll or pre-cut  there are a variety of color options as well.- Critical to the potential effectiveness of the tape is proper application.  While the tape does come with a sheet of graphic application instructions, it only addresses the more common injuries (mainly joint and tendon issues).  These instructions only cover the tip of the iceberg considering the numerous possible uses of the tape.  I found the website particularly useful in that it offers quite effective/informative videos on how to apply the tape, as well as covering more body areas.My KT TAPE PRO experience is based on using the uncut roll version (black).HOW IT PERFORMED FOR ME:- I found the KT TAPE PRO being surprisingly effective in alleviating my Achilles tendon pain  most notably the aggravation I was experiencing when first getting out of bed.  Immediately after applying the tape in the instructed manner, I felt a noticeable increase of support in the affected area and a significant reduction in pain.  The main issue with the effectiveness of the tape was that after 3 days, the segment of tape running down the bottom of my foot started to peel back and its super-sticky nature caused it to adhere to the floor and pull off when walking barefoot.  This was the only portion of the tape that gave me issues (the rest of the tape was solidly in place) and I blamed part of it on the rather difficult location (sole of the foot) and it being my first attempt to apply the tape.  A more-educated subsequent application proved to be much more effective.  Bottom line, the tape actually worked and worked well.- My biggest aggravation was with the application of the tape.  Most (if not all) the instructional videos on the website show pre-cut tape being used and it certainly seemed easier than cutting estimated lengths, especially considering all applications involve two or more independent strips of tape.  Prepping the tape was also cumbersome in that each application requires a specific degree of stretching the middle of each tape strip.  The tricky part is that prepping/stretching the tape first requires pulling off the paper covering the adhesive side  its advisable to have a second person on hand to help as you really want to avoid anything but the designated area of your body touching the sticky side.Overall, Im totally impressed with the tapes performance.  Yes, it will take practice (and possibly another person) to correctly apply the tape, but the KT TAPE PRO has yielded surprisingly effective results.  My Achilles tendonitis is fading and now Im concentrating on weightlifting injuries:  inner elbow tendonitis (golfers elbow) and shoulder pain (from heavy bench pressing).  I plan on having a roll of KT TAPE PRO on hand as I believe it delivers what it promises  only I will opt for the pre-cut roll instead (the uncut roll is probably better suited for athletic trainers).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXBTI2LTBAL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B8TTM8#wasThisHelpful","R2NXBTI2LTBAL0","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of mice on the market for just about every niche of gaming.  Being a casual online gamer, I prefer a mouse that can transition easily from gaming to general computer use  without the need of swapping between two.  The LOGITECH G302 DAEDALUS PRIME has the capability of being a go to mouse for gaming (specifically Multi Online Battle Arena gaming) and everyday computer use.PERKS:- The DAEDALUS PRIME is a wired mouse which generally contributes to the devices reliability (not only in terms of power, but uninterrupted communication between the mouse and the computer).  For many gamers, this is a plus.- The mouse can be thoroughly customized though a user-friendly downloaded Logitech program.  With 6 programmable buttons and lighting options (the color and mood of the lighting can be set for personal preference.- There are 4 DPI (mouse sensitivity) settings that can be set from 240 to 4000 DPI through a button behind the mouse wheel.  The user can opt to reduce the number of DPI options, if desired.  This is a pretty wide range with a high-end  4000 DPI is way too sensitive for me.- The DAEDALUS PRIME is lightweight and shaped in a manner that fits snuggly into the palm with slightly curved left/right buttons that enable your index and middle fingers to relax comfortably without impeding reaction time.  The buttons click easily and the middle-wheel is rubberized for smooth scrolling.  I found this mouse to be extremely comfortable, reliable and a pleasure to use for non-gaming purposes.POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS:- As a casual non-MOBA gamer, I found the mouse to be too lightweight for me.  My large, heavy hands require a heavier mouse for gaming.  Its a personal preference.- The umbilical cord.  I have grown quite comfortable with the freedom of movement that wireless mice provide and going back to using a wired-mouse is something I cannot seem to get used to.Overall, this is simply a good quality mouse that is aesthetically appealing (with lighting options), quite comfortable and easily customizable.  While it may be designated as a gaming mouse, I find it well-suited for general computer work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VETYH7F9YUDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHJY7C2#wasThisHelpful","R3VETYH7F9YUDM","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Networking isnt my forte and TP-LINK has always delivered in providing good quality networking devices that make it easy for network noobs like me to set-up and use effectively.  The ARCHER C5 is a solid router that delivers a nice, strong signal that makes every nook and cranny of my home network accessible.WHAT IT IS:- Dual-band wireless router (2.4GHz and/or 5GHz) with 6 total antennas (3 outside the router and 3 inside), 1 gigabit WAN port, 4 gigabit LAN ports and 2 USB ports (2.0).WHY IT ROCKS:- First and foremost, setting up the ARCHER C5 was a cinch and I cannot stress the importance of this.  Connecting the router takes 4 simple steps and configuring the device (wired or wireless) takes only 5 steps from start to finish.  A CD is provided, but I found it completely unnecessary.  The entire startup process only takes a few minutes (and that included removing my old router from the system).- Once the router is up and functioning, you can configure your router through a user-friendly direct website that will guide you through a customization process (if desired).  What I really appreciated was that the customization processes were organized into tabs (such as setting up guest network access) and all the options within the tabs were thoroughly explained on the right side of the screen.  This thorough presentation allows users to make INFORMED decisions and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by confusion.- The router itself projects a STRONG signal (2.4GHz, 5GHz or alternating between the two).  The signal is strong enough to provide complete network access for every room in my home.  I have found the 2.4GHz band as being stronger and more reliable than the 5GHz  this may be an issue for some, but it more than meets my household demands.- Provides secure network via 64/128-bit WEP, WPA / WPA2, WPA-PSK/ WPA2-PSK encryption.- There are a myriad of options/customizations including parental controls, guest network access, the ability to schedule access times, etc.- The router is silent and stays cool.I find the TP-LINK ARCHER C5 to be a solid router that should address most basic networking needs, plus the bells and whistles for those demanding more functionality from their network.  The biggest plus, in my opinion, is the user-friendly setup that gets things up and running quickly and easily, regardless of ones networking expertise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQCV0C1AT6VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFG6QS#wasThisHelpful","ROQCV0C1AT6VD","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in house where the computer hardware is on a different floor than most of the gadgets using WiFi can occasionally be a problem, especially when multiple connections are going on simultaneously.  The TP-LINK AC750 RANGE EXTENDER proved to a simple, but most effective tool in our house.WHAT IT IS:- A device that simply plugs into a wall outlet to extend the range of your routers WiFI coverage.POSITIVES:- First of all, the set up for this device is a cinch  a big plus for those (like me) who understand computer-related issues, but feel a little less comfortable dealing with networks.- It can be plugged into any wall outlet, so you can position it to reach more remote areas of your home (in my case, a separate floor).  This range extender allows full coverage in every room of our home.  With smartphones, game consoles, tablets, internet connected TVs and DVD players all connected via WiFi, I have yet to experience any connectivity issues or drops since implementing this range extender.- There is a port on the underside of the range extender that allows internet access to non-WiFi devices (Ethernet bridge)  this is a big plus, in my opinion.Not being a network person, I was particularly pleased with the quick setup and ease-of-use this device offers.  I especially liked its ability to be moved from room to room in order to maximize its effectiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C68IF47H61R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR2VMNC#wasThisHelpful","R2C68IF47H61R9","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SMART WEIGH DIGITAL PRO POCKET SCALE has proven to be an extremely handy device in my house because of its many uses, size, accuracy and toughness.WHAT IT IS:- A flat digital scale that is not much bigger than many of the smartphones on market (3.94 x 3.7 inches).- Easy-to-read bright blue digital display, the scale can provide reading is 6 different weight measures:  Grams (G), ounces (OZ), pennyweight (DWT), carats (CT), grains (GN) and troy ounces (OZT).  This versatility allows the scale to be used for measuring food portions, jewelry and even mail (for postage purposes).  It can weigh items up to 500 grams.- Runs on two AAA batteries (provided).  Scale will automatically shut off after two minutes of inactivity (preserves battery life)HOW IT FARED:- For almost a year, Ive been measuring my protein portions for meals using a myriad of plastic kitchen scales that were cheaply made but not cheaply priced.  The DIGITAL PRO POCKET SCALE immediately revealed the significant inaccuracy of the other scales.  Ive actually been shortchanging my protein intake for months!- This scale has the ability to provide EXACT measurements.  Even better, I can toss a container on the scale, calibrate the scale to include the container at the push of a button and measure the weight of the contents being added to the container (tare function).  This is a big plus as most of the simple scales Ive used involve guessing or manual adjustments to calibrate.- Portability  this is a big plus.  The SMART WEIGHT DIGITAL PRO is quite inconspicuous and can be packed in a suitcase, briefcase, backpack or purse  a shirt or pants pocket might be stretching it a bit.  This is something I will bring when traveling without a doubt.- Durability  the scale is made of stainless steel, not plastic and its heavy and flat enough to sit on a countertop or table without sliding around or tipping over.  There no loose or movable parts to worry about.  For added protection, there are two separate plastic covers (one covers the entire bottom of scale and the other covers the weighing platform).- The digital display is bright with enough contrast to see in a variety of lighting environments.While my use for the scale will primarily be associated with weighing food, I like the fact that I can drop a stuffed or oversized letter on the scale to calculate postage (rather than wasting stamps guessing that additional postage might be needed).  The versatility and accuracy of the SMART WEIGH DIGITAL PRO POCKET SCALE make this scale a worthy device to have in the home  collectors of fine jewelry, reloading, measuring medicines accurately  this is a well-made and useful device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD494GWRC0MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME8VI34#wasThisHelpful","R2SD494GWRC0MS","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After turning my back to the heavily marketed disposable razors, aerosol creams and other shaving junk, I was actively seeking alternatives to meet my needs.  The standard aerosol gels generate a lot of foam/lather for one razor pass, but always left my face dry and the cans simply never stop oozing foam after the first use.  I tried CREAMO CREAM after hearing a radio add and decided to give it a try.  First impression was:  strange scent, but super slick.A small dab of CREAMO with a sink or cup full of warm water is really all that is needed to provide a well-lubricated lather to accommodate multiple razor passes.  I found the key to this products success being the addition of a little water to each application of the cream.  Adding water to the cream is what generates the silky, slippery quality that allows your razor to glide effortlessly across your skin with having to apply pressure to your razor.  The only drawback to using this product was that it does create buildup on your razor that doesnt rinse away so easily and this can reduce the blades effectiveness over time.  The scent is rather unique and the only tangible aroma I can tie it to would be a hint of orange.I use a brush to apply shaving soap and find CREMO to work just fine:  simply wet the brush, apply the dab of CREAMO CREAM to the brush and use your face as the mixing platform (dabbing your brush lightly in warm water every so often to generate more lather)  or you could use a mixing bowl (which I consider more of traditional tool than a necessity)  or use the palm of your hand as the mixing bowl (I used this method until I discovered the simple convenience of using my face to generate the lather).  The key is getting the water/cream ratio right  too little water = dry/uncomfortable shave  to much water = messy/uncomfortable shave.  Lightly dipping the edge of my brush into a sink of warm water allows me to add water in small increments to generate the lather I want.While I find CREAMO CREAM to be a quality product, its not as widely marketed as other shave gels/creams and I can only buy it at one particular drug store in town.  The cost for a single tube seems high until you realize how many shaves a single tube will provide (with a pea-sized dollop for each shave)  its definitely worth it.  The biggest drawback for me was the buildup on my razor, so I use CREMO as a back-up or add it to my shave soap when trying to shave several days of hair growth  its the only product Ive ever used that minimizes the uncomfortable tugging associated with shaving longer facial hair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR700QPSPJTX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WQH8SA#wasThisHelpful","RR700QPSPJTX8","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont know how I initially stumbled up on the series of Perplexus puzzles, but I found them somewhat fascinating the minute I saw them.  Two years ago, I purchased the PERPLEXUS ROOKIE for my 6 year old daughter and until a few months ago, it was nothing more than a shelf ornament in her room.  The last few months, however, she finally discovered the challenging fun it presents and navigating the puzzle has become an almost daily ritual.WHAT IT IS:- The PERPLEXUS ROOKIE is a unique puzzle maze that requires a person to navigate a ball bearing from a starting point and through series of 70 progressively more difficult obstacles to reach an end point (each obstacle has a number and a directional arrow to keep you on course).  The entire puzzle is enclosed in a clear plastic sphere that allows one to see the ball bearing and determine the approach necessary to negotiate each obstacle.  Completing the puzzle requires a combination of patience, logic and focus, along with the ability to gently twist, tilt, flip and tap.  One misstep and the ball bearing drops off course, requiring the player to start over from the beginning.- The PERPLEXUS ROOKIE is the introductory puzzle to the Perplexus series of similar, more challenging puzzles.IS IT FUN?- Absolutely!  First of all, I found the unique nature of the puzzle quite appealing.  The jungle of interconnected obstacles crammed into the sphere is somewhat intimidating at first sight.  But, once I started playing it, the fun and frustration took over.  The key to working these puzzles is to address the approach needed for each obstacle just before the ball bearing reaches it.  Failing to do so will most always lead to the ball dropping off the obstacle.  Mastering the PERPLEXUS ROOKIE doesnt merely mean completing it, but the ability to successfully navigate the obstacles without having to think your way through it.SERIOUSLY?  SUITABLE FOR A 5 YEAR OLD?- The games says its for ages 5 up, but that may be a stretch.  The PERPLEXUS ROOKIE might be the easiest Perplexus, but it will present a challenge to most adults.  A soft/gentle touch is needed to work the puzzle, not just logic.  The ability to hold the puzzle and visually guide the ball bearing throughout the intricate maze of obstacles might be too much for such small hands (and I havent met a 5 year old yet that does anything gently).My daughter revisiting this puzzle has been fun for the whole family and the Original Perplexus is on the Christmas list this year (with the Epic and Twist looming as future gifts).  The only issue I have is with numbering on the obstacles, they are etched into the colored plastic and are difficult to see when light creates a glare on the sphere  clearly seeing the ball bearing and the course it is on is critical.  Simply coloring the etched numbers in black or a contrasting color would certainly alleviate this problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CL3A4CDK4XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNNPOI0#wasThisHelpful","R4CL3A4CDK4XO","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buzz Bissingers seminal Friday Night Lights is one of the better sports books Ive ever read.  The immersive nature of the book made it too difficult to simply read-and-forget  it had me begging for a follow-up.  AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS may have filled a void to some degree, but it left me feeling somewhat shortchanged.After reading this brief (albeit informative) follow-up, I quickly realized the purpose of the book was less about satisfying fans of the FNL book and more about the authors ongoing struggle with the success of his best-seller at the unfortunate expense of its star, Boobie Miles.AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS focuses on Miles miserable plight following an injury that ended his starry-eyed dream of playing professional football.  It is easy to sense the gnawing guilt Bissinger has experienced since writing his successful book (which spawned a decent movie and an arguably better television series).  Glaringly contrasting Bissingers success over the years is the chaotic and somewhat wretched life of Miles; a life that includes fathering numerous children with different women, unstable employment, legal issues and mounting debt.  While AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS details Miles woes it also illustrates the almost fatherly bond Bissinger has formed with him over the last 20+ years.  The sincerity of the relationship (from both sides) is difficult at times (considering Miles primary contact with Bissinger usually centers on a need for money), but it is definitely sincere and deeper than one would expect.  The guilt Bissinger expresses doesnt always pertain to material things as we learn one particular passage in FNL proved to be as emotionally devastating to Miles as his physical injury.  Ironically, as depressing as the story may sound, its somewhat uplifting as we see Boobie as being more resilient and happy, despite his life of suffering.While AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS allows readers to catch up on the divergent lives of the author and his prime subject, those hoping for a more thorough then-and-now perspective on the coaches, players, parents, Permian High School and Odessa itself will be disappointed.  Bissinger knows how to tell a captivating story and he actually does so with AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS  I simply wanted more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IO7A49992Y02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI9GPCE#wasThisHelpful","R3IO7A49992Y02","A2IMGHMF0LO151","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IMGHMF0LO151?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OXO makes great, common-sense kitchen products that have always proven to be useful, easy-to-use and durable.

Use the included cord or if you have a hub center set up with cords already, use one of yours.  Either works.It is approximately 2 in diameter by .5 high.  The instructions are simple and short.

"I love aromatherapy and have even convinced hubby that it is good for him as well.This diffuser is approximately 6 high and 3.5 in diameter.  It comes with the unit itself which has a twist off top so you can add water to the tank, a measuring cup and the AC plug.  It is made of a white plastic-like material.The tank has a max measurement line.  Be sure to not overfill it.  Once you add water, you can add essential oils.  I find one drop of oil gives a scent that is not overpowering but yet I can notice there is scent.  Then just replace the top with a twist to line up the lock buttons that are on the inside of the top.The light button has seven different settings and you can choose the changing mode, just one particular color or you dont even have to have a color setting for the diffuser to work.  The mist setting is either steady or intermittent.  Make sure you wait a few minutes after you plug it in for the mist to start.I like the part where the diffuser will shut off automatically when it has used all the water.  In other words, I can plug it in before I go to bed and can drift off without worry of burning out the diffuser.  It is quiet and is cool to the touch so no worries about burning yourself.Whether you use this in the bath, bedroom or any other room in your house, you will have the pleasant scent you want in the rooms you choose.  I will use them in our guest and master bedrooms.  If a diffuser is on your purchase list, this would be a good buy.""I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2WU8CZ9M8MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153SKAA8#wasThisHelpful","R3O2WU8CZ9M8MQ","AJV985MKGCIQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJV985MKGCIQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I put on lounge wear, I like having a bra on as well.  I want to have one that I dont wear as a normality and this padded sports bra fits that requirement.It has a racerback design, is soft and stretches and the padding is permanent.  Many of these types of bras allow the pads to be removed.  All that means to me is I have to fish the pads out of my clean laundry and put them back in the bra.There are no wires or hooks to dig into your skin.  You can wear this is complete comfort.  There are no tags or even permanent writing on this bra.  Nothing to irritate your skin at all.

"The very first thing I noticed was when I went to pair this speaker to my phone/tablet.  I didnt have to find the flashing red/blue lights!  That was great as I usually have my finger over where the light flashes.  Simply turn the speaker on, it tells you power is on, then open your Bluetooth connection on your phone or tablet and it finds the speaker all by itself.  Also, if you dont complete the pairing and just leave the speaker on, after a minute or so, it will tell you that you are still trying to pair.The next thing I noticed was the suction cup.  It actually works!  Real suction so I dont have to worry that the speaker will fall off of whatever surface I choose to put it on.  Removal is easy as well.  Just slip your finger under an edge and it comes right off.The buttons are large so you dont have to worry if you are using the right ones.  The buttons are 1-previous, 2-next, 3-on/off and 4-music play pause, phone and reply.  The instructions have a graphics so you can be sure you are using the right buttons.  It is rated for playback time of 4-6 hours and charging time of 3 hours.  It is approximately 3 in diameter and 2 high.It comes with a charging cord.

"This is a Bluetooth ear bud type headset that is foldable.  That makes it a great set to have.Just pair this headset like any other Bluetooth device.  Now you are all set to listen to your music or audiobooks or even answer a phone call.  The instructions are well written and have everything you need to get this headset up and running.  It even has a graphic that shows you where everything is on the headset.I like that this is a necklace rather than sitting on your ears or head.  The ear buds retract into the headband for storage so no tangling.  Pull out to length needed to be comfortable for you.  When done, press the button on each side and they rewind into the headband.One charge will last for 300 hours of standby time, 16 hours of music or 18 hours of talk time.  Charging time is rated at 3.5 hours.  Included in the box are three sets of foam ear covers  choose the size that works for you.  There is also a charging cord.

"I have several device such as a smartphone, a 7 tablet that I read on and an iPad Gen3.  I thought I had all the devices I needed.  Then I got this 10 tablet by iRULU.First, I arrived in a heavy cardboard box, not the flimsy kind most products come in.  Besides the tablet, there were two power cords:  one for USB to Micro USB connecting and an AC/jack cord for charging.  I used the USB cord I already had to charge as I have a charging hub already set up for my other devices.  The instructions said to charge it for 10 hours before the first use but it was fully charged when I got it out of the box.It runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop and has a Quad Core A-33 processor.  It is GMS certified by Google.  That means it has met a standard that is internationally recognized for quality, reliability and performance.  It has a 16GB capacity and is white on the back and black on the front.There are three buttons on one end:  the power button and volume up and down.  There are also slots for OTG, DC-5V, headphones and a TF card slot.  The microphone is also on this end.My next step was to set up the device.  WOW!  That was easy.  I simply turned it on and the device walked me right through the set up process including transferring data I had on my 7 tablet such as contact and apps.  I even tried the reset to factory feature as I didnt allow my data to transfer the first time.  It worked just as easily.  Once it had reset to factory, I again turned it on and it went right through the set up process.  This time I allowed the data transfer!  Any other questions you might have should be covered in the instruction book and it has graphics so you know if you are looking at the right screen.What I didnt find was the GB size in settings.  It might be in some other menu I havent found yet.  I am also looking for a way to turn off the clicking sound when I use the keyboard.  It must be in a menu I havent looked in yet as well.  I also wasnt sure if a tempered glass screen saver and a jelly cover that I wanted to order would fit my tablet.  I asked the company and got an answer within a day.

I want a set that will stay in my ear and not make them hurt after wearing for a couple of hours.  And, of course, they have to be wireless.I found these to be everything I wanted.

The up/down button is on the top of the right ear bar and the power button is on the right side of the right ear bar.  I see a button on the left one but didnt find anything it did.

"I am an earbud/headset connoisseur or maybe snob would be a better word.  What I mean is I am very particular of my headsets.I wear them when I am quilting so I can hear my audio books.  I love my books!  I want a set that will stay in my ear and not make them hurt after wearing for a couple of hours.  And, of course, they have to be wireless.I took them out of the box and tried them out just as they came.  I found them to be a perfect fit without having to try the other two pair of ear covers.  They pair easily just as any Bluetooth device.  The set also comes with a charging cord.  The instructions are good but the graphic of the set could be a bit darker.  It is light enough that it is hard for older eyes to read.The set talks to you so you know when it is power on/off.  The R/L markings are clear as is the up/down button and the USB recharging port is also easy to find.  The LED port is positioned so you can see it.What it does come with, and I couldnt at first figure out, was what the two small pieces with two grooves in them were for.  At first, I thought it was to allow you to adjust the cord that runs from ear piece to ear piece but once I put the set on, I found that was not possible in the way I was thinking.So I went to the photos on the web and finally got it.  It does allows you to shorten the cord so it doesnt hang down your back/front.  That doesnt bother me as I run the cord on my back so I wont be using them but for those that dont want the cord so long, it is a very nice accessory.The headset is rated at eight hours of running time which means they will be good through a whole day of sewing.  If you want a light weight, well fitting in ear headset, this should cover all your wants and needs.""I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTUBE4S59JW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F5VE3M#wasThisHelpful","R3JTUBE4S59JW8","AJV985MKGCIQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJV985MKGCIQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really gotten into using essential oils.  In fact, so much that I was considering how to take my diffuser with me on vacation.  I know I can pack it up but want thinking of something smaller.Then I saw this diffuser.  It was small which makes it portable.  It plugs into a USB port so I have a wall plug with one port which will work.  Then I realized it didnt have an auto shut off.  RATS.  It says it should be unplugged when the water runs out.  If you use it for sleep and it runs out after four hours, I wouldnt want to have to set an alarm to get up just to unplug the diffuser.  I havent found anything that tells how long it is rated to run on either the box or the web site.It has the option of running continuously or intermittently which is OK but I wouldnt use the intermittent one.  It is small enough to fit in my hand and for reference, I wear a size 7 glove.  Finally, it comes with an extra wick and a USB cord but both ends are USB so if you want to use AC power, you will need an adapter.If you want a small diffuser then this is perfect for you.

"This wireless mouse paired as easily as any of my other Bluetooth headphones/ear buds.Simply add one AA battery, turn it on (thats a switch on the bottom of the mouse) and press the connect button (that is next to the power switch).  If your Bluetooth is on, it will start the pairing process with no trouble.  I set it up with my 7 tablet with no problems.The web site says the battery has a 15 month life.  Since I havent had this item for 15 months, I cant attest to that but even if it last eight months that would be great.The mouse is designed to fit your hand.  If you cup your hand over the mouse, your thumb will fit nicely into the rounded side.  It has a scroll wheel and right and left click buttons.  By your thumb, there is a forward and backward button.This mouse is for hubbys computer but we cant figure out how to turn his Bluetooth on.  It will take a few searches on the internet to get that accomplished but that is the computers fault, not the mouse.  It pairs with my devices that do have Bluetooth turn on with no problems.

"I like lots of light when I read or quilt.

"Hubby has been wanting a new headphone set for his computer at work.  I know he will love this set.He likes noise cancelling/isolating and this headphone has it.  It is an over the head, ear muff type of set.  Another plus for him.The headset can be wireless (Bluetooth) or wired.  It comes with the audio cord and also with a recharging cord.  The site says the build-in 400mA rechargeable battery will provide about 12 hours music playing time and more than 15 hours talk time.  I dont think he will use it for talking but he will definitely use it for his music.I paired it to my 7 tablet and there was no trouble doing this at all.  Simply turn it on, go to your device, scan for the headset and when it shows up, just touch the button on your device to complete the pairing.  The volume up/down is easy to work.  You just need to remember not to hold it down but to tap it once or twice depending on how much you want to increase/decrease the volume.Another nice feature of this set is that it folds up into an approximately 4.5 x 6.5 x 2 sized area.  The only thing it doesnt have is a bag to contain both cords and the headset but Im sure we can find one around the house.  The site also states that the earmuffs are made of artificial protein leather to simulate human skin texture.

"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.No one writes quite like David Mitchell. His last book, The Bone Clocks, made the list of my favorite books I read in 2014, and now I was utterly captivated by the quirky, slightly creepy, and utterly compelling Slade House.Slade House is a bit of an anomaly. If you go looking for it most days, you won't find ityou'll simply go down the narrowest alley you've ever seen and search in vain, and if you ask passers-by whether they've heard of Slade House, chances are they'll look at you like you've gone mad. But the truth is, Slade House is only visible every nine years, and only if you've been chosen by the house's owners, a mysterious brother and a sister, will you get the chance to enter. You'll be amazed by the beauty of your surroundings, the grandeur of the houseand then you'll start to realize all is not what it seems. But by then, it's too late.Slade House spans five decades, beginning in the 1970s, and follows an unlikely group of people as they encounter the house and its owners. A misfit teenager accompanying his musician mother for a recital, a recently divorced policeman with an eye for the ladies, a college student who joined her college's Paranormal Society to get closer to one of her fellow students, and an investigative journalist all enter the house; some have knowledge of its existence, some are totally unaware. And then it becomes difficult to distinguish what is real and what is in their minds.I'm not going to say more about the plot for fear of spoiling it. Once again, David Mitchell has created a tremendously unique story with lots of twists and turns (and there's even a tiny overlap with a character from The Bone Clocks, but you don't have to have read that book to enjoy this one. This book has vivid imagery, fascinating characters, and even takes some trips into the territory of authors like Stephen King, Peter Straub, or Dean Koontz, but still remains completely Mitchell-ian. (If that word doesn't exist, now it does.)Give yourself a little post-Halloween treat that won't pack on the calories, and pick up this book. Chances are, like me, you're going to want to read more of Mitchell's books afterward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5Z6B00CRPP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998685#wasThisHelpful","R2N5Z6B00CRPP6","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I pick up a book by Jojo Moyes, it's a pretty fair bet that it's going to make me cry at least at some point, although none of the other books of hers have left me the sobbing mess I was while reading Me Before You, which was one of my favorite books of 2013.Given how much I loved that book, I'll admit I was slightly dubious when I learned that Moyes was writing a sequel. Would it be able to capture the emotion of its predecessor without feeling like a retread? Was there more to Louisa Clark's story that still needed to be told? And perhaps most importantly, would it leave me an emotional wreck? I'd say pretty much, yes, and, well, sort of.Since Will Traynor's death, Louisa's life hasn't been the same. She promised him she'd live boldly, and she tried, but in the end, she found herself going through the motions more than anything else. When a freak accident forces her to return home to live with her family, she is confronted by the feeling that she never made any progress with her life before she met Will, and she doesn't know what she wantsif anythingfrom her future.Stuck in a job she hates, with only her family and members of a bereavement group to commiserate with, Lou feels guilty about not keeping her promise, but she isn't sure she has anything more in her. But then lifein the forms of an unexpected figure from Will's past, and the paramedic who rescued Lou after her accidentintervenes, and once again she is forced to make a decision as to whether to do what is best for her, to step outside of her comfort zone, or should she just do what is easiest, even if it means letting chances pass her by?After You is a book about how hard it is to move on and start living again after you've lost someone you love so deeply. It's about how grief affects everything you do, and sometimes paralyzes you, and how even when you are pushed out of your rut, it can still be far too hard. It's also about whether you are willing to let yourself take chances again, even if those chances may lead to you being hurt again.I really enjoy the way Moyes writes. Her style is breezy, accessible, conversational, and it just draws you in so quickly. I really liked most of the characters in this book, and it didn't really feel like a retread of Me Before You. I'll admit that at times I felt the book was going to veer into territory I wasn't going to like, but for the most part, Moyes kept us out of there. (There was one brief shift in the book's narration that would really have irritated me if it continued, but fortunately, it didn't.)This book didn't hit me as hard as its predecessor, but I still found myself getting choked up. And while I didn't think this book was quite as good, it's still a really good, enjoyable, emotional read, so I wasn't disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JX4A1QH2RDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426590#wasThisHelpful","R5JX4A1QH2RDI","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved this, loved this, loved this.There's a lot of fiction out there these days about extraordinary situations that threaten the worldusually it's an attack by aliens, monsters, or vampires, or otherwise the country is in danger because of war, dystopia, or political manipulation. It usually falls to one person, or a group of people, to save the world and solve the problems facing it.Patrick Ness' terrific The Rest of Us Just Live Here turns that concept on its head. While a small community is under siege by mysterious forces and a group of ""indie kids"" (aka hipsters) have to figure out who (or what) is responsible before they destroy the world and keep killing people, Ness' book focuses on a group of friends who aren't the chosen ones. They're just a group of best friends, each dealing with their own problems, and just counting down the days until they graduate from high school and can leave their town behind.""Not everyone has to be the Chosen One. Not everyone has to be the guy who saves the world. Most people just have to live their lives the best they can, doing the things that are great for them, having great friends, trying to make their lives better, loving people properly. All the while knowing that the world makes no sense but trying to find a way to be happy anyway.""The book is narrated by Mike, a sensitive high school senior battling OCD, who wants nothing more than to pursue a relationship with his friend Henna before they graduate and she heads off to Africa on a mission trip with her parents. His sister Mel has had more than her own share of problems but is trying to stay above water and pursue a relationship of her own. Mike's best friend Jared is more than just a smart, generous football playerhe's the most complicated of them all. And Mike and Mel's problems get exacerbated when their ambitious politician mother decides to run for the U.S. Senate, since her last political campaign nearly destroyed their family.Each chapter of this book starts with a brief description of what is happening among the indie kids who are fighting the menacing problem threatening to destroy the town. It doesn't really mention those events again unless Mike or one of his friends comes across a related situation. They're sad that the indie kids are dying, but mostly, they're just hoping their high school doesn't blow up (again) before prom and graduation.As I've said many times, I love books that make me feel all the feels, and this one definitely did that. Ness so perfectly captured not only the typical teenage angst about how life will change after high school graduation, and falling in love with one of your best friends, but he deftly balanced that with all of the other emotional issues the characters dealt with. I totally identified with Mike's fears that he was the odd man out among his friends, and that he was the neediest one of them all.Ness is a great writer (I'm definitely going to have to read some more of his books because he has a new fan in me) and I felt his dialogue and pacing were close to pitch-perfect. Until I understood the concept of the book I was a little confused, because I kept expecting the chapters to actually contain elements of the story that their introductory blurbs hinted at, but once I got the idea, it didn't matter. This is moving, funny, and utterly enjoyableit's nice to read a story about (mostly) ""ordinary"" teenagers in the midst of extraordinary circumstances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODZKBLVS8J7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","RODZKBLVS8J7T","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently devoured Lori Ostlund's short story collection, The Bigness of the World, which I absolutely loved. (See my original review.) I so fell in love with her writing and her storytelling ability that I very quickly jumped into reading her debut novel, After the Parade. While I don't think I loved this book as much as her stories, I continue to be dazzled by Ostlund's talent and her ability to provoke so many different emotions with her writing.Aaron Englund has been with his older partner Walter for 20 years, since Walter rescued him from a lonely existence in his small town of Morton, Minnesota. But while the two shared a strong bond, Aaron felt that Walter always controlled him, and never let him forget that he saved him. So one day, Aaron leaves their home in New Mexico and heads to San Francisco, where he hopes to start a new life and continue his career as an ESL teacher.""Perhaps that was the nature of love: either a person was not in it enough toc are, or was in it too deeply to make anything but mistakes.""Settling into a small garage apartment in San Francisco, Aaron begins to realize that a new life isn't all it's cracked up to be. While he enjoys helping his students maneuver their way through the idiosyncrasies of the English language, he spends most of his time alone, knowing he did the right thing in his relationship with Walter yet still missing him, and feeling ever more alone and isolated, but scared and unwilling to try and make new friends.Through flashbacks we get a better understanding of what has shaped Aaron into the man he has become. His angry, abusive father was killed in a freak accident when he was five, and his mother vacillated between smothering and distant. He never felt he was the same as his fellow classmates, and he often was the object of ridicule and/or bullying. Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he encountered a number of people whose differences were either physical and emotional, yet he felt at home with them. And then, while he was in high school, his mother left home in the middle of the night with the town's priest, and she never connected with Aaron again.After the Parade is a moving story about feeling isolated, feeling different, and how our relationships and personalities are shaped by the things that occur in our lives. I felt for Aaron so much as I learned more about him, his likes and dislikes, and his inability to feel comfortable letting his guard down. But at times the emotional distance at which his mother kept Aaron, and Aaron keeps the world, translated into an emotional distance for me as well, so at times I was frustrated by Aaron's inability to act, to say what was on his mind, to do something that might bring a change in his life, although I understood why.This is a story that unfolds slowly (very slowly at times), and while the flashbacks are tremendously valuable for insight into his character, I would have enjoyed spending more time with Aaron in adulthood than in childhood. But while this isn't a book I necessarily enjoyed, it was a book that moved me, and Ostlund's talent is on full display here. It's definitely a book that has me thinking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLTLL9ARBBKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476790108#wasThisHelpful","RNLTLL9ARBBKE","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this between 4 and 4.5 stars. Maybe 4.25?Sometimes you read a book you know very little about, and it utterly surprises you. That was the case with Sung J. Woo's Love Love, a moving, thought-provoking, endearing, and slightly zany novel about two siblings whose lives aren't quite going the way they plannedand every step they take seems to throw them another curve.Judy Lee is, to put it mildly, unhappy. She hasn't pursued a relationship since her marriage ended, she hasn't forgiven her father for her mother's death, she has no career prospects, and she doesn't know what she's going to do with the rest of her life. And when she meets a new man she might be interested in, he's a little more complicated than most, plus he may or may not have been a member of the Japanese Yakuza gang at some point.""Everyone else she knew was doing productive things like buying bigger houses, raising smart kids, getting promotions. And here she was, a temp at age thirty-eight, with no husband, no house, no job, nothing. She knew she should be concerned, and to some degree she was, but whenever she fully recognized her utter lack of everything, the sheer emptiness of her life filled her up, leaving no room in her heart to even feel scared.""The only constant in Judy's life has been her older brother, Kevin. But Kevin has more than enough problems of his own. His career as a professional tennis player never really hit its stride, he's still mourning the end of his marriage, and he's just had one heck of a bombshellafter preparing to donate one of his kidneys to their dying father, he learns he isn't a genetic match. That's right, he's adopted, and he's finding this out for the first time at age 40, and all his father can give him is a nude picture of his birth mother from the 1970s.Love Love is about trying to cope and move forward when nothing in your life seems to be going right, and when every possibility turns up more chaos than you expected. It's the story of two siblings trying to decide whether to wallow in their misery or take control of their lives when they seem utterly, completely out of control on all fronts. It's also an interesting meditation on how we choose to live our lives, on the difference between selfishness and independence, and how much of a role fate plays in the choices we make.I found this book utterly endearing and enjoyable. I really liked both Judy and Kevin's characters, and found many of the supporting characters to be so much more fascinating and complex than I imagined. At times things happen as you expect they will, at times Woo really throws some crazy twists into his story, and while it makes the book a little quirkier than I imagined it would be, it also makes it more entertaining. Woo is a terrific storyteller and you can tell that he cares about his characters, which makes you care about them, too.What a pleasant surprise this was! Nothing like some good family and relationship dysfunction to entertain you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K17KZ6PUOTTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593766173#wasThisHelpful","R2K17KZ6PUOTTS","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Walter was five years old, his mother left their family, driving away in her blue Volvo, and he never saw her again. Now 17, living a monotonous existence away from the Las Vegas strip and taking care of his bedridden father, he has spent the last 12 years searching for her, hoping that she'll someday mysteriously reappear in her life as quickly as she left it.Working a dead-end job at a museum on Fremont Street, he has his whole life ahead of him but feels he has not much to live for. And then one day he meets Chrysto and Acacia, siblings who work as living statues at The Venetian. Their beauty and passion awaken something in Walter, and he suddenly finds himself looking forward to the end of work days so he can spend time in their presence. He also finds that Chrysto is making him feel things he never expected to, but isn't sure if he should trust anyone not to leave him.James Sie's Still Life Las Vegas is more than just the story of a young man living under the specter of loss and abandonment. It tells the story of Emily, Walter's mother, and what led her to abandon her family, as well as the story of Owen, Walter's father, how he lost control of his life and his love, and how he ekes out an existence without both. It's also the story of how we shape the truth to help us cope, not realizing the ramifications that our version of the truth might have on others around us.As you might imagine from the plot, this is a very moving story. Walter is a character you feel for, although you want him to strive for more, feel more, and begin living his life for himself. The emotion of the story is both complemented and supplemented by some beautiful comics-like illustrations by Sungyoon Choi, and at times, key moments in the plot reveal themselves through these illustrations.My challenge with this book is the way it was told. Chapters fluctuate between Walter in the present, Emily from childhood through the moments after she makes the decision to leave, and Owen's search for his wife, but there isn't any linear order to the chapters, so I felt the story revealed itself in fits and starts, and at times it dulled some of its emotion. But while some of the discoveries Walter makes may not surprise, they still touch your heart, and his story finds its way inside your mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ8DDWC73QJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055660#wasThisHelpful","RZJ8DDWC73QJ5","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whoa. I'm not sure what to make of this one.""Storytelling is a landscape, and tragedy is comedy is drama. It simply depends on how you frame what you're seeing.""Do we ever really know the person we're in a relationship with? What about the person we're married to?Lauren Groff's dense, thought-provoking, occasionally meandering new book, Fates and Furies, is a weighty exploration of a 20+-year marriage between Lotto (Lancelot) and Mathilde. The two meet at the end of their senior year of college at Vassar and fall instantly in loveand lustwith each other. Both tall, confident, exuding charisma, they are the couple everyone wants to be, and be near.Lotto was once a child of privilege, the heir to a fortune, only to have it all taken away by his manipulative, agoraphobic mother. He runs on the fuel of adoration and popularity, but once his acting career doesn't materialize, he falls into a depression until he discovers his true talent, writing plays. Mathilde is his muse, his inspiration, his business manager, the person who keeps their lives running as Lotto flickers in and out of the creative process. But why is she willing to put up with Lotto's mercurial nature, his desperate need to be adored, his feelings of abandonment from his family?Fates and Furies tells Lotto's story first, seeing the marriage from his vantage point, and then switches halfway through to tell Mathilde's story, which provides an intriguing, complex perspective on incidents we've already seen. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book, some surprising, some not so surprising, and these are fascinating, flawed characters. (At times Lotto felt to me like a character from a Pat Conroy novel, not that that's a bad thing.)I'm a huge fan of Lauren Groff, and her storytelling ability and her use of language is sensational. At times I marveled over her words but at times her prose was so weighty, so laden with metaphors and references to Greek mythology and Shakespeare that I found myself a little lost. (The last segment of Lotto's section was particularly confusing, as I couldn't figure out what was a dream and what was reality.) But in the end, this is a fascinating and compelling book, an intriguing character study, and I can't get it out of my mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LPRHLMP3VRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634475#wasThisHelpful","R12LPRHLMP3VRL","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in exchange for an unbiased review. My thanks to Mandy and Jonathan Smith for making this available to me!A quote from Death of a Salesman says, ""Attention must be paid."" That is how I felt after reading Mandy Smith's powerful, painful memoir, Secrets in Big Sky Country. This book is worthy of notice, and Smith is to be praised for bringing attention to the tragedy of child sexual abuse.Smith's parents divorced shortly after she was born, and her mother, afraid of being alone and without the attention of a man, quickly married her ex-brother-in-law. Smith's older brother Cliff went to live with their father, while she was raised by her mother and uncle/stepfather. It wasn't long before her mother realized her new husband wasn't much of an improvement over his brother, but she couldn't live without him.This was a particular problem for young Mandy (born Cathy). Beginning at age three, her stepfather began sexually molesting her, and she lived in constant fear of sexual assault and physical violence. Her stepfather's actions tore her and her brother apart, and set her on a cycle of eating disorders, depression, fear of being in cars, and PTSD that would follow her into adulthood. And while she tried to tell people, and tried to free herself from the abuse, it wasn't until she was 14 that she was able to convince people what was happening. But sadly, her life took an even darker turn from there.Smith's story is brutal, but it isn't gratuitously graphicit's honest. It was a wonder to me a number of times how she found the strength to keep living, to keep confronting her abuser and keep from truly going off the deep end. But as difficult as parts of this book are to read, I was often overcome with wonder at her ability to tell her story, to relive it all again, all of the pain and anguish and fear. That is true courage, and true strength, and I hope it inspires others confronting these same issues in their own lives.Studies show that as many as one in three girls will be sexually abused at some point in their childhood. That statistic is immensely alarming, but what is even more frightening is the number of crimes that go unreported. Hopefully the courageous words of Mandy Smith will find their way into the ears of those who can help stop this cycle from continuing, and lives can be protected before abuse occurs. We should be grateful to those like Smith who are willing to share their painful experiences with the worldwhile they are difficult to hear, we must hear them in order to make change happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXQUNOUV5CRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631528149#wasThisHelpful","R1CXQUNOUV5CRU","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review. Many thanks to NetGalley and Fliterati Press for making it available!Scrabble fans, the word ""brailling"" means feeling the surface of a tile while your hand is in the bag in order to draw a blank or other specific letter. This practice is strictly against the rules. (Don't worry, this isn't a book about Scrabble.)At times while reading James Zerndt's moving but slightly scattered Brailling for Wile, I felt as if I could benefit from brailling to help me find my way to the beautiful heart of this book. At its core, this is a book about love, loss, redemption, and recovery, and it touches you and makes you think. It's just at times it loses its way a little bit.Thirteen-year-old Mattias Long and his older sister Georgie have been left reeling since the suicide of their father Wile (so called because ""his crazy plans to build his family a better life...ended up with an anvil falling on him,"" like Wile E. Coyote) one year ago. Mattias has been responsible for watching over their mother, who is so consumed with grief that she hasn't been able to reopen the family's Colorado restaurant, The Sad Cafe. And then their mother makes a discovery that changes all of them, sending them reeling and pondering their next steps.Mattias and his family aren't the only ones struck by life and loss. Brailling for Wile follows a number of other people in the small ski town where they live, and many are trying to overcome their own dilemmas and figure out their own lives. And then a seemingly simple request from Mattias' mother sets a course of events in motion that affects an ever-widening circle of people and forces them to confront their own issues.As you might imagine from a book about loss, there is a lot of emotion conveyed in this story, and it's very engaging. There are a lot of different threads of the plot to keep straight, although they eventually intersect, and while most of them work, one subplot involving Mattias' friend Helyana and her ultra-religious grandfather seemed utterly unnecessary and unrealistic, and I found it tremendously distracting. I don't think the book needed to artificial chaos that those characters brought aboutit was almost as if Zerndt didn't trust the power of his story without that, and it was moving more than fine on its own.But despite the one discordant thread of the story, this is still a moving, well-written book that I felt in my heart and my head. It definitely makes you think how you'd handle the situations the characters find themselves in, and I was left thinking about these characters even after I finished the book. I'm glad I read this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R735CIYQSKQAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511527277#wasThisHelpful","R735CIYQSKQAX","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Gritty, sometimes bleak, but full of well-developed characters and emotions, the stories in Colin Barrett's collection Young Skins are tremendously compelling and memorable.Set in the small Irish town of Glanbeigh, Barrett's stories evoke the weariness one feels when they have spent most of their life in one place, with the same people, following the same path they always have. Sometimes his characters are down on their luck, sometimes their facing a major crossroads, and sometimes they're just hoping for a little more out of life. And even when they aren't the most upstanding people (to put it mildly, in some cases), Barrett's respect for his characters makes you care about them anyway.I really enjoyed all seven stories in this collection. Some of my favorites included ""Stand Your Skin,"" about a man whose face was damaged by someone else's act of recklessness, and how he tends to live his life on the margins; ""The Moon,"" about a senior bouncer at a bar, whose infatuation with his boss' college-aged daughter makes him ponder a different life than he has known; ""Calm with Horses,"" which followed Arm, the enforcer for a neighborhood drug dealer, whose life is far more complex and complicated than you'd expect; ""The Clancy Kid,"" about a lovelorn young man and his larger-than-life best friend, who is obsessed with the kidnapping of a young boy from their neighborhood; and ""Kindly Forget My Existence,"" in which two old friends and romantic rivals are reunited when both try to avoid a solemn occasion.While Barrett's writing style reminded me a bit of Roddy Doyle's, he has a voice all his own. I had read about this collection a number of times over the last several months, and it always had been on my to be read list, but I'm so glad I finally picked it up. These stories are rich with character, plot, and introspection, and they definitely leave you marveling. Colin Barrett may be a relative newcomer to the world of fiction, but I don't anticipate he'll be a flash in the pan given his talent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ8GCE8D9P5E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123325#wasThisHelpful","RJ8GCE8D9P5E3","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They knew about the middle, how all of life revolves around a single moment in time. Everything that comes before leads up to that moment. Everything that comes afterward springs from that moment. In my case, that momentthat middleis my husband's murder.""From the moment she met him, Brett loved Charlie. The easygoing, confident, dynamic brother of her best friend Eli, Charlie quickly mesmerized Brett and captured her heart, despite Eli's warnings to the contrary. When Charlie leaves town, leaving Brett alone again at college, she feels a palpable loss even as she knows she may never see him again. But her heart doesn't care.Years later, after many ups and downs, Brett and Charlie finally marry and live in his family's cottage on Cape Cod with their young daughter. But despite the fact that they finally have the life Brett has dreamed they'd have, life keeps intervening in different ways, particularly with the continued reappearance of Eli, whose mental illness has taken a toll on the entire family. When the unthinkable happens, Brett is at odds between holding fast to the life she dreamed of and the life she seems destined to live, and needs to determine just what sacrifices are worth the love of your life.I really enjoyed this book, although I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, or a meditation on love, loss, and family? Were there elements to the plot that would surprise, or was the power of the plot simply in the storytelling and not in the unpredictable twists? I'll leave you to discover what happens.Nina de Gramont is an excellent writer, and although at times I wanted to shake Brett to make her act or speak up, I found this book utterly captivating and definitely emotional. It definitely made me think how I would react if faced with the mental decline of someone I once truly cared about, someone of whom I wasn't sure whether to pity or fear. And it made me acknowledge once again how fragile love is, and how quickly our lives can change.Give this one a shot!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DC447BY80SYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6YR0JE#wasThisHelpful","R3DC447BY80SYW","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Will the truth really set you free? In Susan Juby's quirky and enjoyable The Truth Commission, three art students believe so, and strive to compel their fellow students to expressing the truth about the various situations they're inbut they don't realize that the truth comes at a price, and that facing your own truths may cause more difficulty than you realize.Normandy Pale is a student at the Green Pastures Academy of Art and Applied Design in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. She is a tremendously talented artist and embroiderer; trouble is, she lives in the shadow of her older sister, Keira, also a graduate of Green Pastures. Keira became famous with a series of graphic novels that lampooned Normandy and their parents, but their parents don't seem to care, and only seem to indulge Keira's behavior.One day Normandy and her two best friends, Neil and Dusk (whose real name is Dawngotta love it), launch what they call The Truth Commission, designed to get their fellow classmates to reveal their not-so-secret secrets. As they start questioning their peers, they find the whole process tremendously empowering, although they're not the ones telling the truth, but their efforts start an interesting domino-like effect across the school, which has both positive and negative results.But the truth that Normandy finds herself most compelled to uncover is the truth about Keira, who left her university studies and returned home, ostensibly to write the next installment in her graphic novel series. Keira is acting more eccentric than ever, and Normandy can't quite understand why their parents won't get to the bottom of what's going on with her. And then, without warning, Keira starts to confide in Normandy about an incident that has left her shaken. Normandy faces the ultimate dilemma: as she and her friends pursue their search for other people to reveal their truths, should she try to do the same with Keira? Will anyone care if she does?This was a warm, amusing, and utterly engaging book, populated with really intriguing characters. While so many of the issues the characters dealt with are familiar, Juby makes you care about her characters, so you want to keep reading. The book is ostensibly Normandy's junior project in school, so it's a reflection on the events that occurred and how they made her feel, along with her wry (and sometimes off-topic) observations, even some drawings here and there.I don't know how you read a book, but this one has a lot of footnotes, mostly Normandy's observations and comments to the readers of her manuscript. When you read a book with footnotes on a Kindle, you have to click back and forth between the footnote and the text, so it took a little longer to get through the text, and sometimes the footnotes didn't advance the story that much. But in the end, it's a tiny irritation that didn't dampen my enthusiasm for this terrific book in the slightest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8CG2CDEF76I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG645C#wasThisHelpful","R3C8CG2CDEF76I","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.I tend to be dubious when I come across a book written by an actor. It's not that every actor is a bad writer; in fact, I've read some well-written books authored by actors, such as Ethan Hawke, Meg Tilly, and Lauren Graham. But of course, for every actor deserving of a book deal, there are many whose books are published only on the strength of their name and not any display of writing skill. (Cough, James Franco, cough.)When I saw a friend had raved about Jesse Eisenberg's collection of stories, Bream Gives Me Hiccups, I was definitely intrigued. I'm a big fan of his acting and hoped that his wry, sarcastic sense of humor I've seen displayed in interviews would shine through. I also hoped that a book being touted as hysterically funny actually lived up to that billing.I'm pleased to say Eisenberg succeeded on both fronts. This book is composed of a number of stories and humorous anecdotes which take different formstext messages, email conversations, letters, conversationsand many made me laugh out loud. From the hilarious and touching title story, in which a nine-year-old boy reviews meals he has in different locations, many with his troubled mother, to an email conversation between a dating couple which gets hijacked by his sister, who is a scholar of the Bosnian genocide, some of these stories are laugh-out-loud funny and many others make you chuckle and shake your head at Eisenberg's ingenuity. And more than a few times, I could hear his voice coming through the narration, which added an extra layer of depth and humor.In addition to the two stories I mentioned above, some of my favorites in this collection included (and many of the titles say all that needs to be said about the stories themselves): ""My Prescription Information Pamphlets as Written by My Father""; ""Carmelo Anthony and I Debrief Our Friends after a Pickup Game at the YMCA""; ""If She Ran Into Me Now,"" in which a man is waiting for a glimpse of an ex-girlfriend; and ""A Bully Does His Research,"" which I found perhaps a little too short.Not every story works; there are times when Eisenberg goes for one more laugh where he could have held back, and times when the stories are more one-liner than plot, but even those are enjoyable in their own way. This was a quick, fun read, and I look forward to not only seeing more of his movies (he's playing Lex Luthor, y'all), but reading more of his books in the future. Perhaps he can pave the way for more actors with writing talent being published instead of those without it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGGL74KJ2074B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XAQ1MVM#wasThisHelpful","RGGL74KJ2074B","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She is worried she's turning into her late mother, an alcoholic who seemed to sabotage her own life at every turn, and Mattie has no end of regrets about their relationship.When she finds out that she might inherit something from her late grandmother, a woman she never met, she makes the split-second decision to drive more than 800 miles to Gandy, Oklahoma, where her grandmother and mother once lived. She quickly discovers that her mother had a tremendous amount of potential but her life was derailed by several incidents in her teenage years, which led to the disappointments of her adult life. But as Mattie tries to figure out exactly what caused her mother to abandon the possibilities which lay in store for her, she finds a lot more questions, secrets, and more than a few angry people.Can we overcome our regrets and our mistakes and start a new course for our lives, or are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again? Why are we so determined to push those who care about us away, and not tell them the things we should?From the very first sentences of The Art of Crash Landing I was utterly hooked, and this book didn't let me go until it ended. It's not that there was necessarily anything earth-shattering about the plot, but Melissa DeCarlo did such a great job unfolding the story, and creating so many fascinating characters. This book is just over 400 pages, and I read the entire thing in less than a dayand I didn't sit around all day reading, either! I was just completely drawn in by the plot and just couldn't stop reading, because I really enjoyed Mattie's story, as dysfunctional as it was.I love books that give you so much more than you expect. For an author writing her debut novel, Melissa DeCarlo has talent in abundance, and knows how to tell a story. The Art of Crash Landing is moving, funny, and compelling.

"Bill Clegg's novel, Did You Ever Have a Family, is a lot like life itselfat times it's poignant and emotional, at other times it's vague and somewhat frustrating, and at still other times you find yourself shaking your head at the wonder of it all.""I've learned that people will believe what they believe no matter what you say or do.""The night before June Reid's daughter is to get married, an unexpected tragedy takes the lives of her daughter and her fianc, as well as June's ex-husband and her current boyfriend, Luke. Utterly unsure how to process a loss of this magnitude, she is emotionally overwhelmed, wracked with anger, sadness, and guilt. The only solution she sees to coping with those around her who feel the need to pass judgment on the situation and assign blame, even if they don't know the truth, is to run, as far away and as fast as she can.As June follows a path across the country that her daughter once took, from Connecticut across the country, to an oceanside motel in tiny Moclips, Washington. Along the way she reflects on her rocky relationship with her daughter, and finally finding love again, with a much younger man, and the issues that arose from both relationships. Hers is a stoic grief, but one that threatens to consume her, little by little.While June mourns, we get other glimpses of what led up to the tragedy, the people involved, and the aftermath. Portions of the story are narrated by Lydia, the town outcast and Luke's mother, who has secrets and regrets of her own; Silas, the teenage stoner who knows more about the tragedy than he has told anyone; the two women who own the motel where June settles in to mourn; and others with peripheral involvement in one way or another. Some of what is told is more gossip than anything, a slightly bitter version of Liane Moriarty's Greek chorus in Big Little Lies, but much of what is told is like participating in an archaeological dig, where an artifact (or the truth) is uncovered, little by little.This is a book of tragedy and hope, of optimism and bitterness, and one of the strength of relationships of all kinds. Things start out vaguely murky, and it takes a little while to make sense of all of the voices and where the story really is. But once the plot starts to pick up steam, and connections and truths are revealed, at times you feel this story deep in your gut. Just like real life, it is amazing how life hinges on split-second decisions we make, and how the things we don't say sometimes can be more destructive than the things we do.I had never read anything Clegg had written before, but there is a lyricism to his storytelling as well as a tremendous amount of emotion evoked by his words. This is a sad book, and it's not entirely satisfying, but I can't get it out of my mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6HQDDGXY5LCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476798176#wasThisHelpful","R6HQDDGXY5LCD","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know when you read a book by an author you've never heard of before, and you love it so much, but when you read another book by the same person you're disappointed? I was utterly captivated by Jacob Appel's quirky, moving story collection, Einstein's Beach House, but I wondered if Appel's charm would be apparent in his newest collection, Miracles and Conundrums of the Secondary Planets, or whether the quirkiness would become cloying.I'm pleased to say that this new collection is equally as good, and that once again, I am so dazzled by Appel's talent. These stories are unlike many I've read, but they're not outlandish; each is full of so much heart and emotion and incredibly unforgettable characters. This is a brief but powerful collection that left me wanting more.Some of my favorite stories in the collection include ""Invasive Species,"" in which a woman struggles with the impending death of her young daughter, and tries to decide whether the romantic attention of her next-door neighbor is a good thing; ""Phoebe with Impending Frost,"" which follows an expert in climate change as he tries to deal with the return of his high school crush amidst a true climate crisis; ""The Resurrection Bakeoff,"" in which a man is worried that one of his darkest secrets will be revealed to his wife before she dies; and ""Measures of Sorrow,"" about a graduate student who teaches a cab driver about everything he knows so he can woo a woman he's attracted to. And then there's the amazing title story, in which an alien masquerading as a Latvian immigrant in Birmingham, Alabama, keeps the peace between pro-life and pro-choice advocatesand finds himself falling in love.I don't know why Jacob Appel isn't a household name, because the way he writes, the way he weaves emotion and humor and heart and makes you think, deserves more recognition. These stories pack a punch, and will stick in your mind, and you'll want to tell everyone you know about them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NAVQ0QZQYNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625579330#wasThisHelpful","R35NAVQ0QZQYNW","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although it only runs less than 200 pages, David C. Riggins' Boys of the Fatherless packs a powerful, thought-provoking punch.In a dystopian society in our future, the country is divided into zones, which are managed by ""fear and intimidation."" Martial law exists, carried out by security drones armed with infrared cameras and nine-millimeter shotguns, which they are more than quick to use. The lower the zone number, the lower on the societal food chain you are; those who live in Zone N-1, or ""Fatherless,"" are those families whose fathers have been killed or who have abandoned their families.When Danny Roberts' father abandons him, his bipolar, promiscuous mother, and two sisters, their family is sent to Fatherless. But Danny is determined not to let his life be doomed despite the fact that his teachers don't think he'll amount to anything, his mother barely cares about him, and the threats of violence around him could take him down a dangerous path.""I felt like a kind and gentle boy who had been thrown to the wolves with two options, adapt or be devoured. I adapted.""Danny tries to find joy in the simple thingshis two best friends, Jessie and Sam; his girlfriend, Sarah; and the attentions of Darius, an old friend of his father's, who is determined to look out for Danny and be sure he makes something of his life. But when the deck is stacked against you from the start, can you beat the odds? Are love and friendship enough to save you?This was a very intriguing, well-written book, although at times the plot moved so quickly I felt like I missed things. There is a lot of emotion in this book, and the undercurrent of loss throughout is tremendously poignant. The characters are really interesting and have stayed in my mind, and I can't stop thinking about this story and some of the surprises it held.Boys of the Fatherless is unique and not at all what I expected. Riggins is a talented writer, and he has created a fascinating world that I'd like to spend more time in, and I'm pleased that it appears the book is the start of a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7HFUFZU55GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZZXAS4#wasThisHelpful","R2D7HFUFZU55GX","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say tragedies often happen in threes, and that's precisely what has happened to Isabel Moore. Following her best friend Josie's tragic death in a car accident, Isabel's life has been further turned upside down by the imminent demise of her marriage, and the fact that her preteen daughter Hannah is starting to hate her.""Death smashes a crater into your life, and you're left alone to sort through the rubble.""In Days of Awe, Lauren Fox examines the life of a woman who thought she had everythinga best friend who ""got"" her, a teaching job she loved for the most part, a family she cherishedonly to discover things are not as she imagined, and in fact, things seem to be rapidly slipping from her grasp. Isabel tries to figure out where Josie's life went wrong and tries to understand what was happening in the months before her death. Were there signs she missed? Who was to blame? And shouldn't everyone's lives remain in flux until she's had the time to process the loss of Josie?But recovering from this loss isn't all she has to deal with. She needs to figure out whether her marriage is worth fighting for, if there is a way to get her daughter to like her again, and consider whether to let someone else into her heart. But beyond that, she needs to find a way out of the rut she is in, and whether she can prevent herself from the same behavior patterns and same choices that have caused her problems in the past.""What if you make the right choices? What if you shelve those immature and solipsistic pursuits in favor of the grown-up occupations of family and careerhappily, you do it without regret, in love, looking forwardthen those fall apart? You turn around and you're staring at the moonscape that used to be your life.""I found this book tremendously engaging and enjoyable, and read most of it in one day while sitting at the pool. While I didn't necessarily agree with all of Isabel's choices, I really like characters that try to diffuse difficult situations with sarcasm and humor and yet don't always correctly gauge the moods and tolerance of those around them, mainly because I do the same thing more often than I should. Even if not everything that happens is surprising, I still found myself wanting to know what happened next. These are complex, fascinating characters.Fox is a very talented writer. How many of us have struggled with grief and chaos in our lives, wondering whether the choices we are making are the right ones, or whether we even have the capacity to change the path we're heading down? Days of Awe is moving, amusing, thought provoking, and very well written. That's a pretty great combination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISMXK6GD54GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307268128#wasThisHelpful","RISMXK6GD54GW","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tremendously thought-provoking, compelling, and slightly disturbing, Joshua Mohr's All This Life is an intriguing commentary on the chaos wrecked by society's constant obsession with social media, and how it simultaneously connects and disconnects us. (And yet, here I sit, posting this review on my blog and multiple social media sites...)It seemed like just an ordinary morning on the Golden Gate Bridge. Countless commuters are stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, including Paul and his teenage son Jake. Then suddenly the morning doldrums are broken by a seemingly unbelievable group of people who appear from out of nowhereand then absolutely astound onlookers with their actions. Jake, riveted in disbelief, captures the entire incident on his phone and quickly posts the video, achieving viral success and garnering online fameand criticism.At the same time, in a small town, 18-year-old Sara is distracted by the coverage of the cataclysmic event in San Francisco by her own media event: her boyfriend has posted their sex tape online, and she becomes both a pariah and an online obsession. Needing to get out of town, to escape the criticism and pointing fingers, she enlists the help of Rodney, her old boyfriend whose injury in a freak accident three years earlier derailed his life and their relationship, but not his feelings for Sara.As the lives of Paul, Jake, Sara, Rodney, and others are affected and transformed by tweets, social media posts, text messages, and online videos, they also must confront problems they never expected. They struggle with being judged, cajoled, criticized, and occasionally praised by people they've never, and will never, meet, and they'll also deal with feeling more alone than ever before despite being connected to people all over the world.""This is how the world works. This is why we're smarter now: We share everything with everyone, have access to each sight and sound. We are informed and connected!""As someone who is pretty active on many different forms of social media, but sometimes falls prey to obsessing over the number of friends, followers, likes, or retweets I get, I found this book really fascinating and powerful. Mohr weaved a number of seemingly disparate storylines together, and all but one seemed like a story you'd hear about from a friend, or perhaps see through a post on your friend's Facebook wall or Twitter feed, or perhaps see on a YouTube video. He is an excellent storyteller, and this book really made me think.If I have any criticism of All This Life, it's the appearance of one random character whose presence threatened to derail the entire book, but luckily Mohr didn't let his characters fall prey. So many issues, emotions, and tough questions are pondered here, but the book never really seems heavy; it seems very current and relevant. Well done, Joshua Mohr!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Y0EBKW8B38P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593766033#wasThisHelpful","R30Y0EBKW8B38P","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.The 1980s were the decade of excess, the decade in which the Gordon Gekko-esque ""Greed is good"" mantra ruled Wall Street (and not just the Oliver Stone movie of the same name), and young ""Masters of the Universe"" raked in millions upon millions of bucks in financial trading, only to blow it through excessive spending, drugs, and sex. It was also the decade in which the promiscuity of the 1970s led to the horror of AIDS, the early days of which caused people to commit suicide, and family members and friends to shun those with the disease.In Robert Goolrick's The Fall of Princes the 1980s are the backdrop for a lamentation of sorts, narrated by Rooney, who reached the highest of the highs as a trader for one of the elitest companies, only to plummet to the lowest of the lows a short while later. Rooney entered the Wall Street world as a young man somewhat confused about what direction his life would take, but once he realized the potential he had to make millions and millions of dollars, his ambition exploded, and he quickly became one of the most prolific young traders, earningand spendingan absolute fortune. He became known as one of the ""BSDs,"" or ""Big Swinging Dicks,"" the phrase somebody coined to describe this cocky band of brothers.""When you strike a match, it burns brighter in the first nanosecond than it will ever burn again. That first incandescence. That instantaneous and brilliant flash. 1980 was the year, and I was the match, and that was the year I struck into blinding flame.""The exhilaration that came with the power and privilege of the job brought with it access to women (and men), alcohol, drugs, cigars, and the finest in fashion, vacations, homes, and other luxuries. But as Rooney tells it, while it required a herculean amount of effort to make the money, it was far, far too easy to spend it, especially in their efforts to have the best of everything.The Fall of Princes traces Rooney's rise and fall, his friendships and romantic relationships, and the lives of those around him. You see the cocky, handsome, well-built, well-dressed specimen of a man he was, and the timid, regret-filled man he became, consumed with longing for the life he no longer had. Rooney takes you on a tour of a not-too-distant time, of trying to be the best and have it all, but realizing that all of the money in the world can't buy you love, or self-worth, or certainty of your place in the world.While Rooney and his friends are much like the characters in movies like The Wolf of Wall Street, I still found his character utterly fascinating, and I found this book to be compelling, heartfelt, and far deeper and more complex than I thought it would be. Goolrick, whose earlier novels like A Reliable Wife and Heading Out to Wonderful captured simpler times further back in history, is an excellent chronicler of place and time, and really captures the high and low points of 1980s culture and society, as well as how life feels when you're in your ascent, as well as once you've hit your lowest point.If you're fascinated by the culture of cocky excess that characterized the 1980s on Wall Street, or you like to see the conceited meet their downfall, you'll find The Fall of Princes a tremendously interesting book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOJR4NBCWBJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8CZNZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1YOJR4NBCWBJG","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The comedy world lost a real treasure when Joan Rivers died last fall. One of the hardest working women in show business, Rivers was unapologetically her own person, telling it like it is, but rarely with malicious intentions. She often said what everyone was thinking but would never say, and there were many instances where she was the only one who could get away with saying certain things about certain people.I had been a fan of Rivers' since the 1970s, when I used to watch her on The Tonight Show, and I listened to her comedy albums, watched her television specials and her talk show, and even loved catching her on QVC hawking her products. And of course, nothing beat watching her and Melissa on the red carpet at awards shows.Through all of her appearances and all of her insults, one thing about Rivers was ultimately clear: she loved her daughter Melissa more than anything, and their relationship was something she truly treasured. And the feeling was definitely mutual, as Melissa makes clear in her book, The Book of Joan: Tales of Mirth, Mischief, and Manipulation. This is a collection of essays that look at Joan's childhood, what motivated her to succeed, her habits, foibles, fears, and pet peeves, and especially her interactions with Melissa and her grandson, Cooper.This is a sweet, funny book that provides some interesting insight into Rivers' persona outside the spotlight, and it chronicles a mother-daughter bond that was truly special. I laughed from time to time (and tried not to do it out loud on the plane) and unsurprisingly, I even got choked up a little bit. It's a tremendously engaging book, but I wish that Melissa didn't try to be as funny as her mother throughout the book, as sometimes her jokes undercut the stories she was trying to tell. (She even provided her own rimshots occasionally.)If you were a fan of Joan Rivers, or of the pairing of Joan and Melissa, or you just enjoy reading stories about mothers and daughters, you may very well enjoy The Book of Joan. It made me miss Joan all over again, and I'm grateful to Melissa for sharing her mother with us for so long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HIWG406IHN62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1IFLRM#wasThisHelpful","R3HIWG406IHN62","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addiction is a powerful, dangerous force, one which often leads to tragic outcomes. And when children are raised by addict parents, the likelihood of their also falling prey to addiction, traveling down the same dangerous path as their parent(s), increases exponentially. It's a vicious and sad cycle.Kevin Jack McEnroe, the son of Tatum O'Neal and John McEnroe, tackles the effects of addiction on a family in his debut novel, Our Town, which he has said is a fictionalized account of his grandfather Ryan O'Neal's first wife, Joanna Moore, and another female relative.Joanna-Rae Cook lived an idyllic life in Americus, Georgia in the 1940s, the daughter of a scientist and his wife, when her entire family is killed in a car accident. When she was adopted by a doctor and his wife, she changed her name to Dorothy. ""Because she felt different here. Happier, somehow. And she thought it'd be nice, and fitting, to recognize that change. Starting over would be a theme in her life. She always felt she could be better than she was.""After winning the Miss Americus beauty pageant, she caught the eye of a talent agent and moved to Los Angeles. It is on the set of a television show that she meets Dale Kelly, a handsome young actor also making his debut. The two fall quickly and passionately in love, get married, and when Dorothy gets pregnant, she puts her acting career aside to raise their family. But as Dale's star slowly rises, the couple find themselves in the thrall of alcohol and drugs, especially when Dorothy tries to restart her career after giving birth twice. It isn't long before Dale's jealousy and anger turns to violence, and the two, constantly fighting addiction, divorce.Our Town follows Dorothy through her life as she struggles with trying to stay beautiful, trying to appeal to men, although she constantly seems to pick the wrong ones. She needs alcohol, cocaine, uppers, downers, and other drugs to make it through her days, keep her weight off, and soften the rough edges of her custody battles with Dale and her frustrations with her children, Clover and Dylan. As frustration turns to neglect, her treatment of her children scars them in countless ways.This is a tremendously bleak book which mirrors the real struggles of addictionglimmers of hope and recovery follows by long periods of decline and relapse. These characters are not likeable, but even as you are disgusted by their behaviors you see what fuels them. You know they are headed toward danger, and you are powerless to stop them; you can only hope they'll find their way before it's too late.The premise of this book is a powerful one, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me in the storytelling itself. McEnroe is a talented writer but his style is scattered, and it is difficult to follow the plot because he often alludes to or foreshadows events without them actually occurring. I found the book very slow moving, but I wanted to see how McEnroe would tie everything up, and the ending of the book definitely provokes emotions. I just wish the rest of the book did the same.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6Y58IUZ527S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUHJZU4#wasThisHelpful","RP6Y58IUZ527S","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.The grief of losing a child is said to be one of the most painful and devastating, particularly when the child is an infant. My brother died of SIDS when he was six weeks old about 31 years ago, and I remember how debilitating that loss was for our entire family, particularly my parents, and that grief still resonates for my mother all these years later.Sarah Shaw isn't sure she wants to recover after the accidental death of her infant daughter. But everyone tells her she needs to pull herself together and start living life again, especially to bring some normalcy back into the lives of her two young sons. Everyone, including her husband, watches her cautiously, expecting her to fall apart again. But it isn't too long before her husband gets caught up in the demands of work, leaving her to take care of their sons, despite that she is afraid something might go unexpectedly wrong at every turn.One day she sees a young homeless woman pushing her baby in a stroller, and it taps into emotions Sarah thought she had dammed up. She pursues the woman, Josie, trying to help her, but Josie is wary of this woman suddenly wanting to help. Eventually, the two form an unlikely relationship of sorts, with Sarah determined to save Josie and her daughter. But Sarah doesn't understand the extent to which her help is needed, and she doesn't anticipate the toll this relationship will take on her own life, her marriage, and her psyche. All she knows is that saving Josie is key to saving herself.How far would you go to help a stranger in need? What would you sacrifice for this help? Shelter Us attempts to answer those questions, filtered through a woman at the end of her emotional rope. But this type of behavior, obsessing over one problem because you can't control another, is far too common, and this book does an excellent job at exploring how a person can lose sight of what they're doing when lost in their own emotional issues.This book is sad and hopeful, and Laura Nicole Diamond does a terrific job creating a situation that seems all too real and all too believable. The reader knows what Sarah is doing is out of control, but you understand why she is doing it. This is Diamond's debut novel, and she definitely proves that she is a writer worth watching in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PTZ4P80RXMVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDYF4OI#wasThisHelpful","R3PTZ4P80RXMVL","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.""Some people choose a profession. For others, there is a calling. Of course, I had never questioned what I did. I was born to it. I loved it.""Jack was a journalist for the New York Times, but that's not the profession he's speaking of. Instead, he's referring to his ""second,"" more profitable jobas a hit man for the Russian mob.In Steven Rappaport's If Jack Had, his now-elderly protagonist, whose body and mind are in the midst of daily decline, looks back on his rich, full life. He had a beautiful, devoted wife who was always the love of his life, four children of whom he is proud, wonderful grandchildren. But it is his many years as a hired gun for a Russian mobster and his family that he thinks about most. But make no mistake: these aren't the regrets of a dying man, more the marveling of a life well lived, even if at times it was a bit more exciting than he'd have liked.This book is a rollicking ride through Jack's life, from being shuttled between two parents who wanted little to do with their child to finding nurturing love from his stepmother, how he pursued his ""freelance"" career, and some of his most notable assignments. It's also tremendously reflective, a man looking back at his legacy, so to speak, and the few times he actually struggled with what he did. Sure, this is a story of a cold-blooded killer, but it's also the story of a flawed man with a tremendous capacity for love and a tremendous need to be loved. Jack is definitely a colorful, complex, multidimensional character.If Jack Had is a breezy, fun read. Sometimes it spent a little too much time dwelling on his father's behavior, but it is understandable given the effect his parents' behavior had on his life. And when I read that Rappaport wrote this book to create a life for his son, who died suddenly at at age 40 from an unknown neurological disorder, the book took on a little more gravitas. Definitely a fun one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BXVU0OVICV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612964915#wasThisHelpful","R27BXVU0OVICV0","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in exchange for an unbiased review.""I'm thirty-two and I'm barely responsible for myself. I spend all my disposable income on cigarettes and beer.""C.J. Neubauer isn't exactly living the dream. A writer who can't seem to get his big break, he works in a coffee shop while mostly living off his sort-of girlfriend, with whom he has a relationship which is more antagonistic than anything else. After college, he fled across the country to get away from his family, and apart from sporadic visits home (which never quite seem to go very well), he rarely speaks to his parents or his siblings.Needless to say, it's a little surprising when late one night C.J. gets a call from his father, who seems more interested in his life than he has been recently. Even more surprisingly, his father ends the call by saying, ""I love you,"" and it so catches C.J. off guard that he figures he'll reciprocate when he's home for his older brother's wedding in a few months. But the next morning, C.J. finds out that his father committed suicide, leaving a note that read, ""Sorry I wasn't what you needed,"" although no one is quite sure to whom the note was directed.So C.J. heads home sooner than he expected, and he isn't home long before nearly everyone is ready to kill him, and the old resentments and wounds quickly surface. As he and his siblings try to figure out what might have prompted their father to take his own life, they each fall into familiar behavioral patterns. But having been out of the familial loop, C.J. is surprised to see how much his mother's drinking has increased, and how troubled her relationship has become with her second husband.""He wasn't the kind of man you appreciate when you have the chance,"" C.J.'s mother said of his father. And C.J. realizes that there was far more to his father than he realized: he touched more lives, felt more deeply, and cared more about his children than C.J. knew. As he tries to figure out what to do with his life, he can't decide whether going home to his combative relationship is more palatable than staying near his family.While comparisons to Jonathan Tropper's This Is Where I Leave You are inevitable, Sorry I Wasn't What You Needed is a different book and it deserves to stand on its own. While James Bailey certainly treads into Tropper-esque territory, there is more poignancy than humor in this book (although the characters do have some zany shenanigans), and this is a family with more than its share of flaws and issues. The characters aren't necessarily likable but you can see how many of them wound up the way they are, and C.J. is so messed up I kept forgetting he was only 32.I always love books about family dynamics if for no other reason than they help me keep the craziness of my own family in perspective. But while Bailey's book might not break any new ground, Sorry I Wasn't What You Needed is a well-told, compelling look at the way family ties can sometimes pull and sometimes comfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DPW229SX4V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH72IMG#wasThisHelpful","R17DPW229SX4V8","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Sadly, war has nearly always been a part of our collective understanding, no matter what generation you are from. So much has been written about the cost of war, and the impact it has on those on the front lines. Jesse Goolsby's powerful, brutal new book, I'd Walk with My Friends If I Could Find Them, takes this one step further, looking at war's impact not only on those who serve, but on those they leave behind, and those they interact with after their service has ended.Wintric Ellis is a young man from a small town in California who decides to join the army directly after his high school graduation, if for no other reason than to provide him direction and give him an opportunity to see life beyond his small town. He leaves behind his girlfriend, Kristen, and winds up in Afghanistan. While he considers himself fortunate not to be in the middle of the deadly fighting in Iraq, the placidity of Afghanistan does little to quell his fears that the enemy is just around the corner, that every step or every encounter could mean peril. But he gets taken under the wing of two more experienced soldiers, Torres and Dax, and their friendship helps make the fearful days less so.One day, the soldiers are forced to act in a split second, essentially making the choice between life and death. And that decision, made in the heat of the moment, is one that will affect each of their post-war lives and impact their relationships with others, and set each of them on a tremendously challenging path. And after his friends are decommissioned, Wintric faces a shocking incident of violence that further affects him.I'd Walk with My Friends If I Could Find Them is essentially told in snapshots, looking at the early lives of Wintric, Dax, and Torres, and how they wound up in Afghanistan, and how their lives unfolded after they left the military. The book looked at their relationships with family, loved ones, friends, children, and the demons that haunted each of them, many of which formed in that one moment in Afghanistan. The struggles are moving, at times brutal, and tremendously poignant, when you realize that many who have served our country deal with similar issues.Goolsby is an absolutely talented writer, and his use of language and imagery is tremendously poetic. The characters are tremendously complex (although not always likeable) and you can feel for them and their struggles. My challenge with the book, however, is that in his vignette-like approach, Goolsby often doesn't paint the full picture of what happens to the characters, leaving you with more questions than answers. This was the case with several key incidents in the bookhe is oblique rather than direct, and I had to re-read parts of the book a few times, and still didn't always come away with the answers I was seeking.There have been many fine books written about the scars of war, both physical and emotional, and I'd Walk with My Friends If I Could Find Them deserves to stand alongside them. I look forward to seeing what's next in Goolsby's career, because his talent is tremendous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZBB8VIGKX00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZ7GSWQ#wasThisHelpful","R33ZBB8VIGKX00","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.When you get to a certain age (and that age differs from person to person), many people find themselves thinking about the path their lives have taken, and wondering what might have been, if things might have gone differently. I'd imagine those thoughts can be more intense for people who once had a taste of fame, as they look back on their time in the spotlight and wish it had ended differently.Thirty-eight-year-old Teddy Tremble is an attorney, but that hasn't always been his chosen vocation. For a few magical years, he was the lead singer of Tremble, a band that had one fairly well-known hit, won an Oscar, and even had their music appear in movies. Tremble was a fairly talented group of musicians, but their second album wasn't a critical or commercial success and the decision (Teddy's) to headline their own tour instead of opening for a more popular group was more hubris than anything else.Then their label dropped them, the spotlight faded, his marriage broke up, and his fellow band members got on with their lives. A law career isn't quite how he dreamed his life would unfold, but it passes the time and pays the bills, and his relationship with Sara, an interior designer who has seen more than her share of anguish, is satisfying, although he's never quite sure where they stand with each other. And then one night while heading on a trip to Ireland to take a deposition, a random message from Tremble's former drummer sends Teddy on a journey that hits him both physically and emotionally, and inspires him to start writing songs again.But once he writes a few songs with some potential, does he really want to try again? Can he convince his old band to get back together for another try, even though they've built totally different lives, and in some cases, there are issues between them? And is the vastly different musical world ready for the return of a one-hit-wonder band? Can a group of musicians pushing 40 still find a place? And does Teddy really want a second chance after all?Even though we've seen this type of story before, I thoroughly enjoyed Thank You, Goodnight. It was a fun and compelling read, filled with endearing characters who transcend the typical stereotypes of aging musicians. I was really impressed with Andy Abramowitz' storytelling, especially given that this is his first novel, and you could tell he really cared about his characters. This is also a bit of a tribute to the power of musichow it can make us feel, and how it can bring back memories of certain people, places, and times in our lives.Give this one a shot. You'll have a lot of fun, and you'll probably want to listen to some music afterward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVEER18AVNMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WWBO#wasThisHelpful","R1XVEER18AVNMO","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. I cannot even begin to put into words how much I freaking loved this book, but I will attempt to. Sappy heart, be still!Simon Spier is a friendly, slightly goofy high school junior. He knows he's gay, and doesn't think that either his family or his friends will have a problem with it, but he just doesn't want to make a big deal out of it, you know? But when he starts corresponding via email with a fellow gay student he only knows as ""Blue,"" he starts to think more and more about letting everyone in on his secret, almost as much as he thinks about Blue, whom he's falling for, as much as anyone can for someone they've never met.But when their email correspondence falls into the wrong hands, Simon is pressed into action. He needs to decide what to doabout coming out to his family and friends, and whether or not to continue to press Blue for the chance to meet each other. And all of Simon's decisions have the potential for disaster. What's a music-loving, Oreo-craving guy to do?""It's strange, because in reality, I'm not the leading guy. Maybe I'm the best friend. I guess I didn't really think of myself as interesting until I was interesting to Blue. So I can't tell him. I'd rather not lose him.""Becky Albertalli's debut novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda is beyond wonderful. I absolutely devoured this book in less than a day and now I'm sad that it's finished, because I want to spend more time with these characters. Unlike so many other young adult novels, I didn't feel like the dialogue was inauthentic or too clever for its own good, and I felt like most of the situations the characters found themselves in were realistic, even the negative ones. But beyond that, Albertalli all too perfectly captures the intense feelings of infatuation and indecision, the desire to share the real you with the world but the fear of actually putting it out there.I've said many times before, I wish that books like this existed when I was in high school, but I am so glad that these books exist now. Everyone should know it's okay to have secrets that you divulge when you're ready to, and that you can never assume to know what another person is going through. I cannot wait to see what Albertalli does next, and I miss these characters already!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P7QDYMVK473P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSRXJKC#wasThisHelpful","R3P7QDYMVK473P","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So if you're averse to getting all choked up when reading a novel, even perhaps crying your eyes out at least a little bit, this is not a book for you. But it's one you shouldn't miss.Claire has always been a free spirit, practically from the day she was born. She raised her older daughter Caitlin practically on her own, excelled in her career, and never expected to find love until Greg, a contractor, came to do some work on her house. But she was utterly smitten, and it wasn't long before the two had a child of their own, outspoken, three-year-old Esther.It seemed the perfect life, at least until Claire was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease. And while at first Claire felt things slipping away gradually, her decline becomes more rapid than anyone expected. Suddenly her mother has moved in to help care for Claire, she's not allowed to leave the house on her own or do much of anything she wants to, and much to everyone's chagrin, she doesn't feel comfortable around Greg anymore, even though she knows she is supposed to love him and that they had built a life together.As Claire's condition further deteriorates, she discovers that 20-year-old Caitlin has secrets of her own, although they are no match for Claire's own secret involving Caitlin. And when Claire has a chance meeting with a handsome man in a caf, it causes her to experience feelings she didn't think she ever would again, feelings she wants to hold onto as long as she can.The Day We Met is a tremendously poignant and moving account of one woman's fight to hold on to her life and her memories as long as she can, and her struggles not to disappoint those around her. It's also the story of how her illness affects those she holds most dear, the wounds her condition causes, and how you can continue to be courageous in the face of bleakness. But more than that, this is a beautiful story of love, both between people and simply the need to find and hold on to it as long as you can.While comparisons to Lisa Genova's Still Alice are certainly inevitable, and both books left me an emotional mess, what sets the two books apart is this is a more purely emotional account, without the clinical aspects of Genova's book. Claire is a much less passive character than Alice was further into her diagnosis. And I felt this book was much more willing to paint Claire as not entirely sympatheticeven though her condition was causing her to act a certain way, you didn't need to like everything she said or did.Rowan Coleman has written a book to savor and think about, and one to cherish, as it is as lovely as it is sad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32FRMSMHSIO20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD2GK#wasThisHelpful","R32FRMSMHSIO20","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know how much I love a book when I can't stop myself from devouring it in practically one sitting, although I want to savor it at the same time. And boy, did I love this one.The eight stories in Einstein's Beach House are slightly quirky (but not distractingly so), somewhat moving and each at least a little bit humorous, and extremely memorable. Jacob Appel does such a great job developing his characters and the plot of each story, I honestly could see many of them developed into a full-length novel, and I'd definitely want to read those books, since I wanted more of the characters.It honestly is hard to pick favorites, since each story was just so good, but the few that I can't stop thinking about right now are: ""Paracosmos,"" in which a married couple is worried that their daughter is obsessed with her imaginary friendand then the girl's father shows up; ""La Tristesse Des Herissons,"" which tells the story of a couple whose relationship hits a bit of a snag when they adopt a depressed hedgehog; ""Limerence,"" in which a man looks back on his crush on his much more worldly next-door neighbor; ""The Rod of Asclepius,"" which tells the story of a young girl caught up in her father's acts of revenge; and the title story, in which a family tries to make hay of a typo in a travel guide, only to have the tables turned on them.I had never heard of Jacob Appel until two friends on Goodreads raved about his writing, and this story collection in particular. They couldn't have been more on target. He is such an engaging writer, and even though the subject matter of these stories isn't quite your everyday stuff, the stories are tremendously human (and often humane), and really pack both a literary and an emotional punch. I'll definitely be picking up some of Appel's other books, but in the meantime, I highly recommend you pick this collection up. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RU4DJG1OBUM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXZHD2A#wasThisHelpful","R2RU4DJG1OBUM7","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmm. This book was definitely intriguing.Peggy Jackson grew up in Virginia in the 1960s, a girl of some means raised by parents with more of an eye on social niceties and appropriateness than actual parenting, especially when she realizes she is a lesbian. She convinces them to send her to Stillwater College, a small, all-girls school, where she can pursue her dreams of literary success, and perhaps find a girlfriend. They are none too happy to send her away.But it isn't long before she winds up under the spell of Lee Fleming, Stillwater's resident poet, whose wealthy family allows him to indulge his profligate lifestyle and invite poets from across the country to share their talents, not to mention share their drugs and alcohol. Despite one major complicationLee is gay and Peggy is a lesbianthe two begin an affair, which quickly leaves 18-year-old Peggy pregnant and forced to withdraw from school.Peggy is unprepared for marriage and motherhood, despite the fact that she loves her son and daughter. But her jealousy at Lee's serial infidelity and his unwillingness to help her advance her literary career leaves her angry and depressed. An impulsive act has Lee threatening to commit Peggy to a psychiatric institution, so with no other choice, she runs away with her three-year-old daughter in tow, leaving her nine-year-old son Byrdie behind with Lee.Determined to live a life outside the margins, Peggy (now Meg) and her daughter Karen squat in an abandoned shack in the midst of an African-American settlement, and she adopts African-American personae for both of them (despite their outward appearances). They live in near-abject poverty, supplemented by Meg's odd jobs (including aiding a drug dealer), but eventually the two move into a housing project, where Karen can be closer to her best friend, Temple, whose intellect and potential far outweighs those around him, and this helps propel Karen forward as well, despite that she is younger than Meg has led everyone to believe.Years later, Temple and Karen wind up as students at the University of Virginia (Karen on a minority scholarship), and it is there the two encounter Byrdie, now a senior, happy to be living a life away from his father's emotional complexity. The lives of the three intersect one Halloween night, the implications of which not only threaten to unravel each of their academic lives, but the lies that have been told for years prior.I thought the concept of this book was really fascinating, and Nell Zink is a very good storyteller with a knack for language and dialogue. However, I felt more often than not, this book was satirical when I expected it to be serious, and chose a heavier hand when dealing with more farcical material. I think it wanted to be a commentary on the heavy weights of racial and sexual prejudice, social mores, and the damages that family can cause, but often it got mired in more exposition than it needed, and I felt the ending was a little too pat for a book that was really unique in most other ways.If you enjoy social satire, this may be your cup of tea. Zink's writing is crisp and her ideas are really creative, but for me, Mislaid, well, missed the mark.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1VEIW5GKM0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O11HCM8#wasThisHelpful","R3A1VEIW5GKM0H","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa Williamson's The Art of Being Normal is a moving, well-written reminder of how brutal, yet how beautiful, the world can be to those who are different.David Piper has really never fit in. Apart from his two best friends, most of his fellow high school students ridicule him for being different. One of the school bullies has called him ""Freak Show"" since they were younger, but David is willing to wait him out until high school ends. His parents think he is gay, and are waiting for him to tell them.What David wants, more than anything, is to be a girl. But as he grows taller and more like his father, he wonders if this will ever be a possibility.Leo Denton is the new kid in David's high school, coming from a poorer area to the more posh private school. Overly exaggerated tales of his exploits at his last high school follow him, but he lets people say what they want about him. Yet while he wants to remain under the radar, two events occur which ensure that wish isn't granted: he stands up for David when he is being bullied, and then he falls for one of the most beautiful and talented girls in school. It's not long before secrets he hoped wouldn't be exposed come to light.I felt The Art of Being Normal so accurately captured the feelings one experiences when you are different, when you are bullied, and how you just wish you could hide to avoid the ridicule and abuse. Williamson created such complex characters that you feel for and root for, characters you think about after the book is over. Even if once the story hits its stride you have a feeling how the plot will unfold, you're completely drawn into the characters' lives and you want to know what is going to happen.Like so many YA books out there these days, this type of book didn't exist when I was growing up. I'm so glad that it exists now, however, and hope that people read it, are moved by it, and perhaps convinced to change their behavior, to understand that their definition of ""normal"" isn't everyone's.

"Relationships. Can't live without 'em, can't, well...The summer of Sam Turner's 15th year was an eventful one. Spending time with his group of childhood friends, he suddenly catches the interest of Suzie Epstein, and they begin a romantic relationship that they keep hidden from their friends, even though the hookups of others are known among them. But as quickly as it begins, their relationship ends when Suzie's estranged parents decide to give their marriage another try and move the family to another city. And then Sam suffers another blow, when his mother decides to leave his husband and move away.In the wake of Suzie's abrupt departure and the dissolution of his family, Sam finds himself drawn into a relationship with Suzie's best friend, Bella. Their relationship continues into college, but while Sam feels strongly for Bella, he can't seem to give her the full commitment she desiresand he can't seem to give that commitment to anything in his life, which also causes trouble in his relationships with his father and older brother. He finds himself drifting, from job to job, relationship to relationship, without feeling any pull to put down roots.Suzie left her old life and her old friends behind, mostly out of embarrassment for the way her parents' marriage affected the lives of so many. She becomes the caretaker for her younger brothers and her alcoholic mother, and works hard to graduate high school one year early, so she can start anew. And she never thinks she'll be able to have a relationship that isn't dysfunctional, until, surprisingly, she connects with Sam's older brother Michael.The Grown Ups follows Sam, Bella, and Suzie over a decade, as they weather romantic, professional, and familial crises. Robin Antalek does a terrific job weaving their stories, and even though her characters aren't completely likeable, their lives are tremendously compelling. Even though what happens in this book is more commonplace than unique, I still really enjoyed this book, and found it emotionally provoking at times as well. This is a book about all types of relationshipsromantic ones, parent-child, siblings, and of course, friendshipsand at least one of the relationships in the book may seem familiar to you.""She could feel the world that Mindy was talking about pressing in on all sides, and then the crazy crooked line that ran from her mother to Sam.

"I remember the beating of Rodney King, but what I remember more than that was the outrage and violence which exploded in Los Angeles in April of 1992, when three of the four white policemen accused of the beating were completely acquitted, while no verdict was reached on the fourth. It was utterly surreal to be living in Washington, DC, watching the rioting, looting, destruction, and violence that followed, a feeling I'd never thought I'd have again, yet I felt similarly a few weeks ago when similar incidents occurred in Baltimore.Over a six-day period in 1992, 53 people were killed in the riots. But what few really understood was the violence that occurred outside the immediate epicenter of the riots, as Los Angeles-area gang members used the incidents as camouflage for their own activities, settling old scores with rival gangs jockeying for control, and taking whatever they could, by whatever means necessary. Ryan Gattis' magnificent, powerful All Involved is a fictionalized account of gang members and others caught up in the violence on the fringes of the riots, and how righting alleged wrongs and working to save face proved dangerous and often deadly.Ernesto Vera works on a taco truck, but he has dreams of becoming a chef, and wants to get an apprenticeship at an exclusive Japanese restaurant so he can learn from the masters. Sent home early by a boss worried about the rioting, he is nearly home when he encounters a group of gang members looking to settle a score with his younger brother. This clash sets up a series of confrontations that affect a number of lives, including nurses, firemen, and students utterly unprepared for what is coming down the pike, both good and bad.""There's a truth in that somewhere and maybe it's thisthere's a hidden America inside the one we portray to the world, and only a small group of people ever actually see it. Some of us are locked into it by birth or geography, but the rest of us just work here. Doctors, nurses, firemen, copswe know it. We see it. We negotiate with death where we work because that's just part of the job. We see its layers, its unfairness, its unavoidability. Still, we fight that losing battle. We try to maneuver around it, even occasionally even steal from it. And when you come across somebody else who seems to know it like you do, well, you can't help but stop and wonder what it'd be like to be with someone who can empathize.""Gattis tells 17 interconnected stories, imbuing his characters with life, emotion, and complexity, and he manages to make many of them characters you root for despite what they're doing. It's a talented author who makes you care about those who kill, injure, steal, and destroy, yet he doesn't paint over their flaws either. As you might imagine, some of the chapters are more interesting than othersI honestly would have been happy if the book had remained focused on the rival gangs and those caught up in their activities; I felt the book lost a bit of steam when it turned to other characters with only a slight connection.Gattis' storytelling is gritty, violent, poetic, and powerful, and I was utterly hooked for the majority of the book. We hear all too often about the human toll that violence takes, but All Involved brings that home without being overly preachy. It's an unflinching look at a not-too-far-distant time in our society that sadly, we're not completely past yet. If you're a crime novel fan, this is definitely one to read and savor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKHS9PWYGHAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZXMQ6C#wasThisHelpful","R3DKHS9PWYGHAV","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.One night in 2007, Benjamin Mandelbaum's wife throws him out of the house and declares their marriage over. The sad thing is, this time he's actually innocent of the infidelity she's accusing him of, but she doesn't care.With nowhere else to go, he decides to take their dog and move back into his childhood home in Connecticut, to live with his widowed father, Leonard. He's unsure of what his next steps will be, how his children will handle the divorce, and whether he really wants to start sleeping in his old bedroom again, especially as his father embarks upon a relationship (of sorts) with an old friend.And then one day Benjamin finds out his old high school crush, Audrey Martin, has moved back into the neighborhood along with her lawyer husband and their troubled teenage daughter. Audrey isn't sure if she even remembers Benjamin from high school, but he remembers her all too well, and it's not long before a lonely Audrey allows him the chance to act upon his teenage desires. Yet even as he gets totally caught up in Audrey, he still longs for the comfort and security of his marriage, and misses his estranged wife.Audrey has her share of issues as wellan emotional secret she's not comfortable sharing with Benjamin; worries about Emily, whose behavior is becoming increasingly erratic; and her strained relationship with her husband, Andrew, a powerful attorney who finds himself caught up in a power struggle in his office, the likes of which he'd never imagined, and one he might not win, which is quite a change for someone who hates to lose.All of their lives come to a crucial moment one night, a moment which will change each of them. Housebreaking is quite well written and though perhaps slightly melodramatic in places, really compelling. It's a book about marital discord, about unhappiness and grief, which reminded me a little bit of The Ice Storm. It's also a story about trying to control what happens in your life, despite the fact that you have no control over these things whatsoever.I've never read anything by Dan Pope before, but I was really impressed with his storytelling ability. Although you've seen many of the situations in this book before, somehow in his hands, it seems like a fresh story, and I flew through the book rather quickly. I don't know what it says about me that I find stories of dysfunctional relationships entertaining, but I do know this probably would make a good movie as well.If suburban melodrama (and I mean that in a positive way) interests you, Dan Pope's Housebreaking is a fine example worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66AF9X7KLIGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476745900#wasThisHelpful","R66AF9X7KLIGP","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Oliver Pleasant is a renowned jazz pianist who has been playing music since the 1930s. He has played with all of the greats, traveled the world, and made a bit of a name for himself among those in the know. Now in his 80s, he is ready to retire, so he plans to play five farewell shows at a New York City club before leaving his home in New York and moving to Memphis. He hopes that his estranged children will attend one of his shows.""Oliver sees himself as a carpenter, a craftsman putting notes and melodies together, fitting them when they will, stepping back to rest and reconsider when they won't.""Frank Severs is a newspaper reporter from Memphis, recently laid off from his longtime job, and trying to figure out what is next, both career-wise and in his relationship with his wife. He decides to write a story about Oliver's retirement and pitch it to a number of different publications, so against his wife's wishes, Frank goes to New York to see Oliver play, and hopefully get the opportunity to interview him.Agnes Cassady is a tremendously talented musician in her own right, stricken by a progressively degenerative disease which is slowly robbing her of her ability to play the piano, and she expects it will cut short her life as well. In New York for one final round of tests to see if anything can be done, she's debating whether she should take control of her death as the disease is taking control of her life. But she cannot resist the opportunity to hear Oliver play for one of the last times in his career.In Richard J. Alley's fantastic Five Night Stand, Oliver, Frank, and Agnes' lives intersect, each leaving an indelible impact on the others. This is a story about the heydays of jazz and a young man discovering his talent and the fire to make music. It's also the story of life's triumphs and regrets, the secrets we keep and the hurts we nurse, the hopes we cherish and the hearts we gravitate toward. Above all, it's the story of connection, and how the act of telling one's story can change your life.While the book took a little time to gain steam, Alley is a fantastic writer, and his use of language is so poetic, it's almost musical in its own right. These characters are complex, not always completely likeable, but utterly fascinating and compelling. Five Night Stand is an emotional, enjoyable book, about life, love, and music, one that will make you want to listen to jazz and follow your passions. I'm so glad I found this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15AOYQO463DUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUD0O00#wasThisHelpful","R15AOYQO463DUX","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I love so much about reading short stories is stumbling upon story concepts and characters I haven't seen before, and of course, finding beautiful writing. Both were on display in Monica McFawn's collection Bright Shards of Someplace Else.The characters that populate McFawn's stories are all differenta nanny and her precocious charge, a boss tasked with firing a problem employee, a pompous scientist and the art critic that comes into his circle, a pair of horse trainers and vetsbut there is such heart at the core of each of the stories. And each story chronicles a need of some sortsome far more obsessive than others.My two favorite stories bookend the collection. The first, ""Out of the Mouths of Babes,"" follows a nanny who finds her new charge has a remarkable facility with making phone calls, so she tasks him with helping her solve a few problems. The final story in the collection, ""The Chautauqua Sessions,"" chronicles an aging lyricist whose reunion with his former musical partner is waylaid by his drug addict son, and the lengths he goes to keep his son from affecting his inspiration. A few other stories I enjoyed included: ""The Slide Turned on End,"" which follows a pompous scientist inspired by the intersection of art and science, and the art critic who becomes a somewhat unwilling participant in his work; ""Line of Questioning,"" in which a poetry professor is questioned by police about his relationship with a former student; and ""Key Phrases,"" which follows a fairly new supervisor at a company who is tasked with firing a problem employee.McFawn, who won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction, is a truly gifted writer. There were times, honestly, where her use of language and imagery actually hooked me more than the story's plot itself. Here is one example, from ""Line of Questioning"":  ""Theirs was a comfortable relationship of light mutual contempt that drummed on them bracingly like a light rain when they were together. The old demons of their relationship were soggy but still smelled alluringly like hellfire.""This collection was a bit more cerebral at times than I'm used to with short stories, so I didn't always warm to the plot or the characters.

"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Sam and Danny Goldstein are identical twins. Sam is the confident oneathletic, popular, and tremendously protective of his brother. Danny is more than content to live in Sam's shadow, sharing his friends, and knowing that the two share an inseparable bond. Sam is always looking out for Danny, and plans an elaborate scheme for Danny to finally come out to their parents.In an instant, everything changes, and the world and the life that Danny has known and depended on is totally turned upside down. He finds himself in a new school, living in a new house, and realizing that the reason he was always to content to live in Sam's shadow is that he's not comfortable standing out or being noticed. He isn't really sure who he is, and he doesn't know if he's all that interested in finding out the answer to that question. But what he does know is that he's tired of people telling him how he should feel, or what he should do, and he's tired of being angry and sad all the time.""All of my life, I had always felt like I was watching other people's lives instead of being part of my own.""When Danny meets Cher, a larger-than-life fellow classmate who has always been dying for a gay best friend, she starts to force him out of his shell, little by little, even if he's still not quite comfortable talking about himself or knowing how to be a good friend. And then he meets Rusty, a boy who appears fearless, who helps Danny discover who he is, and what his heart wants. All the while, Danny's journey is helped, and at times complicated, by his former punk rocker parents and his mother's lifelong best friend Alex, an author whose most famous book was a way for him to deal with the isolation he felt about being gay.I've said this before, but I wish books like The Before Now and After Then existed when I was a teenager, if only to help me convince that I wasn't alone, that life beyond the angst and anger and bullying of high school could and would dissolve into something better. This is a sweet, funny, emotional book, and Peter Monn does an excellent job making you care about his characters and what happens to them. The book is a little overly dramatic at times, and Danny in particular isn't always the most likeable person, but I kept thinking of him as if he were real, saying, ""Well, he's been through a lot...""Books like this give me hope, and I hope they bring those same feelings to others who are lucky enough to find it. I look forward to reading more from Monn in the future.""I realized that time kept ticking whether we liked it or not. Life kept happening. And sometimes things weren't measured in time. Sometimes, hours, weeks, and even years went by without us even noticing. Sometimes people died and sometimes people left, but not always. Sometimes they stayed.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAWL7DUZTI3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8B6XLE#wasThisHelpful","R3AAWL7DUZTI3Z","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.When they met, Hannah and Lovell couldn't have been more different. Hannah was the impulsive free spirit, a young woman raised in the midst of privilege yet taught by her mother that women should never be subservient to menand she had a broken engagement to prove her mother's lessons had sunk in. Lovell was the practical, stable, shy climate scientist, whose romantic track record was far less impressive. But when Hannah delivered flowers to Lovell one day after he graduated, he was smitten, and knew he had to be with this woman, despite the fact he didn't feel like her equal.Years later the two have built a life together, raising two childrenrebellious yet sensitive Janine, and Ethan, shyer yet sturdier. Lovell has a successful career that keeps him busy and challenged, but Hannah feels herself drifting, wishing for more. Through the years, the resentments, the anger, the frustrations, and the hurts have multiplied and simmered just under the surface.One night, after a seemingly innocuous exchange, it all comes to a head, and the couple have a bitter argument, one that just stops short of turning violent. Both are unsure what their next steps are, but Lovell hopes they can get back on even footing. Then the next day, Hannah disappears after dropping Ethan off at school and calling in sick to work. As evidence dribbles in, Lovell and the children hold out hope that she will return, but they also must negotiate a new stage in their relationships, especially when Janine fears her father may have harmed her mother.The Daylight Marriage is a bleak yet well-written book about how the things we don't say hurt as much, if not more, than the things we do. It's a book about how we sometimes confuse stability for happiness, and uncertainty for unhappiness. It's also a book about how one impulsive decision can change your lifein both good and bad ways.Heidi Pitlor does a really good job at switching perspectives between Lovell and Hannah, past and present, tracing their relationship from the start to where they wound up. The story also shifts between Lovell's attempts to pull his and the children's lives together, and Hannah's steps after she left home that morning. It's a well done yet painful story, and Pitlor's storytelling ability keeps you fully engaged and immersed in the characters' lives, even if you don't necessarily like them very much, or know who you're really rooting for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12T9573DT4YH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLR6GI4#wasThisHelpful","R12T9573DT4YH9","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Nickolas Butler's Shotgun Lovesongs made my list of the best books I read last year. He imbued his characters with emotion, complexity, and an amazing sense of place. I absolutely loved the way he told a story. So needless to say, when I saw he had a short story collection coming out later this year, I jumped on it as quickly as I possibly could. And the good news? Beneath the Bonfire is just about as good as Butler's first book, and his writing is still pretty fantastic.The characters in Butler's 10 stories are all struggling in one way or another. They're struggling to find or keep love; they're struggling with the circumstances they've found themselves caught up in; they're struggling with family, friends, emotions, illness, even loneliness. These are stories which will make you feel, make you think, make you laugh, and perhaps even make you cry. (Or maybe that's just because I'm a sap.)I honestly loved 9 of the 10 stories, and would love to read a full-length novel with the characters from many of them. There's the man struggling to keep his unexpected family intact despite the emotional instability of his girlfriend in ""Train People Move Slow""; the story of childhood friends living very different lives in ""Morels""; the policewoman fighting demons both real and unreal in ""In Western Counties""; the grandfather wondering if he might need to be a parent again in ""Rainwater""; and the beautiful poignancy, restlessness, and desperation described in both ""The Chainsaw Soire"" and the fantastic title story.This collection reinforces my belief that Butler is a writer to be reckoned with. If there's a downside to reading this collection a few months before it is to be released, it's that I'll have to wait even longer for his next book. But don't you waitread Shotgun Lovesongs, and then wait for Beneath the Bonfire. Hopefully you'll be as blown away, and as touched, as I have been.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PI8QLKWS6Z07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFID776#wasThisHelpful","R1PI8QLKWS6Z07","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Driving through a neighborhood, looking at the houses you pass by, do you ever stop and wonder about the lives of those who live there? Looking from the outside in, we never know about the problems people face, whether their lives are mundane or full of excitement and tension, what their desires and regrets are, and what drives them forward.Lauren Acampora's intriguing, well-written collection of linked stories, The Wonder Garden, strives to give us insight into the lives of strangers, as she focuses on the residents of Old Cranbury, a well-heeled suburb not far from Manhattan. From John, the home inspector whose intense attention to detail in his professional life hasn't seemed to translate into his personal life; to Madeleine, whose life is upended when her husband leaves his corporate advertising job to pursue a career as a healer; from Harold, whose fascination with the brain veers into bizarre territory after he forms an alliance of sorts with a surgeon; to Camille, whose frustration with motherhood and life after divorce fuels her desire for a life elsewhere, these stories chronicle hope and disillusionment, happiness and hurt, desires realized and desires thwarted.Acampora does an excellent job creating a sense of a community, and although it's difficult at first to remember which characters were which as they showed up in future stories, once I did, I enjoyed catching another glimpse of them through the lens of another character or situation. Some of the characters are tremendously flawed, some of them are simply caught up in an unexpected or strange situation, and some are just trying to go about their daily lives.Among my favorite stories in the collection were: ""Ground Fault,"" which followed a home inspector whose personal life is more in disarray than his professional one, but some spillage is inevitable; ""Floortime,"" about a woman struggling to reach her autistic son and willing to consider any means to do so; ""Elevations,"" about a couple struggling with the separate needs of each person; ""The Umbrella Bird,"" which chronicles a woman who must reconcile a drastic change in her husband; and ""Moon Roof,"" in which a woman's inability to move into traffic underscores issues in the rest of her life.I really enjoyed this collection and think Acampora is a terrific writer. A few of the stories didn't work for me, either because I found the main character so unlikeable or because I found the premise of the story less interesting, but on the whole this is a really strong collection, and definitely signals the arrival of a fantastic new talent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQVZ2D3DM9RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123554#wasThisHelpful","R3NQVZ2D3DM9RE","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I started reading Adam Rapp's Know Your Beholder I expected it to be a vaguely hipster-ish lament about a musician with slacker tendencies. Having never before read anything that Rapp has written, I was honestly surprised at the complexity of the characters, the humor, and the emotions this book contained. And for me, there are few things better than a book that pleasantly surprises you and surpasses your expectations.Francis Falbo is in his mid-30s, a former musician living in the small town of Pollard, Illinois. He's struggling quite a bithe's still mourning over the end of his marriage (despite the fact that his wife has moved on and gotten remarried), the death of his mother, and the end of his band. Winter seems endless, he has been stranded in his apartment for a while now, and he's taken to growing a colossal beard and wearing the same bathrobe over and over. And even if he could leave the house, he's finding himself in the grips of a pretty debilitating case of agoraphobia.""Is this approaching grace? I wonder. Or is the aggregate narrative of my life a series of small, ill-shaped rationalizations that mask an enormous failure? I probably won't know until I reach old age, if I'm that lucky.""The only thing Francis has going for him is that he has divided his childhood home into several apartments, and all are full, relegating him to a cozy apartment in the attic. His tenants are a motley crewa former Olympic athlete; an artist with a curious portfolio; a former teacher with a heart as big as his enormous stomach; his ex-brother-in-law, a stoner trying to disengage from life; and a pair of former circus performers whose young daughter has gone missing, and they're not overly interested in helping the police try to find her. While Francis is struggling to overcome his own problems, he can't help but become immersed in everyone else's lives, which leads him to make some questionable decisions and occasionally act in unlandlord-like ways.Francis pines for his ex-wife and wishes that they could get back together. He also misses his band, mourns the circumstances that led to its demise, and wishes he and his bandmates could reunite. But when both his ex-wife and an old friend return to his life in different ways, he realizes that life doesn't always give you what you want the way you want it. And he makes a surprising discovery about his mother, which deepens his feelings of loss for her, and makes him realize she was even more complicated than he ever knew.""I'm convinced that part of leaving someone is carefully arranging the pain that will be left behind. Like gluing a broken dinner plate to the wall.""I really enjoyed this book tremendously. Even though it was a little zany in places, Rapp's storytelling ability made me chuckle, made me think, and even made me get emotional from time to time. Francis is a far more complex character than he appeared, and although I'll admit the constant descriptions of people's lack of hygiene made me a little queasy (I'm squeamish; what can I say), I found Know Your Beholder quite compelling and I needed to keep reading to see how Rapp would tie the story together.Maybe it's because his brother is Anthony Rapp of Rent fame, but for some reason I kept picturing Adam Pascal (who played Roger in the original Broadway cast and the motion picture adaptation) as Francis. I think this would be a tremendously interesting movie, but regardless, it was a really enjoyable book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WRW4POLPLV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316368911#wasThisHelpful","R8WRW4POLPLV8","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The body of an infant has been found near a creek on the campus of Ridgedale University. No one knows whose baby this was, who killed the baby, and, of course, why someone would have done such a terrible thing. Molly Sanderson, a freelance journalist who has mainly covered the arts, lifestyle, and human interest beat for the Ridgedale Reader finds herself assigned to cover the story, and she is unprepared for the toll it will take on her psyche.Following the loss of her second baby, Molly suffered a near-nervous breakdown, which took a toll on her marriage and her ability to care for her other daughter, who was still quite young. And although she was able to overcome this deep depression, and her husband's job at Ridgedale has given them a chance for a fresh start, this storyand the memories it unearthshas the potential to tear open wounds that time has healed. While she knows inherently she should give up the story, and her husband all but begs her to turn it over to another reporter, Molly is determined to get to the bottom of the story in the hopes it may provide some closure for her. As Molly begins to uncover a series of secrets many people in power would prefer to leave hidden, she finds herself getting entangled in a web where many people's behavior appears suspect, including several people she knows well.Where They Found Her is narrated not only by Molly, but two additional, very different women, each with a linkage to the story. Sandy, a high school dropout desperate to right her life and find the correct path for her future, is forced to play parent for her tremendously immature and undependable mother. And Barbara, the wife and mother determined to have the ""perfect"" life, is haunted both by memories she hoped she'd never have to deal with again, and problems faced by both of her children.There is no such thing as the ""perfect"" community, or the ""perfect"" family. But Ridgedale has more than its share of secrets and dysfunction. And Molly is determined to find out where all of the paths converge, especially if she can figure out what happened to the baby, and who she belonged to, no matter what it does to her, her life, and her relationships in the process.As I was reading Kimberly McCreight's new book, I found myself wondering which alternative I like better: a book in which you figure out what is going to happen before it is revealed, or a book that introduces so many possible solutions you haven't a clue what is going to happen. I think I prefer the latter, in which category this book definitely falls. McCreight definitely keeps you guessing, and her writing is taut and compelling. If I had any criticism of this book, it's that there are a lot of characters to keep straight, not all of them likable, so when the characters I didn't care much about narrated the book or appeared in the story, I wasn't as interested as I was otherwise. However, on the whole, this was a very interesting and suspenseful read, more so than I imagined, even though I figured out part of the plot.McCreight is a really talented writer. Her first book, Reconstructing Amelia, was one of my favorite books of 2013. If you like mysteries with a lot of emotion, give either of her books a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROBVBQOSDPGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZX118G#wasThisHelpful","R3ROBVBQOSDPGT","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I have a lot of ambitions in my life, but one of the ones I wish for the most is to be as clever and well-spoken as the characters in John Green's books. While I don't know many teenagers who speak the way his characters due, I am obsessed with the way he writes dialogue, especially banter, and although I think I do fairly well for myself conversationally, I wouldn't mind the the wry observational quality of his characters.While I believe Hazel and Augustus, the main characters in Green's The Fault in Our Stars (easily one of my most favorite books of the last several years), are the pinnacle of Green's dialogue mountain, Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman (okay, so Green knows how to name his characters well, too), the main characters in Paper Towns definitely have moments which should easily be added to his conversational pantheon.Quentin and Margo grow up living next door to each other in a suburban Florida town. When they are younger, the two find the body of a man who apparently committed suicide, and while this discovery should have cemented their relationship, it wasn't long before Margo drifted away, finding popularity, new friends (not to mention boyfriends), and an alleged life of adventure, while Quentin is content to life a quieter life, albeit one filled with close friends, video games, and worshiping Margo from afar.As their senior year of high school comes to close, one night Quentin is awakened by Margo, climbing into his bedroom window, dressed like a ninja. She enlists a reluctant Quentin to be her accomplice and assistant with a series of revenge-related activities throughout their area. (And while she promises no breaking and entering, she promises no such thing about breaking or entering.) While Margo's schemes push Quentin's blood pressure fairly high, and bring the duo into a few dangerous close calls, the late night ride awakens his confidence and sense of adventure, and he hopes that this will be the start of a whole different relationship with Margo.What he doesn't expect, however, was that Margo would disappear the next day, something she has done a few other times over the years. And when he finds out that the other times Margo disappeared she left obscure clues her family couldn't figure out, he becomes convinced that she has left him clues to find her this time. He seeks the help of his two best friends, Ben and Radar, to try and determine where she could have gone, why she left, and how he can find her, so that perhaps she'll realize the new, more confident Quentin she inspired is someone worth getting close to.But what Quentin discovers is that people's reasons for their actions don't always make sense to anyone other than themselves, and sometimes our perceptions of a person and what motivates them is vastly different than reality. He also learns about the power of quiet observation, the intensity of friendship, and his need for people to act the way he wants them to.""JustJust remember that sometimes, the way you think about a person isn't the way they actually are.""I really, really enjoyed this book, and it once again cemented John Green among my favorite writers. While Paper Towns has a great deal of humor and heart, at times I didn't find Margo to be as fascinating of a character as the others were, so much like Ben and Radar, I sometimes wondered why Quentin was spending so much time trying to find her. But again, Green's dialogue and his storytelling hooked me quickly and completely, and I read this book over a few hours. (You also can't quibble with a book that uses Walt Whitman's poetry as a significant plot point.)The movie adaptation of Paper Towns comes out later this summer, and I hope it's as faithful to Green's book as the movie version of The Fault in Our Stars was. A book this good deserves an equally good movie, but like always, I'd suggest reading the book first, to get the first-hand exposure to Green's talent. And maybe it will inspire you to plan adventures of your own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB982KE8DI9V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241493X#wasThisHelpful","RB982KE8DI9V6","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.I'll admit I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, but I have come a long way from being convinced I had the plague when I caught a bad cold while reading Stephen King's The Stand many years ago. If I hadn't, I certainly wouldn't be able to read many of the post-apocalyptic, dystopian novels out there that chronicle the world after major pandemics without convincing myself I had whatever illnesses wiped out most of the world!Benjamin Percy's The Dead Lands chronicles a future world in which our planet was hit by a massive flu epidemic that wiped out millions. In an effort to prevent the further spread of the disease, or perhaps wipe out those they felt were carriers, many countries detonated nuclear blasts, which caused further illnesses in survivors and caused animals to mutate into savage, deadly creatures.In what used to be St. Louis, a walled outpost called The Sanctuary has thrived for many years, purportedly protecting its citizens from the threats of the outside world, while governing through fear, violence, and corruption. The only bright spot in this bleak existence is a museum devoted to chronicling artifacts and events of the past, curated by Lewis Meriwether, the highly intelligent son of the Sanctuary's former mayor. One day, from the dead lands surrounding the Sanctuary, a lone woman comes riding in, telling of places far away where there is water, and natural resources, and life beyond the drudgery they all know. While the mayor tries to brand her as a deadly savage, she has come for one reason: to bring Lewis Meriwether back with her.But the tales that the woman tells prove too enticing for some. Mina Clark, a tough ranger with demons of her own, convinces Lewis (yep, in case you haven't been following along: Lewis and Clark) and a group of others to follow this woman, Gawea, into the dead lands, and find out whether the world she promises beyond the Sanctuary is true. But they're utterly unprepared for the dangerboth human and otherwiseand the beauty which they will find. And getting to Astoria, Oregon isn't half the battle.I'd never read anything by Percy before but I was tremendously impressed by the vividness of his language and the world he painted. The characters were really fascinating, although at times the shift in perspectives among so many characters became a bit confusing. Ultimately, though, I didn't think the book delivered on its promiseI felt as if it took far too long to get going, at times it was unrelenting in its brutality (how many mutant creatures could one group of people encounter?), and the whole thing didn't quite have the payoff I was hoping for.The Dead Lands is a well-written and unique addition to the dystopian landscape, although a little bit more horror-focused at times than other novels in this genre. It's certainly not the Lewis and Clark story you're used to!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPN4N4Q5148T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455528242#wasThisHelpful","R1TPN4N4Q5148T","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa Williamson's The Art of Being Normal is a moving, well-written reminder of how brutal, yet how beautiful, the world can be to those who are different.David Piper has really never fit in. Apart from his two best friends, most of his fellow high school students ridicule him for being different. One of the school bullies has called him ""Freak Show"" since they were younger, but David is willing to wait him out until high school ends. His parents think he is gay, and are waiting for him to tell them.What David wants, more than anything, is to be a girl. But as he grows taller and more like his father, he wonders if this will ever be a possibility.Leo Denton is the new kid in David's high school, coming from a poorer area to the more posh private school. Overly exaggerated tales of his exploits at his last high school follow him, but he lets people say what they want about him. Yet while he wants to remain under the radar, two events occur which ensure that wish isn't granted: he stands up for David when he is being bullied, and then he falls for one of the most beautiful and talented girls in school. It's not long before secrets he hoped wouldn't be exposed come to light.I felt The Art of Being Normal so accurately captured the feelings one experiences when you are different, when you are bullied, and how you just wish you could hide to avoid the ridicule and abuse. Williamson created such complex characters that you feel for and root for, characters you think about after the book is over. Even if once the story hits its stride you have a feeling how the plot will unfold, you're completely drawn into the characters' lives and you want to know what is going to happen.Like so many YA books out there these days, this type of book didn't exist when I was growing up. I'm so glad that it exists now, however, and hope that people read it, are moved by it, and perhaps convinced to change their behavior, to understand that their definition of ""normal"" isn't everyone's.

"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Growing up in rural Montana, Riley worshiped her older brother, Mick. Part guardian angel, part partner-in-crime, Mick taught her about the world around her. But when Mick goes missing in action in Vietnam, the loss is more than Riley or her parents can take, and she spends the next few years in a haze of wild behavior and drugs. She meets and falls in love with Darrell, a boy from the nearby reservation, and then she finds out that she is pregnant shortly after Darrell tells her that he, too, is headed to Vietnam.Feeling she has no choice, Riley, too, decides to leave Montana, heading for San Francisco, where she hopes the pull of the ocean may right her once and for all. But her journey is one continually punctuated by those who come into her life and those who leave, sometimes tragically, and on many occasions, Riley turns to drugs and alcohol to fill the empty spaces in her life.""The years since I'd left Montana had fallen well short of a pure, unadulterated, youthful-type trajectory, and my soul was every iota as snakebit as some of the worst ones. Climbing out of the ditch was a hit-or-miss proposition, and even though I was working on it, down was still a hell of a lot easier way to go than up.""Eventually, Riley makes her way to Vietnam, first to Saigon and then to Cu Chi, where Mick went missing, in the hopes she might find some sign, some clue as to what happened to him all of those years ago. But at the same time, she's also looking for a way to move on with her own life, to be able to finally reconcile all of the people who left her, as well as her own leaving.Marian Palaia's The Given World is a lyrical, poignant book about those who leave and those who are left behind. It's about trying to find the courage to trust again when all around you people break their promises and abuse your faith. It's also about finally letting the world in instead of letting it pass you by.Palaia's prose is beautiful, almost poetic at times. She populates this book with so many fascinating characters, none more so than the complex, flawed Riley. I found myself so drawn into her story that I hoped the book would take a turn that would otherwise be unrealistic. There are so many characters, and some chapters are told from others' perspectives, so at times the plot is difficult to follow, but Riley's story just takes hold of you and makes you want to race through it.This book was an unexpected surprise for me, and I can't wait to watch Palaia's career continue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9BV9LPIWPA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476777934#wasThisHelpful","R3B9BV9LPIWPA6","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And as one martini turns to two (and then more), once their plane takes off, they begin to play a game of absolute truth. No judgment.Perhaps it's the liquor that loosens his tongue, or Lily's presence, but Ted begins to reveal the problems he's experiencing with his wife, Miranda, and that he's pretty certain she's having an affair. Knowing a divorce will cost him a great deal of money and more than a little bit of humiliation, he jokes that it would just be easier to kill Miranda. When Lily first replies, ""I think you should,"" and then later adds, ""I'd like to help,"" he's utterly surprised, a bit freaked out...and more than a little intrigued.The two begin to devise a seemingly foolproof plan, but Ted can't help but wonder whether Lily is actually serious about it, or if somehow she'll end up trapping him somehow. But what Ted doesn't know is that there is far more mystery to Lily than he can even imagine. And then everything gets a little bit more complicated...I'm going to stop my description at this point for fear of giving anything away, although this is a book that succeeds both because of its intricate plot as well as the strength of Peter Swanson's writing. This isn't a book that thrives on surprises, although Swanson throws in a few. I just found the characters so compelling, both the ones I liked and the ones I didn't, and I really wanted to know exactly how he'd tie everything up. And now, of course, I'd love to know what happens next.I don't want to hype this, but this is definitely a book worth reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F0LOVUTEV6UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOFW596#wasThisHelpful","R2F0LOVUTEV6UO","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.""Children deserve care.""So is the motto of Bay Area pediatrician Bill Blair. When he finished serving in the Korean War, he left his Michigan home and decided to pursue a degree in pediatric medicine in San Francisco. While on a leisurely drive into the Portola Valley one day, he came upon three acres of wooded land which he was so taken by, he purchased it on a whim. Of course, he had no money to actually build on the land, so he just visited it from time to time.When he meets shy Penny Greenway, he finds underneath her calm demeanor a reservoir of passion and yearning, and they plan a life together, one in which they will build a house on Bill's land and raise three children. And although the house works out as planned, they wind up having four children, which upsets Penny more than she's willing to let on, and ultimately, being a wife and mother isn't enough to satisfy her, and she seeks the opportunity to become an artist, without much worry about what that might do to her family.Years later, Bill and Penny's children are grown, with the three oldest still living near their childhood home, while the youngest, James, the hyperactive ""problem child,"" has never settled down. Yet James' return to his hometown unsettles the stable lives of his siblingsRobert, a doctor like their father; Rebecca, a psychiatrist; and Ryan, a schoolteacherand unearths old resentments among each of them, and raises questions about the state of their parents' relationship when they were growing up. James is still the one no one can contain or control, he is still the one easily dissatisfied and mercurial, yet he desperately wants to belong, whether among his siblings or in the community where he lives.Ann Packer's The Children's Crusade is a tremendously well-written, intriguing, and emotional look at family dynamics, and how the decisions adults make while parenting have the potential to cause ripples in their children's lives for years to come. It's also a story of regrets, unfulfilled wishes, fears, things unsaid, and both the power and peril of memory.""I remembered my memory of the moment, because after so long that's what memory is: the replaying of filmstrip that's slightly warped from having gone through the projector so many times. I'll never know what actually happened and what distortions I added.""The book shifts between present day, looking at each of the adult children, and key moments in their childhood and Bill and Penny's marriage. Packer does a great job developing her characters and drawing you into their lives. The majority of the characters aren't completely likeable, but you feel for them, and you want to know what happens to them even after the book has ended.Packer's The Dive from Clausen's Pier remains a book that has stuck with me years after I read it, and I've always been a fan of her writing. While The Children's Crusade moves slower than that book, it's still a rich, complex story that I enjoyed tremendously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENC8X49OP26N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476710457#wasThisHelpful","R1ENC8X49OP26N","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""We had learned to appreciate our lies like a veil over our lives, each untruth stronger than the facts.""When their father falls into a coma, three sisters are forced to confront the secrets of their childhood that they've tried to keep hidden. Growing up in an Indian-American family, they were always taught to value appearances above everything else, and they succeeded, as from the outside looking in, they were a model family. But that couldn't have been further from the truth.Sonya, the baby of the family, was the brunt of most of her father's anger and violence. She fled home as quickly as she could, and used her photography career to keep her at a distance from life, refusing to allow herself to connect with anyone, afraid her secret shame will be revealed.Trisha was her father's favorite, and while she was able to stay safe while growing up, watching her mother and sisters be victimized certainly took its toll on her. She's created the perfect suburban life, but there's still a wall she can't seem to take down, and she doesn't understand why.The oldest daughter, Marin, remembers what life was like in India, before her family moved to America. Her father's abuse has shaped her into a ruthless businesswoman, stopping at nothing to get what she wants, and she doesn't quite understand what happens to those who get caught in the crossfire, even if they are people she cares about.Trail of Broken Wings is a powerfully moving book about the dangerous and destructive cycle of violence and abuse that affects far too many families, as well as the secrets we keep and the lies we tell, ostensibly to protect those we love. But we don't quite understand just how those secrets can affect our adult lives, and the lives of those around us.Sejal Badani is a very talented writer, and her use of language borders on the lyrical and poetic at times. The challenge with this book, however, is that in painting an accurate picture of the long-term effects of abuse, her characters are at times both sympathetic and unlikeable, and some of the situations seem a bit melodramatic. And even though you probably have an idea of how Badani will tie up the story, it's still very compelling.Domestic and child abuse is a serious subject that is still too often swept under the rug. Even if books like Trail of Broken Wings may cause some discomfort, these are stories that need to be told.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1LOHQ7SNHWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N58XLLE#wasThisHelpful","RE1LOHQ7SNHWZ","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Kirker Butler's Pretty Ugly leaves no stereotype untouchedpageant moms, philandering husbands, slutty teenage girls, even devoutly religious old women get torn apart in this satire.When she was a young girl, Miranda Ford won a local beauty pageant. (Well, she didn't quite win, but she eventually got the title.) It changed her life, and when she got married and gave birth to a little girl of her own, Bailey, she was determined to make her a true pageant star in the southeastern U.S. After eight-and-a-half years and more than 300 pageant titles, Miranda is just getting started, but Bailey is tired of sacrificing her life to pageants, tired of parading around in gowns and swimsuits, tired of being judged. Knowing there's no stopping her mother, Bailey starts binge eating in an effort to fatten herself out of contention, but even that doesn't stop Miranda, who is pregnant with another baby girl she has already named Brixton Destiny Miller. (Don't ask.)Miranda's husband, Ray, has always tolerated her obsession with pageants, despite the financial and emotional toll it has taken on their family. Working two jobs as a nurse and a hospice worker to keep them afloat, Ray pops every random pill he gets his hands on, with often-interesting results. But a growing dependency on nearly every prescription drug imaginable isn't the worst of Ray's problemshis girlfriend, Courtney, the 17-year-old girlfriend of one of his hospice patients, has just found out that she's pregnant.And then there's Joan, Miranda's devoutly religious mother, who home schools the couple's two sons because Miranda doesn't know what to do with them since she won't enter them in pageants. (Because they'd turn out gay, wouldn't you know?) Joan has frequent conversations with Jesus, and listens to everything He tells hereven when it comes to planning a murder.Things go from bada pregnant Miranda gets into a knock-down, drag-out fistfight with the trashy mother of another pageant contestant while a reality show films it allto worseCourtney moves in with Ray and Miranda's family and befriends Miranda, although she plans to destroy everything by forcing Ray to marry her. (She doesn't realize, of course, that Joanand Jesusare watching.)Pretty Ugly is a campy book, part Toddlers and Tiaras, part Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, with a healthy dose of soap opera thrown in for good measure. It's funny in places, ridiculous in others, and I thought the story was drawn out a bit too long, but Butler, a writer and producer whose credits include Family Guy, clearly knows what he's doing.If you've ever wondered what the people involved in kiddie pageants are like but can't bring yourself to watch a reality show, this is the next best thing. More ridiculous than sublime, it's sure to make you chuckleand/or offend you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OIIV362JM4IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049725#wasThisHelpful","R3OIIV362JM4IH","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.While I know most authors dream of achieving astronomical success with their first book, I'd imagine that's a lot of pressure, since everyone's expectations regarding your subsequent books are unfairly ratcheted up, and many will expect you to write similar books over and over again. And reading through some of the reviews I've seen of Sara Gruen's At the Water's Edge, it definitely seems as though many of her fans were expecting a redux of Water for Elephants. (There are some similarities beyond the word ""water"" in both of their titles, but they are different books.)It's 1944, deep in the thick of World War II, amidst Philadelphia's high society. Maddie Hyde, her husband Ellis, and his best friend Hank have always been a bit of a trio, despite everyone's hope that one day Hank will settle down with the right woman. Both Ellis and Hank are unable to serve in the war, which causes them no end of disapproval from others, and leads the three to act perhaps a bit more recklessly than they otherwise might, which serves to further alienate Maddie from her wealthy inlaws. But when the trio's scandalous behavior at a fancy New Year's Eve party causes quite an uproar, the resulting arguments lead Ellis' father to throw the couple out of the family home and cut off Ellis' allowance.With seemingly no other option, Hank convinces Ellis they should head to Scotland to try and find photographic proof of the famed Loch Ness Monster, a quest that Ellis' father once went on, and it led to his public ridicule. The two drag Maddie along, and they soon find themselves (after a treacherous journey across the Atlantic) at an inn in a small Scottish town, in the midst of austerity of the war. When Ellis and Hank leave Maddie alone at the inn to fend for herself as they try and track down the creature, she finds herself questioning the people and the lifestyle that she once knew, and tries to decide in what direction her life should go.I'll admit I was particularly enamored of Water for Elephants, but I didn't let that color my expectations toward this book. I thought that here Gruen told an interesting story, despite the fact that I found the three main characters generally flighty and unlikable. (The supporting characters, on the other hand, were more colorful and compelling.) Where Gruen excels is her ability to evoke a sense of place and time, and her description of the Scottish highlands was quite vivid. But in the end, although well-told, this book was a little too melodramatic for my liking, but I don't know whether that will disappoint her fans or those who enjoy a dollop of historical romance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJTRPWCGFL93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5557I0#wasThisHelpful","R1PJTRPWCGFL93","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Will Grayson, Will Grayson, by John Green and David Levithan, was one of the best books I read in 2010, and years later, it remains one of my favorites.That book, populated by two very different high school students, both named Will Grayson. One Will Grayson's best friend, ""Tiny"" Cooper, who isn't shy about his size or his sexuality, and tries to push Will to declare his feelings for his best friend, Jane, all while Tiny is getting ready to produce his autobiographical musical.This ""companion piece,"" authored by Levithan, is the script of Tiny's musical, complete with his commentary/stage direction, which in some cases, lets the reader in on how the lives of both Will Graysons, Jane, and Tiny progressed after the book ends. But mostly, the musical gives tremendous insight into what it's like to live a life where everyone thinks they know who and what you are, and just how much courage it takes to put yourself so far out there and be happy with who you are every day.""There are those of us who draw our power from those electric moments when everyone is watching, everyone is listening, and there is the most perfect silence you can imagine, the entire room waiting to hear whatever you will say next. Especially for those of us who ordinarily feel ignored, a spotlight is a circle of magic, with the strength to draw us from the darkness of our everyday lives.""Tiny's character really resonates for me. I remember what it was like to feel most at home in the middle of a stage, singing my heart out to an audience, even if it was an apathetic one. I remember what it was like not feeling comfortable in my own skin, but still wishing that I'd find others like me. And I remember what it was like to like someone so much, and fall so fast, that the biggest mistake you could make was expressing how you felt too soon. His musical is full of the unconditional love Tiny gets from his family and his best friends, as well as flamboyant musical numbers, some of which even star the ghost of Oscar Wilde.While it's difficult to read a musical as if it were a book without knowing what the songs sound like, getting a glimpse into Tiny's heart, head, and personality more than makes up for it. Levithan once again treats his characters with the respect and love they deserve, and looks beyond the stereotypes. I hope this isn't the last we see of Will, Will, Jane, and Tiny...maybe Levithan and Green can team up again?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFKL4ZIBGH5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428844#wasThisHelpful","R2OFKL4ZIBGH5R","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eddie Joyce's Small Mercies is a beautifully written gem of a book, about an Italian-Irish family from Staten Island that has always faced challenges, but none so difficult as coping with the loss of youngest son Bobby, a firefighter who died when he was a first responder on 9/11. Even nearly 10 years later, each member of the family still has their moments of grief.Gail Amendola, the matriarch, has tried to hold her family together any way she can. She and her husband Michael have weathered their own storms during their marriage, but they've now settled into a peaceful and happy life in their golden years. Oldest son Peter, the smart one, couldn't get out of Staten Island fast enough, and becomes a successful lawyer, yet meets his downfall in an attempt to protect ""one of his own,"" another young lawyer from his hometown. Middle son Franky has always been the troublemaker, and he was always fiercely devoted to Bobby, and his death has sent Franky far down the wrong tracks.As the family prepares for Bobby Jr.'s birthday party, they are forced to confront something they never expected to happen: Tina, Bobby's widow, whom he dated since they were in high school, has met a man. After nearly 10 years of widowhood, of mourning her husband and leaning on his family to help her raise their children, she's ready to move on with her life, and thinks she's found the person to help her do it. And he's not even from Staten Island.""He was the absolute best possible version of that man, the absolute best. To try to love some lesser version of him would be the greatest insult to his memory she could imagine. If she wanted to feel love (and she was still young and wanted to love and be loved in return), she needed to meet someone who didn't feel like a cheap imitation of her dead husband.""Small Mercies focuses on a week in the life of the Amendolas, as they try to process their feelings about Tina's new man and what that means to how they continue to deal with Bobby's death. It shifts perspectives among the family members, and moves back and forth between past and present, to provide a clearer picture of the good and bad times in their lives. It's the story of anger and frustration, hurt and heartbreak, love and happiness, grief and loss, and ultimately, hope.Eddie Joyce is an absolutely fantastic writer and he has created a flawed yet all too human family. But despite having grief as a central theme of this book, it isn't morbid or maudlin; there are certainly some parts which provoke emotions, but by and large, this is simply a powerful story of a family fighting to stay together and come apart. At times it gets a little bogged down in melodrama and predictable plot twists, but for a debut novel, this is a pretty strong and terrific read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMINAHHRI1SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427295#wasThisHelpful","RLMINAHHRI1SC","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a big fan of Sujata Massey's series of mysteries featuring danger-prone antiques dealer Rei Shimura for quite some time now. In 2008, when I read the 10th book in the series, Shimura Trouble, it certainly sounded as if Massey was finished spinning stories about her heroine, and I was rather upset, so when I found out that Rei had returned to the literary world, I was very excited to spend time with her and her compatriots once again.When The Kizuna Coast opens, Rei and her new husband, Michael Hendricks, are settling into their lives in Hawaii. But newlywed bliss is short-lived once the couple learns that a powerful earthquake has rocked the northeast coast of Japan, followed by a devastating tsunami that left enormous death and destruction in its wake. Although Rei is relieved to find out that her family members living in Japan are all safe, when she receives a distressed phone call from her mentor and former boss, antiques dealer Mr. Ishida, who has been injured and displaced by the storm, she promises to go to Japan to help him.Getting to Japan shortly after such a disaster proves challenging (not to mention upsetting to her husband), and once she arrives, in order to get to the city where Mr. Ishida is, she must offer her services as a disaster relief volunteer. But before she arrives in Tohoku, she visits Mr. Ishida's shop, only to discover it may have been burglarized. And when she finally is reunited with him, she finds that while he is concerned about his shop, he is most concerned about the whereabouts of his employee, Mayumi, who unexpectedly met him in Tohoku on the day of the tsunami, but seems to have disappeared.At first, Rei doubts just how devoted of an employee Mayumi is, but then she starts to uncover more information about the tumultuous life this young girl led. And as she finds herself trying to help find out what happened to Mayumi, and get Mr. Ishida back to his shop, she is also overwhelmed by the destruction, both physical and emotional, that the tsunami caused. To top it off, her worries begin to grow about her husband as well, whose job sends him near the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which was damaged during the storm.Reading The Kizuna Coast is like being reunited with old friends. Rei's character hasn't changed, although she has gotten a bit more mature at times, but her doggedness and her compassion remain the same. While this book dealt more with her experiences in the tsunami-stricken area, it was still good to see the return Mr. Ishida, as well as her close friend and former roommate, Richard; her aunt, Norie; and her doctor cousin, Tom. The plot is a little predictable but it doesn't matter, because Rei is a warm, fascinating character and Massey does such a great job making you care about her and those with whom Rei is dealing. And as always, there's even some fascinating information about Japanese antiques thrown in for good measure.If you're a mystery fan, I'd definitely encourage you to pick up a book in Massey's Rei Shimura series. They're fun and compelling, and they've really taught me a great deal about Japanese culture I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise. Plus, you now have 11 books to read in the series, so hopefully if you get hooked, by the time you're done, Massey may write another!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTNAQRBXA8O8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5SCT34#wasThisHelpful","RTNAQRBXA8O8X","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Violet (""Vee"") has wanted to be a prima ballerina for as long as she can remember. And as a girl from a wealthy family, she can dream whatever she wants to and achieve her dreams. When she meets Ori, whose family life is less than stable but whose talent is greater, Ori becomes Vee's strongest advocate and biggest fan, protecting her from self-doubt and those who seek to tear her down. But as they find themselves in the midst of their teenage years, and Ori's talent begins to shine brighter than Vee's, their friendship is tested. And when Ori is accused of an act of unspeakable violence, their once-unbreakable bond is destroyed.Amber has been locked up in the Aurora Hills juvenile detention facility for as long as she can remember. Sentenced at age 13 for allegedly murdering her abusive stepfather, she has become all too expert at navigating the tricky culture of Aurora Hills, knowing the people she can talk to, the places she can go, the questions she can ask of her fellow inmates, and the way she must behave to pass the time. The facility is rocked one night by a mysterious power outage, which harms the delicate balance Amber has been able to maintain and threatens her relationships. It also leads to her getting a new cellmateOriand the two lonely girls form an unlikely bond.The Walls Around Us is part a story about living with loneliness, betrayal, and guilt. It's a story about the power of friendship and how even the strongest relationships can be shattered by lies. Nova Ren Suma's writing is absolutely beautiful, lyrical and almost poetic at times. You think you know what might happen but you're utterly unprepared for what does, particularly because the book has some supernatural, ghost story-esque elements as well. It's a tremendously interesting twist on a not-quite-typical story which has aspects of teenage angst as well.I have never read anything that Nova Ren Suma has written before, but I was blown away by her storytelling ability. I'll admit the way the book concluded confused me a bit because I'm not 100 percent certain what happened with one character, but I still thought this was a tremendously unique and compelling book.

"I'd rate this 3.5 stars.Here's a conundrum: how do you review a book that is dazzlingly beautiful but otherwise relentlessly brutal? Do you focus on how it's written or how it makes you feel? David Vann's Aquarium is a book that makes me ponder those questions. Vann's writing is truly masterful, but this is a book that hits you with a wallop.Twelve-year-old Caitlin is growing up in Seattle, being raised by a single mother who works at a local container porta menial, laborious job that barely helps them make ends meet. Because her mother can't afford child care, and can't pick Caitlin up directly after school, Caitlin spends each afternoon at the aquarium, which is no punishment for her, since she loves fish more than anything.""The only thing that kept me moving along that street each afternoon was the blue at the end, the sea visible because we were on a hill. That blue promised the aquarium. A gauntlet leading to a sanctuary. I could have stayed in an after-school program, but it was my choice to visit the fish. They were emissaries sent from a larger world. They were the same as possibility, a kind of promise.""Caitlin studies the fish each day, and reflects on their place in the world at large. One day, she meets an old man who seems as enamored of the fish as she is. He strikes up conversations with her and is amazed at her knowledge of these denizens of the deep. They begin to meet at the aquarium each afternoon. As Caitlin struggles with what is going on in her lifeher mother coming under scrutiny for bringing her to work at night when she does overtime, Caitlin's feelings for her best friend Shalinithe old man proves to be her salvation. Although Caitlin wants to keep him a secret from her mother because she is worried how she'll react, the man insists Caitlin introduce him to her mother.But little does Caitlin know what fissures this man will open in her life, in her relationship with her mother, and her mother's psyche in general. For the first time in her life, Caitlin sees how brutal and painful life can be, how it can derail you from all you want and all you hope for. She finds herself living in fear of losing all that she loves, and all that she wants.Aquarium is truly a sucker punch to the gut. It is vivid in its depiction of how hurtful and cruel a person who feels they are wronged can be, and how easily they can injure another person physically and emotionally. It's a book about how the sins of adults are often visited on their children, and how easy it can be to take your own frustration and sadness out on those who are more vulnerable. But as brutal as it is, there is still a glimmer of hope deep inside.""The worst part of childhood is not knowing that bad things pass, that time passes. A terrible moment in childhood hovers with a kind of eternity, unbearable.""I found this book tremendously difficult to read and a bit disturbing. The transformation Caitlin's mother undergoes, while realistic, is so drastic and shocking it's nearly over-the-top, but you can understand how a woman so beat down by life could have so much anger inside her. But in trying to illustrate this point, I felt that Vann might have taken it a little too far, because it became difficult to sympathize with her, and those who watched her actions occur.I'd never read anything Vann has written before, but I was truly amazed at the depth of his talent. And it is that talent, that storytelling ability, that kept me reading even as my heart hurt for Caitlin. This isn't necessarily a book you'll enjoy, but it is one which will leave your mind reeling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9K7555UGS7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV9D9P4#wasThisHelpful","R1X9K7555UGS7V","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With her latest story collection, Get in Trouble, Kelly Link takes readers to some fascinating and sometimes unique places, populated with tremendously intriguing and compelling characters. While I've seen this book classified as science fiction and fantasy, I think it's probably more the latter than the former. But neither term can accurately convey the appeal of these stories.Many of the stories in this collection are about relationshipsbetween siblings (when one has technically sprung from the other's shadow); best friends (when one of them has a lifelike, life-size, animated doll that another covets); ex-lovers and former actors (one of whom is hosting a ghost hunting show); and total strangers (when one is a 15-year-old girl who pretended to be an adult while playing an online game, and goes to a hotel to meet her much older onscreen companion). But while the core themes of these stories are typical, the way Link lets the stories unfold is anything but.So many story collections these days have what I call ""nuggets"": stories that seem to end before they really pick up momentum. The stories in Get in Trouble are substantive, and really wrap you up in a fully-fleshed narrative. (Longer stories are great as long as you like them.)I really enjoyed eight of the nine stories in this collection, but some of my favorites included: ""The Lesson,"" in which a gay couple attends an old friend's wedding on a remote island while they're awaiting the birth of their child via a surrogate they're not 100 percent sure about; ""The Summer People,"" which tells the story of a teenage girl growing up in rural North Carolina, who is the caretaker of a house occupied by mysterious residents who make goodand badthings happen; ""I Can See Right Through You,"" about when a pair of former ex-lovers and actors who are always tied to each other emotionally have a reunion in Florida, where one is hosting a ghost-hunting television show; ""The New Boyfriend,"" about a group of best friends and one's life-size, likelike, doll ""boyfriends""; and ""Light,"" a unique story about a woman plagued by her twin brother, who actually sprung from her extra shadow.I had never read anything Link has written before, but I am utterly enamored of her storytelling ability. Even though I do read some fantasy and science fiction books, I tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to short stories, but these really hooked me. They're unique and different and well-written and memorable, and they deserve to be read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2551ZPD0O9HR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSS0WQY#wasThisHelpful","R2551ZPD0O9HR4","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Our lives are lived with the illusion of control and then there are moments rare as wisdom when we abandon the pretense that we are masters of our fate.""New York City wills and trusts lawyer Jeremy Best has nearly always taken the safe choices in his life, causing him more regrets than he'd like. He does have one interesting secret: he's also a poet of some promise, publishing under the pen name Jinx Bell. He certainly dreams of renown, but beyond having his poems published in a few literary journals, he keeps his talent hidden.He is utterly unprepared for the arrival in his life of Spaulding Simonson, the 19-year-old troubled daughter of his boss. Although she refers to Jeremy at age 33 as ""already halfway to dead,"" somehow she knows that Jeremy and Jinx Bell are one and the same. And she loves his poetry. Spaulding is unpredictable, emotional, even erratic at times, but fiercely intelligent and immensely talented.Jeremy can make a long list of reasons why he shouldn't get involved with Spaulding, the least of which is he's on the partnership track at his law firm and he's just received news that shakes him to his core. But he can't seem to get her out of his system, and she is inexplicably drawn to him, particularly as he encourages her to live her own life and never give in.Seth Greenland's I Regret Everything is a story of an unlikely couple, one who is trying to be less predictable and one who is trying to take control of her life for perhaps the first time. It's the story of letting your heart have power over your head, even though that's the last thing you're comfortable doing. It's also a story of wordplay, of poetry, of creativity. Because the book shifts in perspective between Jeremy and Spaulding, the tone shifts with their personalities, which is unsettling for a brief second, but wonderful once it kicks in.I absolutely loved this book. It threw me for a loop a few times (in a good way), and I wondered just where Greenland would take the plot, but Jeremy and Spaulding are such unique characters that drew me in instantaneously. Greenland is such an excellent writer, and his narrative occasionally has a near-poetic quality. I couldn't sleep last night, so I devoured this book in practically one sitting, and as much as I loved it, I'm disappointed it's done. Bravo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9GAK14DGZA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RYAY#wasThisHelpful","R2K9GAK14DGZA3","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.Aysel is a 16-year-old high school student growing up in Kentucky. She's obsessed with science, particularly physics, but she avoids participating in school because she doesn't want to give her fellow classmates even more fodder to whisper about her. She's also tremendously depressed, and fears that the mental illness which plagues her father will affect her in the same way, so she has made up her mind that she's ready to die.""Something inside me is wrong. Sure, there are things in my life that make me feel alone, but nothing makes me feel more isolated and terrified than my own voice in my head.""Aysel spends a lot of time on Smooth Passages, a website for people who want to die. In a section of the site called ""Suicide Partners,"" which is dedicated to people looking for others to make their final plans with. It is in this section that Aysel meets Roman, a 17-year-old who lives in the next town over. He, too, wants desperately to die, wants to do it with someone who lives within an hour of him, and he wants to die on April 7. That's non-negotiable.As Aysel gets to know Roman, and gets drawn into his life, she realizes the depth of his sadness, but she is uncomfortable sharing her reasons for wanting to die, for fear she may alienate him. As the days draw closer to April 7, she starts to wonder if death is really the answer for the two of them, or if she's better off finding them reasons to live. But Roman isn't interested in changing his plans, no matter how Aysel makes him feel.""I once read in my physics book that the universe begs to be observed, that energy travels and transfers when people pay attention. Maybe that's what love really boils down tohaving someone who cares enough to pay attention so that you're encouraged to travel and transfer, to make your potential energy spark into kinetic energy.""My Heart and Other Black Holes made me sad, and it gave me hope. It painted a tremendously accurate, effective, and emotional picture of teens dealing with depression and despair, and how the need to escape those feelings becomes greater than anything else, even connections with others. Jasmine Warga created memorable characters you truly feel for, and I've been thinking about them even after finishing the book.This book will generate comparisons with Jennifer Niven's amazing All the Bright Places , and while the two share a general theme, they're very different books. This book is a little more straightforward; I felt as if Roman and Aysel talked more like teenagers and dealt with more teenage-like problems that Violet and Finch did in Niven's book, but I felt as if the plot in this book was a little more predictable. This book is no pale imitation of Niven's, however; it is tremendously well-written and affecting, and it deserves to be read on its own merits.In the end, it's important to realize that even if your problems seem insurmountable, there is always a solution other than suicide. Anyone dealing with those feelings needs to get help, needs to let someone else in, even if the thought is overwhelming. Give someone else the chance to listen to you, to hear you, to help you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A48QAQ8DKIW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFG15NU#wasThisHelpful","R1A48QAQ8DKIW5","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.""It's not always wise to assume that just because the surface of the world appears undisturbed, life is where you left it.""At age 19, Annie Black flees her unremarkable, hopeless life in California to seek a job in London. She feels lucky when she finds a job as an assistant to Malcolm Church, a structural engineer working on a bid to build a new light rail station at Canary Wharf. While Malcolm takes good care of her, and makes no secret that he is attracted to her, she spends her evenings drinking herself into oblivion and longing for more, and she thinks she finds it in Patrick Ardghal, a flirtatious photographer with an interesting connection to Malcolm and his wife, Louise.One turbulent evening in Paris, while Annie is on holiday vacation with Malcolm, Louise, and Patrick, things come to a head, and the next day, Annie flees without a word and heads to Ireland. She meets Jonathan Gunnlaugsson, a fellow American, and the two travel through Europe and Asia, eventually falling in love.Twenty or so years later, she and Jonathan are married and living a successful life in San Francisco. Annie designs custom lighting fixtures for her own store, and the couple is parents to three childrenRobbie, Polly, and Clara. One day Annie receives a photograph in the mail that reminds her of that tumultuous time in Paris, and it reignites a passion in her she hadn't felt in some time. While on a business trip to London, she rekindles an old acquaintance, which sets off a chain of events she never expected.Not soon after her return to California, she gets a shocking phone call about Robbie, which shakes their already vulnerable family to the core. As she tries to rally herself and her family together, more secrets are revealed, which surprise both Annie and Jonathan. She desperately tries to reconcile her feelings with trying to preserve the life she has known and taken for granted.Jan Ellison's A Small Indiscretion shifts between the present day and Annie's life in London 20 or so years earlier. It's the story of being torn between seeking what you think you want and taking what you really want for granted. It's a revealing look at the ups and downs of marriage and building a life together, and just how destructive secrets can be, especially secrets you think you've hidden well.This is a well-written and compelling book with a few twists and turns along the way. I liked it, but a few things frustrated me. I felt as if Ellison relied too much on foreshadowing as a narrative device, alluding obliquely to things that would happen later. Doing this a few times was fine, but the more she did it, the more I felt she undercut her own story. I also felt that on the whole, Annie was a fairly unsympathetic character, so it wasn't always easy to have empathy for the situations she found herself in.While it's not as good as Charles Dubow's fantastic Indiscretion, which was one of my favorite books of 2013, on the whole, this is an interesting, well-told story. It definitely will make you think about relationships.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EGSCVOXSJOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MDHN6S6#wasThisHelpful","R35EGSCVOXSJOH","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The crime/thriller genre is full of a lot of books that seem rather similar, to the point where at times you can't easily distinguish books you've read from those you haven't. Mike Pace's One to Go is not one of those books. Sure, it's utterly implausible (at least I hope so) and it goes off the rails toward the end, but it takes you on one hell of a ride, and is unlike any other book I've read, mashing together the crime/thriller genre with a bit of the paranormal.Tom Booker is a new attorney at one of the more powerful law firms in Washington, DC. He's rotating through the firm's different specialties, hoping to find his niche and make an impression on those in charge. Deciding to be a lawyer at a later age than many, he wants to succeed yet still wants to be a good father to his young daughter, especially now that he and his wife are divorced.Rushing to meet his daughter and her friends at a museum one Saturday, he stops to text his wife that he's on his way (although running late), and he inadvertently winds up drifting into oncoming traffic, causing an accident on the Memorial Bridge. An accident with a truck as well as a minivan driven by his sister-in-law, carrying his daughter and her friends. The minivan tips on its side, starts leaking gasoline, and is on the verge of plummeting into the Potomac River below.Can Tom shake off his own injuries fast enough to save his daughter? Suddenly time inexplicably freezes, and he encounters a perky couple, Britney and Chad. They give Tom the option to reverse time and save everyone involved in the crash. But this offer is not without its costto repay for the four lives he will save, he must kill a person every other week. It doesn't matter who he kills, he just has to kill someone. And if he doesn't, one of the minivan's passengers will be killed instead, which again puts his daughter at risk.He has to be hallucinating, right? Tom quickly sees that this utterly unbelievable situation is all too real, and he must take Britney and Chad's bargain seriously. But how will he find people who deserve to die? And how will he work up the courage to kill them when he's never really even fired a gun? He must turn himself from an upstanding lawyer into a serial killer in just a matter of days, and he can't caught, or he'll put his daughter in danger. And then he finds himself in the middle of another situation that threatens his freedom and his daughter's life.One to Go jolts you from the start, and keeps your adrenaline pumping throughout. Tom is not your average everyday murdererhe thinks he can go about killing like he's seen it done on television and in the movies, but he finds it much more difficult than he'd even imagine, and as he finds, the devil is definitely in the details. I liked the fact that Pace didn't change Tom's character too much as the story unfolded. Pace does a great job ratcheting up the tension throughout, and there are some good action scenes.I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I found part of the story's resolution tremendously predictable (I figured it would go one of two ways) and then the outrageous elements of the plot were just a little too outrageous. But if you can completely suspend your disbelief (and I mean completely), you'll probably agree this is a book unlike many you've seen in this genre.I look forward to seeing what Pace thinks of next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20D2S6GJM9RAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSQ0YPE#wasThisHelpful","R20D2S6GJM9RAM","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd give this 3.5 stars.I've been a big fan of Patton Oswalt for some time now. I think he's a pretty good actor (he particularly gave a terrific performance in Charlize Theron's Young Adult a few years back), and I love his comedic observations as well. One friend of mine says that Oswalt and I share a similar sense of humor, although clearly only one of us is making a living off of it.One thing I didn't know I shared with Oswalt was an obsession with the movies. Those of you who know me well know I've been a huge movie fan for almost my entire life, and at the very least, see everything nominated, or in contention, for Oscars each year. And thanks to a year-long American film class in college, I consumed a healthy diet of classic movies as well.Oswalt's Silver Screen Fiend isn't your typical celebrity memoir, although it does chronicle a period of his life when he dealt with a serious addictionto going to the movies. From 1995-1999, while focusing on his career as a stand-up comic and dreaming of one day acting and directing, Oswalt went to the movies at least several times a week, often at the New Beverly Cinema, watching classics and lesser-known films as well as new releases. While watching movies brought him pleasure, expanded his cinematic horizons, and stimulated his creativity and his desire to one day see his work on the big screen, it also caused him a great deal of stress, as he planned comedy sets and other work, as well as social obligations (when he had them) around movie times. (And the constant diet of movie concessions wasn't good for his waistline either.)""Moviesthe truly great one (and sometimes the truly bad)should be a drop in the overall fuel formula for your life.""And if just seeing that many movies each week and planning his life around them wasn't enough of an obsession, he also compulsively felt the need to ""check off"" each movie he saw in one or more of five film reference books, chronicling the location, date, and time he saw each film. This action became a routine he couldn't shakeit's almost as if seeing the movies didn't count if he didn't record seeing them.As Oswalt provides background on each movie he saw, and places it in the context of his personal and professional life, he also chronicles the evolution of his career, from first getting the comedy bug while doing an internship in Washington, DC, to dealing with the ups and downs of good and bad performances, to his time both as a writer for MADtv and his tenure on television in The King of Queens. He struggles with jealousy of other comedians who achieve the success he craves, and worries about being able to realize his ambitions.I enjoyed this book very much, as Oswalt did a great job informing, entertaining, and making me think. While I had heard of many of the movies he mentions in the book, there are a number I wasn't familiar with, so I enjoyed his perspective on those films. I did feel that the book was a little disjointed at times, as he occasionally shifts from one subject to another rather abruptly. But in the end, I found this tremendously appealing. (My favorite part of the book was a tribute to the late owner of the New Beverly Cinema, in which Oswalt imagined a month-long film festival, creating twists on popular movies with classic actors and directors.)If you're more than simply an occasional movie watcher, or interested in the path some comedians follow toward success, you'll enjoy Silver Screen Fiend. Oswalt writes with humor, heart, and a whole lot of film trivia.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXEFK4GIDUE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSB2API#wasThisHelpful","R1LXEFK4GIDUE7","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why I loved this book so muchmaybe it's because I'm a child of the 80s, or because I'm obsessed with movies like the book's main character. But whatever the reason(s), I wouldn't have minded if this book was doubled in length, because I want to know what comes next for these characters.In 1989, Eric ""Zuke"" Zauchas is a student at Pison Nazarene College, a small religious school in Indiana he chose because of the chance to play basketball, although he doesn't get the chance to play very much. He and his best friends are part of a club called the Brothers in Pursuitwhile they do almost everything together anyway, every Sunday night they wear matching, embroidered boxer shorts and helmets, play games they invented, and report on their pursuits of truth, compassion, God, and women. (Not necessarily in that order.)Zuke believes life should be like it is in the movies he watchesSixteen Candles, Weird Science, The Princess Bride, and especially Say Anything. Like that movie's protagonist, Lloyd Dobler, Zuke believes he should pursue a dare-to-be-great situation, and he thinks he's found it in Abby, a girl in his English class. He devises a plan so that they're frequently togetherhe decides to become an English major like she is. They get along perfectly, and both feel a connection.The challenge is, Abby happens to be dating Cheese (Brett), Pison's star basketball player. She's known Cheese nearly her entire life and thought of little but marrying him. Her relationship with Zuke has opened her eyes that perhaps she needs to expand her horizons a little bit. But will she break up with Cheese and start dating Zuke, or will she break Zuke's heart?""All he wanted shimmered in foggy remembrances of relationships he'd seen on the big screen. Zuke wanted to be in the kiss at the end of the movie.""Meanwhile, things are exciting and stressful for the other Brothers in Pursuit as well. There's a surprise romance, a thwarted romance, taking control of your life when your plans have gone awry, even a little sexual identity crisis, which is particularly a big deal at a religious school. Plus the Brothers need to survive a WWE night with the guys down the halland their dorm keeps shaking, and they don't know why.Love on the Big Screen is utterly charming, full of 80s nostalgia as well as the nostalgia of simpler times (although life didn't seem as simple). It's a story of friendship, romance, ambition, religion, forging your own path, even a little bit of heroics. And it has so much heart. This was one of those books that hooked me from the beginning because of its charm and its quirky characters. The story is simple, but it's high on entertainment value.I'd love it if Torgerson wrote a sequel, because I'm dying to know what came next for Zuke and his friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YIIR1W37NU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M5HHZA#wasThisHelpful","R15YIIR1W37NU6","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Patrick is a forensic sculptor, helping to identify unknown murder victims through his work. His latest assignment is to reconstruct the skull of an unidentified girl found on Brighton's run-down West Pier in the 1970s. Yet while he is determined as always to give his all to his job, he can't stop thinking of a summer night he spent on the West Pier in 1993, a night spent in the company of Black, a beautiful photography student. But as soon as he started to get to know Black, she disappeared without a trace.""It's the story of my life: desiring the impossible woman.""As Patrick works to reconstruct the girl's skull, he remembers fragments of his lifehis childhood and the turmoil he experienced, being abandoned by many people he cared about throughout his life, as well as how he came to be a forensic sculptor. He wants to solve the mystery of who the girl was, and solve the mysteries of his own life. Neither challenge is an easy one.Paul Tomkins' The Girl on the Pier is fascinatingthe plot takes all sorts of twists and turns, and Tomkins provides so much interesting detail, particularly around Patrick's career, and the steps he takes in his work. (I'll admit, with all of the crime novels and thrillers I've read, I don't believe I've ever read about a forensic sculptor, so that was pretty cool.) And Patrick is an intriguing character, one who demonstrates how powerful memory can be, and how moldable memories are.My one criticism of this book is the non-linear way the story is told. I found myself having to double back more than a few times and re-read passages, just so I could better orient myself to the flow of the story and figure out what was being talked about. But once I got further into the story, I didn't find that as unsettling, although it took some getting used to.If you're a fan of crime novels and thrillers, definitely add this one to your list.

"I'd rate this 2.5 stars.The title of Michael Coffey's new story collection refers to the main character in the title story, who has made a living naming products, housing developments, and other things. But it's also appropriate for the entire collection, which focuses on people trying to get a sense of their own identitiesas parent, friend, lover, child, priestand figure out their place in the world.Of Coffey's eight stories, the ones I enjoyed the most were: ""The Newman Boys,"" which followed a teenage boy's friendship with a physically disabled neighbor, and how that relationship ripples through the rest of his life; ""Moon Over Quabbin,"" in which a mother pictures her former town, which was submerged under water when a river was dammed, and envisions her son alive through those to whom his organs were donated; and ""Inn of the Nations,"" which follows a priest in the 1960s, trying to get control of his life, which seems no easy task.While Coffey is a very talented writer, and I enjoyed his use of imagery, many of these stories eluded my grasp. They started out strong, and I understood what Coffey was trying to say, but then the stories veered off course. In some cases, it seemed as if he just threw so much stuff into the stories they were going in many directions at once. This was particularly the case with the final story, ""Finding Ulysses,"" which borrowed heavily from James Joyce.These stories are intriguing and unique, and Coffey has a strong voice. I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0IL020OKKR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFK02ZO#wasThisHelpful","R3S0IL020OKKR2","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd rate this 3.5 stars.George Pelecanos has been one of my favorite crime writers for a number of years now. I've read everything he's written, and I'm always blown away by the crackling action scenes, his exploration of racial tensions, and his opening up a new perspective on the Washington, DC of the 1970s and 1980s. I also love the complexity of his charactersmuch like real life, no one is completely good or bad, which makes them tremendously compelling.The seven stories in Pelecanos' first collection, <b><i>The Martini Shot</b></i> boast many of the same characteristics which make his novels so appealing. For the most part, these aren't the happiest of stories, as each of the main characters is struggling with somethingaddiction, greed, violence, guiltor often more than one of these. And although you can often figure out the path these stories will take, Pelecanos' writing ability raises them up a notch or two.Some of my favorites included ""Miss Mary's Room,"" where a young man remembers the carefree days of his youth and a close friendship before crime changed everything; ""When You're Hungry,"" about an insurance investigator who travels to Brazil to find an allegedly dead man, but finds his perfect case closure record may be in jeopardy (among other things); ""Plastic Paddy,"" which illustrates how letting your friends see you vulnerable is never good for your friendship; and ""Chosen,"" which provides some back story on Spero Lucas, a character from a few of Pelecanos' most recent novels. (This story reminded me how I'm more than ready for another Spero Lucas novelhope that's next from Pelecanos!)The collection also contains a novella, ""The Martini Shot,"" which goes behind the scenes of a television crime show and follows one of the show's writers (probably loosely based on Pelecanos' own involvement with <b><i>The Wire</b></i>). But this is just more than a you-are-there type of story, as the writer finds himself caught between the woman he loves and the trouble a friend finds himself in. Even though the story was tied up at the end, I found this really interesting, and would have loved to keep reading this.There wasn't anything I <i>didn't</i> like about the collection; I just wasn't blown away by every story. I felt as if a few duplicated themselves a bit, and some didn't grab me as much the other stories, or other Pelecanos novels, have in the past. His excellent storytelling ability is on display, but some of the stories needed a little more time to develop.If you've never read anything by George Pelecanos, you need to remedy that. While this collection isn't his best work, it's still a great example of why he's one of my favorite writersand why I can't wait for his next book to come out, even if it's a year or so away.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WUCH75A9IPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAEXMGK#wasThisHelpful","R10WUCH75A9IPF","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shockedand feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problemwell, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectivesRachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWVDZ025WBAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9B7IKE#wasThisHelpful","R3IWVDZ025WBAR","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loathe when a book is touted as ""the next [fill in title of bestseller],"" or ""as funny,"" or ""as suspenseful"" as another popular book. As I've said before, I believe that type of comparison cuts both waysif you're a fan of the book that the new one is being compared to, it sets up unfair expectations, and if you're not a fan, you may skip a book that you might have really enjoyed.Jennifer Niven's All the Bright Places is hailed as The Fault in Our Stars meets Eleanor and Park. Having absolutely fallen in love with both of those books, I couldn't resist reading Niven's, even though I knew that the comparison wasn't fair. But after reading Niven's book, I can say that it does share some commonalities with the other two booksnamely characters who speak far more eruditely than real teenagers do, and the books' ability to leave me a puddle of emotion when they were done. And neither of those facts made me love All the Bright Places any less.Violet Markey and Theodore Finch have one of the most unusual meet-cutes I've seenthey meet on the ledge of the bell tower at their Indiana high school. Violet is grieving after the tragic death of her older sister, and has shut the world out. Finch has been known as ""the freak"" for years, despite his good looks, snarky sense of humor, and intelligence. He's fascinated with different methods of suicide, and has contemplated it more than a few times, but something always stops him.""I'm fighting to be here in this s***ty, messed-up world. Standing on the ledge of the bell tower isn't about dying. It's about having control.""After Violet and Finch essentially save each other from possible death, Finch makes it his mission to save Violet from herself, and convince her to start living her life again, and allowing herself to enjoy things, and people, she used to. The two become partners on a class project called ""Wander Indiana,"" where they are encouraged to visit some of the wonders of their state. But in doing so, they also discover that despite all of their challenges, they can truly be themselves when they're together, which both find truly cathartic.As the two begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other, and Violet starts feeling comfortable again, Finch continues struggling with his own demons. As much as he tries to be present, to enjoy every moment they spend together, the weight of the feelings of others around him, the problems he's always dealt with, become too much to bear. Violet must make a crucial decisiondoes she try to save Finch as he saved her, or does she let him handle things on his own?Niven does an excellent job in portraying the struggles of teenagers dealing with grief and mental illness, and while the obliviousness of those in Finch's life is appalling, this sort of ""ignore it and it will go away"" behavior is all too true. While as with many YA books published recently, the characters are far more articulate and intelligent and sarcastic than most teenagers really are, the dialogue was beautifully written, and I found the characters, Finch in particular, to be truly memorable.Sure, this book is a little predictable, but I found it tremendously well done. I can't get it out of my head. I'm sad that I'm done with Finch and Violet, much as I felt after Hazel and Gus' story, and Eleanor and Park's story were done, too. This is a special book, and an important one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R324KWTSHS9XZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKJHTB8#wasThisHelpful","R324KWTSHS9XZ0","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my favorite writers of all time. Like many, I was first introduced to his writing in high school through The Great Gatsby, which I fell in love with pretty instantaneously, and then devoured everything else he wrote. But while I am familiar with F. Scott Fitzgerald the author, I honestly never knew much about F. Scott Fitzgerald the man, save his tumultuous relationship with his wife, Zelda.Stewart O'Nan's new book, West of Sunset, follows Fitzgerald at the end of his life. In 1937, despite the successes he achieved with his first few books, he is teetering on financial ruin, and his renown has been eclipsed by other American writers, such as Ernest Hemingway. His reputation has been soiled by his days as a violent alcoholic, as well as Zelda's mercurial and sometimes destructive behavior. With nowhere else to turn, he lands a job as a screenwriter in Hollywood.Scott finds Hollywood to be a garden of temptation, of both the alcoholic and female persuasions. He begins working at MGM, and is reunited with old friends like Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell, and Humphrey Bogart and then-wife Mayo Methot. He finds life as a screenwriter not particularly challenging, although he doesn't enjoy having to navigate studio politics, which cause him to be bounced from one film to the next, and he sees his work get edited by other writers and directors. He uses his spare time to try and write another novel, about a powerful movie director, but can't quite muster the confidence.While he tries to immerse himself in Hollywood life, he also tries to be a dutiful husband to Zelda, who is living in a mental hospital, and their daughter, Scottie. And as he struggles with his addiction to alcohol, he meets Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham, and promptly falls in love with her. Their tumultuous relationship, juxtaposed against his financial woes, his on-again, off-again binge drinking, and his guilt over betraying Zelda, causes his health to decline, and his career to do the same.As a fan of old Hollywood, I found this book very interesting, as it touched on movies, actors, directors, and writers that I've heard of, and whose work I've seen over and over again. O'Nan paints Fitzgerald as a tremendously flawed character, desperately trying to redeem himself as a writer, a husband, a father, and a man, and not having much luck on any front. I've always been a fan of O'Nan's storytelling ability, having read all of his books, and while this one moves a bit slow at times, and feels repetitive after the fifth or sixth time Scott's alcoholism relapses, O'Nan's talent is once again on display.This is an enjoyable, but somewhat melancholy, look at an entirely different side of one of literature's leading lions, and some of Hollywood's glory days. If you're as fascinated by movie and literary nostalgia as I am, pick this one up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSK6318KHGDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG9L5M#wasThisHelpful","RCSK6318KHGDK","A3A7DII49DAMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7DII49DAMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Schlage makes an excellent product. I've installed a metric ton of Kwikset knobs and they are, frankly, cheaply made in comparison. Not only is the finish good on the Schlage knob but the mechanism is smooth and the install is easy. As another reviewer noted, you can really crank down on the attachment screws and get this knob on tight. Not that you need to, but there's no worry of anything breaking or popping out of alignment. The same cannot be said of the competition.Can't recommend this enough.

Actually, I bought this thinking it was just Vitamin E oil, not knowing anything about Argan Oil at the time.I've used a few drops on each scar once a day for about 3 months and the scars are almost gone.

"Bought these for under-counter lights over a small wet bar. The install is easy and the light is perfect. I really didn't need three for my application (only about a 42"" upper) but I went ahead and used all three and the light is great. These aren't built like a tank but for the price and for what they are they are fine. My only complaint, and a little one at that, is the variation between the two settings (low and high, essentially) isn't very different. It's kind of like ""On"" and ""On-a-little-more"". Oh well.

"I'm a big fan of these Cooper LED nightlights, in all the configurations (with a switch, with an outlet, and the full nightlight). They are easy to install and look very slick. I tried another brand and it was way too bright and way too blue in color. These are a warm white and the dimming feature is fantastic. At full blast I think they are too bright, but at full dim they are just a soft moonlight-like glow that isn't overpowering even when you wake up in the middle of the night.Pro tip: If you are building or remodeling, position outlets about every 6' on the path to the kitchen and bathrooms to illuminate your way at night. And if you have a separate toilet room put a full nightlight version in there.They are a little expensive but I think they are money well-spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AMI8VRMJ3XO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UNHEAY#wasThisHelpful","R2AMI8VRMJ3XO5","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big fan of Columbia ""breather-back"" shirts. In the hot Texas summers these things are no joke- they really do keep you cool. For no good reason, I only had one of these for many years and I only used it for fishing. This past summer I snapped out of that nonsense and started buying more and wearing them all over. Here's my take on the different shirts, hope this helps you. (for reference I am 5'8"", 175#, 32"" waist and usually wear either an athletic-cut large shirt or a medium if it's cut normally...yes, I live in size hell)Bonehead: This shirt is 100% cotton and is very tough. Makes a great work shirt. It wrinkles easily and has the traditional PFG assortment of pockets on the front. It is the quintessential PFG shirt. It does not fly under the radar but it looks fine for what it is. I have several of these and if you can get them less than $15 that's a great deal. Given the pros of the other shirts, however, I must say this style is my least favorite (but still a great shirt, and my go-to work shirt). I always get a small in this style and it's still roomy at that. It's cut VERY large.Bahama II: Much like the Bonehead in terms of pockets, but it's made of a synthetic fabric. Breathes better and wrinkles less but can still wrinkle. The ""Super Bahama"" version has a print rather than solid colors. Heavier material than the Tamiami. I wear a small in this shirt as well. Not super lightweight but tougher and can be used as a work shirt.Tamiami II: This seems like a refinement of the Bonehead and Bahama. Very light cloth, kind of parachute-like. Different pockets. This, to me, is the coolest (temperature-wise) shirt of the bunch. The ""Super Tamiami"" is the printed version. I wear a small in this one as well and it's my favorite for very hot weather but I would be very hesitant to wear it for work applications. Not as tough as the Bonehead or Bahama. Pretty much wrinkle-free.Baitcaster: Lightweight like the Tamiami but different cut and different pockets. It's kind of a cleaner version of the Tamiami, however, because of the cut I wear a medium in this rather than the small in most of the others. I tried a small and it would button but was tight in the shoulders.Low-Drag Offshore: Another lightweight version with far more conventional pockets and a very clean look. Some colors have contrasting stitching which, in my opinion, looks sharp. The sizing on this is smaller than the Bonehead/Bahama/Tamiami but slightly larger than the Baitcaster. I ordered a small and it fits, barely. By far my favorite design. When I order another I may or may not order up a size to a medium.So there you go. If I seem addicted to these shirts it's because I am. In a hot climate you may be able to find a cooler shirt but if one exists I don't know about it. Retail you can expect to pay anywhere from $30-$60 for these but if you keep an eye out on Amazon getting them as cheap as $11 isn't unheard of.

Not super lightweight but tougher and can be used as a work shirt.Tamiami II: This seems like a refinement of the Bonehead and Bahama. Very light cloth, kind of parachute-like. Different pockets. This, to me, is the coolest (temperature-wise) shirt of the bunch. The ""Super Tamiami"" is the printed version. I wear a small in this one as well and it's my favorite for very hot weather but I would be very hesitant to wear it for work applications. Not as tough as the Bonehead or Bahama. Pretty much wrinkle-free.Baitcaster: Lightweight like the Tamiami but different cut and different pockets. It's kind of a cleaner version of the Tamiami, however, because of the cut I wear a medium in this rather than the small in most of the others. I tried a small and it would button but was tight in the shoulders.Low-Drag Offshore: Another lightweight version with far more conventional pockets and a very clean look. Some colors have contrasting stitching which, in my opinion, looks sharp. The sizing on this is smaller than the Bonehead/Bahama/Tamiami but slightly larger than the Baitcaster. I ordered a small and it fits, barely. By far my favorite design. When I order another I may or may not order up a size to a medium.So there you go. If I seem addicted to these shirts it's because I am. In a hot climate you may be able to find a cooler shirt but if one exists I don't know about it.

"I'm a big fan of Columbia ""breather-back"" shirts. In the hot Texas summers these things are no joke- they really do keep you cool. For no good reason, I only had one of these for many years and I only used it for fishing. This past summer I snapped out of that nonsense and started buying more and wearing them all over. Here's  my take on the different shirts, hope this helps you. (for reference I am 5'8"", 175#, 32"" waist and usually wear either an athletic-cut large shirt or a medium if it's cut normally...yes, I live in size hell)Bonehead: This shirt is 100% cotton and is very tough. Makes a great work shirt. It wrinkles easily and has the traditional PFG assortment of pockets on the front. It is the quintessential PFG shirt. It does not fly under the radar but it looks fine for what it is. I have several of these and if you can get them less than $15 that's a great deal.

"Great construction. An iPhone 6+ will fit as far as width, but it's too tall and doesn't allow the velcro to fasten. I actually purchased this to hold the power brick/charge for a MacBook (without the extension cord) and it works great for that.ATACS looks great as well. My only gripe is the MOLLE straps are kind of goofy. They work, but compared to the 5.11 slick sticks the Hazard4 ones are overly complex and don't hold it as tight to the host as it should, in my opinion. But for this application (inside a backpack) they are fine. Overall a really nice case and I would not hesitate to buy another Hazard4 product based on this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D882CH80CXIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NXZSBI#wasThisHelpful","R1D882CH80CXIL","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got tired of trying to find the perfect backpack so I decided to create an almost-perfect insert and be less picky about the bag. This one from 5.11 pretty much does the trick.I got the small one and it fits perfectly in a normal-sized backpack (Oakley Panel in my case). As with most 5.11 products it is constructed well and has some nice touches like the detachable handle.I'm not crazy about the horizontal PALS webbing on one side...what in the world would you really use that for? I ended up threading a long BlackHawk strip through and then weaving the molle attachments behind that. I think they could have just done conventional vertical PALS on both sides and for most people that would be more useful.I wish it had loop velcro as well, but it doesn't and that's that. Whatever is inside it that makes it ""rigid"" isn't really that rigid, but the nice thing is that it's easily accessible via a velcro flap so if you want to add something to stiffen it up you can. I think I'm going to add a sheet of kydex or something, but it's not a priority.Overall I can recommend this if you're looking for a backpack insert. Not perfect but it does a good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KBAX9R3DDQL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRI1WQM#wasThisHelpful","R2KBAX9R3DDQL1","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I almost always carry a knife and am a fan of larger assisted openers. I needed a smaller, slimmer blade and the Skyline consistently popped up in reviews as a great, slim EDC knife. I've never owned a Kershaw and quite frankly they didn't do anything for me compared to Benchmade, ZT, etc. But for the price I figured sure, why not.This knife is borderline perfect for EDC, for me. It's very slim, has a great feel and stays sharp. I got the Damascus steel version and I've worked it a lot harder than it should be worked and it's never missed a beat. Example: I had to cut the tires off of four golf cart wheels (they were glued to the rim). This should have been a utility knife job but the only knife I had on me was the Skyline so I used it like a rented mule. Never a hiccup. Couldn't be happier with this little gem of a knife.

"I've hunted for years and have a pretty good idea about how coolers work and should work. I bought mine via a charity auction so yes it was expensive but I'm probably a little less sensitive to the cost than someone who bought it retail (even though I paid more). That said, I have very mixed feelings about this cooler.First the good: It's built like a tank. You'll probably own this the rest of your life. Most coolers crack at the hinges even with modest use. Not the case here. I'm about buying quality (""cry once"", right?) so I feel good about not having a buy a new cooler every 2-3 years. Lets be honest, it's also a cool brand. So there's that. And from a performance standpoint it does work well. I don't think it's a game-changer, but it works well.The bad: It's built like a tank. Meaning, it's HEAVY. Really heavy and I'm not a lightweight. Even empty you kind of go ""Gee whiz this is heavy"" and loaded up...yeah, it's a beast. And I have the 35-quart! The big ones, loaded down, would simply be immovable. The capacity is also a bummer. For the size--because of the insulation--it hold less than a comparable normal cooler. I hope that makes sense.Other things to consider: It's a target for theft so you have to lock it down. That's a pain. And lets talk about ice retention for a minute. Does it work well? Yeah I guess so. I totally understand pre-cooling it and not leaving the thing in the direct Texas sun. And I don't want to under-sell it but for me, it's just not that impressive. Especially given the cost.Do I regret the purchase? Nah, it's cool. But honestly my expectations were not that high. If this purchase is a budgetary stretch for you, and/or you expect it to change your life...be prepared. On the other hand, if you are an avid outdoorsman and you have the disposable income, go for it. I give this 5 stars for design, 4 stars for performance, and 3 stars for value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CYSVG72CA0NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U6MHJC#wasThisHelpful","R3CYSVG72CA0NE","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't have a lot of experience with other brand grinders but I do own DeWalt and Milwaukee tools...this Makita seems every bit as stout as those if not more so.

"Shocked that no one has reviewed these yet, so here goes: I recently realized that my work boots were (wait for it) 10 years old. They used to be worn daily and now they are only worn on weekends...but still. I realized how bad it was when I went from running shoes to my old boots and the insoles of my old boots had the give of a granite countertop.I went to a local western wear place and tried on a bunch. The Ariats were, to me, hands-down the most comfortable. I didn't need a steel or composite toe and I like a round toe rather than square. The Groundbreakers were OK but didn't seem as comfortable, so it was a toss-up between the Workhog and the Rigtek. Really liked the sole on the Rigtek so I went that route and ordered them from Amazon.I normally wear a 10.5D in running shoes but the 10D Rigtek seemed to be a good fit. I wore them around the house and while the length was perfect they were just too narrow. Which is odd, because I don't have wide feet and I have never purchased anything other than a D width. So while I LOVED these boots and they look great, ultimately I had to return them due to the narrow width squeezing my feet to the point of being uncomfortable.Follow up: Rather than do the order-and-ship song and dance again I went back to the local store and tired on a BUNCH of Ariat boots. Here's the conclusion I came to... The size, in terms of length, is pretty much spot-on. I think what throws the width off is both the toe configuration (round vs square) and/or the waterproof lining that some boots have. I ended up buying the square toe Workhog in a 10D and it fits like a custom boot. The same boot with the round toe was noticeably more snug, and the waterproof boot was again too tight. Moral of the story: buying these online is a tough deal. But they are great boots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5G11RY8ZUQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3HUQEA#wasThisHelpful","R2F5G11RY8ZUQL","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I re-wired a small utility trailer and it worked great. High-quality wire. Be aware, though, that it won't go as far as you might think. My little trailer is only 5' x 8' with a pretty short tongue and this roll of wire just barely finished the job. When you allocate for the hook-up pigtail, side spans for marker lights and your tail lights, it will go fast. If you have a larger trailer I would imagine you are going to need two rolls for sure. Smaller trailers or just repair applications should be fine with one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19I5LYBG2ZSTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CQQKNI#wasThisHelpful","R19I5LYBG2ZSTB","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice switch but unforgiving on installation. Needs a pretty exact-tolerance hole which I found hard to do in the metal panel I installed mine in. Wouldn't recommend using a hole saw as it's not a precise-enough cut. You really need one of those step bits. Also, the material you mount it in needs to be pretty thin. You can make it work with glue/epoxy in thick material but just be aware.The switch itself is nice and looks to be of good quality.

"I'm goofy about keeping my car clean and for years have pulled a wheeled shop vac around, fighting cords, etc. I've always wanted a wall-mount vac and finally ordered this one. All in all it's a good setup but it's not perfect.For being a WALL MOUNT shop vac the wall mount part is pretty flimsy. I suppose companies like Apple have spoiled us to expect great attention to detail and in this case I'm disappointed. Not to say it's faulty or bad, just cheap. Example: At a cost of exactly $0.00 they could have molded the hose keeper on top another 2"" longer and you'd never fight the hose falling off. As it is, it's barely adequate.I knew going into it that the accessories were kept in a mesh bag. That didn't bother me until I mounted it and now it seems (detect a trend?) cheap.  Look at other models from other companies and you'll see thoughtful designs that integrate accessory storage.So in the end, this is a relatively good value vac that will serve it's purpose. Suction is good and ultimately that's what you're buying this for. If you love great design and attention to detail you'd be wise to spend an extra couple bucks on a nicer machine. For the average homeowner, though, this should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4XVLTRUN6HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006NXIH26#wasThisHelpful","R1V4XVLTRUN6HV","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an older Yamaha G14 golf cart whose previous owner had given a poor paint job. Rather than re-paint it I thought I'd order this vinyl kit. The camo is cool, but it for me it was really just about covering up the paint.I'll say first that the vinyl is very, very high quality and extremely tough. You can pull, stretch, peel it on and off- it's tough stuff. And it looks really good. 5+ stars for quality.The installation is kind of tricky. ""Mossy Oak Graphics"" has a very good YouTube video and I highly recommend you watch that a couple of times. I did my cart myself but this would be so much easier with two sets of hands, even if your helper isn't too handy just having them there would assist you greatly. As the video shows, applying heat makes this vinyl so much easier to work with. If you dont' have one already, buy a $20 heat gun. Not a hair dryer but a heat gun. Trust me, it's money well-spent. You'll also want an Exacto knife with new blades, alcohol to prep (and other alcohol to drink :), lots of paper towels and something comfortable to sit on.Make sure your cart is clean. Make sure your work area is clean. TAKE YOUR TIME. Don't do this when you have an hour to kill and you're in a hurry. You'll regret it. Also, cut carefully. It's not like you have 150% of what you need- they give you just enough and if you cut off scraps like you're trimming a fatty steak then you'll be short in the end. And obviously this stuff isn't cheap. Mark my words: you'll open the roll and think you have waaaaaay too much, you'll get half-way done and be convinced you are going to be short, and in the end you'll be just fine.When done right, the end product looks very, very nice. Try to enjoy the ride- doing curves and radiuses can be a challenge but again, if you take your time and apply heat then you can make this work. I would recommend doing this over the course of at least a few days, if not a week. Do a panel, take a break. Patience and time is your friend here. Rush it and you'll be sad.ON THE OTHER HAND (!), if you don't have the patience or the time, I would suggest you consider either painting your cart, getting the body hydro-dipped, or getting a professional to do this. It's not brain surgery, but it certainly isn't for the faint of heart. If you're thinking you're going to be slapping on an over-sized bumper sticker think again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZEH7P8VNJIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0T0WV0#wasThisHelpful","R2CZEH7P8VNJIK","AUKQYNHAWG6MS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUKQYNHAWG6MS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A month ago I would have rated this 5+ stars. Love it. Then I noticed that one side of the string had pulled through from the rubber part. A quick tug and the OTHER side pulled out. See attached photo.This looks cool and worked good for a short while, but for the long-term it's a poor design. They should have made a loop and molded the rubber around the loop, not open ends. Or they could have knotted the ends, something to keep it from pulling loose from the rubber. It's a crappy design. Unfortunately it's not unique to Chum's products- I had a set of aircraft cable sunglass keepers and the cable pulled out of the rubber end in the same way. Chums could be really, really awesome but they haven't done a good job, in my opinion, of figuring out the rubber overmold process.

"Got this for giving (and getting) back massages. It's OK- not as easy to use as you would imagine. I think you'd almost be better off with just a fixed round/spherical object.

"I've used all different types of earbuds (Etymotic, Shure, JVC, Panasonic, Philips, you name it) and am always on the lookout for a budget earbud that's a real find. I've never owned any MEE but the Head-Fi reviews were solid so I thought meh, why not. In short: Great decision. I'll try to keep this brief. Overall construction is solid with a good cable and good attention to detail. The remote works like a champ and in fact is one of my favorite features while running. I haven't used the mic yet so I can't speak to call quality but the volume control and button work great.Fit is above average, in my opinion, with the memory wire working well and the in-ear fit being excellent. You get 6 sets of tips, I believe it is, so play around and you should be able to find a combination that works for you.Sound is good with excellent bass and overall good sound. Are they my favorite for sound? Mmmm, jury is still out on that one. I have a burned-in set of JVC FX40's with Comply's that are kind of my go-to earbuds in terms of great sound, but for what these are--working out and running earbuds--the sound is great.You also get a very nice zippered case, a shirt clip, and as I mentioned 6 different tips. All for what, like $21?? That's a steal. That would be a steal if the sound quality was just OK, but it's actually very good. I know reading these reviews can become exhausting, and you are NEVER going to find the perfect set of earbuds because so many of the qualities being rated are personal and subjective. But speaking as objectively as possible, these are good earbuds with an excellent value.

"Basically it's easier to tell you what I don't own in pencils, than list all that I do. The only 2 (two) colored pencils of the professional/artist quality are the Pantone, and Fellisimo that I don't own. Coloring is not a new trend for me, which is why I've been collecting art pencils over a course of several years. While Caran D' Ache is one of the best and highest rated products for artist, I hate to say that this is my least used colored pencil, at least for using in coloring books. I'm sure I still need to try using these on an art quality paper like Stone Hedge, or Bristol board. My experience using these in coloring books was they did not lay down enough pigment, I could not layer with them, but the worst part was, using these as a watercolor pencil. When I applied the water it made the pigment all but disappear. Colors seperated, and faded away.I've got the set of 120, aside from a few other artist quality brands I owned at the time Prisma, and Derwent, I had great expectations for these being from Caran D' Ache.

My only complaint is the feathers aren't in very securely, I would recommend applying a small amount of non toxic glue, inside the rubber cap to prevent your cats from so easily pulling it's feathers out. Otherwise this is the best feather toy I've bought, and I've gone through several other types as cats seem to enjoy the feather teasers best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCBZA8N2U9N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZLEQ4U#wasThisHelpful","RRCBZA8N2U9N2","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This arrived much earlier than was predicted by Amazon. Well made of durable acrylic, and well thought out for practical use. Because I like to keep several tanks filled with a variety of flavors, and keep coils from getting mixed, this allows me to have up to 7 tanks, and 6 different e juice out which helps me keep track of which flavor is in which tank. It holds 6 /30 mil. Bottles, 4 /15 mil. And there are 6 holes on the back row that could hold  tanks. The 7 holes on the front bottom row can either hold tanks, or 15 mil bottles. I like that the holes on front row also have a small hole in the very bottom, which accommodates the thread on the bottom of a tank, so they sit flush upright. The piece of wood they sent, with the company logo, I used as a base to the whole unit, that way if a tank should leak it won't get on my table.I think this was well thought out. For me having 6 tanks, and 6 different flavors loaded at one time is plenty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAOC4FGJM0J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9I5GWK#wasThisHelpful","RIAOC4FGJM0J9","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been feeding my cat the Vitri-Lysine brand for about one year, he's accustomed to eating a few every morning.

"Marjorie Sarnat is making quite a splash with what I believe is now her 3rd coloring book. Most enjoyable, well drawn, highly detailed, and intricate. So glad to see that her coloring books are also being published under Dover's Creative Haven title. As I think many are aware of by now, Creative Haven coloring are single print on a pretty decent quality paper, that takes all mediums quite nicely.31 images just waiting for you to color.I used to scan and reprint my coloring books, but thanks to the Creative Haven line, this is no longer necessary. I enjoy coloring with my Prisma markers, which are an alcohol based marker and notorious for bleed through. I also apply colored pencil over the markers for a more vibrant look, thankfully the weight of paper used in all Creative haven books allow me to color in the fashion I enjoy.This book will take me considerably longer, as each page is such a full compostion, but well worth the time and effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAM2CJLQW18C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486789640#wasThisHelpful","R1QAM2CJLQW18C","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marty Noble is such a wonderful artist, who else could make bugs SOoo much fun to color?! I'm pretty sure I've got most all of Marty Nobles coloring books. I held off on acquiring this one, now that I have it, not sure why. Just colored my first, only to discover this isn't like coloring bugsat all, but more like coloring very well balanced, intricate designs.Like all of Marty Nobles illustrations, each one is a well thought out compostion, complete with beautiful borders, florals, and well balanced designs.I feel so very fortunate that Marty takes time to illustrate such incredible coloring books for the coloring community. There is not a page that doesn't beg to be colored.Being a Creative Haven means there are 31 single print pages ready for your enjoyment. Because they are print on one side only, these books are ideal for using markers, water color pencils, color pencils and gel pens. On my example I've colored directly in the book using my Prisma markers, and some colored pencil over the marker. The paper, which is of a very nice quality stands up to all markers. Because Prisma's are notorious for bleed through, I just placed a sheet of printer paper behind it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D8XF9030OJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486494993#wasThisHelpful","R10D8XF9030OJU","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE ALL of Ming Ju Sun's fashion illustrations, and this one is one of her newer. Illustrated in a great size for coloring, clean, concise fine line illustrations, with good detail, and floral backgrounds. Lovely prints on fabrics. What I enjoy about coloring fashion is deciding how I want the fashion to look. One of my favorite genres for coloring is fashion, as I love to bring the fabric to life.This being a Creative Haven means each page is single print, nothing on the backside, which makes these great for using all mediums, from watercolor, felt markers, colored pencils ect...,31 pictures to color, all ranging from the 1920's through the 1950's. Day wear, evening wear, hats, fur, lace, you name it it's all here. Every outfit a detailed fabric begging to be colored.If you love coloring fashion this book is a must have , even if you don't, this is a good book to discover your own potential for  fashion and fabrics.This is just one more book I don't see a single page I won't want to color.

"Well Pam S. took the words right out of mouth. I've been using this for the past 11 years. I can't shower without it, this has become such a central part of my daily hygiene. I Use this before I step out of shower, applying with water still on skin. Then air dry, or towel blot, this does not leave my skin all oily. It does have a lovely light scent, which I equate to a very light clean powdery smell (that does not over power or inter mingle with fragrance) it actually helps carry my perfume, and seems to make my perfume last longer.This is such a terrific product. I have used lotions and potions sense I was a teenager. ( now a senior) while even the best and lightest lotions, body butters etc... can leave your skin feeling waxy and suffocated, with fragrance that can clash with perfume, this body oil does not.While lotions only give dry skin temporary relief from dry skin, this really seems like giving your skin a good drink of fresh water, leaving your skin so moisturized, there is no need for lotions.Well I think I've said more than enough, without saying the words 'I love this product' and I truly do, can't shower without it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJ34QVNNY1MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ2NL8C#wasThisHelpful","R2MJ34QVNNY1MC","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely elated after carefully looking at each page, the day it arrived. Every page just begging to be colored. From very creative styles of Victorian based Steam Punk fashion, Marty tied it all together with exactly the right hair style, and accessories. Her figures are in perfect proportion, NOTHING is out of step or amiss.As a serious colorist I favor Marty Nobles coloring books because her illustration are always well balanced use of space, beautiful designs, boarders, intricate, and detail oriented, clean concise line drawings, with no broken, disconnected  or over lapping lines. Coloring fashion is one of my favorite genre for coloring, but this book I found to be exceptionally awe-inspiring reason for being is with this book there is not a single page I won't want color. Being of the Creative Haven series means this book contains 31 black and white illustrations, print on one side of very nice quality paper. This is a toothier paper than typical bond type paper which is used in many coloring books. This paper is heavy enough to accommodate all mediums from colored pencils, and felt markers to water based colored pencils, and gel pens. Each page is perforated for easy removal.I believe this book will fast become a favorite for many of my fellow colorist.

Even gels pens would be too large in most cases, and because these are double sided print, unless you scanned and reprint the drawing you wanted to color, you'll ruin the page on the opposite side.This is just a different type of coloring than what I typically am inspired to do. I enjoy shading, and coloring space, be it fashion, floral, or designs. About all you could do is struggle with fine tip pens, just not my thing.There were some nice designs in this book, but very intricate, too small to be enjoyable for me.

"Sorry to say for the price I was sorely disappointed. I guess this is just not what type of coloring I enjoy. These drawings are small, overly simple line drawings. The overall book is only 63/4""x 61/2"". Too small to be enjoyable. The book is print on a nice quality paper, and is put together in a nice format whereas each page is preforated, however these are  the best attributes to the book. The drawings lack consistancy and theme. Overall I was very disappointed with this purchase.Nothing against everyone that loves or enjoys this book, this is just not my personal idea of what makes for a nice coloring exercise. Also I have been purchasing and collecting coloring books for many years, I own more than I could comfortably admit to, which accounts for my being more critical as to what I will keep for coloring.In all fairness this book requires different type of coloring than that which I am accustomed to.

"Marty Noble illustrates the nicest books for colorists, being the artist she is,understand how to illustrate pictures that will inspire to be colored. Clean concise line drawings, complete compostions. Nicely detailed, without being overly intricate. I am also happy to say that Dover has gotton away from that 'green' paper they were using, it seems they have listened to their customers, and have gone back to using a much better quality paper. The Creative Haven books are print on one side, the paper used in these books are of a nice weight. Great for all mediums, colored pencil, felt markers, gel pens ect...,This book is a lovely compilation of the designs from from Magnificent Mehndi Designs, and her first Mehndi Designs. The first Mehndi designs were based more on the Henna tattoo body art, while Magnificent Mehndi designs are more animal, floral, and paisley inspired. All the designs reflect an style from authentic Indian, African, and Middle East designs.

"Like Lola I have most professional colored pencils in my collection such asFaber Castell  (Albreicht Duer) Caran De Ache (Pablos), Faber Castel (Poly Chromos),,, Stadler (Karat), Mitsubishi Uni, Tom Bow (Irojiten), Lyra, Derwent,(Colour Soft, Artist) Prisma, Creata Color,( Urban So Ho & Karmina) etc...,at first I compared these to a poly chromos, but now after having used these quite alot I can honestly say they color like nothing else. They color smoother and creamier than a Stadtler Karat, ( and Albreicht Duer which are about the creamiest pencils) I find the Holbien is what I prefer to lay down first because it colors the smoothest of all my pencils. What sets these apart from the poly chromes is they color with a transparency I've yet to acheieve with any other pencil. Just when I think I can't get down another layer, with the Holbiens I can, no matter how much pencil I've put down, even after burnishing and I don't get ANY wax bloom!Always pencils behave differently according to the paper you are working on. I have found several coloring books with a smooth bond type of paper that almost seem to repell some of my best artist pencils like the Faber Castells, and Caran De' Ache. So again, this is another bonus for the Holbiens, so far I've yet to discover a coloring book or paper that these don't color beautifully on. These have become my favorite of all my pencils. I still don't work with them alone, typically I work with at least 3 to 4 different brands at once, due to coloring in many layers.The Holbiens arent as soft or waxy as the Prisma, and don't put down quite as much pigment, so if I had to compare I'd say they color more like a poly chromo, but I believe they are much softer than a poly chromo, and you can acheive a beautiful transparency to your colors that you can't get with a poly chromo, or a Prisma.The other thing I love about this set of 150 colors is the pastel tray. There are such beautiful colors that are not available in any other set. These have become colors I find I'm using the most. I've also not had a single broken lead, they sharpen the best.As far as wondering if your set is 100 or 150 colors, read the description. Most vendors use a 'stock' photo which may or may not be exactly what a person is expecting, so always read the description. My set was the 150 pencils set, I got it for such a steal, I was afraid possibly it's because it might be the set of 100 instead, which led me to call Amazon to verify exactly what I could expect. I was assured it was the set of 150, I couldn't be happier for getting these, as they are still a very difficult pencil to acquire in the states. Well worth the money when you can secure these from Amazon, and not have to pay for shipping charges from Japan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDBFNJ5FBJQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GQ37ZW#wasThisHelpful","R2EDBFNJ5FBJQC","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having not been familiar with Impact books, or this illustrator Barbara Lanza, I was surprised to see my mother's completed copy. Good clean contour line drawings. 47 pictures of fairies, of all ages to color. Her fairies look original, none that I have seen before. No broken, unconnected, or over lapping lines. The paper is of a reasonable grade. Not toothy but smooth, heavier than what I see being used in many books. These pictures are an excellent size for coloring, not too small, or overly intricate, and not too simplistic, just nicely drawn, well balanced compositions.

"Extremely well made, and well thought out in terms of what cats enjoy. Sturdy built to last. The people designing these toys have really gotten into a cats head, they understand the  activities come natural to our feline friends. I play with my 2 year old, 17lb boy, Charlie twice a day, though sometimes I wish he'd play be himself, which is why I've begun making this nominal investment, in these Catit toys. Both pleasantly surprised, and very pleased with the quality put into these products.I love that you can build and add to making this as complete as you please. Oh...,one more thing to love about this, is the way the ball keeps a pretty consistent movement, due to the way this is designed. The end caps are shaped in such a way, that pushes the ball back the other direction, which in turn helps keep the ball in motion, which also helps hold the cats attention. I definitely plan on adding to this system.

So far my PC is behaving lighting fast, no more crashing, and it's working like a brand new PC.I would say, if you are experiencing issues, even if your not, Ccleaner is simply just GOOD software to have in your PC, even before you start having problems! Money well spent, problems fixed, and now I've got my piece of mind back!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HGD20I63ZRVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BS42EW4#wasThisHelpful","R2HGD20I63ZRVI","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat LOVES this stuff!, and since everyone has jumped on the 'awareness band wagon of nutrition', I do also. Real chicken, and salmon listed as the first ingredients. Granted there are still better choices out there, when considering ingredients, but those cost a small fortune. Purina( who's been around forever) has listened to what consumers are asking for, and made it available in an affordable, and what I believe to be reasonably decent nutritional recipe. After having tried several different dry foods, (and my Charlie wasn't particularly picky) he did begin to show a preference for this particular food. The others this won out over were Science Diet,  and Fancy Feast, just to name a few.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFPACI5FMVRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AH3RR#wasThisHelpful","R3PFPACI5FMVRP","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The BEST mandalas I've seen, and 50 of them, print  on one side only!  Which as every colorist knows is ideal for coloring with markers. Angie Grace has been a busy lady! Not sure exactly how many coloring books she's published to date, but I am wildly impressed with her mandalas. Beautifully intricate, nicely balanced, and uniform. Clearly she must have training in technical pen, as her lines are impeccable, no unconnected, or unfinished or broken lines anywhere. Intricate without being overly so. Balanced in the amount of size and shapes. Uniform in that her designs maintain perfectly even spacing all the way around, which are difficult to find in hand drawn designs. The paper used in her books is consistent from one book to the next, which is a better quality than what most coloring books are using today. I enjoy coloring mandalas for an exercise in playing with color, when I need a break from my regular type of coloring. This book makes an excellent gift, or addition to any colorist book collection, if you've not yet added this one to yours, you don't know what you're missing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSMT5LPA8UCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508582211#wasThisHelpful","RYSMT5LPA8UCS","A12392BNWYYHN6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12392BNWYYHN6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What could possibly be so bad about his past that he feels her innocence is in jeopardy if he discloses his past?This author's stories are classy and steamy all at the same time.

Call it pheromones, chemistry, fate... whatever, the attraction is there unrelenting and seeking to fulfill our need to find our other half that completes us.Lucy and Drake are like this from the moment they met in person.  This was no simple crush or infatuation.  It was like they could look at each other and know they had found the one and only.  Their courtship was on steroids from that moment on as far as Drake was concerned.  He did not have much time for courtship with the election around the corner.

Take the journey with Brandon and Zoe as they attempt to piece together his memory and keep him from going over the edge with his fiancee.The story is told in 3 books, releasing one month apart... so I am waiting eagerly for the next part of this story.

"To a lover, an intimate kiss can mean everything. When a relationship is young and you have not shared how you feel about each other, an intimate kiss will relay the depth of your emotions, that connection that spurs bonding, lust, and ultimately helps the lovers transcend the mundane and primal urges.A BDSM relationship does not revolve around the depth of romantic emotions. It revolves around trust, respect and the connection that makes the power exchange between the participants the ultimate high. As far as Jacob is concerned, the emotions he feels for Vivienne will only ruin the Dom/sub link they are trying to create.Vivienne is totally clueless as to what is required for this type of relationship. All she knows is how she feels toward Jacob. She is jealous of any woman that touches or seems to flirt with him. Feeling so inadequate to hold on to Jacob, her emotions get the best of her.I love the interplay between this couple as they attempt to create a relationship. Jealousy, domination, possessiveness and control all come to play as they attempt to build the trust needed to further their relationship. As always, I cannot get enough of this story.

"Call it destiny, life's little twists, Karma, serendipity... but sometimes you are presented with situations where what you decide to do will shape the rest of your life.Beth is just trying to recuperate from the scandal her soon-to-be-husband has created.  Little did she know he has been cheating on her for the past four years of their married life.  It is true he is a country rock star, but he made vows to stay true to her and their love.  Over thirty women have come forward with details of their affair with Troy and the paparazzi has been relentless.  Now, a chance meeting with Jonah Masters, while she is on an outing with her best friends, is nothing short of serendipitous.

She has a way of creating characters that are hard to forget.Now this book has me with mixed feelings.  I do not like vampires, but yet she has a very interesting plotline going here.  There is the usual attraction to the scent and figure of the vampire by the prey.  Unusual is the fact that Alasdair is willing to delay feeding because of the heightened rush of the anticipation.  When he finally bites his prey... things become very unusual.  I won't spoil it for you.There is a mystery to resolve!  The Ancients are in peril!

"Life does not always work the way we planned it.  As a matter of fact, it seldom does.  The one thing I think most of us hope for is to live a clean life, make our parents proud, and be reaffirmed we did our best.That is not the case with our main character Kace.  He planned to be the boxer he could be - his trainer betrayed him by giving him supplements laced with steroids.  Forget a career in boxing.  He tried to make his parents proud of him - forget that after the scandal broke about the steroids.  He was blamed as a user and he lost his will to redeem himself.  As to an affirmation he did his best, well, he killed a man when he lost his temper one drunken night.  Now Kace is really ""the walking dead"".  He says to Jett he died the night he killed that man, and now his focus is on making sure he pays for the death he caused.His love affair with Lyla should be what brings him out of his funk.  He feels so guilty, though, he is unable to even allow himself to be happy in love with her.  Lyla is like the other half of his soul.  They both came from the wrong side of the railroad tracks and worked to get out of the gutter.  They are raw and exposed, yet still with the spirit to continue looking for a way to move ahead.Repentance is a story that reminds us sometimes we don't have all the facts because we are blinded by our own lack of self-esteem.  We are all sinners and sometimes life just pounds us with might be insurmountable obstacles.  It is up to us to find solutions and attempt to improve our lives rather than wallow in self-pity.  This is a story of bringing hope back into our lives and doing the best we can with our circumstances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271C4FXH1DCZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GQ8LEY#wasThisHelpful","R271C4FXH1DCZW","A2ZU73E6RDADJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZU73E6RDADJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Are you a fan of the original STAR WARS trilogy? Then, you will fit right in with Adam and the lovely Solo. Yes, she is a girl but with two dads that worship Harrison Ford. What else would they have called their daughter?Our two main characters are very young... barely in their twenties. They are mature for their age, but let's face it, they are still young and fragile. With all the pressures on Adam to come up with money to pay his mother's medical bills, he has no choice than to do erotic modeling. What is that you say? Next time you look at a hottie in their briefs where little is left to the imagination you will know. Let's face it! We all look for the tattoos, the flexed muscles, the magical ""V"", pecs of a Hercules, and sometimes we even glance below the belt and go WOW! Yep! That is what our gorgeous Adam has signed up for in order to make money fast.Solo just happens to be the social media guru working for the photographer who has hired Adam. She is a gorgeous, petite girl who is very careful with these models. She does not want her broken again.Now that I have set the stage for you, imagine all the possibilities for frolic and enjoyment when these two are mixed together.

"I received an ARC from a new author by the name of Cole Saint James. The book is called The Heart Breaker. As I already started reading it and must say I was VERY IMPRESSED. It had a great unique storyline, well-written, surprisingly sensitive and erotic at the same time.As I continued to read, I realized how deeply in tune the author was with his characters. The emotions, perils, and dreams of the characters in this book were all exposed in a way I could not help but be involved. This is a sensual book too, but it is not your typical sex on every page book. It goes deeper. It felt like the author was courting the readers with details about the main characters and creating the anticipation they would feel when faced with a new love interest. By the time the lovers consummate their need, you understand their reactions and feel the blossoming emotions with every word you read.I am so glad I was able to read this author's work! I will be following his career from now on. A man that can be this in tune with his emotions and write about his fictional characters in such a style is a romantic and worth reading. I love romance!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15I72IBZ29QGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131PQP6I#wasThisHelpful","R15I72IBZ29QGO","A2ZU73E6RDADJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZU73E6RDADJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TRUST is a commodity Chad cannot afford to give. He trusts no one, except his best friend Jared and his sister Amy. If you have been reading this series, you know by now that Chad has spent the last six years running and dodging the men who will stop at nothing to retrieve the cylinder he found. Now with his parents dead, these killers after him, and Amy in danger, he is faced with the fact he must find a solution to this problem once and for all.To use the common cliche of ""rollercoaster ride"" does not even begin to express the turmoil Chad is going through. Saved by a beautiful stranger, unable to trust her, knowing someone has betrayed his whereabouts and facing torture are but a few of the highlights.Once again, Lisa Renee Jones takes us on a magic carpet ride with this gripping story. Nail-biting, at the edge of your seats thrills and a scorching hot seductive love affair is what you are in for. Watch for the plot twists and be amazed. One more book remains in this thrilling series. Unbroken is promised for September of this year, so we only have one more month to wait for the final conclusion.

"Waking up with no memories of who you are must be not only disconcerting but paralyzing. This is how our Jane Doe starts to live her new life. Beaten, pummeled within an inch of her life, and left in a dumpster to meet her maker, she is brought back to life. The police cannot find any reports of missing persons in the entire State of Florida. Her fingerprints are not in file. No one can tell if she is a minor ... what is her age?  Homeless, hungry and at death's door, Jane Doe meets Brantley King on the day of his release from jail. While friends are partying around them, Doe is looking for food peace and quiet when they meet. Like a thunderbolt, King realizes she is different and is the one for him. Their courtship is shocking and unconventional to say the least. Their connection is unavoidable, and once King allows Doe to see behind his facade, the two of them cannot deny what is happening between them.This is the gripping story of two lost souls who in a very unconventional way , reach out to each other and bond.  Reading this book made me think about the bonds we make as human beings.  We are born into a family we did not choose to begin with.  As our lives unfold, we get the chance to bring into our ""family"" people we grow to love, respect and admire.  This ""family"" we choose for ourselves is the most powerful support system we can possibly have in life.  More than blood connection, this is the family we created with our life experiences.  Their members are the ones who will stand fast by our sides in times of trouble and in times of joy.Be aware our characters are part of an underworld of drugs, murderers, and lawless characters. They are a law within themselves. Their world is one of kill or be killed, yet they are human beings too, with all the dreams they dare to hope for.  I read this at one sitting because I was unable to put this book down. It is gut-wrenching. If you enjoy plotlines with an edge, this book is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GH5QV3BWS49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT5QTJS#wasThisHelpful","R11GH5QV3BWS49","A2ZU73E6RDADJV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZU73E6RDADJV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wrist measures 5.5"" around, and the small/medium brace meant for 5-8"" wrists is almost too large. I have to pull the strap to its furthest point and the velcro barely has anything left to ""hook"" to.  It is also a bit loose around the hand, so I would love a XS/Small version of this even more.  That said, it feels good on and helps with the tingling and aching, especially when I wear it over night. It's very lightweight, so I don't notice it, and it is slim enough not to stretch my sweater sleeves out much.  When wearing long sleeves, it's hard to tell you're wearing anything except ""hand warmer"" inner sleeves (like the kind that come in athletic long sleeve gear).There's an inner ""sock"" of thin fabric that goes under the velcro straps to make it even more comfortable.

"Works better than my Shark navigator, and has all the right parts to clean carpet and hard flooring perfectly.  The dusting mit attachment is amazing on hardwood, since the brush only gets up larger particles, not fine dust.The suction is quite good, and the weight is also decent for using on the whole house.

"Set #15  The colors are all thin and take 3x as long as the regular sets to cure.  They're also blacklight reactive, so the colors are a bit pasty.  4 of the colors are identical in daylight (neon red/orange).

"Works great for a narrow person, but is uncomfortable for wider shoulders. Great length for a tall person (6'2"" fits perfectly) but the width means your shoulders are resting on the metal support bars.  Because the fabric works similarly to a hammock, the bars are a little higher than the fabric platform, creating a metal lip your shoulders rest on if you're not a small person.

The screw-clamp portion of this device is all plastic (the nut and the threaded rod it goes onto), but it is about 3"" longer than most of the lightweight cheapie versions of soap pumps available in the big box stores.  This makes it a lot easier to install, plus the clamp nut is designed to be tightened by hand with finger ""wings"" to push/grab. The cheap versions need a wrench, and if you've tried to install one of these with a wrench after a sink is installed in the counter, you will appreciate the finger--tightening nut.  There simply isn't enough room to get your hands plus a wrench in there without being made of rubber.

"1) Sound quality on PCs was terrible.  Even before you speak, it transmits a load of loud electrical humming. When you do speak, it hums over you.  There were no windows settings that altered this, and it was the same on two very different windows machines. Window recording device settings, etc, did nothing to curb the hum.  I tried connecting it through multiple USB dock locations and then several different intermediary USB device as suggested, and it was still terrible.  Using the device wired or wireless was equally bad.2) Pain in the backside to synch. It took over an hour of doing as the manual directed to get the headset to synch to the receiver, despite being only a foot or so away from each other.  I don't know why it finally worked, but it needed to be resynched after each power-down, each time taking several minutes.3) The head band is too large for a woman or smaller man's head. The ear cups hang off the top of your ears unsupported by the head band. It is not adjustable.4) The manual is a joke, and you need software for some windows machines that is not supplied in the box. You'll need to download the proper Turtle Beach wizard for your machine to detect the device.  The manual supplies very little information and simply assumes you plug the thing in and it works.  If you're running windows 8, this will likely not be the case.I get better sound transmission quality from a $5 headset I bought to fill the gap until I could order a better one.

"Works on fine, straight, thin (but very dry) hair. Scalp and hair gets clean, without feeling at all greasy.  Also, you don't have to use as much product per use as the ""Wen"" system requires, so a bottle should last a while.The shampoo reminds me of Noxema face cleanser, or cold cream; it feels a bit cool, and it cleanses, but isn't soapy. The scent is quite medicinal (with a strong hit of lemon grass) and it lingers, in case perfumes bother you.  The conditioner feels like normal conditioner, but it rinses out better than most without a greasy feel.My not-curly hair is chemically damaged, so it needs a lot of moisture to keep it from looking and feeling dry. Silicones in normal conditioner mask the problem for a while, but actually make the internal dryness worse.  This set works much better, and doesn't just mask the problem with a coating of shine. My hair is shinier with this stuff than it ever was with silicone balms, mists, or conditioners, and much softer.If your hair is extra dry, tangly, or has natural texture you want to enhance, I would suggest using a little bit of the conditioner in your towel dried hair for detangling and softness. The rinse-out steps do rinse out clean, so you may need that last ""no rinse"" step.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJHXTIA0BI8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XN2NMK#wasThisHelpful","R2BJHXTIA0BI8E","A225UWT247BBBH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A225UWT247BBBH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really great at sucking up leaves directly from rubber bark mulch and pea gravel if you're careful. The vacuum bag seems well built to me, but I haven't used it for more than a year yet.The blower's multiple speeds are great. More than enough to blow sand out of the grooves of concrete or decking, and it'll blow dry leaves quite a ways.  The only trouble you'll have is with wet sticky leaves; those don't move very well if they're stuck to stones, concrete, or mulch.Easy to use. I suggest a heavy duty gauge extension cord if you need more than 50 feet of length. The power seemed to dwindle a bit using a medium-duty cord.Quieter than gas powered blowers, by far, but still noisy.

"Dark Places by Gillian Flynn is a 2009 publication.After reading Gone Girl, I was chomping at the bit to read more from this author.  I dived into Sharp  Objects,  and it was good too,  just very different.  But, as time passed, I forgot about this book, and it sat on my TBR list for a long, long time.A few weeks ago I was browsing through Amazon prime movies and noticed this book has been made into a movie starring Charlize Theron. What? I had no idea.  Well, I didn't even bother looking at the ratings or reading the reviews for it, but instead, I went in search of the book, remembering suddenly that I had been excited to read it a few years back.I really don't know what to say or how to feel about this book.  It certainly doesn't measure up to  the other books I've read by this author.The story is just very busy and  complicated, and the flashbacks delved too deeply into matters that didn't pertain to the story all that much and didn't add much insight, which took me out of the story.  I really struggled to stay interested and had to exercise all my self control not to skim or skip ahead.Libby survives a vicious attack on her family that leaves her mother and two sisters dead, and her brother in prison accused of the crime.  Now, in  her thirties,  Libby is flat broke, so when she is approached by a Kill Club a group of people obsessed with notorious murder cases, she sees a chance to cash in on her tragedy.  She is stunned to discover that many people in the group are not convinced her brother, Ben, is guilty,  something she has taken at face value all these years.After hearing some the contradictions in the case, Libby begins to have second thoughts about Ben's guilt , and with the help of a group member, she begins to piece together what really happened to her family all those years ago, and it's not as cut and dried as she had thought.Is Ben innocent or did he have an accomplice?  Was it a stranger to the family, or an enemy of her father's or someone seeking revenge for an alleged crime.. or all of the above?  Libby's journey will take her to many dark places before she's able to see the light.This book has the trademark twist and turns that we expect from this author, and the very dark subject matter, too.  Gillian Flynn is a master at writing books in which none of the main characters are all that likeable.  I wanted to like Libby, pull for her, cheer her on, and see her finally find closure, but she was not exactly the warmest person in the world and certainly has her own foibles.It seems that nearly all the characters were morally bankrupt in one way or another, some more than others.  So, if you are one of the few who hasn't read this book yet, don't expect things to turn out rosy in the end with everything tied up nice and tidy with a big bow on top.This is one weird story, but it does, in a strange way, have a modern day noir feel to it, however, if that was what the author was going for, it didn't quite work.  I  ended up feeling irritated at the pacing of the story, and after all that frustration, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy when I got to the end.As a side note, after finishing the book, I did go back to see what people thought of the movie, and the general consensus was that it's an okay movie, maybe a little above average, according to Amazon reviewers, so out of curiosity, I might give it a try and see what Hollywood's take is on this very odd story.I'm still on the fence about my rating, but will settle for a 2.5 rounded to 3","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NV83E76N47YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307341569#wasThisHelpful","R1NV83E76N47YE","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead in her Tracks by Kendra Elliot is a 2015 Montlake Publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This is the second book in the Rogue Winter novella arc.  The first book is Track of Her Tears by Melinda Leigh and I highly recommend reading it first, if possible, since the two stories tie in together.  However, this one can be read a stand alone too.Zane and Stevie have their hands full on Christmas day when the body of a young girl is found in a seedy motel room and the prime suspect is already sitting in jail.  When a shocking and unexpected hitch in the case occurs, Zane and Stevie must start all over at square one to determine who is killing young women in Solitude.On the personal side of things Zane is finally getting Stevie to consider taking the next step in their relationship, especially now that Stevie sees her mother's predictions seem to be accurate after all. This is another well written, fast paced thriller by Kendra Elliot, and for such a short story,  this one packs a solid punch.  This is certainly not your typical holiday reading, that's for sure.But, never fear, there are a few lighter moments and some really sweet romantic gestures too, which will put all the lurid crime elements into perspective in the end.I really love this series and hope to see a lengthier novel- or two- in the near future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TVEYM0TGAOYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG3S9UU#wasThisHelpful","R1TVEYM0TGAOYA","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracks of her Tears by Melinda Leigh  A Rogue Winter Novella is a 2015  Montlake publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.It  is the holiday season in Solitude, Oregon, but it's anything but merry and bright.  When Carly's brother, Bruce goes missing and his girlfriend is found murdered, it's up to Seth, to solve the case and keep his family safe.It seems like it's been a long time since I have touched base with this series, so I was happy to see a pair of novellas coming out this month- this one from Melinda Leigh and Dead in Her Tracks By Kendra Elliot.This story reunites us with Seth and Carly, who are back together and making their marriage the top priority is their lives now.  But, when Bruce's girlfriend is found murdered,  they find it hard to find balance in their personal lives, especially when a young child is left without parents.This is one action packed story, though,  a little gritty, and pretty realistic as the author showcases just how dumb criminals can be and the horrible consequences of their actions.I was happy to touch base with Seth and Carly, and am thankful that this couple are working things out, and that for once, Seth didn't get on my last nerve. He is really coming along, and showed that he can stick to his guns when it comes to trusting his wife and letting her do her job, just like he has to do his.  The pair actually worked together on this one and make a pretty darned good team, if you ask me.While the circumstances are sad for many concerned, there is a bright ray of light that  we see shining through in the end and it looks like Carly, Seth and Brianna will have a very Merry Christmas!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQ88HLFEKYHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG3S9W8#wasThisHelpful","R1GQ88HLFEKYHX","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little House Living: The Make Your Own Guide to a Frugal, Simple, Self-Sufficient Life by Merissa Alink is a 2015 Gallery Books publication. I was provided a copy of this book as an XOXpert, the official street team of XOXO After Dark.I admit I grew up in the era of quick and convenient. I bought pre- mixed cake mixes and scoffed at the idea of making anything from scratch. Instead of home remedies, I bought over the counter pain relievers and cold medicines, and never would have considered making my own soap, dish detergent, or other household products.But, my daughter would tell me about making her own facial scrubs and using peppermint essential oils for various maladies, but I still never imagined myself doing any of these things myself. First of all, you have to buy all the ingredients, and when I did the math, and figured in the amount of time it would take, I figured I was just as well off buying it from the store until I got this book.First of all, it should be noted that this is not just a recipe book for cooking or food. This book has a little bit of everything in it.Body and Beauty 'do it yourself' recipes such as:Bath SaltsLip BalmHand SoapChest RubHousehold items such as:Dish SoapFloor CleanerDusting Spray and furniture polishWindow CleanerIdeas for Children and PetsDiaper Rash CreamPlay DohPet treat mixPet Flea WashAnd of course food-Make ahead mixes:cake mixHamburger help mixOnion soupHot chocolateBreadThese are just a few examples of the items listed that you can make yourself at home.Are you on a busy schedule and don't think you would have time to make your own products? This book is packed with very easy recipes for those on a busy schedule, such as deodorizer disc made out of everyday baking soda and water with a drop or two of essential oils, placed in a muffin tin and left to dry for a day or two. The disc can be placed discretely in odor prone areas of your home. It took me all of five minutes to do this, and the essential oil is not necessary. Baking soda is a natural odor absorber.The cost? Well, for some of the projects, there would have to be some investment on your part, especially if you want to put the mixtures into cute containers and such. I made the chest rub, but I didn't have a glass jar to put it in, but I did have a very small Tupperware container that worked perfectly. Most of the ingredients can be purchased at Amazon for less than buying them at a health food store, and I had no trouble finding the ingredients. A few items were a little pricey, but once I had everything I needed, I saw that I could make double, even triple, the amount of goods, which meant I saved money and time by making the items at home.The Items I Made:I made the chocolate cake mix and the cake turned out great, but it wasn't as moist I am accustomed to. But, the flavor was fantastic and there were some variants on the recipe that I may try in the future.Bath Salts:I made bath salts for colds:This is super easy-One half cup Epsom SaltsOne half cup Sea Salt ( I bought bulk, because it was cheaper)5 drops peppermint essential oil5 drops eucalyptus essential oil5 drops lavender essential oilJust mix together! That's it!I also made the chest rub which was simply coconut oil and peppermint and eucalyptus essential oils. Just stir together, and store in a container. It took less than five minutes to make this and it smells like chest rub you buy at the store. I rubbed some on the soles of my feet one day when my allergies were bothering me, and it worked wonders.As I noted earlier, I made the deodorizer disc, too. But, the disc dried out quickly and broke easily. I ended up putting some of the mix into small Dixie Cups instead.I also made the dusting spray which consisted of white vinegar and oil ( I used EVOO) and a few drops of lemon essential oil.Overall, this is a fun book and I loved how easy it was to make the products and the ingredients weren't some kind exotic stuff I could never find anywhere. I'm planning on making more of the food recipes and want to make up some of the body butter for Christmas gifts.The only disclaimer I noticed was in regards to the use of essential oils, so be sure to read the directions carefully and do not allow children to use the oils unattended, or at all if they are very young.This is a hardcover book with color pictures and illustrations on glossy paper. The sections are well organized and planned out, with step by step instructions and money saving tips.Overall, I am a happy customer and will be referring to this book often for many household items and beauty aids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DAZX6ABP5DUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI3VI#wasThisHelpful","R3DAZX6ABP5DUI","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The bright ale-cup, the mail-clad warrior, The prince in his splendor---- those days are long spedIn the night of the past, as if they had never been!From the Anglo- Saxon poem:  The WandererRouge Knight is the second book in the Medieval Warriors series,  and gets off to a rousing start and builds upward to a stunning and epic conclusion.Emma is outraged over the carnage and cruelty she has witnessed from the Normans, fully backing her father's alliance with the Danes, who have begun an uprising against King William.But, it is a French Knight that will come to Emma's aid on more than one occasion, and therefore finds herself in the most heart wrenching and precarious situations one could possibly imagine.Geoffroi is loyal to  William, but sees the same  over the top cruelty Emma does.  But, he never suspects that Emma is caught in the cross hairs, and her secret could tear apart all the love and trust between  them if it ever came to light. Eventually, Emma will have to take a stand.  But, which side will she take?Emma is a strong female protagonist, loyal to her family, but in love with a man who, while very honorable,  plays for the other side.  I am sure that this happens in real life in any war. It's often a 'no win' situation, and at times, Geoffroi, detested what his fellow warriors did in the name of the king.So, we have a little bit of forbidden love, a fierce uprising, and divided loyalties, mixed  with intrigue and adventure, that makes this a deeply layered tale, one that will stir up your emotions, have your heart racing and then melting.When historical romance novelist these days use the excuse of I'm a romance writer, not a historian, to push aside any inaccuracies or expansive liberties they take,  I say Bah!I challenge them to read any novel written by Regan Walker, to get an idea of how to write a great romance within the historical fiction context.  Great and epic romances are often told amid the backdrop of real events or  are based on real people.  A historical romance can be every bit as sensual, romantic, and filled with  passion,  and still have accuracy, authenticity, and realistic historical details, without offending the sensibilities of the modern reader.Regan Walker always goes the extra mile to bring her stories to life, igniting the imagination, transporting you into a long ago era that is endlessly fascinating and absolutely riveting.  The writing is excellent, the research impeccable,  and the love story is epic.  You can't ask for more than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YCTXA4XMK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514198304#wasThisHelpful","R17YCTXA4XMK3","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Death Before Decaf by Caroline Fardig is a 2015 Alibi publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This new cozy mystery series by Caroline Fardig charges from the gate with a whole new cast of terrific characters, a multi-layered mystery, a little bit of romantic angst, and laugh out loud humor.I'm a big fan of Caroline's work, whose style is a blend of mystery and romance, infused with perfectly timed humor that makes the comparisons to Janet Evanovich understandable.This first book in an all new series is centered around Juliet, a singer with stage fright, but who happens to be very good at restaurant management. Down on her luck, her old friend, Pete, puts places her at the helm of Java Jive, a small coffee shop and cafe in Nashville.Right away, Juliet rubs her new employees the wrong way, which is especially bad, since one of them is found murdered and Juliet is suspect number one. Fearing she may go to jail if she doesn't find the real murderer, she begins her own investigation into the crime, putting herself in the middle of a wide reaching scam and in serious danger.I believe I mentioned in my review of the last book I read by this author, that I really thought she was hitting her stride, and this new release only solidified that feeling for me.There is a lot going on with Juliet as she finds herself in the middle of, not only a murder investigation, but a little bit of a love triangle between her old friend Pete, and the new guy she's dating, who may or may not be a good guy. The employees at the Java Jive are a real handful, and I thought the descriptions of working for the public and in food service were spot on. Occasionally, the balance gets lopsided with so much going on, but it rights itself quickly and manages to stay on pace.The dialogue is snappy, and hilarious at times, and I think Juliet will be a character everyone will like. She's smarter than she gives herself credit for, is strong, hot-tempered, and doesn't take any crap from people. But, she also cares for those closest to her and is dedicated her work, and puts herself out there in a way I couldn't help but admire.The mystery is one that fits into our modern day society and sadly is something of a cautionary tale as well. The college town atmosphere makes the plot line entirely too plausible despite the lighter tone of the book.So, overall I'm super excited about this new series and I think this author is really coming into her own, and will only get better with time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2802D2YW4M8GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOYNDKK#wasThisHelpful","R2802D2YW4M8GF","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Deep Kiss of Winter by Kresley Cole and Gina Showalter is a 2009 Pocket Books publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher as an XOXpert, the official street team of XOXO After Dark.In my ongoing tribute to Kresley Cole and the Immortals After Dark series during the month of November 2015, I am attempting to read as many books in this series as possible. Next on my list is this novella length story  Untouchable.This story centers around Danii- The Ice Maiden and Murdoch Wroth- a vampire. Danii is from Icere and can only be touched by her own kind because if she gets too warm she will shatter. Murdoch was changed into a vampire unwillingly and has a manwhore reputation. When they cross paths it quickly becomes a tense situation and before Murdoch knows what hit him, his heart starts beating, and we all know what that means.This is another predicament where the mated couple find themselves in a situation where they must overcome some huge obstacle in order to be together. This couple is unable to touch and must get creative to find sexual release. I found the prospect of not being touched for two thousand years to be a really sad situation to say the least, so I felt worse for Danii than anyone else. Murdoch was the usual IAD type alpha, and I did like him, he is funny and maybe a little romantically impaired, and of course stubborn and resistant to commitment.There is a little action and adventure as always, plus, I just happened to fit this one in at the perfect time due to a cozy holiday reference at the end of the book.Overall, I enjoyed this story, but it wasn't my favorite in the series. Still, it's a worthy addition to the series and a must for all IAD fans.While this is a novella length story, it's given the most space in the book. The Showalter story is very brief, but for the sake of time, I will have to go back and read it at another time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YD3J989IA13D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408490811#wasThisHelpful","R1YD3J989IA13D","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Threads that Bind by Alice Hayes is a 2015 Fastpencil publication.  I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.The Threads that Bind is a unique story of friendship that centers around five women, four of whom are  expecting their first child.Although each woman has a chance to tell her personal side of the story and give her perspective on how things are developing in their lives, it's Sherice who is really our main character.  Sherice works in an OB clinic, which is how she meets Sylvia, which leads to a friendship with Payton, Joanne, and Gloria.One small act of kindness will bring these ladies together and forge a bond that will see them through many of life's trials and ultimately give them the strength to make hard choices and to find peace for themselves.I will admit, I had no idea what to expect when I started this book, and at my age, talk of pregnancy, and babies, and all that entails, is not something I identify with all that much anymore.  So, I wasn't sure, in the beginning, if this book was a good fit for me.  However, it didn't take long before I found myself invested in the lives of these women, caring about their situations and cheering them on as they met unexpected challenges and came out on the other side of it with solid friendships and a better life than when the story started.There were a few minor issues for me.  I felt the story could have been tightened up a little, and could have been trimmed down some.  The new characters showing up at weird times and having their story integrated in with those of the other characters  was unique in a way, but kind of confusing and jarring in others.  However, in the end, it came together cohesively, which is what matters in the long run.Each woman has an emotional back story and a difficult life.  Sherice is dealing with her aging parents,  Sylvia with financial difficulties and a broken down health system,  Joanne is dealing with her unstable mom, her intentional decision to enter into parenthood without marriage,  Payton with an unplanned teen pregnancy, and Gloria is dealing with a failed marriage and a broken heart.Against the backdrop of Atlanta, Georgia, with sweet tea and grits,  these women, who come from all over the world, set an example for everyone, sometimes by just being there for each other, sometimes by listening, sometimes by stepping up and taking care of someone when they are in a bind.  In a world where we run a hundred miles an hour, dealing with our own internal battles, we sometimes lose sight of what other people are going through. We've lost that sense of community that supports one another, even when we have so much to deal with ourselves.I can't say I approve of all the choices these women made, but I did love seeing each one rise to the occasion and take back their dignity, replenish their faith in humanity, learn to let go and learn to trust.  Each character grew to possess a determination which made them stronger and released in them a new confidence, but they also learned to lean on those who love and care for them and to give that gift back in return.Overall, this is feel good story about friendship and kindness, about love and life, peace and contentment, and standing up for what is right.I ended up enjoying this story, although I was skeptical at first.  I would highly recommend it  to those who enjoy contemporary fiction or women's fiction or to anyone who likes uplifting and inspirational stories.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBOP7J7B2M52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ERZ0DK#wasThisHelpful","R1YBOP7J7B2M52","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Do by A.J. Pine is a 2015 Entangled: Embrace publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.These days if I run for the hills if someone mentions 'New Adult', and I admit I didn't realize this book fell into that category when I requested it from Netgalley.However, this one turned out to be a pretty enjoyable read filled with unexpected humor and some very nice romantic gestures between established couples going through some of life's ups and downs as best they can.As friends of Duncan and Elaina prepare for their wedding in Greece, trouble begins to brew when the groom goes missing making his fiance fear the worse. But, Noah and Griffin go in search of the groom, believing he didn't have a change of heart, but could be in some sort of trouble. In the meantime, the other couples are going through some life changes of their own and will have to learn to work together to keep their relationships balanced and healthy.The trademark for New Adult is the various first person perspectives and this story was no exception, which means each character got a voice, which is great, but, because there were so many characters, it could be a little much at times, since this book is not all that long. It was like everyone was talking at once sometimes. But, overall, what won me over was the humor, the very real problems the characters faced, and how the characters learned to approach their issues with maturity. Elaina is a little bit of a tough nut to crack, but I thought she and Duncan did great, plus I loved his Scottish brogue.There are sweet and sentimental moments, some character growth, and sexy times too, with a little something for everyone. I think some contemporary romance lovers will enjoy this one too, since it's so charming and fun and the angst isn't over the top and the plot is refreshingly mature for New Adult.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH313MF6AC7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MPPDMM#wasThisHelpful","R3MH313MF6AC7Z","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this author and have been impressed with her work so far, so I was pleased to see this holiday themed novella come up on Netgalley.However, one thing I should mention is that despite the obvious Christmas related book cover, the holidays are rarely mentioned, so it's kind of a winter themed romance, but no matter what this very sentimental tale that will melt your heart in the end.Piper and Noah were once an item, but when the relationship grew to the commitment stage, Piper was there, but Noah wasn't.  Noah pursued his career and traveled all over the world, while Piper stayed behind and lived the small town life.  Now, seven years have passed and Noah is back for a weekend, which also happens to coincide with the annual Snowflake Ball.  When Piper and Noah meet face to face again, they still have the same chemistry between them, but Noah simply can not see himself settling down, getting married and having children, no matter how strongly he feels for Piper.  So, the couple appears to be at the very same impasse they were seven years ago.Can Noah and Piper find a common ground or will they always remain star crossed lovers?This story illustrates just how love wins out in the end, no matter how unlikely it seems thing will work out.  I felt badly for Piper, who is really ready to start a family and Noah's appearance back in Echo Lake only serves to remind her of lost love and the rapidly dying hope she will ever get Noah to see things from her perspective.  Noah, was so stubborn with his insistence that his wanderlust was far from over.  But, deep down, I think we all know he is fighting a losing battle, that it feels like he trying to convince himself of that, more than Piper.I did get the feeling that Piper was still a little bit fragile where Noah was concerned, even after he finally realized what he wanted from life, and her trust in  him might not be what she claimed, but I did feel like Noah was all in, was finally at peace, and maybe even wondering why he fought so hard and long against love, commitment, and family.So, overall this was a strong, at times emotional, sweet and touching story with a  wonderful sigh worthy conclusion.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWQNHYYTODDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P2QXAU#wasThisHelpful","R3EWQNHYYTODDI","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gilt by Association by Karen Rose Smith is a 2015 Kensington Publication.I got in on the ground floor with this series and knew right away I was going to love it.  Somehow or other I missed this book when it came out, so I have read the fourth book, but not this third one.  So,  I  checked it out with my overdrive library account in order to catch up.When her mother's best friend, Louise, is found murdered, Caprice looks into the case at her mother's request.  It turns out Louise has a secret past, a complicated marriage, and more enemies than one might think.  On a more personal note,  Caprice is still struggling with her feelings for Grant and Seth, is trying to help her sister adjust to caring for a newborn, and training her new puppy.This was a very good mystery which kept me guessing all the way to the end.  I love Caprice, and her vintage clothing style, and her big heart.  She's a great amateur sleuth because she doesn't just luck into solving the case, she actually gets out there and works to find clues just like a real detective would.  She may be a little too nosy, but she doesn't take it too far.Naturally, with  two Cocker Spaniels in my house and three cats, this story, which features my favorite dog breed, is a plus, and I love the animal rescue storyline, and appreciate  the time taken to add a few facts for readers, such as a list of what types of plants are toxic to pets, which is a great reminder we can all use, and of course the fabulous recipe at the end.Overall, this is a very solid and satisfying addition to the series and I am thankful my library had it.4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGP8S6ZYC9KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4ASQF0#wasThisHelpful","ROGP8S6ZYC9KN","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luseta Beauty Moisturizing oil is a mulit-purpose oil for your  skin, but also  works on your hair.  I put a drop or two in my bath as well.  What I like most is the scent, which is mild, and despite the fact this is an 'oil', it's not greasy or heavy. I can rub it on my skin and put my clothes on immediately without worrying about the oil rubbing off on the fabric.  My skin does feel softer, and so does my hair, which also has a slight shine to it now.  This product is affordable,  and does what it advertises it will do, so I will continue to use it and purchase more on a regular basis.* I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTKXKC2BHF9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0JJU#wasThisHelpful","R1PTKXKC2BHF9P","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Books began reissuing these books in digital format that I discovered this author and the Delilah West mysteries, which is one more reason why I love electronic books and e-readers.In this fourth Delilah West mystery,  we find our heroine doing much better, building a clientele and making a little money which has her living a more stable life.  However,  she is also quite aware that she has been receiving a little help from someone and that it's time to put a stop to it and stand on her own merits now.But, life gets shaky in a hurry when Delilah falls victim to a set - up that eventually leads to murder.  While the prime suspect certainly looks guilty, Delilah is positive she's innocent and sets out to find the real murderer.I really like Delilah and if you are a fan of the Sue Grafton alphabet series, you will most likely find these books appealing.  Told in first person, we are privy to all of Delilah's crime solving thoughts, her musings on her personal life, and are treated to her self deprecating humor, wit, and humanity.  Despite the tough outer shell she presents, she's really a nice, caring person with human foibles and desires,  and is someone I couldn't help but cheer for.The story is pretty basic, and the plot is not really all that original, by today's standards, but there were some pretty  tense and suspenseful moments along the way. On a more personal note, Delilah's private life is still up in the air as far as romance is concerned and I'm hoping something will come from her relationship with Eric, who seems plenty contrite and is perhaps worthy of a chance.One thing to keep in mind is the time frame these stories were written in.  Although there was a brief cell phone reference, something that made me wonder if perhaps this was thrown in the digital version as an afterthought, in an attempt to modernize the story  a little, because I'm thinking only a few people had cell phones in the early nineties.  If that was indeed the case, it would have been better to have left that out, because it stuck out like a sore thumb.  No internet,  answering machines, and several other huge clues, make it obvious this book is not set in present day.However, I thought the nostalgia was part of the story's charm, and rather liked the old school detective  skills, which did not  rely on computers and smart phones to do all the work.This is a short read, well plotted and written, nice steady pacing, and a pretty solid mystery, despite it's ordinary storyline, and the action/suspense elements more than make up for anything lacking in that area.  I enjoyed this whodunit and recommend it to anyone that likes reading mysteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZRG63FHS0IP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y41B5KA#wasThisHelpful","R8ZRG63FHS0IP","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I Want by Jill Shalvis is a 2015 Berkley Publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.All I Want has all the trademark humor we've come to expect from Jill Shalvis, especially in the Animal Magnetism series,  but there is a little romantic suspense element in this one I really liked.Zoe, has convinced herself she is good and fine since her brother Wyatt and her sister Darcy found true love and have moved out of the house and on with their lives.  But, deep down, she longs for the same happiness her siblings have found.As fate would have it, Wyatt's good friend, Parker, is on a vacation and Zoe has agreed to let him stay at the house with her to help finance home repairs.  When the two meet each other sparks fly right away but in a hilarious way, which  had me laughing out loud.Naturally, the couple tries to deny they are feeling a connection and work hard to douse the flames because they are not really suited for each other.  Parker is on a vendetta mission, which is very dangerous, but once he's done what he needs to, he will disappear back into the dark and murky world from which he came.Zoe needs total honesty,  commitment, loyalty and honor, NOT a dark, dangerous,  and mysterious.  It seems as though a hot fling is all she can hope for unless a  litter of adorable kittens and a delightful rescue dog named Oreo can  help pave the way for Zoe's own Happily Ever After.I have been catching up with the Animal Magnetism series little by little recently, and was very curious about how Zoe's story was going to play out.  I love her cutting edge occupation, her loyalty to family, and felt her insecurities were valid.  Same with Parker, who, had some family  matters to cope with as well.As I said before, Parker has a dangerous job, and is going rogue a little bit here, looking for justice in the death of  his partner.  This story line added a little bit of danger and suspense to the story, and of course I loved that element, which really made this installment stand out a little more than some of the other chapters I have read so far.One thing Jill Shalvis is very good at is creating heroes  that will  melt your panties off, but will melt your heart in the process.  I thought Wyatt was nearly perfect , but  now here comes Parker.  Geez! But, of course her stories are usually always very well balanced, laced with emotional dramas, and offset with humor, and excellent banter and dialogue that never fails to leave me with a smile on my face.Fan Girling on this one.  5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RCHDQ1E0AJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026L0#wasThisHelpful","R36RCHDQ1E0AJX","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am quickly becoming a huge fan of Luseta hair care products.  This shampoo and conditioner is very high quality, and certainly a cut above the typical over the counter shampoos and conditioners.  While there is a very pleasant scent, the shampoo lathers up very nicely,  and my hair feels soft, the main thing that stands out for me, is how clean my hair feels.  There is no residue or build up, but my hair is manageable. and since my hair is very fine, I love the body lift.  Another thing I have been loving about this set, is the packaging. The pump bottles come in very handy in the shower, since I don't have to fumble around with pouring the shampoo into my hands, dropping the bottle, or spilling the contents, and I can control the amount that I use, plus the bottles don't fill up with water from the shower.

"Marry Me at Christmas by Susan Mallery is a 2015 HQN publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.I always look forward to the Christmas stories written by veteran authors like Susan Mallery, and so I made a concerted effort to seek this one out.  However, this time, I'm afraid the story fell a little flat for me.Madeline's Bridal shop is entering it's slow time of year, so when a very special request came from the mayor to help plan the wedding of movie star Jonny Blaze's only sister,  Madeline agrees, albeit reluctantly at first.But, once she meets Jonny and gets over her initial starstruck giddiness of actually working with a movie star,  Madeline finds Jonny to be a very grounded, down to earth guy, for the most part, except when it comes to planning his sister's wedding, where he tends to get a little carried away.  Pretty soon the pair find they enjoy being with one another, but the issues surrounding life as a major movie star could nip their romance in the bud.  Is the couple doomed or can a little holiday magic work it charm in Fool's Gold once again?For some reason this story just didn't elicit any sort of emotion from me and almost felt like the author was just going through the motions with this one.  The set up isn't bad, but the couple have no chemistry,  and there wasn't all that much conflict, and well, they were kind of boring. In fact the entire book was a bit drab.There were a few humorous moments, but other than that,  I felt a little let down by this one.  This is definitely not one of Susan's best efforts, in my opinion.  2.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29O92GWING3XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URK9T9G#wasThisHelpful","R29O92GWING3XS","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Returned by Jason Mott is a 2013 Harlequin MIRA publication.Usually when I pick up a Harlequin MIRA novel, it's more on the side of contemporary romance or women's fiction.  But, I saw this book while thumbing through the Overdrive library books, and will confess I misunderstood  what the book was about when I checked it out.  I was thinking the story was centered on the return of a missing child who was presumed dead,  but this book is nothing at all like that.As the story opens, the reader learns that the dead are returning to earth. Not as ghost or zombies, but seemingly as real people.  The catch is that they are the age they were when they died.  So, when Jason shows up at his parent's home, he is still just a child, the same age he was when he died.Naturally, people are freaking out over this phenomenon, thinking it indicates the world is about to end, or suspicious about the returned, thinking they can't possibly be the actual person who died.  In the midst of this fear and panic, people respond as they often do by taking extreme measures to ensure their  sense of safety.But, as we shall see, the story is about more than the commentary on human nature, it's also about the fantasy of having a loved one return to us, giving us a chance to recapture what was stolen from us, by their death.The writing style was a bit different and took me some time to adjust to, but once I got accustomed to it, the story seemed  to flow nicely with steady pacing and interesting dialogue.It's a very thought provoking and often moving story and I  give the author kudos for having such vivid imagination and giving the reader a realistic conclusion to the story that didn't insult my intelligence.Although I can't say this book was my cup of tea, and is not the sort of story I usually go for, it was, I believe  written with a sentimental and sweet intention, even if it did leave me feeling a little melancholy at times. It does end on an up swing though, even though we aren't given all the answers to the questions,  I think it's more about taking a leap faith and having hope, about grabbing the opportunities you have right now, and holding on to whatever you are given, even if you experience some doubts,  and about being thankful for that chance, and making the best of it.Be warned, if you are looking for the usual Harlequin fare, this isn't it, but it was certainly an interesting concept and a fascinating read.  I recommend this one to readers of fantasy, paranormal, and science fiction.3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQ1SNPRQ038L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778315339#wasThisHelpful","R3RQ1SNPRQ038L","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Love to Last ( Prophecy of Love- Book one) by Kelsey Browning is a 2015 publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Maybe where you belong is less about the location itself and more about how you feel about yourself when you're there.A small town romance set in Texas with a smidgen of magic and sprinkle of paranormal occurrences is the foundation for this new series by Kelsey Browning.Laney is breezing through Prophecy, Texas to check on an old friend before embarking on one of her world wide tours. But, things get complicated when she sees Whit Maddox at his boot shop confirming her worst fears concerning his failing health. She is torn between continuing her nomadic ways or settling in for a while after Wilt informs her she is Prophecy's next 'bootmaker'.What does that mean? Well, for Prophecy, the boot shop is its life's blood. The boot designer creates a unique pair of boots, but they always come with a special matching pair. The matches could mean love or healing or luck. It's the stuff legends are made of and people flow through the small town, bringing in money for all the other merchants. But, with Whit unable to make boots anymore, it's up to Laney to keep the town from going under. But, that's not her only problem Cal Maddox is still rooted in Prophecy, still hotter than a Texas pepper sprout, and still holds Laney's heart in his hands. The problem is Laney and Cal have different goals and expectations from life.So, Laney has some big decisions to make and the pressure is nearly unbearable. Can Whit and Cal and the town of Prophecy convince Laney this is where home is and always has been?I always look forward to reading a new book by this author because I know there are going to be some OMG- Laugh out loud scenes that crop up when you least expect them.Raylene, this is Cal. Would you happen to be available for lunch? Sure, sugar. Why don't you c'mon over here? I just mixed up a batch of egg salad.Cal grimaced at the lunch menu, but what they ate wasn't important. What they talked about was.You mind if Sawyer and Greer tag along?  Honey, that ain't a date. It's an orgy.The humor is really only a small part of why I enjoyed this story. I'm a sucker for second chance love stories, and the magical undertone created a nice whimsical appeal, which was fun too, and the boot shop being the focal point put a big Texas style stamp on it, which made me REALLY love it.I could feel Laney's anxiety, and could understand how she might feel cornered, but it was obvious she loved Cal, and longed for a place to call home.I admit to crushing on Cal a little bit. He's a quintessential Texan, and wow could he bring on the passion and the swoon worthy romance. Whew! My kind of guy!The story is well balanced with a lot of laughs, a few tears, a sweet and spicy, and deeply romantic love story, which is topped off by a fanciful atmosphere that gave the reader a feeling of anticipation and expectation which kept it from becoming predictable. So, I gather by now, you have the impression I really enjoyed this story, and you would be right. A solid beginning to what I hope will be a long running series. 4.5 sta","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BP7P61YM46DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163PV8E2#wasThisHelpful","R2BP7P61YM46DZ","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twillyweed by Mary Anne Kelly is a 2015 Mysterious Press Publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.I confess I am unfamiliar with this series and so was not aware there were four other installments in the Claire Breslinsky Mystery series. Even so, I had no real indication this was not a stand alone as the author quickly got me up to speed on the events that have led us all to this juncture in Claire's life.Claire is now divorced, with grown children, struggling with her photography career, and to top off her recent string of bad luck, she finds out her current lover has a big secret, and her niece, Jenny Rose, whom she only recently discovered even existed, is coming to America from Ireland, and her sister wants Claire to meet up with her on her behalf.Jenny Rose has come to America to make contact with her birth mother and takes a job as an Au Pair, caring for young Wendall, a boy she quickly becomes attached to. Meeting her Auntie Claire, put the two women together amongst the same group of people, and they develop a quirky, but nice and solid relationship. However, a theft is soon discovered, which leads to a murder, and once again, Claire is in the big middle of the whole messy affair.The one thing that kept screaming out to me as I read this story was that it felt dated, as though it had been released back in the 1990's, but was being reissued in digital format. However, I could not find any previous editions of the book anywhere, so I tried to ascertain if the story was historical and deliberately set in this time frame. But, I couldn't find any indication of that either. But, there are glaring signals and huge hints that this story is not set in present day.If you know that going in, you will be mentally prepared for attitudes and beliefs we no longer practice, and the unusual lack of or mentioning of modern technology, except on a very rare occasion. However, this is not exactly a bad thing, in that the atmosphere was weirdly charming, even quaint.This is a whodunit mystery, but it's also a family saga of sorts. The mystery part gets off to a very slow start, and it's not until over half way in that we see any action from that element. However, once the ball got rolling the guessing game picked up speed and I never would have guessed who the culprit was.I liked Claire's character, her tenacity and honestly, and at times even her self deprecation. Jenny Rose was wisecracking, with an attitude typical of her age, but could come off sounding disrespectful on occasion, but she grew on me as the story progressed. However, both women wind up finding some peace and harmony in their lives, which was good to see.The book was a little off the beaten path and is certainly a unique spin on the typical amateur sleuth trope. If I ever can manage to find the time I would love to go back and read the previous books in the series, and I will certainly read any future releases too.I think mystery lovers who like the amateur sleuth trope or cozy mysteries, will enjoy this one. It's a character driven story with a mild romantic undertone, the violence and language are tame, so most everyone could enjoy this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QRWN4B826TWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150401667X#wasThisHelpful","R2QRWN4B826TWH","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel's True Desire by Grace Burrowes is a 2015 Sourcebooks Casablanca publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.It's always a pleasure to pick up a novel by Grace Burrowes.  This one, however, was really, really, really good.  ( I know, I say that every time, but I really mean it, every time)As the story starts off we are introduced to Daniel, a Vicar, on his way to his new post.  Upon arrival, he meets the most refreshing of ladies,  Lady Kirsten Haddonfield.  The two immediately forge a bond, each carrying burdens the other can relate to, but the trouble is, Daniel is married.Now, I know what you are thinking.  An extramarital affair is scandalous under normal circumstances, but a Vicar?  Well, as it turns out, Daniel's wife is not all she presents herself to be, and they have been estranged for nearly a year.  Still, the emotional affair between Kirsten and Daniel pushes the envelope just a little, and I felt Grace was taking a bit a risk with this scenario, but she does tread lightly, even if some actions by the characters may have raised a few eyebrows.I loved getting a glimpse of the characters we have read about previously, the side story involving Daniel's ward, and the sweet romance that develops between Kirsten and Daniel, which leads them to uncover a ruthless and greedy scandal and gives them both a fresh path in life, as well as the fruition of dreams they never thought would come true.This story is very well written, with the author delicately handling some prickly situations, although I did wonder if maybe the couple should have handled the situation in a more traditional way. Still,  the sensual details are not gone into in explicit detail, and this is fitting, I think, for this particular story.There are some tense moments and some surprising twist along the way, which kept me very involved in the story, and the deeper I delved into it the better it got.  Everything you have come to expect from this author is here-  humor, wit, sharp dialogue, emotional story lines, true love, and of course a wonderful and sweet happy ever after so what's not to like?5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKLQIG7IYNYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GOL3C#wasThisHelpful","RDKLQIG7IYNYE","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a person who suffers from sinus infections and tension headaches, I have tried everything you can think of to ease this discomfort.  I absolutely hate taking pills that cause drowsiness and make me feel loopy.  So, hot/cold mask are something I like to use as an alternative to pain meds when I can.  However, not all mask are created equally.  Many are filled with gel and are made with cheap plastic, meaning I may get a handful of uses from it before it gets tossed in the trash.  This mask, however, is made like a pillow and is very soft and comfortable.  Lavender plant tops were added in to aid in the pain relief and smelled wonderful.  So, a little aromatherapy was added it there too.  I used the mask as hot therapy first, and it's very, very soothing.  I found myself relaxing in no time.  I also used it as cold therapy, which was is not the route I usually go with when using an eye mask because for some reason  the 'coldness' only makes my pain worse.  But, not with this mask.  First of all,  when  I took it out of the freezer it wasn't hard as brick, and the coldness was not overwhelming.  In fact, I have been using the cold therapy more than the hot.  The coolness is so very refreshing, and made me feel so much better.  This is a well made, quality eye mask and is perhaps the best one I have ever used.  Highly recommend!!I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34W629NDBBNR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKVHRW8#wasThisHelpful","R34W629NDBBNR8","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cover Story by Brenda Buchanan is a 2015 Carina Press Publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This is my first Joe Gale Mystery so I didn't know what to expect going in, but I soon found myself immersed in this compelling mystery that centers around a small Maine community and the murder of a prominently connected social worker.Joe is an investigative reporter from Portland on assignment covering the Frank O'Roarke murder trial, although at first glance it appears to be an open and shut case. However, once Joe begins chatting with the locals, he quickly learns the situation isn't so cut and dried after all, and someone is sending him no so subtle messages that he should leave well enough alone. Will Joe get to the truth before it's too late?I found this mystery intriguing and absorbing, with well drawn characters, vivid detailing of the Maine landscape, and a compelling and thought provoking storyline. If I had a complaint, it would be that at times the story was a little dry, and although Joe is a very interesting guy, with some messy and complicated personal issues, especially in the romance department, perhaps an infusion of humor here and there would liven up the dialogue a little. Other than that, the author did a great job of depicting the old school investigative tactics once employed by journalist, but mostly tossed out the window these days. Joe is a dying breed, I'm afraid, a lone hold out, still doing face to face interviews, knocking on doors, and writing the truth without any sort spin or hidden agenda. I wish there were more like him.This is a straightforward mystery, a quick and easy to read, and quite enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the next Joe Gale Mystery.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IOY78KEERJRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPQDOCC#wasThisHelpful","R3IOY78KEERJRJ","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Myths of Midwinter by Sarah M. Cradit is a 2015 publication.  I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Remember the warning, with the fervor of faith:Seduction to sinner.  A legacy in splinters. Beware the myths of midwinterBy now those who follow my reviews are well aware of my gushing effusiveness over this series.  I can honestly say I've never come across a such a unique blend of paranormal, occult, and fantasy, mixed with all manner of family drama and suspense.  This series is one that may leave a character hanging in the balance, but doesn't necessarily have to pick up where it left off in the next book, which under ordinary circumstances might leave readers feeling frustrated , but fans of HOC&C know to be patient and that  good things come to those that waitWhile Ana's fate is still in question, Finn is hard at work finding a way to save his wife.  In the meantime he learns more about his own gifts and how he can use those gifts to reunite himself with Ana and for the sake of his son and the prophesy.But, the main story here doesn't center on that particular situation as much as it does on some characters we've met briefly in previous installments.  This was a wicked story, full of white knuckle suspense,  some morally bankrupt characters,  with a very heavy, dark, atmosphere that gave me the shivers a time or two.This book is definitely intended for those who have kept up the series up to this point, so it's safe to say, that all that occurs here is part of a bigger picture.  I can't wait to see what happens next, which is the beauty of this series.  It's always fresh, always rich in details and atmosphere,  sharp dialogue, and pushes the reader toward vivid imagery and challenges our perceptions.As always this story is well written, complex, and utterly absorbing.4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDOG3D0CHJL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ZEZWQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1WDOG3D0CHJL6","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Desires After Dusk by Kresley Cole is a 2008 Pocket Books publication. I was provided a copy of this book as an XOXpert  the official street team of XOXO After Dark.This sixth installment in the Immortals After Dark Series centers around Cadeon Woede and Holly Ashwin. Cadeon is a demon seeking redemption and Holly is the vessel he needs to obtain that goal. The problem is she's human and off limits, but he still feels she is his mate. Nevertheless, in order to get what he needs he will have to betray her. Will he chose love or redemption or can he have both?Holly and Cade couldn't be more different, and it takes Cade a long time to earn Holly's trust. Holly's a little OCD and Cade is, well a demon, alpha, and has no shortage of confidence. However, they are perfect for each other, but of course they have some real problems to face.This book, in my opinion, has a touch more humor to it than some of the previous books in the series, which is terrific, but it in no way took away from the darker toned portions of the story. This author continues to build upon this series adding new and exciting plots, adventure, super steamy and erotic romance, and near perfect characterizations.I am eagerly anticipating the newest Immortals After Dark novel coming out in December, 2015, so I've been trying to get completely caught up with the series before the new release. However, I didn't realize I was this far behind, BUT, I am NOT backing down from the challenge. It's on.. This month is going to be dedicated to this goal so get ready for more Immortals After Dark!Seriously, this is my favorite paranormal/ Urban Fantasy series ever and I can't wait to see what happens next!4 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT78FL6585JPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849834164#wasThisHelpful","RT78FL6585JPC","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Irresistible Rogue by Valerie Bowman is a 2015 St. Martin's Press publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Irresistible Rogue is a charming and delightful historical romance with a touch of danger and adventure, chock full of witty and zany dialogue, with a tip of the hat to one my favorite classic movies- The Philadelphia Story.Lady Daphne Swift managed to convince her brother to let her help out with the war effort by working undercover as a spy, which meant she must legally marry Captain Rafe Cavendish. Although she has romantic feelings for him, Rafe thinks of her like a sister.. Or so he claims.But, now the mission is over, and sadly Daphne lost her brother in the process. With Rafe showing no inclination toward making their marriage a real one, Daphne has decided to move on with her life and is expecting a marriage proposal, any day now, from Lord Fitzwell. Naturally, she will need an annulment before she can legally remarry. But, before Rafe will agree to end the marriage, Daphne must help him with one more mission. Will Daphne really marry the boring Fitzwell, or can she convince to Rafe they are meant to be together?Rafe's opinions towards blue bloods and aristocracy are less than charitable, and helped to himself he and Daphne were not meant to be. Will he have a change of heart? Daphne proves her mettle out 'in the field', becoming a true hero. She's smart, adventurous and sassy, making her a heroine all will respect and love. But, it was Daphne's young cousin Delilah that practically stole the show.The author blends romance and adventure together with panache which kept me entertained from beginning to end.Overall, this was a very fun, well written, and delicious romance!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BO55Y51LI2PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072573#wasThisHelpful","R2BO55Y51LI2PI","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heartsong Cottage (Eternity Springs # 10) by Emily March is a 2015 St. Martin's Press publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This tenth installment in the popular Eternity Springs series begins with Daniel's harrowing story of how he lost his son ten years prior. Fast forward to present day, and Daniel is coming to Eternal Springs to attend the wedding of a very special friend where he meets a mysterious new lady in town named Shannon. These two lost and lonely souls reach out to one another in a haze of wedding blues and champagne. But in the light of day, Shannon soon discovers there are now some huge ramifications stemming from their impulsiveness and that she's made a terrible mistake because Daniel apparently isn't the hero everyone thinks he is.This story is classic Emily March in many ways, with the trademark emotional story line. But of course holiday stories usually require an added dose of sugar and inspiration, topping it all off with a cozy and heartwarming ending. However, this story has a little bit of an edge to it because Shannon is running away from a dark past and of course Daniel's background is just heartbreaking.I enjoy reading love stories with more mature couples because the hormonal angst isn't at a fever pitch, and I can relate to the characters a lot more. In this story, the romance is a sweet one on many levels because Daniel really deserves to find love again, and of course, Shannon's life has been fraught with anxiety and danger and its time for her to find peace. Both of these characters exuded a deep loneliness that made me root for them even more. Their romance was not filled with grand gestures or explicit bedroom scenes, even though they got off to a rip roaring start in that area, at first, but, as the story unfolds they take a slower, more cautious approach, building a strong emotional bond, along the way. There are misunderstandings, conflict, suspense, and danger, but as the Christmas holidays draw nearer, Eternity Springs will once again work its magic.This was not exactly what I was expecting from this holiday themed novel, but it was a welcome change from the many other syrupy tales that usually come out around the holidays. I enjoyed the romantic suspense element very much, and for those who are looking for those heart-tugging and touching moments, there are plenty of those to go around too.This is a series that is dependable, and this author always weaves an interesting tale, so you can't go wrong with this one. 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T5D337SB7CV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHJM7RU#wasThisHelpful","R1T5D337SB7CV3","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cinderella Murders is a 2014 Simon and Schuster publication.I have been super excited about finally getting to read this book because I am such a big fan of both authors-  Alafair Burke and Mary Higgins Clark.  With these two at the helm, I knew this would be a great mystery and so it was.Television producer, Laurie Moran, desperately needs a hit.  With her career on the line, she pitches The Cinderella Murder  to showcase on her new reality TV show  Under Suspicion.  Once she begins looking up all the 'usual suspects', she soon discovers someone wants to shut down the renewed interest in the case and Laurie herself could be the next victim.Years ago, a talented young UCLA student was murdered on her way to an audition.  The case was never solved, but a cloud of suspicion still hangs over the  director she was on her way to meet. But, it seems many others have been harboring secrets in regards to this case and now the truth is beginning to seep out little by little, casting doubts over all those involved.  Was it a  jealous roommate?  Someone involved in a cult like church on campus?  Susan's boyfriend?  The director?This is a classic whodunit, cleverly plotted, with precision timing and pacing.  I love cold case stories  that blend the past with the present,  as long  buried and dark secrets come bubbling to the surface and of course after all this time has passed, the murderer is finally brought to justice.Because I read so much, and am usually called upon to scrutinize a book with a critical eye, I have become jaded over the years. However, I chose this book as a pleasure read, and only had a few very minor complaints, which I can't expound on without hinting at the outcome, but,  I must say I found this mystery very entertaining.  It kept me guessing,  had likeable and realistic characters in the lead, and just a tiny bit of romance to cap it all off.  There is very little detailed  violence, the language is mild and while there are adult situations, there is no explicit sex.  This is just an all around solid mystery that everyone can enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YK49WMZWQ8S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDU8E7Y#wasThisHelpful","R2YK49WMZWQ8S3","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Then Came You by Jill Shalvis is a 2014 Berkley Publication.What a cute story!  I enjoy most anything this author writes, but I don't get to read as many of her novels as I would like with my review schedule.  However, I'm hoping to feature the author on my blog in the near future, so I used that as an excuse to check out some titles I have missed.  This one was miraculously available on the Overdrive app, so I quickly snatched it up.  Now, I see why it was so popular.Emily winds up in Sunshine, Idaho to fulfill her internship at the veterinarian clinic, which wasn't exactly where she was hoping to land.  To put the cherry on the cake, the guy she had a one night stand with at a convention a few months back, just happens to be her new supervisor.  Could things get any better?Wyatt is firming rooted in Sunshine while taking responsibility for his two sisters, who still need a little  guidance.  The last person he expected to ever see again was Emily.Despite all attempts to remain strictly professional, to pretend they never had that one mind blowing encounter, to keep their hands off one another, fails spectacularly.While Emily and Wyatt aren't total opposite , life's hardships have shaped the way they approach challenges and change, and how they deal with problems.  Emily is decision maker, and sometimes, not only for her own self, but for other people as well.  She's also an organizer and a planner,  and her plans do not include Sunshine, Idaho.  She's hot to get back to LA , almost to the point of having a little tunnel vision in that area.  Wyatt on the other hand likes to give people space to make choices for themselves without his input or influence, if possible.His smile faded and  he stroked a  stray strand of hair along her temple, tucking it behind her ear, wondering what it would be like if they were even halfway suited for each other.For those who haven't gotten around to reading this one yet, I predict you ladies will fall for Wyatt, who has all the qualities anyone could possibly ask for in a hero. He was strong.  He was strong, inside as well as out.  He was smart and funny and protective, and incredibly sexy.  But more than just about everything else, he was rock solid steady and unflappable.  A guy you wanted at your back.Emily could be one dimensional at times, but she could be pretty funny too.The beer loosened her tongue, two beers separated it from her brain.  So naturally she had two.At first I was a little concerned about the lack of build up between the couple, since of course we know they've already hooked up, but the two can't stop going at each other, so there is no suspenseful 'will they or won't they' in that regard, so the question really is whether or not they've built a strong enough  emotional bond to make the relationship stick.With pets and animals as the backdrop and Wyatt's super difficult and outspoken sister, Darcy keeping him on  his toes,  the story never had a dull moment.  If you like romantic comedy, I think you will love this book.  I'm so glad I took time out to read this one.  4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EASJMKA42Y4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270173#wasThisHelpful","R3EASJMKA42Y4I","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Home for Christmas by Lily Everett is a 2015 St. Martin's publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Home for Christmas is a sweet and emotional story of family, forgiveness, healing and hope.Libby is a writer on assignment for the publication she works for and while she tried to weasel out of it, her boss has given her an ultimatum, so for better or worse, Libby returns home for Christmas.  Her assignment?  To give war hero Owen Shepard a heartwarming Christmas with his family on Sanctuary Island.  Can she pull it off and still maintain her false persona?I haven't read all the books in this series, but have immensely enjoyed the ones had to chance to read, thus far.  This one is just a little bit different from the others, in  that the characters featured here, Libby and Owen, only had familial ties to Sanctuary Island, and the story is more focused on the entire family and not just on the romance between Owen and Libby, making this one fall more into the women's fiction or chick-lit genres that some of the previous installments.The storyline involving Owen's daughter, is very sad and emotional.  Owen has only recently discovered he is a parent and is having trouble adjusting to that type of responsibility.  I got very frustrated with him and his fixation on returning to the army, which would mean abandoning a little girl who desperately needed him.Libby was sort of an enigma, living a lie, and struggling to cope with the reality of her situation.  Her family dynamic is certainly interesting and creates a lot of drama.Since the story deals with a lot of rather heavy family issues, the romance is not all that steamy, but that seems more fitting somehow in this case.  I enjoyed the way Libby and Owen rose to the occasion to do the right thing for themselves and their individual families, and managed to forge a family of their own in the process.  So, while this one was not exactly what I was used to from this series, I still thought it was a strong addition to the Sanctuary Island collection.So, if you like contemporary or  women's fiction,  emotional and touching holiday stories, and happy ever afters you will want to add this on to her holiday reading list.  3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VR237JRWEHIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V38KAX0#wasThisHelpful","R2VR237JRWEHIB","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a 2015 Riverhead Books publication.Most mystery readers have by now heard of  The Girl on the Train,  the 'sleeper' success of the year.  I have been patiently waiting for this book to become available via overdrive library account,  but the wait has been a very long one, which is why, as we approach the one year anniversary of the book's release, I am just now getting around to reading it.Anytime I hear a lot of buzz about a book, especially one that hasn't come from a 'household' named author, I am curious about it, naturally.  But, it also creates a dilemma because I don't want to necessarily buy into all the hype, because I'm afraid I will expect too much,  but I don't want to approach it too skeptically either.  So, with as much of an open mind as possible, I eagerly dived in.By now, you are all aware of the set up.When Rachel, a full blown alcoholic,  witnesses something out of the ordinary, while looking out of the  window of a train, she feels compelled to report it to the police, and ironically,  this event will pull her out of her alcoholic haze long enough to connect some disturbing dots, making her more vulnerable than ever.  What did Rachel see that stunned her into sobriety and will she live to tell the tale?Sometimes it's funny how word of mouth is still one the most powerful tools out there for promotion and spreading the word about a book or product.  This book is a fine example of how that works.  But, I have to say, I was left scratching my head in the end, wondering what it was about this particular book that captured the attention of so many people.Don't get me wrong, the book is good, it's definitely better that the mass majority of mystery/thrillers out there, but then again,  there are many books on the market that are just as good or better.  The writing is a little disjointed at times, the pacing was slow, heavily focused on the marital drama of the main characters,  with only small bits of information coming out at a time, which wasn't exactly trustworthy, then quite suddenly we reach  the grand epiphany and the shocking, and in my opinion,  darkly humorous conclusion.The story was certainly interesting, and atmospheric, but comparing this book to Hitchcock's unrivaled genius is just ridiculous.  Still, approached with the proper perspective,  this book is a solid mystery, and did employ a storyline that is outside the usual murder mystery norms, and is worth checking out, if you haven't gotten around to it yet.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGH8CMZGSGKBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","RGH8CMZGSGKBH","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Say You'll Love Me by Ally Broadfield is 2015 Entangled ( Scandalous) publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.A Charming Ode to Fairytales! Abigail gets the shock of her life when at her very own engagement ball, she discovers her fiance, Robert, in a compromising position with his sister's maid. Before she can come to grips with what she witnessed, the ladies maid vanishes and is later found dead, making Robert the number one suspect.While she wishes to cry off, her father insists she stick by Robert until they find the killer. She reluctantly agrees, but decides to investigate matters herself with the help of her friend's brother, Edmund Townsend, the Marquess of Longcroft.Edmund is a mathematical whiz with seven sisters, he must find husbands for, which means he hasn't given much thought to finding a wife for himself. Besides, Edmund doesn't think love is logical, believing it to be a 'non- quantifiable concept. But, Edmund is finding it harder to resist the urge to kiss Lady Abigail.What is this?I'm attempting to determine what is wrong with me.She read aloud from his list.Insomnia, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate.Looking up, she met his eyes.Sounds to me like you're in loveImpossible. I have already determined that love does not exist.You're a fool if you think that.  I take that back. You are a damn fool.I enjoy historical romances with a bit of mystery or intrigue in them, and I also enjoy the friends to lovers trope, so this one really appealed to me. This story also pays homage to fairy tales as Abigail is always reading them and deep down believes there really is such a thing as happy ever after, and that she deserves to be loved, even though she has begun to think true love is not in the cards for her. Edmund is a unique hero - funny, but smart, maybe a little nerdy, but sweet and honorable. The best part of the story, for me, was seeing him transform from a non-believer to a true believer in the power of love.This is a light romance with just a bit of a sinister edge at times, but mostly it's charming and fun.

"Lady Decadence (Furies # 3) by Wendy LaCapra is a 2015 Entangled ( Scandalous) publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.What a bummer. This is the last book in the Furies trilogy! I am so sad to see it end, but Thea Marie and Wyn's story is an awesome way to bring the series to a close.Before you start reading this one, I must say that unlike some series or trilogies, that can normally be read as stand alone novels, I highly recommend reading the two previous installments first. There is a mystery thread that, without the background information, I don't think you will completely understand why Thea is so concerned about her brother-in-law, Eustace.For those who have been following along, Thea makes a wager with Wyn- if she wins the roll of the dice, they file for parliamentary divorce, but if he wins, Thea returns to him for the summer. With Thea's need to protect Wyn, she makes sure the dice rolls in her favor.Two throws each, the highest total wins. Equal numbers will merit a third throw.Thea and Wyn have lived apart for several years after the loss of their unborn child, something Thea blamed on Wyn for years, while harboring guilt of her own. This reconciliation, which may be temporary, will give Wyn the chance to win back the woman he loves. But, they have some major challenges ahead of them if they are to make a go of their marriage.First of all, Wyn is not the most demonstrative guy in all the world, and still requires lessons on the art of conversation. He has been emotionally distant from Thea, but not only that, he, like many men of this era, believed their wives, as ladies, should not be subjected to their baser passions in the bedroom.Thea Marie of course, is a healthy, vivacious woman who has a perfectly normal sexual appetite, and so believes her husband is a 'cold fish'.These issues lie at the very bottom of the chasm between Wyn and Thea, not to mention a jewel theft, Thea was suspected of.Although Thea has some ulterior motives for agreeing to spend the summer with her husband, she would like nothing more than to reconcile with him, prove her innocence, and bring out the unrealized love and emotions both are keeping locked up inside them. However, the problem with Wyn's brother, who has miraculously returned from the dead, could prevent the couple from ever having a life together.I fell in love with this series because it dares to journey down the road less traveled. The themes explored here are a little darker, more emotional, and difficult, than what you usually find in historical romances today. 'The Furies' are ahead of their time, all them bold, very brave, and ready to move on with their lives, now that they are more settled.I loved getting to know these fine ladies, and enjoyed witnessing their close bond of friendship, which is stronger than ever, and am so happy to see Thea finally step out from behind the shadow of suspicion, see the mystery of Eustace solved once and for all, and have these wonderful friends and their husbands, enjoy their own Happy Ever After.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FE61KG37KMWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CQ0T8A#wasThisHelpful","R3FE61KG37KMWW","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Forbidden Knight by Nicola Davidson is a 2015 Entangled (Scandalous) publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This is a solid historical romance set in the days of Bloody Mary's reign. Lady Catherine Linwood is the daughter of an esteemed physician, and is favored by the queen, until her father dies suddenly.Catherine is immediately suspicious of the alleged cause of death. When she meets Sir Brandon FitzAlan, a bastard Knight, a man indebted to Catherine's father for his medical treatment of his mother, the two work together to figure out what really happened to Catherine's father, and end up falling hard and fast for each other. However, they may not live long enough to have their happy endingCatherine is an unconventional girl, uninhibited, educated, and loyal, while Brand has a few dark spots on his record and carries around a little baggage. Catherine seems like a cool salve for Brand's tortured conscience and bitterness toward his father, who will not publicly acknowledge him. I like both characters because they were mature, faced danger head on, with courage and honor, and proved their love was strong and could weather any storm.This is a novella length story, but did not suffer from underdeveloped characterization. The plot does move quickly, but the story is fleshed out evenly with a nice mix of romance, intrigue and suspense. I'm not sure if this book is a part of a series, but even it is, it can be read as a stand alone. A perfect lunch break read for historical romance lovers!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOVNW9BLMOPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CR0SFS#wasThisHelpful","R2JOVNW9BLMOPZ","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Her Perfect Stranger by Jill Shalvis is a 2002 Harlequin Temptation publication.This title is one of those 'bargain bin' novels I picked up at my local paperback swap store.  Jill Shalvis has gone on to enjoy countless appearances on the NYT bestseller list and is a heavy hitter in contemporary romance.I pulled this title off my shelf because I am thinking of starting a new MEME for my blog in order to incorporate more of my older books in with the new releases I feature on my blog.  ( Stay tuned for more information on this development)It's hard to fathom the many changes our lives have undergone since this book was written.  Sadly, NASA and the Space Shuttle, which was a big part of the story, is no longer a part of our space program.  Also, the attitudes regarding women in a position of power has improved as it's more common than  it once was.Corrine finds herself stranded in a hotel during a storm with no rooms available, when a man she met in the hotel bar, a perfect stranger,  offers to share his room with her. After spending the night together, the situation turns awkward when Mike discovers Corrine is his boss.  Not only that, she is one cool customer, never out of control, garnering the reputation of being an Ice Princess.  Corrine doesn't have time for a relationship, especially with a man she is working with.  But, Mike has no qualms about pursuing Corrine, even if it's just a temporary, physical attraction.Naturally,  the couple find themselves playing with fire as each one tries to deny there is more to the relationship than carnal pleasure.This is a pretty short book,  and so things move along at a  fast pace.  Mike is a very likeable character, is smart, down to earth, and pretty much unflappable.  This irritates Corrine, as she struggles to maintain her professionalism, when all she can think about is Mike.  A reader picking this book up in 2015  may find the book is slightly outdated, but just a little bit, in regards  to women being in charge , and the difficulty some men had with a woman being 'the boss'.  Other than that, this book is still a nice, spicy contemporary, and is still available in both digital and paperback formats.It was fun watching Mike pull Corrine out of her carefully constructed professional persona.  This couple literally could not keep their hands to themselves.  They are hot, hot, hot behind closed doors, with some of their sexy time pushing the envelope for a Harlequin novel written over a decade ago.The plot was just a little thin and of course somewhat predictable,  and Corrine could grate on a person's nerves at times.  However,  this was a fun trip down memory lane, plus it was a lot of fun to read some of Jill's back listed titles.3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8ZH0O33NF4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0263835448#wasThisHelpful","RG8ZH0O33NF4P","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hot Toy by Jennifer Crusie is a 2015 St. Martin's Press publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This is a novella length modern day Christmas tale filled with non-stop action against the insane backdrop of last minute Christmas shopping.All Trudy wanted was to find her nephew the hottest toy of the year so he wouldn't be disappointed on Christmas morning.  So, she finds herself in the midst of last minute Christmas shoppers in the worst toy store in town, battling it out for a toy sold out months ago.  The last person she expected to run into was Nolan, a guy she very briefly dated a few months ago.  To put the star on the Christmas tree, she also finds herself caught up in a cloak and dagger spy game! Merry Christmas and Ho Ho Ho!In all honesty, this story is pretty silly, but during the holiday season, these are the types of stories that just might keep a person sane.  Many of us have found ourselves rushing around at the last minute and searching against all odds for that elusive, much sought after toy one of our children, or relatives wants more than anything else.  Talk about stressful!  So, many of you will be able to relate to Trudy's dilemma. The author takes that common issue and turns it into action packed adventure with laugh out loud dialogue and still manages to slip in a few heartwarming holiday moments to boot.This book is perfect for a holiday spirit booster and may even help you put  all of it  in perspective a little bit.  A short, funny, escapist read, just the right length to fit into a busy holiday season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6CNKUSCV58B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N98XPE#wasThisHelpful","RJ6CNKUSCV58B","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"House of Echos by Brendan Duffy is a 2015 Ballantine Books publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.It seems that the good old fashioned chiller is a thing of the past, replaced by blood, gore, and slashers, with as much nauseating violence as possible. The understated, atmospheric, spine tingling suspense that makes you jump at every little noise in the house, is a lost art, for the most part.However, in House of Echos, the horror genre is blessed with a well thought out thriller that creates a sinister tone, setting the stage for the slow, but steady increase of suspense and foreboding, that keeps you turning the pages, but dreading what you will find there.The writing was a bit jarring at times as the author shifted gears suddenly, taking me in an entirely new direction I wasn't expecting. However, the build up of suspense was superb despite the occasional sharp turns here and there.This story is an ideal Halloween read, if you are in the mood for a spooky tale this month. I loved the Gothic undertones in this one, and appreciated the limited amount of violence and gore. Naturally, with a novel classified as 'horror', one must expect some disturbing descriptions and events, and in this case animals seem to be a target, and of course as an animal advocate, I cringed a lot. I don't know why animals and small children always have to be the first targets when evil hangs in the air. However, for the most part the author replies upon the psychological tension in this family unit, and the parallel to events of the distant past, in a small community, set in a large isolated mansion, filled with a deeply rooted feeling of oppression. You get the idea...I rarely read horror novels any more, but of course the month of October puts me the mood for a supernatural tale. I'm very picky about the books I will read within this genre, and am delighted to say this one did the job it set out to do, by giving me a few chills and thrills along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAQ0AQSM2EDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PENN6#wasThisHelpful","R3BAQ0AQSM2EDA","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything I Left Unsaid by M. O'Keefe is a 2015 Random House publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Sometimes it simply comes down to this: READ THIS BOOK! I promise you will find it absorbing, scorching hot, relentless, and suspenseful, and will leave you gasping, breathlessly wanting more.Annie is one of those truly inspiring characters, a woman who has never been off the family farm in Oklahoma, knows very little about the world at large, but she has a survivor's instinct that screams into her ears, telling her to get the H out Dodge before it's too late so she leaves her abusive husband, still bearing the marks of his hands around her bruised neck. She winds up in a trailer park filled with other kindred spirits who have graduated from the same school of hard knocks as Annie. Once she steps inside her trailer, the oddest thing happens a cell phone stuffed between some cushions starts to ring... Should she answer it?A phone call will change Annie's life, and open up a whole new world of sensations, giving her a taste of real pleasure, and a renewed outlook on life. From the first moment she hears his voice, she leaves behind Annie's bleak surroundings, transforms into her new alter ego- Layla, and steps into Dylan's exotic, titillating, and exciting world.Dylan has been paying people to watch over an elderly resident of the trailer park, but apparently, his last employee has left without notice, leaving his cell phone behind. When Layla answers the phone, something about her voice, her bad jokes, and tone of innocence, intrigues Dylan, and the two strike up a most unusual relationship, one that builds a odd sort of trust, a sense of safety, and sends Layla on an amazing journey of sexual and self- discovery.Told from Annie's first person perspective, her vulnerability and innocence jump off the pages, making me worry about her constantly. She has been sheltered, raised by an unstable mother, going straight into an abusive marriage. She has never been on her own before, and is now surrounded by some characters that made me a little nervous, unsure of whom to trust.Dylan gives us a third person perspective, and while he is also struggling with some major emotional issues from his past, he exudes a powerful presence, one that made me feel like Annie/Layla would be safe with him. But, there are some boulder size obstacles the couple will face. Still, despite all that, Annie's journey is incredible, and I was so proud of her and the courage she shows by taking charge of her life.This is a spell bounding story, very unique, with some big and interesting curves thrown in that kept me sitting on the edge of my seat. The one huge bummer is that there is a cliffhanger and it's a whale of one. UGH!! BUT the author was quite upfront with that and assures us the wait will not be long for the next chapter of the story. So, in the meantime, I'll be sitting on pins and needles, impatiently counting the days until I can hear Dylan's voice again. *Sigh*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOE7ALQBUP1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WM#wasThisHelpful","R1TOE7ALQBUP1P","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"City of Jasmine by Deanna Raybourn is a 2014 MIRA publication.This book has a very long 'wait' list with my library so I've had to cool my heels waiting with much anticipation to read this book.  Finally, this week,  it became available to me after being 'on hold' for what seemed like an eternity.  So, once I got it downloaded,  I dropped everything else and dived into this book immediately.This is a unique novel for this author, best known for her 'Lady Julia'  historical mystery series.  Set in the 1920's the adventuresome aviatrix Evangeline Starke, a woman well ahead of her time,  is preparing for a whirlwind tour in her aeroplane, but takes a detour when a bombshell revelation takes her to Damascus in search of a long lost love and maybe even a priceless artifact.I love historical adventures and the author does an amazing job of creating the atmosphere of the decade, with very vivid details of the surroundings, and introducing us to some very colorful characters, some of whom were terrible villains and some that I simply loved.This story is all about intrigue, the hunt and fight for a priceless artifact, and the adventures Evangeline and Gabriel have while trying to retrieve the artifact and stay alive.  This is also a love story, but it's very unconventional and I dare say some may balk at the outcome. It was a little hard to swallow sometimes and I admit,  Gabriel was a tough nut to crack, and I never quite knew how to take him.  Still, I couldn't help but forgive him in the end.I really enjoyed going along on this adventure with Evangeline and Gabriel and this wonderfully zany and offbeat cast of characters.  This is a satisfying and enjoyable historical mystery and romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H89I54T535AU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNJVSVI#wasThisHelpful","R1H89I54T535AU","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dance of the Bones by J.A. Jance is a 2015 William Morrow publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.I have read books from three of Jance's series, Beaumont being my all time favorite character. I have not read any of the books about the Walker family , this being my first introduction to the characters from that series.This book is marketed as a Beaumont novel- listing it as the 22nd in that series, but that is a little bit misleading, since Beaumont makes little more than a cameo appearance here. This is definitely Brandon Walker's show.There are several threads running through this novel, but the main story line involves a man convicted of a crime he may be innocent of, a man Brandon Walker put behind bars. So, after all these years, Brandon finds himself once more embroiled in what is most likely a cold case, and after discovering a connection to another old case, Brandon reaches out to J.P. Beaumont, who just happens to have a little time on his hands.There are a lot of characters in this story and at times I felt a little lost. This could be due to my lack of familiarity with the Walker series, but I usually find it difficult to keep up with a large cast of characters, no matter what. However, the plot is not all that complicated, so it wasn't that hard to follow, actually. However, the story doesn't flow smoothly, is jagged and disjointed all the way up to the midway mark. There are too many flashbacks, for lack of a better word, for one thing, which made it hard to maintain my focus on the main thread.The Native American story that began each chapter was a nice touch, and is very interesting and I liked the way the reservation traditions was woven into the story, especially concerning Gabe. Once I got familiar with all the characters, and their roles, I was able to relax into the story more and once I reached the halfway point, I could see things starting to come together and the writing tightened up a great deal in the last half of the book, enabling me to became more engrossed in the story.This was not my favorite book by this author, but it did introduce me to the Walker's and I liked them well enough to want to catch up with them someday. Although, it got off to a pretty rocky start, the story ended up being enjoyable enough, in the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGOV9ZXGDNAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP0JHS2#wasThisHelpful","R3AGOV9ZXGDNAY","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boats and Bad Guys by Cindy Bell is a 2014 publication.Suzie and Mary find what appears to be a treasure map tucked behind a painting they purchased for their new B&B business.  This discovery sends the two friends on a quest to discover what really happened to the artist who painted the picture and if their really is a hidden treasure.This is super short cozy mystery that solves a cold case and takes the ladies of a bit of a high seas adventure.  There is a lot of action and suspense and of course the story moves at a very fast pace.At this stage, the series is still settling into a rhythm,  giving the reader a little more insight into the main characters, but also the secondary characters, like Paul and Jason.  Since the story was so short, the set up was a little bit rushed through, and some details were not fleshed out,  but this makes a solid 'lunch break'  mystery and  I'm looking forward to seeing what Suzie and Mary get up to next. 3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VAS5G9F7UKHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG3CFDU#wasThisHelpful","R3VAS5G9F7UKHM","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chance the Winds of Fortune by Laurie McBain is a 2015 Sourcebooks Casablanca publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Fire which seems extinguished often slumbers beneath the ashes- Pierre Corneille With diabolical villains plotting revenge, Rhea Claire, the daughter of Sabrina and Lucien, is kidnapped, then manages a daring escape, only to find herself on board the Sea Dragon with Marquis Dante Leighton, who believes she is a spy, so once more she finds herself being held captive.The bright Day is done, And we are for the dark.- Shakespeare.Thus begins the epic tale of Dante and Rhea, which is filled with treasure seeking, privateers, pirates, and high seas adventure. While Rhea is not quite as fiery as her mother, she holds her own against the stubborn captain of the Sea Dragon, without losing the tender, gentle part of herself that made her unique. Rhea is most certainly a lady, and one I felt so bad for while she struggled with homesickness, against Dante's hardened heart, and with her feelings for him.Dante was a man on a mission, seeking sunken treasure, and is a little bit bitter, and cynical, but, eventually, the sweet Rhea Claire slowly chips away at this rough exterior and wins his heart.I am so excited to see Laurie McBain's books being brought back to life in the digital world. Originally published in 1980, the younger crowd reading these books, might struggle a little with the slower pacing and yes, the writing is a lot different from what many of you are accustomed to, but I for one truly believe this author's style is exemplary, because she puts me right there in the story, vividly describing the scenery and action, which blocks out all distractions for me and keeps me completely absorbed in the story.Times go by turns, and chances change by course.From foul to fair, from better hap to worse- Robert SouthwellThere is a lot going on in this story, with Lucien's horrible cousin, Kate, who is basically a psychopath, and Dante also has a few enemies to contend with. With so much going on, I began to wonder when Rhea and Dante were going to finally face each other, as their story doesn't get off the ground until after the half way mark of the story. But, stick with it, because this is only the beginning for this couple, who will go through a great many trials before they finally get to the truth.Sadly, epic sagas, such as this one are a thing of the past, and I really miss them. It is so fun to return to these classic romance novels again, and I sincerely hope these stories capture the imagination of a whole new generation of romance readers!Also, you will want to be sure to catch Dark Before the Rising Sun , the conclusion of the 'Dominick series, also featuring Rhea and Dante, which is is also available in digital format.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22AGW3AIK45RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWMC8CG#wasThisHelpful","R22AGW3AIK45RB","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moonstruck Madness by Laurie McBain is a 1977 Avon Publication.When I noticed a couple of Laurie McBain's books were up for review on Netgalley, I didn't hesitate to request them. I am thrilled to see some of these books are being released in digital format. However, when I started on Chance the Winds of Fortune, I realized the book was the second in the series. I didn't see the first book up for review, so I went into my vintage and collectable bookshelf to see, if by some minor miracle, I had a copy of this book. Being a big fan of Laurie's I did keep many of her books, so I was relieved to discover that I did still have a copy. YAY!Written way back in the late 70's, this book might be tossed into the 'bodice ripper' category, but frankly, I didn't feel that way about it. Yes, there are some uncomfortable treatments of women, but despite what many would like to believe, these depictions were accurate and true to the time period.Other than that, this book is pretty much a standard historical romance for the time frame it was written in.Sabrina has left her beloved Highlands of Scotland for England with her aunt, sister and young brother. They are not well off, and Sabrina takes part and even devises some dangerous stunts in order to keep her family afloat, until she crosses the Duke of Camareigh, who puts her little enterprise out of business. In order to survive, Sabrina will have to escape her father's plans for her, which leads her right back into the arms of Lucien Dominick.I loved this story! It's a real classic and is tame enough that modern readers will find it just as enjoyable now as romance lovers did when the book was first published. Sabrina is bold, daring, and a woman who doesn't give up without a fight. I loved her determination, her cleverness, and her fiery passion.Lucien was absolutely hilarious most of time, as the author depicted him so authentically. He is haughty, arrogant, and manipulative too, but his punishment is having to deal with Sabrina, the love of his life, who always keeps him begging for more.The secondary characters were also key in this story and give it a very tiny paranormal element as well. There is lots of action, adventure, drama, and emotions in this one, and the writing is simply wonderful. When I read these older books, and find myself swept away , so immersed in another world, never wanting the story to end, I can start to feel a little wistful, wishing there were more books like these being written in present day. Thankfully, a publisher has seen the worthiness of these novels and are reissuing them, breathing new life into them, so that hopefully, a whole new generation will come to love these classics too. 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1107PMVQ0U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPZ2JA#wasThisHelpful","R3O1107PMVQ0U5","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ghost of Ardnamore by Alix Andre is a 1979 Worldwide Library/Mystique Books publication.As many of you know, I collect rare, out of print, and vintage books, and search through used bookstores etc. for these little gems.  This book is one of those hard to find, out of print novels, by an author I was not at all familiar with.  You never know what you'll get with these books since often they are dated or just plain bad, but at other times these novels are actually pretty good and it's a shame they are not being preserved or released in digital format by someone.This one falls somewhere in between, since it was an obvious knock off of the mystery classic Rebecca.When Martine and her step-sister, Helen, travel to Scotland with the intention of selling off a piece of useless property Helen has inherited,  they become embroiled in an old legend concerning a haunted Loch.  The man purchasing the property from Helen, Richard Duncan,  insist they stay at his castle while they iron out the details, which leads to Martine falling in love with Richard, but the mystery surrounding the death of his fiance has her on edge, and determined to clear him of all suspicion.This time of year always puts me in the mood to read a spooky story, and so I was combing through my bookshelves looking for a ghost story, when this book grabbed my attention. This story falls in the romantic suspense genre for the most part, but had a few characteristics of the old Gothic mystery novels that were so popular in the 60's and 70's.  Although, the outline was very familiar, it wasn't a bad read at all. It's a clean read, typical of it's time, with a castle, a dark brooding male lead, and while technically a damsel in distress, Martine, is not the too stupid to live type at all, and is actually a character I liked.  There are some ghostly elements, but alas, everything has a plausible explanation.  So, this is was not the spooky story I was looking for, exactly, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised by this one and enjoyed it for the most part.3 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BGXMZAJML4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FRNPNY#wasThisHelpful","R4BGXMZAJML4V","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But, despite her reservations, Lacey agrees to prepare the cottage for Ava and Mason.Ava knows she will have to face Ean, Ava's brother, eventually, because of the wedding,  which is going to be a little awkward for Lacey.  She hasn't seen Ean since she was fourteen years old and made an embarrassing pass at him, which he handled badly.  To her utter dismay, Ean shows up at the cottage unexpectedly, during a snowstorm and naturally, they wind up stranded there for there for the night.  Will the cottage prove to be magical after all?I really like Samantha Chase, and read many of her novels, but this one was not very good. There is just no nice way to say it.  First of all, I was very disappointed by the ending because of a pet peeve of mine, which I can't mention here without giving away a major plot twist.  I don't find it romantic at all, don't think it's fair to the couple in question, and it's merely symbolic, since the I's weren't  dotted and the T's weren't crossed.  Ava was the most irritating, immature, and annoying character I have come across in a long time, but she does at least have one moment of sanity and I applauded her maturity in that one moment, but her timing was terrible, showing she is incredibly self absorbed.  However,  Ava's story continues in...Ever AfterSo, by now you have guessed Ava didn't marry Mason after all.  But, she isn't left out in the cold, because she really does need a happy ending after all she went through. ( And put us through in the first book)  Ava's personality didn't improve much in this story , and if it's possible, she was  a little more annoying. She is STILL  fixated on that bleeping cottage, and nearly ruins a good relationship because of it.  Brian was okay sometimes, but at other times, I got just as frustrated with him as I did with Ava.  Thankfully,  they had a little intervention and Ava finally got what she was dreaming of all along. Thank goodness!Again, I really DO  like this author, and I know what she is capable of, which makes this one more disappointing, as a result,  because this could have been a really awesome collection. Naturally,  I will continue to read her books, however,  I  can't really recommend this one as there are just way too many holiday stories out there with more humor, more chemistry, and more depth.2 stars","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXUUXXCQLXFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQC2OE8#wasThisHelpful","R3MXUUXXCQLXFW","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karin Slaughter is a seasoned author of taut suspense and she certainly knows how to weave a wicked little tale.  This one though was a real mind bender.It's been over twenty years since Lydia and Claire's older sister, Julia, disappeared.  Their lives took drastically different directions at that point, as Lydia falls into drug abuse and addiction, and Claire quietly disappears into the safe environment her genius husband, Paul, has created for her.  Claire and Lydia have been estranged for all these years, but when Paul is killed, the two sisters cautiously reconnect as they begin to uncover a mountain of lies, sins, crimes, and depravity, no one would ever have guessed at, and at the very heart of the matter, is the drive to discover what really happened to their sister all those years ago.Once I started this book I was immediately sucked into it, and found it deeply absorbing.  The book is longer than the usual three hundred and fifty page lengths I have grown used to, and while there is a vast amount of information to digest and weed through, there were times the story got bogged down a little and the momentum suffered as a result.  A few times I questioned some of the information and found it pushed the boundaries of plausibility,  but overall, the plot was tightly woven, clever, and very tense.  The characters were well drawn and the baddies are particularly chilling.  Although the story is basically centered around Claire,  I didn't know  what to think of her sometimes.  Her character does grow in leaps and bounds and she discovers a strength within  her she never knew she had.  However,  Lydia was inspirational, a character I liked instantly.  She steals the show in many ways with her sharp mouth, her bravery and ability to forgive, which in the beginning was something she struggles with.This book is not for the faint of heart as the subject matter is very dark, the violence is graphic, and the imagery is quite disturbing.  It  is also a very emotional and heartbreaking story, as we see the toll the crimes have taken on the families.  By the time I got the end, I felt like I had just finished a  marathon or participated in the triathlon.  This book gives your brain, your body and soul a thorough workout, but like Claire, Helen, and Lydia, I was left with a sense of peace, a feeling these strong women will survive their ordeal, and will pass that fortitude onto the next generation, making those who didn't live to see justice done, very proud indeed.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R101AEDICN653G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VES8D6K#wasThisHelpful","R101AEDICN653G","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"American Ghost: A Family's Haunted Past in the Desert Southwest by Hannah Nordhaus is a 2015 Harper publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.With a title like this one, I was sure this book would make an excellent Halloween read.  I'm not a slasher, blood and gore type horror fan, but instead lean toward the creepy, chiller ghost and haunted house stories.  So, I was all set to immerse myself in a little history, a little haunting, and maybe a few thrills and spine tingling moments to cap it off.Sadly, this book was, well, to be totally honest, boring. The history provided about Julia would definitely be interesting to one's own family, but to anyone else, it was very dry reading.The ghost story is apparently one of note and concerns the author's great, great, grandmother Julia Schuster Staab, who allegedly haunts a hotel in Sante Fe.  Through the years, those who spent the night in Julia's room have complained of various unexplained temperature drops, orbs of dancing lights and other very unsettling occurrences.  The story grew to epic proportions and of course embellishments went without saying.So, the author began a quest to learn of Julia's past, her heritage, her marriage to a man many believe treated her cruelly,  her supposed descent into madness, and her death.  Determined to separate fact from fiction, the author employed mediums, did intense historical research, and was often surprised by her findings.I think the title will throw some people off, and although I did read the synopsis, as a person who also enjoys history, I felt I had a good understanding of what to expect from the book.  It was an interesting journey in many aspects, but it was such a personal quest, that I often failed to connect to the author's enthusiasm, frustrations, and at times her methods.I will confess, I did think of abandoning this one by the half way mark, but couldn't let it go without knowing what the final verdict would be.  I was pleased by the way the book ended, which will give the reader a sense of peace and closure.This story is also a kind of cautionary tale, in which we are reminded how myths can grow to outlandishness, leaving only a particle of truth behind.  The myth and legend of this haunting will be impossible to extinguish now that it's been embedded in the minds of the public, who prefer to fiction most of the time in order to capitalize on the public's curiosity.  Still, for the author,  I felt that in the end, she at least derived a sense of accomplishment from her research and it was worth her while in the end.2.5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX48WSEMWJMRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPV5B7Q#wasThisHelpful","RX48WSEMWJMRC","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blonde Hair, Blue Eyes by Karin Slaughter is a 2015 Cornerstone Digital publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.This novella length story sets the stage for the full length novel  Pretty Girls.Julia is a college student concerned about the recent disappearance of a couple of girls who are strikingly similar in appearance.  She is hoping to be a reporter/journalist and wants to write a story about rape statistics.In the meantime, Julia still wants to belong, wants to have fun, is hoping the guy she is seeing feels the same way about her as she does about him.  She's both mature and immature at times, and I so I found her character to  be pretty typical of her age.The story is atmospheric from the beginning with a palpable sense of foreboding, and by the end of this short story, I was very, very uneasy and disturbed.The author throws out some truly frightening statistics about female victims and draws parallels between how these crimes are approached and viewed from various standpoints.I strongly urge you to have Pretty Girls already on your kindle before reading this short prequel, because this story does come to a sudden and shocking stop.Overall, this story accomplishes what it set out to do, which is to entice readers to read the full length novel.3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKPG7P9D7K7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z751DUY#wasThisHelpful","R3IKPG7P9D7K7U","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brave the Heat by Sara Humphrey's is a 2015 Sourcebooks Casablanca publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This book is the first in a new contemporary romance series featuring the McGuire brothers.  Many of us know this author for her wildly popular paranormal series,  so this one may seem like a departure for some of you.Jordan and Gavin were teenage sweethearts but  Jordan  abruptly left town without a word, never to be seen or heard from again for fifteen years.Now she has come home with two young daughters, to take care of family matters and hopefully make a fresh start in her tumultuous life.  What she didn't know what that for fifteen long years, Gavin has never completely gotten over her and was hurt by her departure far more than she ever could have imagined.But, this is not the only pain Gavin is dealing with.  A horrible tragedy inspired him to become a firefighter,  and is still haunted and riddled with guilt over what happened.  However, at the moment he has his hands full with an outbreak of  fires obviously the work of an arsonist.Now that Jordan is back in town, can Gavin get to the bottom of why she left all those years ago?  Do they have a chance at love the second time around? I enjoy reading contemporary romance more than I ever used to, but as a person well past her  twenties, I often find it hard to relate to the characters and the issues they find daunting. So,  I really appreciated that this story featured more mature characters who were dealing with meatier issues. But, for me, what set this one apart from others like it, was the more realistic depiction of firefighters, highlighting the dangers of the profession, something that is often glossed over in romance novels.With Gavin,  we were introduced to what felt like a real, honest- to -goodness hero who literally goes into blazing infernos and pulls people to safety.  But, while Gavin knows what a fire can do, how quickly it can spread, and how easily it can kill, being in love with Jordan frightens him just a much as a fire raging out of control.Love is scary and wonderful, and it's what makes us humanJordan's life has never been easy and she's never been able to catch a break.  Her return home is a new start for her and a chance to face down old demons, clear up misunderstandings and past hurts, and hopefully set her life back on track.  I thought she did the right thing by leaving home, but did not do it the right way.It's obvious the old fires are still burning between Gavin and Jordan but is it too late to start over? Has too much time passed?  Can they work through their doubts and fears in order to finally have a life together?The drama and romance is compelling enough to make a great story, but the mystery involving the arson fires is not to be taken lightly, even though it runs in the background for  much of the time.Some parts of the story does seem to follow the usual contemporary romance pattern when it comes to second chance love stories, don't be fooled or become complacent.  This was a very solid romance, with very intense situations and a shocking mystery.I think this book set the stage for a very solid series and I'm really looking forward to the second installment.  4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWY40IM4DGU3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402293674#wasThisHelpful","RWY40IM4DGU3J","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No Place to Hide by Susan Lewis is a 2015 Ballantine Books publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher as a part of The LibraryThing Early Review program.No Place to Hide is a powerful, emotional, and stunning novel.I had no idea what to expect when I started the book but I was under the impression it was a suspense mystery novel. Well, it is that, but is also a riveting drama that held me in it's grip from start to finish.Hope is the thing with feathersThat perches in the soul,And sings the tune without the words,And never stops at all.-Emily DickinsonJustine has moved from England to Culver, Indiana, a place where her grandmother once owned a lake house. Justine remembers spending summers here as a child and is positive her deceased grandmother is compelling her to live in Indiana instead of settling down somewhere else.Justine has been forced to begin her life over again with her three year old daughter, leaving her husband behind. She's changed her name, keeps her past a secret, confides in no one, not even her current best friend. She's constantly worried about the press, about someone finding out who she really is, she's jumpy, emotional, and seems very fragile.But, why is Justine hiding? What is she running from? Why is she starting over and leaving behind a husband she obviously loves and misses dearly?All we know is that Justine and Matt agreed that living separate lives was the only way their three year old daughter could have a normal life and that whatever has driven them to this unorthodox arrangement is something truly sinister.Via flashbacks, we learn that Matt and Justine had a pretty charmed life for a while. They had purchased their dream home, were surrounded by good friends, were both happy with their careers, and had three healthy children. But, as the past begins to merge with the present the shocking truth will leave you shaken to the core.The pacing in the first half of the book is slow, but tantalizing, as the author builds the suspense and mystery to crescendo. I could not begin to fathom why Justine and Matt would take such extreme measures to protect their daughter, agreeing to avoid contacting one another even. Why were the media interested in them? I tried to puzzle it all out, coming up with a plethora of scenarios, but never, ever would I have guessed where the story was headed.Once the shocking truth is revealed the second half of the story take on an entirely new dimension as everything we learned before now makes sense. But, the atmosphere is so taut by that this time I was nearly breathless.The secondary story in which Justine discovers some puzzling information regarding her grandmother, is paralleled to the situation Justine is in, certainly not to the same extent or context, but does add another layer to story that has it's own twist and surprises.The themes explored in this novel are multi  layered, such as family secrets, running from the past, family bonds, parental mistakes, prejudice, cruelty, blame and guilt, but also the promise of forgiveness, a testament to power of love, of forgiveness, and of hope.While there are other books that have tackled some of these issues, none have been presented in such a way as this, and I can not stop praising the author's ability to create such intense emotions, create doubts, touch on our worst nightmares, but still, despite such grim circumstances offer us a renewed hope and leave us with a sense of peace.None of the characters in the novel will ever be the same, they will bear crosses all their lives, will have moments of confusion, pain, guilt, regret and remorse, will second guess all that came before and all that will come next, but these are remarkable people in unbearable circumstances who will no doubt soldier on and make the best possible future with what and who is left to build it with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37H8OQLTSL7SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549554#wasThisHelpful","R37H8OQLTSL7SS","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Warning by Sophie Hannah is a 2015 Witness Impulse Publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review by the publisher and Edelweiss.The Warning is a suspenseful novella that might give you a little something to chew on. For a short story, I thought the author did an excellent job of creating a dark and atmospheric situation that had me feeling a little jumpy and uneasy.One part of me was sure I knew which direction the story would take, while another part of me couldn't decide who to believe or who could be trusted.A stranger steps in and saves the day for Chloe and her daughter. Now, Chloe wants to show her gratitude by bringing the man a gift. On the surface this seems like human nature at it's best. But, looking up a total stranger could have dire consequences, especially when Chloe is given a strong warning to stay clear of Tom.Each character is suspect, each could have his or her own agenda, or they could be totally innocent and only trying to be helpful. You will have to decide for yourself, if you can, who you should trust or not.A menacing, sinister, thought provoking story that will have you questioning your own paranoia and ability to decipher who to trust in your everyday dealings with friends or strangers.I thought the book touched on some interesting themes, by drawing the characters in such a way as to represent one extreme or another, suggesting a calm, reasonable approach might be what works best in the long run. I definitely thought about the story for a while after having finished it.Simply taking the story at face value is allowed, but I picked up on a few finer points hidden in there too. Although the story ended in a surprising way, there were several alternate endings that could have taken it's place.Over all this is a clever little short story worth an hour or so of your time. 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDWCOWM9Q6JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VES8D5G#wasThisHelpful","RMDWCOWM9Q6JI","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scandal Before Sunrise by Sabrina Darby is a 2015 publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the author and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Short and sweet, Scandal Before sunrise, is a novella length story that centers around Abigail Billings, a woman who has returned to London after a lengthy absence. Her sudden departure was fuel for the gossips and Elliot Jones is determined to uncover the truth about her, putting her goal of becoming a respectable lady and finding a good match for marriage in danger.It is important to remember that in the 19th century, in London, scandals were always sought after by the bored, the titled and the wealthy. Abby's situation peaked Jones' curiosity due to her reputation as a thrill seeker, a vivacious young lady who dared to spit scandal in the eye. But, upon her return to London, it seems Abby is much more subdued and very marriage minded.I thought this story was fun and flirtatious. Abby's past is indeed scandalous and I could understand her fierce desire to quickly find a suitable husband. But, Jones who is so nosy and bad, and hoping to talk Abby into having an affair with him, keeps distracting her and reminding her of the days when she was more the vixen, a part of her personality he is determined to draw out.The banter between Abby and Elliot was titillating and sensual, but they kept the build up at a respectable level. Despite his original intentions toward Abby, Elliot soon finds himself a war with his feelings towards her. He wants an affair, Abby wants marriage. Will Abby give it to temptation and ruin her chances of at becoming respectable or will Elliot rise to the occasion to save Abby's reputation?This is an enjoyable read, with a little bit of mystery, lots of scandal, backstabbing, and delicious gossip. There is even a plot twist thrown in I didn't see coming. With a short story or novella at times the depth is not what I would like it to be, and this one did suffer from that malady just a little, but it was a nice way to escape sitting under the air conditioner on a blistering hot August afternoon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ABRRD4BUHUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UBYYZG#wasThisHelpful","R38ABRRD4BUHUL","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new cozy mystery series I think I'm going to love!Mrs. Kaplan and the Matzoh Ball of Death by Mark Reutlinger is a 2014 Alibi publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This first book in an all new cozy mystery series features Rose Kaplan and her very good friend, Ida, two senior citizens residing at the Julius and Rebecca Cohen home for Jewish Seniors.Rose makes the best Matzoh ball soup in the world, so after winning a contest, she is allowed to make her infamous soup for seder, the first night of Passover.But, things go horribly awry when someone falls face first into the soup and is pronounced dead at the scene. Rose is relieved beyond measure to learn her cooking hadn't killed anyone, but it would seem she is still a person of interest, because what did kill the poor woman was found in Rose's soup. So, the question is how did it get there if Rose didn't put it there?So before Rose winds up in jail for crime she didn't commit, she and Ida must determine what really happened.I do believe I have found a new cozy series to follow. Told from Ida's first person perspective, these ladies had me in stitches. Seniors they may be, but they are sharp, alert and observant. The home is a boiling pot of gossip and secrets so it will take a some unconventional methods for Rose and Ida to solve the case. I was fascinated by the vernacular and intonations and expressions used, with authentic Yiddish language included in some of the dialogue, adding another level of enjoyment to the story for me. The dialogue was snappy and sparked with wit and humor, the characters were well drawn and developed, the pacing was steady, and the character driven plot kept me engaged, and puzzling over the red herrings, but mainly I was just entertained by this story and actually laughed out loud a few times.There were some moments where things got a little too far fetched, but with a cozy mystery I think a little elbow room is required at times, especially when writing about senior amateur sleuths, who are limited to what they can plausible accomplish while living in an assisted living home.Rose cleverly outsmarted the detectives on the case, which caused some embarrassment for them, but also garnered Rose a little respect too. I've got the next book queued up and ready to read and can't wait to see what happens next.Overall, this well written mystery was a very satisfying read and I had a lot of fun with it. I think this series is going to be a keeper.4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1447PD5W0DMYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK0PJJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1447PD5W0DMYO","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hot Seal ( A Hostile Operations Team Novella- Book 9) by Lynn Raye Harris is a 2015 publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.As if the 104 degree temperatures here in Texas weren't hot enough...This ninth book in the HOT series is one of the steamiest to date, and that's saying something. I always love the romantic suspense elements in these stories with hot alpha SEALS and dangerous missions, but I am also a sucker for second change romance.Kind of like that old Johnny Cash song- Dane and Ivy got married in a fever hotter than a pepper sprout. But, when they woke up from the haze and reality set in, Ivy's old insecurities rose to the surface when Dane announced he wanted to be a Navy SEAL. Her career in the DEA was important to her for personal reasons, and she didn't want to give that up to be a lonely Navy Wife, always wondering if Dane would return to her or not. Unable to make a compromise, the two divorced. Now four years later, a dangerous drug smuggling operation requires the help of the SEALS. Ivy is lucky she is still involved in the case at all, but is soon mortified to discover her ex-husband is a member of the military team called in to take over the operation.I had a feeling I was going to like Dane, after all how could I dislike someone with the nickname of Viking. Sure enough this guy oozed alpha hotness, but is also sensitive, sweet, and funny. Ivy, was shaped by her unfortunate childhood which led to being an adult with some issues to work through. I did like Ivy and was moved by her story, but she did frustrate me at times because Dane needed emotional support too and she seemed a little top self involved. The chemistry between Dane and Ivy sizzles immediately with just one smoldering look, but the old issues between them still fester. Can they manage to work out a compromise so that one doesn't have to give up their career for the other?For a novella length story, this one has a lot of action and suspense, too, with a riveting showdown between the SEALS and some really nasty drug lords. I have to mention the secondary characters too because their humor added a nice compliment to a pretty intense story.Overall, this installment has my engines revving for the next book in the series, which thankfully will release very soon, so I won't have to wait too long between books. 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUC6KWYYUN9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011OKQOTK#wasThisHelpful","R2FUC6KWYYUN9A","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Needs at Night's Edge by Kresley Cole is a 2008 Pocket Books publication.  I was provided a copy of this book as an XOXpert the official street team of XOXO After Dark.After reading the first four Immortals After Dark novels, this one seemed like a bit of a departure, but one I welcomed.I've struggled to find the time to catch up with the series, but with fall upon us and Halloween right around the corner, I've been in the mood for something paranormal.  This book happened to be the perfect book for my mood.Neomi Laress was a premier ballerina in the 1920's,  but her former fiance murders her after she breaks things off with him.  She has been stuck in the phantom realm at her dream home, Elancourt,  in New Orleans ever since.The  abandoned and crumbling home is the perfect spot for Nikolai and Sebastian to bring their brother, Conrad, who is still enraged over having been made into a vampire.  Conrad has the blood lust and is very dangerous, which has made him a few enemies along the way.  He's out of control and his brothers are hoping to contain him, wishing he would find his bride which might help take the edge off.After years of being invisible, it figures a vampire would be the one who could see Neomi.  She is thrilled by Conrad's ability to see her and converse with her, but as attuned as they are they can't physically  touch each other.Yet as time goes on, Conrad knows Neomi is his bride by fate, his bride by choice.  But how on earth can that be?Ghost stories are my absolute favorite paranormal trope and these days they are few and far between.  One reason, I suppose, is that it's got to be hard to create a love story with a  ghost as the love interest.  I mean, how do you make that work?Well, leave it to Kresley Cole to find a way.  This imaginative story is deeply sensual,  but with lots of action and danger to round things out.  The secondary characters were absolutely fantastic with super sharp dialogue that kept me enthralled, exited, and totally into this book.I loved the flip flop of having Neomi be the take charge person  in the sexual aspects and for a very rare change, the female lead is the one with the most sexual experience.  I loved the way everything worked out for the couple.  I loved Conrad's growth and development,  because he has so much to overcome, but I couldn't help but feel a huge mount of empathy for Neomi.While this story may seem impossible to pull off, it worked out wonderfully, with love doing it's thing and working it's own magic.This was one of the most unique installments in a series that is known for being idiosyncratic to begin with.  So far I've been most impressed with the IAD series and it's one of the very few paranormal romances I still make an effort to keep in touch with.  Overall a 4.5 out of  5","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIQNXSS4I3I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141654707X#wasThisHelpful","R1EIQNXSS4I3I5","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All the Sweet Tomorrows by Bertrice Small is a 2004 Ballantine publication.This book was originally published back in 1984 and is a whopping 600 pages in length if you have the print copy. This is the second book in the Skye O'Malley series.The opening of this book reminded me of how Skye started out in the first book, and I was not too happy with this set of circumstances, although I was aware something like this was going to happen, I didn't expect it to take place so soon.Skye finds herself once again widowed and one again betrothed in an arranged marriage. This time the marriage takes place in order for her to keep her son's inheritance in tact and for her to continue to control her fortunes, but once again, the man she marries is abusive and the man she loves dropped the ball so to speak and it takes some time for him to get his ducks in a row and get the love of his life back.The story starts out on a sad note and for me it set the tone for the first half of the book and well, I was not all that into it. I was not happy with the situation Skye was put in, and not happy with Adam for not stepping up in the first place. But, the second half really picked up and Skye of course lives out a most adventurous and action filled life. She travels far and wide, there is a passionate love story, villains and danger, action and intrigue, making this one yet another epic and sweeping romance.Keep in mind this is an older 'bodice ripper' book which has been released into digital format. So, these days I like to include a disclaimer when reviewing these older books: These stories are not for the faint of heart, so be warned, there are some pretty rough passages here and there. If you like strong women who overcome severe adversity without losing their spirit and the men who love them and will do whatever it takes to win them and protect them, if you like pirates, action, steamy sex scenes, and a satisfying happy ever after, then you will find this one thrilling and absorbing.I think by the story's end the followers of this series will feel content with the knowledge that Skye has found, at long, last the man for her. I think Adam and Skye will live many a long and happy year together.Overall 3.5 rounded to 4","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KQJWLPRZZ82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QZ9XSU#wasThisHelpful","R19KQJWLPRZZ82","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Better Date Than Never Box Set- Books 7-10 is a 2015 Halco publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This box set contains four stories in the super popular Better Date than Never Series by Susan Hatler. For the sake of time and space, I have chosen to review Deja Date- Book nine in the series.This is story centers around Melinda, a young woman who lost her father in a freak accident and whose mother never quite recovered from it. Now Melinda is going through a very rough patch due to losing her job when all of a sudden a golden opportunity falls into her lap.The bakery that was such a big part of Melinda's life is on the market and all she needs to do is claim her share of the inheritance her father left her, which shouldn't be a huge problem. But, when she approaches her mother about the situation, she finds her world turned on it's axis.The first issue Melinda faces is Nate's return home after a lengthy absence. She had been in love with Nate years ago, but after sharing an intimate moment, he left with his mother and never contacted her again. Now, Nate wants a second chance, but it seems the of them are like polar opposites. But, the biggest obstacle she faces in regards to the bakery is the Carpe Diem her father added to his will, a development she hadn't counted on. Without much of a choice, Melinda begins working her way down the list, but the message her father was trying to send is more of impediment that she originally thought, and it looks like she could lose everything she ever wanted.This is a charming story about letting go of one's guilt and grief and learning to step out of your comfort zone and take a few risk, and really living life with gusto. Nate is a real keeper in this book and he does the absolute best thing for Melinda by making a compromise that, well, frankly was more fitted to who Melinda really is deep down. I don't know if she was ever the adventurous type, even before her dad's death, so there were times when I felt she was pushed into being someone she really wasn't. Therefore, I could see her point of view and understood why she was skeptical about Nate. Still, she does learn a lot about herself with a little intervention from a surprising source. I loved how everything came together in the end.Overall this is a short, sweet, and heartwarming, and feel good kind of story.4 stars.All of the books in this delightful series are short and sweet, some with more heart tugging moments, like this one, but others having a lighter tone, with a touch of humor. I have read most of the books in this series and absolutely love them. These stories never fail to give me a little 'pick me up', no matter what kind of day I'm having.I recommend this series for every one, and although some of these stories are connected, all of them can be read as a stand alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33F26FBSWT3RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LEP8RS#wasThisHelpful","R33F26FBSWT3RF","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, what a cool essential oil diffuser/humidifier!  This sturdy holder is very stylish and will look good in any room.  The diffuser is very simple to use and set up, and plugs into the standard outlet.  Once you have added the water and your essential oil, plug the unit in, and you can press  ""mist' for the humidifier to work and if you press 'light'  the unit not only glows but changes to all manner of pastel colors which is relaxing and mood enhancing.  Once thing to note however, is that the essential oils are not included, but are easily purchased here on Amazon.  I used a lemon scented oil to test this product and found it to be very invigorating.Overall I am very impressed with this product.  I would buy  another one  so I could have one in several other places in my home, or buy one as a gift.  5 stars!I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MU50NFXK4WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012WAEUM4#wasThisHelpful","R30MU50NFXK4WY","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Light My Fire by Christie Ridgway is a 2014 publication.Being Rock Royalty comes at a high price for the offspring of the super group The Velvet Lemons. The band members had lots of kids by different women, and bought a ranch/compound for them all to live together.However, once they were of age they all scattered with the wind and seldom have any contact with one another.The youngest child of this extended 'family' is Priscilla- aka 'Cilla'. Cilla has remained close to home, runs her own business and was especially close to a 'groupie' named Gwen, who had lived with them for a long time, and was the closest thing to a mother figure Cilla had. With Gwen's recent passing, Cilla is now responsible for going through her things.This development, along the need for a break, Ren, who is now a tour promoter, returns to California and to the compound. Taken totally off guard by his appearance, Cilla must put up her defenses to ward of the old feelings she still harbored for Ren, her fantasy crush when she was younger.Alone at the compound, Ren and Cilla become reacquainted, each seeing the consequences of their unorthodox upbringing. Cilla, was pretty much ignored and forgotten about by all the other kids, spending her youth alone, with no parental contact, or family bonds.Ren, on the other hand was abandoned by his father due to his rock star lifestyle, exposed to things no young person should ever have witnessed, and then his mother took off, making it very clear she was not interested in being a parent.Now Cilla is dealing with a blow to her confidence, in the bedroom, thanks to the callous words of her former boyfriend. The crackling chemistry Cilla feels when Ren is around creates a sexual tension between them that gives her an idea. Maybe Ren could be her sexual mentor?This is a wonderful contemporary romance/ New Adult romance. Although the author pays homage to Jim Morrison and The Doors and their music, she doesn't glorify the rock star lifestyle, instead showing how the offspring of wild rock stars, who are in a state of arrested development, has had to deal with their unconventional parenting or lack thereof.In the beginning there were a few bumps in the road as I struggled with the introduction of so many characters and with getting the set up straight. But, once the story narrowed in on Ren and Cilla, it was smooth sailing.While this story is very steamy when several really hot scenes, it was the character development that really sucked me in. Cilla despite her solitary existence makes an attempt to be up beat, but her issues manifest themselves in other ways, such as with some rather odd sleeping patterns. Ren is definitely scarred and carries around a lot of bitterness, but deep down he longs for a real family. He is mature enough to see the damage Cilla suffered by being neglected as a child, but freaks out over his intense feelings for her with the usual you deserve better defense.Baby, I'm not good enough for you, okay? he whispered, knowing she didn't hear him. But, think of me...fondly, yeah? And I'll think of you always.Both characters develop well, but Ren is the one who has to step up in the end and he does so with a new perspective on life and love.It takes courage to create your own identity, to stop believing old stories about who your are or that limit who you can be.I enjoyed this short romance, liked the characters, the romance, and the happy ever after! I'm really excited to read the next book in the series.Overall 4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQOWPBQT79N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV3XQEW#wasThisHelpful","R1AQOWPBQT79N2","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hot & Bothered by Lynn Raye Harris is a 2015 publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.HOT &  BOTHERED DEFINITION:having or showing intense or violent feeling; ardent; fervent; vehement; excited:a hot temper.Informal. having a strong enthusiasm; eagerSlang.1. sexually aroused; lustful.2. sexy; attractive.I got in on the ground floor with this series and this author has quickly become one of my favorites.  I have watched this series develop from playing in small clubs to filling large stadiums.  Each installment gets more polished and more emotional, without sacrificing the integrity of the series or what made it so popular to begin with.As with any series, there were some stories or characters I liked more than others,  but this  very aptly titled book will go down as one of my favorites.I would dare say there are  few among us who have not made a bad relationship choice at one point in our lives. Emily, however, might take top honors, as her former husband turned out to be a terrorist.  Now, she is a pariah,  on the no fly list, and her life will never be the same.  What is even harder to take  is  being in love with Ryan   Flash Gordon,  a member of The Hostile Operations Team or HOT.  Even if he was interested in being more than friends,  getting involved with Emily would end his career on the spot, and Emily can't let that happen.So, when Ian Black a CIA operative,  offers her the opportunity to get her life back by going on a covert operation, Emily can't pass up that up.  But, since it's such a dangerous mission, Emily knows it could be life or death, so she wants just one night with Ryan before she leaves, because she may never see him again...Okay, I stifled a snicker when Ryan showed up with HOT and took Emily by surprise. Oh my was he ticked!  The chemistry between these two is certainly seductive,  but there is an emotional bond in place first, and this gives the story a little bit of a softer tone.  However, it is fitting under the circumstances, since Emily, in this case, is the one who is putting herself on the line,  it's her life, and her predicament that demands her guy be a little less Alpha male/ cave man, although Ryan does have a few occasional relapses.There is a lot of action, danger and suspense, with Emily getting to be a hero right along with Ryan. Despite certain shocking revelations and the very large issues this couple faced, which led to some angsty and tense  moments,  I thought this couple was more mature, each putting the other's needs first, which was super romantic and a sign of true love.I loved both the main characters and enjoyed  seeing them grow as individuals and as a couple.  It was so great to see Emily redeemed, and walk away with a new mission and a new life.  She deserved every bit of it.This one has a little bit of something for everyone with hot military heroes, suspense, emotional intensity and great story story telling,  and let's not forget the HEA!5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HW8CXD8S98QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941002072#wasThisHelpful","R2HW8CXD8S98QX","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wake-up Call by Amy Avanzino is a 2015 Henery Press publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This is a really cute story about life and the choices we make and what is really important in the long run. Sarah Winslow gets an opportunity to see how having expensive things, a high powered career, and money is not all it's cracked up to be, especially when compared to her home in the suburbs, her wonderful husband and her three beautiful children. But, before Sarah can appreciate all those things she will go through a traumatic experience, one that will slowly put things into perspective for her, but Sarah is not the only one who get a wake-up call.I think many people have planned their lives out one way, only to have their priorities change along the way. But, Sarah doesn't remember why or how she wound up with this life, with this body, and hates every minute of it. She is desperate to reclaim her old life by touching base with old friends, going on a diet, and flirting with another man who makes her feel special.While this book is very heartwarming, sweet and whimsical in someways, I think it can touch a nerve too. How many of you have caught a glimpse yourself in the mirror and were hit with the sudden realization that you are not as young as you once were, you've maybe put on few pounds, you don't spend hours in front of the mirror, you don't frequent the trendiest nightclubs, and your career, which you once thrived on, no longer takes top priority in your life. Do you miss those things? Do you feel like you are in a rut? Sure, especially if you are a woman and have made the decision to be a stay at home mom. You trade one in for the other and if you weigh the pros and cons you will draw the same conclusion Sarah did in most cases. But, you may find yourself feeling wistful, missing some of that fast paced life, and maybe even panic a little, like Sarah did.But, having said all that, this book in not heavy reading at all. It's laugh out loud funny in places and I enjoyed watching Sarah's character development. I did find it interesting that Sarah's amnesia and her subsequent behavior caused her sweet, patient, long suffering husband to read some subliminal messages Sarah's new me character was sending him. So, while it's Sarah we are the most focused on, her family is also responding to her and growing along with her.Overall, I really liked this story and had a lot of fun with it.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCZ5P06E61BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQEE5M0#wasThisHelpful","R2BCZ5P06E61BL","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To Tame the Wind by Regan Walker is a 2015 publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. A High seas adventure with romance at the ship's helm!It as been a very, very long time since I have read a romance set at sea and I must admit I have missed these highly entertaining tales of romantic adventure.Claire Donet was once an adventurous, lively, mischievous, and spirited girl until a tragic event at her convent school doused the fire in her soul. Now Claire is much more serious, ridden by guilt, and determined to become a nun.However, if her father has any say in the matter, he will see to it she marries the man he has chosen for her. But, before either step can be taken, Simon Powell thwarts them both by kidnapping the innocent Claire and declaring he will hold her captive until he gets back what is his.Simon is a British Privateer whose schooner was taken by Claire's father, a notorious pirate. Having been sent away to convent school after her mother's death, Claire is totally oblivious about her father's life.Soon she finds herself torn between her French heritage, her father, and Simon, The Golden One as the revolutionary war continues to rage. With each passing day she gains more and more respect for Simon and begins to fall in love with him, despite the circumstances.Simon's one objective is to get back his schooner and once that goal is accomplished he will turn Claire back over to her father. But, he will do so reluctantly, for he will miss her terribly. However, his feelings for her are forbidden and Claire has already committed herself to the convent.Are Claire and Simon really two ships that pass in the night? Star crossed lovers? Will Claire really join the convent or will she marry the man her father has picked for her? Or will Simon refuse to let her go?The revolutionary war presented from the British and France perspective was a unique spin, and looking at it from that angle gave me a new outlook and made for some titillating suspense.I loved Simon! He is the perfect romantic hero, protecting Claire by honoring her with his respect, and being the perfect gentleman, most of the time. () He is fierce, but kind and loyal and knows his mind.Claire is a lady, highly principled, sympathetic, but strong, and sensitive. She is a bit more conflicted, but her character develops very nicely as the story progresses, and I was proud to see some of her fire rekindled by Simon.One thing I really appreciate about Regan Walker is her dedicated research and attention to detail. How I wish all historical romance authors took the time to do this! There is no substitute for authenticity when reading historical fiction, because the dress, the conduct, vernacular and dialogue is what sweeps me into the past, literally bringing the pages to life.What fun it is to follow along on the high seas, with swashbuckling adventure, danger, epic romance, intrigue, action and suspense! I loved every minute of this fast paced novel. This story was full of surprises and the secondary characters were well drawn adding another layer of depth. This was a romantic, exciting and fun read!As always Regan Walker has gone all out for her readers by putting together maps, a list of characters for reference, and she has put together a Pinterest board dedicated to this novel, which you simply must see to believe.

"Lady Be Good by Meredith Duran is a 2015 Pocket Books publication.  I was provided a copy of this book as an XOXpert- The official street team of XOXO After Dark.How is it that I have not read anything by this author previously?  Well, now that she is on my radar, I will be adding more of her books to my TBR list.Lilah comes from a family of thieves,  but it is her greatest wish to live a decent, honest life.  That goal  means ever so much  more to her now,  since she wishes to honor her sister's memory.  But, her uncle is still holding onto her, trying to keep her down.  So, after finally breaking free of him, she finds she must perform one last job to keep anyone from finding out who she really is.Enter Viscount Palmer, Christian Stratton, who catches Lilah in a compromising position and uses it to his advantage.  In order to get what she needs, Lilah must spy on the woman Christian wishes to marry, in hopes of winning her over.As many who follow my reviews can attest to, I have been struggling with  historical romance novels as of late, and actually stopped reading them so often as a result.  So, it was very refreshing to have been introduced to this series.This story is a fun read, but it's not  filled with fluffy silliness about poor rakish rogues and Dukes and arranged marriages.  This story has well defined and developed characters with some meaty issues to attend to.The chemistry between Lilah and Christian sparkled from their very first interactions with each other.  The author teases us with their flirtation building the tension between them with sharp witty dialogue and by putting them an unusual situation, with Lilah trapped by Christian's blackmail.Christian is a conflicted man trying to avenge the death of his brother and protect his family.  He's riddled with guilt and often feels unworthy of this  reputation as a war hero.  He can be gruff and unyielding at times, but is was so fun watching Lilah wrap him around her little finger.The secondary characters were also a well defined and I found Catherine to be quite an interesting character.  I hope to see a book dedicated to her because I think there is still a lot to know about her and it would be fun to see someone try to win her over romantically.Naturally, I must complain about a few modern terms and phrases slipping through the cracks, but it only happened  a couple of times.  The first part of the story was a little sluggish at times,  but once the characters and the various threads began to take shape,  the story became quite absorbing, filled with action, intrigue and of course  some steamy romance.Overall, this is a charming and delightful historical romance,  quite refreshing and original.  4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMDU9FIJJ1BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472222342#wasThisHelpful","RGMDU9FIJJ1BC","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Starlight on Willow Lake by Susan Wiggs is 2015 Harlequin MIRA publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Susan Wiggs pulled me into this story with such ease and subtlety that before I knew it, I was deeply involved with Mason, Alice and Faith and their interwoven sagas.Faith is a dead broke caretaker. a widowed mother of two daughters, who desperately needs to find a steady job and a place to settle for the sake of her children, who have grown weary of being shuffled so often since the death of their father.Having been hired by Mason to care for his paralyzed mother seemed like a blessing, but once Faith encounters Alice, she realizes she has her work cut out for her.Mason is trying to come to terms with his father's death and help his mother cope with the hand of cards she has been dealt, but wishes he could do it at distance because he and Alice have a strained relationship. Mason is successful in his work and prefers to simply pay for anything his mother may need.But, when his mother takes a puzzling tumble down the stairs, and his siblings can't stay with her, Mason has to man up and find a way to run his business and care for his mother. This development puts him in contact with Faith and from there Alice, Faith and Mason will get to know one another and themselves a whole lot better.As I have gotten older, I have come to appreciate these types of stories more than ever. Thought provoking, emotional, and inspirational storytelling with depth and meaning always leaves me feeling rewarded and satisfied by the time I turn the last page. This book has all of these qualities and was well worth the time spent reading it.For me, the person at the heart of this story is Alice. I know she was a real you know what at the beginning of the book, but I could see past all that and knew in my heart she was going to be okay, but that it would be a long journey for her. In the end, she was an inspiration to everyone in the story. She opened her eyes and her heart in ways many of us might not be able to. I ended up with a great admiration for her. But, she didn't get there all by herself.Faith, Mason, Cara and Ruby all play a part in Alice's turn around. But, Mason too will learn some truths about himself, will admit his own regrets and mistakes, and will have an incredibly surreal chance to find peace by considering his mother's profound words of wisdom. Faith and her girls also play a huge role, with Alice taking a real liking to Cara and Ruby.While I am big fan of romantic build up, my only complaint was that the romance between Mason and Faith too long to develop. I was pretty sure Faith and Mason were moving toward a relationship, but I was beginning to think I had it all wrong, and because it took so very long for anything to get going between them ,it felt like a wet blanket was thrown on their initial chemistry and curtailed the passion and sentimental romance, but! I did like how Faith made Mason fight for her and how he rose to the occasion. The happy ever moment for Faith and Mason was symbolic and perfect for them, each facing their fears and learning to take a leap of faith.I'm hoping to learn more about Adam and Ivy in the future.A wonderful and compelling story that will warm your heart.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4RSK9LLJY50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYOQIGG#wasThisHelpful","R3J4RSK9LLJY50","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mystery of Drury House by Elizabeth Wilde is a 2015 publication.This story reads like a classic Gothic mystery, like the ones made famous by Dorothy Daniels back in the 1970's, and  I can't help but think the outstanding book cover helps to establish that impression.Jack Saxon, a struggling magician finds he has inherited Drury House and his fortunes change overnight.  Now he is writing a historical novel and adjusting to his new found wealth and harsh weather conditions on Morton Vale island during the fall and winter months.But, Jack and his magical 8 ball will be pressed into solving a missing persons case, a suicide, and a murder!Set against the gloomy, frigid weather, a huge menacing mansion on an isolated island and you have yourself the perfect set up for a creepy atmospheric novel of suspense.The author did an excellent job of emulating the Gothic mystery and romance novels of by gone days, even if that wasn't necessarily her intention.  This story is a clean read with no language or sexual content, just some adult situations and of course some mild violence.  But, it doesn't need any of those things to get the job done.  This story may lull you into thinking it's fairly benign, but there are quite a few surprises and twist before all is said and done.A very light romance and a slight paranormal tinge rounds out the suspense elements making this a most enjoyable mystery novel.4 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNL8X5ZWU9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG683H6#wasThisHelpful","R2BNL8X5ZWU9D","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Candy Corn Murder by Leslie Meier is a 2015 Kensington Publication.  I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Fall is right around the corner and there's a little nip in the air for the residents of Tinker's Cove.  That means it's time to gear up for Halloween  the Giant Pumpkin Fest!Lucy's heart doesn't appear to be in it though, as her husband is obsessed with his pumpkin and is spending a great deal of time with Ev, a man Lucy is not overly fond of.  To top that off, Lucy and Bill are caring for their grandson for a while and Lucy is having a hard time adjusting to the strict rules of the daycare center.Apparently Lucy is not the only one disinterested in this year's pumpkin festivities, as it seems someone is out to sabotage the activities.  But who? And why?This is the 22nd  installment in  the  Lucy Stone series, which took me by surprise. Twenty- two! Well, I admit I have read a few here and there, but not all of them.  These are fun stories  with interesting small town characters who will  surprise you sometimes. I found myself feeling very invested in Lucy's struggles with Bill, her grandson, and the daycare center, but, I didn't have  much of a choice because the murder mystery didn't develop until  midway through the book.Not long ago I answered an author survey about mystery novels. The question was: Should the murder happen at the beginning of the book, or do you want to get to know the characters a little bit first?I think I gave some generic, and an oh so helpful response, of It depends.  I still think that, but I can be a little decisive here and say that after twenty- two books, we know the main characters well enough that the murder probably needs to happen before the half way point in the story.I have really gotten into cozy mysteries over the past couple of years and read them more and more often these days.  So, I do know the main attraction isn't necessarily the murder mystery, which can often seem like a side story.  What keeps people coming back for more is the recurring characters and their on going dramas and comedies in life.  So, I do get the formula and understand this is the secret to  the longevity if these series, but in this case I was seriously beginning to wonder if the pumpkins were going to be the only victims of a crime.Once we got the ball rolling though,  things really picked up with several story lines taking shape and I found myself having to hustle to keep up with it all.Small towns can really be amazing sometimes,  hiding behind a facade of  gentle, cozy, living without the harsh realities of city life intruding upon them,  but, they can also, harbor dark and sinister secrets, so,  you can count on a few of those coming to light before all is said and done, proving big cities are not the only place danger can lurk.This an enjoyable enough read and certainly put me in the mood for fall weather and activities.  Overallthis one gets 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293XYAPYOJQZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDYV9PC#wasThisHelpful","R293XYAPYOJQZN","AVO3NDENWYHEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVO3NDENWYHEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Meg Murray who has just graduated from the FBI's training program has seen dead people from an early age. Her cousin was murdered and Meg knew where to find the body which put her in the path of Adam Harrison who basically runs the Krewe of Hunters. Now her best friend Lara is missing after leaving her a cryptic message and she ends up working for Adam immediately upon graduation. She is teamed with seasoned Krewe hunter special agent Matt Bosworth.There is also a serial killer working the area who cuts the tongues out of the women he kills. Is Lara still alive? Is she dead? And does this serial killer have her? Did he kill her? Or has she disappeared voluntarily? Or by some other hand. Matt and Meg along with Killer--a very ugly dog who belonged to one of the serial killer's victims are on the trail of this mystery.I'll be honest this book had me a bit perplexed. Ms. Graham is a very prolific writer. I believe she has at least six maybe more books coming out this year alone. The writing style seemed different than in some of her other Krewe books and I found myself wondering if she actually wrote most of it--especially since she seems to be publishing at phenomenal rate. The interaction between Meg and Matt was also different than many of her other portrayals of the Krewe characters. I'm not saying this is bad nor am I saying she should stick with the tried and true, but it just was ""different"" in tone, characterization and even plot. Sometimes Graham's plots are a bit intricate, but this one seemed forced and the rationale for following the ""trail"" to find Lara made no sense to me. Even with the explanation. The other thing for me that was different in this book was the details in the history and the area. Usually Graham meticulously interweaves details of the area or the history in her story, but this time I thought it was weak interweaving. The other detail--I guessed who was the villain almost right away. Usually there are more choices to choose from, but this time if you ignored the obvious--then there were only a couple of options left.SPOILER for ANIMAL LOVERS: No dogs were killed in this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0O5G1OTXHPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317994#wasThisHelpful","R1T0O5G1OTXHPL","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My granddaughters practically live here during the winter because of the indoor pool and alas until I got this mask/fin/snorkel set - well they had to share. Now they each have a mask and snorkel to transverse the pool with as they search for who knows what! They are preparing themselves for the ocean.  The mask fits snugly and the snorkel clips on easily to the mask and removes just as easily. The fins are a little large still for them, but I tried them out. Was a bit worried they wouldn't fit me as I am an 8.5, but while snug they were easy to get on and off.Definitely a step above what you get in a big box type store yet cheaper than what you would get at a specialty dive shop.

"Received this yesterday and used it last night and this morning and I'm in love! First off I love to buy higher end soaps, but most purchases are at stores like TJ Maxx--not always well stocked in the luxury soap department. This is a lovely, rich soap. The smell is wonderful. The information blurb on the gift box the soap comes with list shea, cocoa and mango butters combined with dash of Argan oil to give the soap its richness. The soap lathers quickly and smells delightful. I'm not sure what the smell is although the box also states something about romance-roses, geraniums, musk and vanilla. . I glanced at some of the other reviews to see what they thought it smelled like, but no consensus was reached. Personally (and since I suffer from allergies I wouldn't take this to be the last word in how it smells)--I think it smells citrusy with a dash of rose and vanilla.  Whatever it is I love it!  Comes with a cute gift box too that can be used to keep ""something"" in (hair ties? clips?) after the soap is used. Right now I have the box in my lingerie drawer while the scent is still strong. The one thing I personally don't like about the soap is the size. Until it ""wears"" down more it is hard to grasp as your hand doesn't fit totally around it although the soap is fashioned more like a large bean making it easier to grasp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143F32AC25NIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9NR476#wasThisHelpful","R143F32AC25NIW","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay I'll be honest--I didn't get this for my grandchldren--I got this for me! After 20 years of being addicted to nasal spray I moved out west and the issues stopped. Call me dense. I also had lost my last cat before I moved.  I had about a year of lovely nasal spray free breathing when I got two rescue cats. Back to a stuffy nose. Yep this time I put it all together. When I moved I'd gotten rid of my air purifiers as they were pretty large and I was downsizing. I plugged this in three nights ago in my bedroom and I am breathing easier. Using less of the nasal spray. Since I'm not going to get rid of the cats, this is a helpful addition to my allergy fighting arsenal.This is a smaller attractive unit that would fit most decors. Included in the box is the Purio unit, one HEPA filter, one carbon filter, a permanent filter and the owner's manual. One of the things I really love about the air purifier is the cord. It stores inside the bottom of the unit so when you aren't using it (in storage) you don't have the cord drooping and catching on things.The specs state that the Purio covers 125 square feet. My bedroom is slightly larger than this, but as I said in the first paragraph I have seen a noticeable improvement in my nighttime breathing. The cord is six feet long with a recommendation to store the unused cord to keep it out of baby's way. Since I only have visiting grandchildren I am using it with an extension cord with most of the cord behind a bookcase. The unit is designed to be as baby proof as possible which for adults makes this an attractive unit for the home with its sleek lines.the controls are on the top and are easy to use. There are three fan speeds with the lowest one being the most quiet. I didn't find the other two speeds to be distracting while trying to sleep.All in all a great unit for baby and adults!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDNS7P22OOJYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PA4#wasThisHelpful","RDNS7P22OOJYG","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Nostalgia quilted bedspread is attractive and lush looking. Made of 100% cotton it measures 102""x118"" and the design fits the Queen size bed perfectly. The background color was a bit darker than what is shown, but it is still an attractive meshing of background and the stitched colors.

"I love designer type soaps. My first criteria is generally the smell. This bar has a light rose smell which isn't too overpowering. It is an enriched shea butter soap and lathers well. One thing I appreciate about it is the size. Sometimes when you buy the designer or more expensive soap bars they are huge in your hand and if you drop them on a toe...well ouchie. This one is a good size, but still allows your hand to close securely around it.

"Two years ago on June 30, 2013 twenty ""hotshot"" firefighters battled a blaze near Prescott, Arizona that was caused by a lightening bolt. From this bolt of lightening 8,000 acres were consumed in a fast moving inferno. Nineteen of the hotshots never made it back. This is their story.The author, Kyle Dickman, is a former hotshot and brings his knowledge to this engrossing true story of the events that lead up to the deaths of nineteen men who knowingly put their lives on the line fighting wild fires.The story reads a bit like a mystery with the situation laid out and the characters introduced. We meet the hotshots and many of their families. We are with them as the situation escalates. And we are with them in the final moment.This is also the story of Brendan ""Donut"" McDonough who survived because he wasn't there. The story of those killed and the survivor who is filled with guilt is a riveting journey of a firefighter/hotshot's dedication to battling fires, saving lives and land and the brotherhood these firefighters form.Although you know the ending before you start the journey, it is a journey well worth taking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5RDX3A2V7ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392123#wasThisHelpful","RB5RDX3A2V7ME","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to this lightbulb because of the ability to program it for vacation  and random on/offs as well as the music sync and Simon says abilities for the grandchildren.First I went to download the app and it takes iOS 8.1 or above. After having a lot of problems with 8.1 on the iPad I left my phone alone. The directions state that you can download the app on your iPad Generation 3. I have Gen 3 and the search function shows no app for ilumi. So I took the bulb over to my son's and tried to program it from some Samsung tablets. No go. Fire. No go. My son's Samsung 5S phone no go. My daugher-in-law's iPhone finally found the app and it was downloaded. We were able to access most of the functions.Now this is why I'm giving this three stars...the issue with the app downloading and the weight of the bulb. This is a heavy bulb. Most of my lamps are vintage lamps, cheap lamps or lamps from art fairs. This bulb was heavy enough that the cheap lamps wouldn't stay up when I tried installing this. I was a bit afraid to keep it in a vintage lamp. Although most of them are rewired, the socket is usually the original socket. I finally found one lamp I wasn't afraid to keep the bulb in. I can tell you that the light produced is really nice. The colored lights are also really nice. I'm hoping to find a good solid lamp that will fit this bulb.

"I'm of the opinion that one can never have too many ear buds--I'm constantly losing or misplacing mine. Some are better than others, but I look for the following--clear sound, good definition of bass and treble and of course the ear buds fit comfortably in my ears. The sound with these is clear and the bass and treble is good and solid. I tried the ear buds with some classical pieces (Beethoven's fifth, Pachbel's Canon), a trio of rock songs and some country. Sound was clear and the upper and lower notes registered well.The reason I gave these four stars is the earbuds were hard to keep in my ears. The package comes with three sizes of ear covers and I found the smallest size was the most comfortable and stayed in the best. The middle size which were on the earbuds fell out constantly.

"I hate those caulking guns. As someone with no coordination when it comes to using them, this product was a great alternative. I needed to caulk around the countertop. This product was easy to use and the directions were easy to follow. I think one of the keys to using this product (as with all caulks) is the surface preparation. I had previously removed the old caulk and after receiving this recleaned the area with a scrubbing sponge, then applied some rubbing alcohol for good measure and let the area dry for several hours. The area I was caulking was relatively small so after making a mistake or two I had more than enough caulk to restart the process. The caulk looks great!

"This is a combined liner and shadow 'pencil.'  the liner end can also be used to contour. I find the liner easy to put on in the sense that the crayon is angled and can be used to line either a thick or thin line. By turning the angle to thick side you can also use it to contour the crease of your eye. My biggest complaint is the crayon isn't as moist as some are so it takes a bit of an effort to do the lining (i.e., stretching the lid of the eye. The shadow portion compliments the liner. I've had this for several months and have used it several times a month.

Sometimes the brush got too much mascara on parts of it and then clumping occurred which meant I had to take a towel (I cut up old cotton dish towels into make-up size squares) and get the mascara off the brush in order to even out the clumps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26FAJBPW87KRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XAU3L6#wasThisHelpful","R26FAJBPW87KRF","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big fan of mineral blushes and foundations. They don't look good on me, but this blush's color was perfect for the look I wanted. As with many powdered mineral blushes you need a light hand with the brush. I generally turn the product upside down and then right side up and use the residue on the lid. My biggest issue with this product was getting it to apply evenly. No matter what brush I used (expensive, inexpensive, fake hair, real hair etc) I couldn't get it to apply evenly. Had to really work at it and look closely under natural lighting to make sure it was evenly distributed. However, that said, it is a decent product for the price and if you use a Rose blush--it is a great color.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PN737WOQC82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KYQ3QA#wasThisHelpful","R5PN737WOQC82","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this mascara in a subscription box. I'll be blunt--it certainly is not worth $65 as there are cheaper ones out there that do a comparable job. The packaging is nice and the mascara is a step above many lower priced ones, but still $65? Sorry, but I can't seem to get beyond the price. Okay I've dealt with, for me, a huge negative, now the positives. I did think it applied easily. The brush bristles are a bit different than most mascaras...a spiral around the wand. I had no problems with clumping, dripping etc. My lashes do look longer than usual with this product. A big plus to me is that the mascara does not come off on my lower eye or skin. As I said earlier, and this is just my opinion, and why I gave it four stars, the price is astounding to me for mascara, but for those of you who don't mind paying the price it is an excellent mascara.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RP2U2OPS8LIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERGG9UI#wasThisHelpful","R1RP2U2OPS8LIF","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As the grandparent of a child who has a rare kind of Down Syndrome--Mosaicism--I want to help him develop his communication skills as much as he can. A Mosaic is a child with Down Syndrome where the cells are not all affected with the T-21 chromosome abnormality. I found this book several years ago and purchased it and ended up giving it to one of his preschool teachers. I repurchased the book to review activities for DS kids that are exiting the toddler stage and entering Kindergarten.This is an excellent resource for those trying to teach a Down Syndrome language, speech and communication. The book is written so that a parent/grandparent/teacher can understand it, but contains facts and research to back up many of the suggestions (the academic component).Most of the reviews of the book so far are very brief. Here is a listing of the chapters to help you decide if you want to purchase the book and if it will be helpful to your child:PLEASE NOTE; AFTER the lengthy chapter listings and CD-Rom summary--you can read my thoughts on some of the content. Just scroll past the chapters if you want get to those thoughts right away.Chapter 1:  Language, Speech, and CommunicationChapter 2:  Speech and Language Characteristics of Children with Down SyndromeChapter 3:  Busy Baby--Busy ParentsChapter 4:  Before the First Word--Precursors to LanguageChapter 5:  The One-Word StageChapter 6:  The Two-and Three-Word StagesChapter 7:  Meaning and GrammarChapter 8:  Speech and Intelligibility ProblemsChapter 9:  Articulation and Phonology: Learning the Sounds of LanguageChapter 10: Pragmatics: Communication in ActionChapter 11: Communicating without SpeechChapter 12: Understanding Speech and Language EvaluationChapter 13: Understanding Speech and Language TreatmentChapter 14: Reading, Literacy, and LanguageChapter 15: School and Community IssuesChapter 16: Concluding ThoughtAppendices:  Communication Evaluation Guidelines for SLPs: For children with Down Syndrome  Speech and Language Referral Guidelines for Pediatricians  Early Intervention Speech and Language Treatment Program Planning Form  Developing a Transitional Communication System  Comprehensive Speech and Language Treatment Guidelines for Children with Down Syndrome from birth to six years  Speech and Language Treatment Program Planning Form: First Word to Age 6  Speech Intelligibility Evaluation Summary Form for children with Down Syndrome  Speech Intelligibility Treatment Program Plan for Children with Down Syndrome  Record form for ArticulationResource GuideReferences and Suggested ReadingChildren's Books for Language StimulationIndexWith the 2012 edition there is a CD-ROM which contains:Forms for Recording Early Communication Milestones (11 forms)Forms for Developing Plans (3 forms)Forms for Evaluation (8 forms)Forms for Treatment Planning (9 forms)My thoughts:The author in the acknowledgements states ""For many years, I have worked with infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults with Down syndrome and their families...There is still a great deal to be done to ensure that people with Down syndrome, at all ages, are able to communicate and live a fulfilling life, and I intend to continue to work for that goal."" This book is a result of Libby Kumin's efforts to reach that goal and if you have a Down Syndrome child it will help you help them with communication, language and speech.I will admit upfront that I have not read the entire book. I have used chapters and pieces of it to help my grandson's language skills. Communication for anyone is a critical skill and the techniques that Kumin describes and uses will help a DS child increase their chance for success in communicating their needs and become a person who can interact with others.The first chapter details what communication is and gives you some ideas for finding a qualified speech pathologist. The second chapter, while talking about each child developing at their own pace, contains a really nice chart of the Development of Early Communication Skills in children with Down Syndrome. This is what I like about the book--the simplicity for us non-academics. For instance the chart is very easy to understand and the author includes the corresponding research that supports the fact. So if you don't believe it--you can find the research!  Children with DS often having hearing issues and the author addresses this as well as physical characteristics of the muscles/structure of the facial area followed by a chart that shows how each characteristic can affect speech and language. Each chapter is packed with understandable information on speech and how to teach a DS child to formulate words, to ""think"" about communicating and to the like.The author gives many suggestions in working with a DS child and how to slip learning into every day activities. For instance in Chapter 8/Speech and Intelligibility problems Kumin discusses the factors for affecting intelligibility and gives lists of home activities (in many of the chapters) to help your child speak clearly. There are many activities to choose from and you can pick and choose those that work best for your child. DS kids range from severely impaired to ""almost normal"" with some of the Mosaics. Some of the children will obviously learn more quickly than others so I feel the author is doing a great service to those of us who are teaching DS kids language skills by providing us with lots of ideas, activities and information that can be tailored to our individual children.The forms in the back of the book and on the CD are great for tracking your child's progress. If your child is in school then you know how complicated and lengthy the IEP's can be--this is much more simple. You can pick and choose the forms you want to use to follow your child's progress. The back of the book provides resources for help which are mainly the larger DS and other organizations that deal with disabilities. The suggested readings are mainly references (lots of academic speak). The very last appendix is a list of children's books to help with language development. They are grouped by subject, i.e.,  Single word objects, Two word books, Finger Play, Manipulatives, Predictable Phrases, TV characters, colors, semantics/vocabulary and more. These are books that are easy to find at a library or bookstore and if you have kids you may already own many of them.Having a child with a disability can be exhausting, but some of this exhaustion comes from trying to communicate. Are you hurt? Are you hungry? What do you want? Simple things a ""normal"" child can tell you easily, but a child with speech issues cannot. This book provides the means and techniques to help maximize your child's communication skills. Even, if like me, you don't use the entire book--it is worth every penny if you can find even one nugget of information that will help you help your child. And to be honest I can't imagine how you could not find more than one nugget.I do want to emphasize that many of the home techniques are easy to incorporate into your daily activities. Many are activities that we do automatically for a child without DS, but don't think about doing the many simplistic repetitions of for a DS child. A lot of what you can do to help your child with speech is just constantly and consistently (i.e. use the same words) talk to them about ""things."" There is so much in this book that unless you are a professional speech therapist you can get overwhelmed. Don't be. Just take what you can and incorporate it into your daily life with your child. You will see an improvement. I have...and I'm only with him three or four days a week. I have enlisted the entire family for many of the activities and when we all work together we see a lot of improvement!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRH0OLBBBD89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606130668#wasThisHelpful","R2HRH0OLBBBD89","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One of the inserts states that the pillow may have a slight odor due to the new foam--mine did--but after letting it air for 24 hours like the instructions mentioned--it dissipated.The promotional materials also state that the pillow is hypo-allergenic.Recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129XS71AK8WQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9CNSI0#wasThisHelpful","R129XS71AK8WQU","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hallie Hartley has been taking care of her half-sister Shelly for what seems like forever, but especially since the death of their parents. Shelly is a very self-involved, selfish ""user"" type of person and Hallie has gotten used to helping her, covering for her and basically putting up with Shelly's meanness and self-centered actions until Shelly tries to steal a vacation home in Nantucket from her by pretending to be Hallie.Hallie stands up for herself and goes off to Nantucket. She shares the home with Jamie who is badly in need of physical therapy from wounds suffered in the war. Jamie is also suffering from PTSD and hovering relatives who tiptoe around him because they are afraid of bringing back memories or upsetting him. Part of the bargain is that Hallie will give him physical therapy.The story is slow and there are a lot of moments that make no sense. I started with this book, but I believe it is either #2 or #3 in the series. Perhaps this would have made more sense if I had read the first book(s). There are ghosts in the book and a lot of characters that I think the author assumes you know. Not sure. Deveraux does a good job with the PTSD and the physical therapy descriptions, but I was somewhat confused by the ghosts, the willing of the house to Hallie and all the characters attending the wedding. I also thought that the ""resolution"" of Shelly and her issues (I won't go into it as it would be a major spoiler) was rather strange. This needed much more back story and explanation than what was given.To be honest I have gone back and forth over giving this three or four stars and if there was a 3.5 option I'd go for that. The story kept my interest even though I found myself thinking things like ""seriously?"" or ""come on this is so unrealistic!""  If you are a die-hard Jude Deveraux fan you'll probably like this. I do like many of the books that she has written and this wasn't the worst, but wasn't her best either!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RV9UE5NVRXX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345541855#wasThisHelpful","R1RV9UE5NVRXX4","A3R9X003XW0LNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9X003XW0LNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Size large is perfect for my very tall 8 month old.  It keeps him warm at night when our home dips down to 60 degrees.  My son wears a cotton footed pajama by Old Navy underneath.  When even colder he also wears a Carter's onesie beneath the footed pjs.  We also have a sleeping hat from Gymboree in case its needed though my son tends to take it off while trying to fall asleep.  I love that this has cotton and not fleece on the outside as polyester makes me itch like crazy.

The original Noah's Ark already comes with 2 lions and the male and female clearly distinguished (unlike the two in this set).  Plus the original lions are better in nearly every way...

"OK little coloring book with dinos not usually put in kids books. Scan and enlarge the images so you can print them at a good size for your little one - however the artwork is not that great compared to other Dover mini coloring books, so I wonder if its worth all that effort to scan.  Teaches your child coloring in the lines, names of the dinos, some facts about the dinos, and reading.  The paper is of a good weight - you cannot see the image on the back side.  Dinos are presented in alphabetically with a large letter to color.  My only complaints are:  a few of the dinos look strange and not quite what I expected - I suspect the dimensions of the dinos are not correct.  Also, a few of the facts are wrong/outdated... for example the T-Rex is not the largest carnivore to have ever lived.  On land, the largest discovered was the Spinosaurus and at sea, there was a lot more that were bigger.  Lastly, the dinosaurs are not the main focus of each two-page spread... the alphabet letter is which was not the focus I expected.  A larger coloring book focusing on the dinos would have better met my needs.Here is the the list of the animals:- Apatosaurus (states is the same as Brontosaurus)- Brachiosaurus- Compsognathus- Deinonychus- Elasmosaurus- Fabrosaurus- Geosaurus- Hadrosaurus- Iguanodon- Janenschia- Kentrosaurus- Lambeosaurus- Megalosaurus- Nanotyrannus- Oviraptor- Parasaurolophus- Quetzalcoatlus- Rhamphorhynchus- Stegosaurus- Tyrannosaurus- Ultrasaurus- Velociraptor- Wannanosaurus- Xenotarsosaurus- Yandusaurus- Zephyrosaurus","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CIXU5N5P5YLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486403017#wasThisHelpful","R2CIXU5N5P5YLM","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:  WOW this dino stands on two feet, is big (approximately 11"" long x 5"" tall x 3"" wide), and more impressive than I thought it would be.  Great coloring and VERY engaging - you actually feel like it could come alive and bite you!Cons:  In order for the model to stand on only two feet, I think they shortened its tail from its real length.  Also it has a movable jaw to chomp everything - which sounds nice until you realize such things can break.  I would be gentle on the jaw to ensure it lasts.  The biggest issue for me, was that its size is significantly greater than the other dinos by this same maker that I already owned.  I really think the company needs to work on accurate sizing between dino species.  As a side issue, most of the sauropods related to the T-Rex have been revealed in the fossil record to have feathers - it seems pretty likely that the T-Rex did as well and I want to see models with feathers ;-)Comparative Size: Below is the link to the stegosaurus I bought = in reality the stegosarus and T-Rex were nearly the same height through the T-Rex was about a third longer and much bulkier.

"I was looking for books on how animals behaved in each season for younger children ages 3-5.  For spring, I went with animal life cycles since many reproduce in spring like birds nesting etc.  For fall, I had a book on preparing for winter as well as a book on migrations.  So, I got this one to cover animals in winter.  I was a bit disappointed that the book rehashes fall animal behaviors like migration, storing food, etc since I already had books on those topic.  I understand that since many fall behaviors are preparation for winter, and so they are connected to winter behaviors.  But mentioning all those things again made the book feel redundant and made the winter section feel slimmer than the title seemed to indicate.  I will probably use the slimmer fall book with a younger crowd and use this longer book with an older crowd.

"Seems well made and I like the bright colors.  The blocks actually look like trees, people, and a home, etc.  The non-circular face has a smile in the opposite direction on the back so it can placed flat side up or down and still have a face in the right direction.The puzzles to solve are shown visually in a spiral book.  The ""day"" side (called starter) shows you where every block piece goes in real color.  These puzzles appear good for ages 2/3 because all you have to do is place the blocks on the pegs in the right order and the correct direction so its identical to the image.  The ""night"" side (called master) only shows the shadow of the final structure which is a far greater challenge because you have to pay attention to each blocks shape and the shadow it makes.  These puzzles appear good for ages 4/5 though I can see some 3 year olds or gifted 2 year olds picking up the idea but they might need a little assistance in learning the skills/concepts.MY SUGGESTIONS:  Only take this toy out to use when doing each puzzle so it keeps its interest.  Also, have some kind of reward like a sticker card for each puzzle completed with a grand prize when all the starter level is complete and another grand prize when the master level is complete.  Before doing the master level, I also strongly suggest kids do a science unit on shadows, make shadow puppets, and even play with this game's blocks in a darkened room with a flashlight so they get used to what each pieces' shadow look like.  I also think that for master levels, you should check each puzzle's completion by making its shadow with a flashlight in a darkened room.  You can look at the back of each shadow page which shows you the solution in full color, but that is not as fun and smart kids will learn to cheat by just turning the page over.  Also, once a level is complete, I would have your child tell you what they see in the scene that made in order to tap into their art/imagination.  You will be surprised how different students interpret the same image.CONS:  The spiral book is a bit flimsy with thin pages and will not last with regular use.  I prefer thick cards so you can set one out at a time as in the bunny box game from the same company.  I wish the pegs had been the same heights as that would have enabled a greater number of blocks to be on each peg and thus increase the number of puzzle possibilities.  I also wish the set came with a few extra block pieces.  These extra pieces would again have increased the number of puzzles to solve PLUS would make the game more complex as it went along.  Basically, once you figure out each pieces' shape/color for the basic level and each pieces shadows for the master level... even the highest numbered cards are not that challenging.  BUT if you add in a few new shapes now and then it would really mix things up and make this set far more valuable.  Overall, the price is a tad much for only 24 puzzles (the same image shown as day and again as night).  If it had been 75 total unique puzzles (instead of the day and night puzzles being identical) it would be worth the $20-25 price tag in my opinion.TO LENGTHEN USE:  Pick up some additional blocks that fit the pegs or you can even drill holes into blocks you already own.  You can leave the blocks natural or paint them with child safe colors.  Then either you or the kids themselves can design new puzzles intermixing with the old and new puzzle blocks.  All you really need is a camera, a color printer, some blank flashcards, and acid free glue/double sided tape.  Also, for kids learning to read, you could even have them follow written instructions in order to build the correct image.  However, making master shadow cards would be more of a challenge as its difficult to photograph shadows, but it is possible if you scan the block images into the computer, reduce their image size by the same amount, then all you have to do is turn the blocks a dark grey on a white background, and rearrange them any way you want - then print.  It definitely would be harder than the day images that can just be photographs.Overall, the product needs improvement.  There needs to be a greater umber of puzzles, a greater range of complexity, the day and night puzzles should NOT be identical, the puzzle images should be on sturdy cards, and there should be a greater number of blocks to lengthen the usefulness of this educational toy.  I will use this product, but I am going to have to do some supplementation which was not something I expected.  The Logic Street game was far better in execution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392K1V67PTPHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TGVP3C#wasThisHelpful","R392K1V67PTPHU","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is about the PRODUCT not the price.  Please note the VAST majority of negative reviews are about amazon's pricing which has nothing to do with the product itself.  I buy the boxes for under $4.00 at various locations.About the product...I buy these teethers because they are gluten free, organic, and NOT made in China.  I have gluten intolerance as well as a number of other allergies - there is a chance my genes were passed to my son.  Eating gluten as a child ruined my life and I want to protect my son from that suffering.  These teethers are a great alternative to oat / wheat teething products for crawling babies.  I have found nothing else in the stores that meets that need for us.At first, my son was confused as to what these things were.  He thought they were a toy and was confused when they broke off or started to dissolve in his mouth....  But once he got familiar with the idea (and his first baby teeth) - he was chomping away and working on his dexterity.  Now he gets really excited when i pull out a teether cracker.  He loves them and the ability to feed himself.These crackers do dissolve, but it takes a little time to do so unless your child is drooly.  Because of this, i suggest you first dip the chewing end in a little formula (quickly so they don't dissolve compeltely) then give it to your baby.  That way the baby can get used to eating them safely.  Slowly wean off the pre-dipping and then your baby will gradually learn to chew the hard cracker by himself.Warning - Never leave a baby eating these crackers unattended!  My baby had enough strength to crack the teether in half and a sharp shard came off.  He then put the long sharp piece in his mouth.  I rushed over to grab it, but he swallowed it before I could get to him.  Thankfully, he did not choke - so the teether was already starting to melt.  Just in case, i gave him a few sips of his bottle to make sure it was fully dissolved.  Afterward my son was perfectly fine and reaching for more.  The whole incident did scare me as a mom - So I strongly suggest you stay right next to your baby while they are eating these.  Its for this reason that I took one star off the product.  I think the crackers could dissolve a little faster.Also, the teethers leave a sticky mess so be ready to wipe your baby's hands and anything else down after eating these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VB60WILD2SXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWXCNTC#wasThisHelpful","R3VB60WILD2SXV","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was just ok for me.  I got it because I wanted a mini-encyclopedia-like book that was a simpler intro to planets for 3-5 year olds than the other options on the market.  I have a number of other books in the same series all on biological science and liked them enough to buy this one on astronomy as well.  However, it does not exactly meet the standard set by the other books in the series and I probably will return it.Pros:  Real images of the objects.  Content separated into smaller sections with a table of contents.  Pop ups that at often show closeups of objects.  Bolded vocab.  Info is up to date with Pluto being a dwarf planet.  Talks about more than just the planets and our sun like stars, galaxies, and rockets.Cons:  Images spread over the crack which distorts them / hard to really see (same issue in all the books of the series).  If the text is bolded than the vocab is unbolded (again same issue throughout the book series).  Some of the images are actually rendered and do not necessarily match reality (like Titan's surface.)  I also felt the pop ups sometimes brought up information that cannot be clearly understood without more details because a word was not defined or that topic had not yet been explained anywhere else in the book. The book shows the major moons for Jupiter, Earth, Uranus, as well as the dwarf planets, but skips the major moons from Saturn.  There are a lot of good images of certain things that the book just skipped over like a REAL closeup photo of the rings.  In the end, I just felt that this book should have done a better job of presenting, explaining, and even organizing information.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXU040V5D5F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609926846#wasThisHelpful","RFXU040V5D5F9","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted some creative ideas with dinos.  I was blown away by this book.  Seriously, I was expecting lame and can't ever really look good kids crafts.  These are far beyond that... in fact these projects can be done from the very young to the oldest of us all.  Yes they were that good.Projects:1. Long necked dino - appropriate for youngest kids adn could even do the same steps for giraffes.2. Dino mouths - could be appropriate at any age because could use as the front of the card and open up the mouth to read what the dino is saying.3. Water dinos - techniques applicable from elementary school onward to adulthood.  Could use also with flying fish, whales, dolphins, etc.  BEAUTIFUL.4.  Standing dinos - seen better on this craft for older children and adults, but this version is designed with the littlest kids involved.5.  Hatching dinos - seems to be a version of decopauge... elementary school through young adults... or for the odd scientist who wants hatching dinos as an Easter decor = )6.  Volcano painting - techniques applicable from elementary school onward to adulthood.  Could use with other painting techniques to have a starry sky, sunset, etc.  Really liked this one.7.  Another take on standing dinos - for ages 5-7 I think.  Still seen better for older kids and adults.8.  Glowing eye pterosaur - only project in the book I thought was lame and would never do.9.  Doodling dinos - great for all ages.  I was surprised how such simplicity was so cute.10.  Layered paper and cut outs picture - could really do this with any dino or animal or anything else you want.  Ages 6+ is my guess.11.  Swamp painting - techniques applicable from elementary school onward to adulthood.  Could do all sort of misty swampy ecosystems like the Egyptian Nile, Louisianian, Floridian, etc.  I can even see Egrets in farmland in the misty morning or misty bamboo forests with pandas.12.  Mobile pterosaur - takes a bit of logic to do it so 6+ if the teach makes the lines ahead of time.13.  Dino collage - WOW this technique could be done with anything - just so impressed.  never thought of collages as a true art form until I saw this.  All ages if you vary the complexity.14.  Drawing dinos with spots - all ages and can vary the method to be more cartoony or more realistic.15.  Dino shaped greeting cards - can be done by all ages because i know a lot of grandmas who would love to send dino cards to their grandsons.16.  Bubble wrap printed skins - can be used for more than dinos and i am sure other things besides bubble wrap can be used.  So many possibilities in this idea.17.  Moonlight animal - WOW I never thought of that but its so simple - chalk gives a hazy edge around the moon that just makes the whole picture work.  I can so see doing this project with nocturnal animals, things for Halloween, etc.I was so pleased with this that I am going to buy their 1000 collection in the same series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDGW7AO271IP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1409538958#wasThisHelpful","RWDGW7AO271IP","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am impressed.  Some ideas were repetitive and others were no-brainers.. but some were just breathtaking and really opened up my imagination to all the possibilities.  As a scientist, I enjoy art and crafts, but its not my forte at designing...  This will help me design and implement engaging art-based projects with a variety of skill sets/methods.  For 20 dollars, I feel like I can approach homeschooling art in a far more meaningful way.  So glad I bought it.  These projects could be done from preschool through high school, just varying the size of the projects, expanse of materials, and skill difficulty depending on the age of the students.  For example : the teacher could pre-cut some shapes for making the collages so kids only have to glue them together OR the teacher draws an outline on the page to give kids a guideline to work from.Here is SOME of what you get in the book.... i stopped trying to list things at page 222 and even then i was just summarizing what was on each page.  There is really so much here.- Drawing / Doodling:  Cats, Castles, Dogs, People, Decorated elephants, traffic, city skyline, fingerprint crowd, hearts, flowers, birds, buuterflies, patterns, under the sea, hands, day vs. night, trapeze artists, chalk under sea image, superheros, curly animals, athletes, faces, and much more.- Paper cut outs / collage:  Monkeys, Cupboard collage, Winter city/street, Clowns, Sea boats, Bird tree, Valentine cards, Trees, Plants, Under the sea animals, Gift tags, Shoes, Robots, Faces, Outer space, Fall tree, Tissue paper aquarium, monsters, crazy animals, penguins, scribbling bugs, stadium and town from above, cats, birds, bugs, faces, embossed cards, rubbing space collage, princesses, button flowers, reindeer garland, paper weaving, figures, robots, dogs, kimonos, owls, cakes, Christmas ornaments, kites, and much much more- 3D art out of cardboard cut outs / folding paper / foil / etc.:  Dinosaurs, Palm trees, People, Box monsters, Pop up cards, spiders, birds, cats, bugs, Christmas cones, paperdollish chains, Butterflies, elephants, Utensil people n creatures, cats, dogs, paper beads, beach animals, layered town, decoupage boxes, pipe cleaner bugs, box cities and much much more.- Paint/Painting focus and may be combined with another art type:  Textured paper butterflies, Blow-paint monsters, Safari picture, Textured paper ice cream, Dragon, Stamping with veggies, Windy day picture, Colored paper towel chameleons, flamingos with soap, spooky castle, parrots, thumbprint birds and bugs, wax repelling paint reptiles n birds, fruit/flower patterns, dot mosaics, drip poppies, spooky shadow forest, rats, handprint sea animals, lab experiment art, fingerprint snowmen n penguins, sponge creatures, trees, rabbit tunnel painting, deep sea fish, Fingerprint animals, Stenciled shark, printed Cars and trains, and much much more.- Stitching: Felt animals, Beads and sequins hearts and flowers, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCJ4YHBX48E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1409536378#wasThisHelpful","R1MCJ4YHBX48E0","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was underwhelmed.  The images were beautiful but the book seemed out of order and disjointed.  Pages 14 and 15 seemed like they should have been at the start of the book since it introduces the topic and defines vocabulary.

"Great little coloring book with animals not usually put in kids coloring books. Scan and enlarge the images so you can print them at a good size for your little one. Teaches your child coloring in the lines, names of the animals, and reading. The paper is of a good weight - you cannot see the image on the back side.  Animals presented in alphabetically order.  My only complaints are:  a few of the animals (a very small portion of the book) don't look quite right to me... but the rest is wonderful and well worth the purchase of the book.  Also, most of the names are very specific as to the species but then the camel is just a camel... I wish they kept the specificity throughout the book.  Lastly, the tortoise is labeled a turtle - there is a difference.Here is the the list of the animals:- Aardvark- Addax- Adelie Penguin- Alligator- Armadillo- Baboon- Bat- Beaver- Bighorn Sheep- Bison- Bobcat- Bottlenose Dolphin- Camel- Cape Buffalo- Caribou- Cheetah- Chimpanzee- Crested Porcupine- Eagle- Elephant- Fawn- Flamingo- Gazelle- Giraffe- Goat- Gorilla- Grizzly Bear- Hawk Owl- Hippopotamus- Kangaroo- Leopard- Lion- Llama- Moose- Mountain Goat- Mountain Lion- Musk-ox- Opossum- Orangutan- Panda- Pelican- Puffin- Rabbit- Red Fox- Rhinoceros- Saki Monkey- Sea Lion- Snowy Egret- Swan- Tarsier- Three-toed Sloth- Tiger- Turtle (really a tortoise)- Vervet Monkey- Walrus- Weasel- White-tailed Deer- Wolf- Yellow Rat Snake- Zebra","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHVUK0PV82LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486264033#wasThisHelpful","RHHVUK0PV82LH","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the cards to use in a unit on light and shadows... because I felt putting images on the wall would be very engaging and a good introduction to the topic of study.  But the set ended up being useful in SO many others ways.First, the cards can be used with a light to create bright images on the wall if the room is darkened.  I tried it out and it works really well.  I don't trust that the provided light will last that long, but any flashlight should do.  This can be a fun way to practice names of objects, letter sounds, and even do a puppet-like show.  I can even see doing it in a tent while camping, in a classroom with the lights dimmed, with homeschool kids down in the dark basement during the heat of summer, at bedtime, etc.Second, the punch outs can be used as name what object makes the shadow, as a sorting game of the different types of animals (birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals), and there are a lot of other odd shapes that would be great pieces for making a mosaic/modern art project.Third, the cards can be used stencils for tracing scenes on paper then coloring or decorating the scenes.  Since there are so many objects shown, you could make quite a number of themed scenes (examples: the umbrella, boy, girl stencils plus cotton balls as the clouds to make a rainy day... or an underwater scenes stenciling all sorts of sea creatures then using tissue paper to make the seaweeds.)  Honestly the possibilities are pretty extensive.VERY VERY pleased with the item except for three things.... first, the backing on the cards tries to come off espcailly when you are trying to take out the punched pieces.  Second, I think the card should have been a slightly stronger cardboard for longevity especially with the stenciling.  Third, I wish the images of objects and letters were done in as few sections as possible - too often the divisions were not necessary (for ample the jellyfish was divided into 3 pieces when the octopus was only one piece).  A single whole cutout object works better for both the light show and punch out usages.Overall, for only $5 bucks or so that is ALOT of possibilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QYCJRVRJ3FBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601597975#wasThisHelpful","R2QYCJRVRJ3FBA","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three reasons I do not like this product.1. It was not clearly labeled as a water squirter. I thought I was purchasing fully sealed plastic animals for teething. I never ever buy bath squirters.2. Since squirters have a tiny hole in it - it will grow mold inside if used in the bath AND bacteria/viruses/food will be sucked inside if the child teethes on it thus can transmit disease. Bleaching them will not effectively clean the inside of the squirters so you would have to replace them regularly which is waste of money and resources.3. The paint comes off and a child will ingest it. All i did was wash them gently with soap and lukewarm water... then the paint started transferring and staining each the other animals.

"This was given to me at my baby shower and I could not imagine being able to scrapbook my son's infancy without it.  I used it together with Carter's First year Calendar Wonder and some scrapbook stickers by various companies.  The pages have turned out ADORABLE.  My only issue is the photo frames provided were not enough - especially given most people are not going to want to use pink boarders with their boys.  Plus most of the provided frames were on the smaller size, when I needed more larger ones.  I started putting some photos in without boarders and accenting them with stickers instead of the frame.  Also, some pages did not really apply to us, but that is ok because I just strategically decorated it and placed a photo on top so you would never know the page was designed for something else.  Lastly, for the longer journaling sections.  I started writing above each ""By 8 months..."" etc. that way I can keep track of which time period the journaling is talking about.  This method enabled me to literally journal for every 2 months during my son's first year.Overall, it was the perfect baby shower gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13M3JEJ8MPRIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934386472#wasThisHelpful","R13M3JEJ8MPRIU","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the Watch Me Draw Dinosaurs book but it did not have enough variety and did not explain each step very well... ultimately with the premade worksheets that other book was good for 4-6 year olds, but I wanted something better for ages 7+.  That is why I bought 123 Draw Dinosaurs.  This book had a large variety of organisms and clear steps even specifying when to erase (which was missing the previous book).  I was very pleased that a list was provided at the end of the book specifying which time period each animal came from.  This was a HUGE plus because I had just spend hours the day before looking for such a chart online to no avail and wallah! it was in my recently purchased art book!  Most kids think all the pre-historic dinos lived together, but the didn't.  It was not until I was an adult that I learned T-Rex did not eat stegosaurus.  If I could help this book in any way, it would be to include feathers on the dinos shown to have them by recent fossil evidence, accurate colors when the fossil evidence provides that information, and accurate measurements/stature.  There were a few dino dimensions/stature that I questioned particularly the spinosaurus and ankylosaurus, but the book was created in.  I also think an image comparing the size to an adult human would have helped kids understand how big these creatures really were.  Overall, I will look into buying more books in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EF9IALKYQNU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0939217414#wasThisHelpful","R2EF9IALKYQNU2","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its the only history workbook for little kids that tries to not merely listing facts to memorize, but explains what history and time lines are and solidifying it with things a child can connect to or find interesting.  However, it falls short of its vision.  I would have designed/presented info a tad differently and the book started feeling too random instead of scaffold-ed learning.  I also feel the book tries to do too much social science when it should just stick to history and timelines.  Because of that, I give the book only 3 stars.  Overall, I think the book should not be used with kids under the age of 5 just because of how much reading is involved and not everything is shown in illustrations.  Some of the projects you could do with younger kids if you simplified the knowledge.  Also the book seems aimed at Christians if that is an issue for you.Here are some of the changes I will do in using the book:pages 6-7.  Instead of placing pennies along the number line, tie something durable onto the yarn at equally-set intervals that way you can measure once and reuse the time line for this book and for years to come.  Things you can tie on could be colored ribbon or yarn, beads, rocks with a hold in them, etc.  These markers can represent first second third, decades, centuries, days, years... anything you want.  Its really important that when history is taught, you can place in immediately in context and this time line will do just that IF you remember to use it.pages 10-11.  Instead of having a very little kid try to draw modern objects, why not cut them out of newspapers, magazines, or print off the internet then tape it into the book with double-sided tape?  A little kid is not going to be able to draw a modern warship, car, shoes, or jet that easily and they need to be able to recognize the object and compare differences to the past... so real images would be best.page 13.  Instead of drawing a photo of yourself, why not put a real baby photo to see how far they have grown/matured.pages 14-15.  Take the yarn timeline made at the start of the book and place all these photos and events in order on the timeline.  Place them at the approximate dates so kids can see that things do not happen at equal distances from each other.page 17.  Skip the floppy tree and just make a 2D one on a poster board.  The family tree can be made well enough to be hung as a family treasure (in the dining room for example.)page 22-23.  They do the history of Thanksgiving, but I felt the information was lacking.  I read a lot of words, but did not feel I really learned much.  So I would supplement this topic with a lot of other information.... there is more information on pages 24 & 25 on the pilgrims which would help, but not really much more about how Thanksgiving meals have changed over time which is the focus of the kid's project.  I think instead of just drawing your own thanksgiving meal, it would be best to choose a few different versions through time and/or a few different ones from different areas.  I mean in my household we eat tempura for Thanksgiving and no we are not Asian... its just what we consider to be a very special celebratory meal.pages 26-27.  I would have preferred for the child to look up each style of boat, print the image, and place on the yarn timeline.  Maybe even researching the types of people and cultures that used each boat and for what purposes.  That would have taught more history and reinforced timelines more than simply folding an origami boat.Page 28-29.  Find images for one toy in each time period, print, and put them on the yarn timeline.. can even find the exact dates released to place them as accurately as possible.  Seeing the real images in the real placement along the number line is better than what is in the book.  Randomly choosing 4 toys, drawing them in 4 boxes, when the time spacing between toys does not equal reality.Page 30-31.  This is Christmas history very light.  Would have preferred something you could actually timeline here... or at least taught different cultural practices that were adopted into our Christmas celebration.  I wish the info was at least was honest about the true history of Christmas.  It was a pagan holiday and the church put the celebration of Jesus on that same day in order to change the holiday to be Christian.  A lot of the rituals had pagan roots, but have been adopted to mean Christian ideas.  There is no project really for this page which again is odd.Pages 32-33.  Really liked the honesty of the history here regarding the 3 kings visiting Jesus... but the project was too history light - just make a Christmas ornament.  No timelines here or cultural comparisons.Pages 34-35.  If you are going to draw the floor plan of your home, I strongly suggest you keep to only one floor and measure it all out as a math project.  Again I would have preferred placing different types of home styles on the yarn timeline.  I also bought a book called Houses from Long Ago by Usborne to supplement this teaching.Pages 36-39.  Not as much teaching history as it is random facts about towns.  I suggest you actually research the history of your own town and place those facts on the yarn timeline.Pages 40-41.  Why not put all the states on a number line?Pages 42-43.  I would argue the Southwest is separate from the Northwest... believe me, I was born in the deserts of California and my husband came from Portland - our cultures have very little in common.  So I say, our country actually has 5 main regions.Pages 50-51.  If you are going to recognize minority holidays like St. Patrick's Day... also include other cultural holidays like Martin Luther King's Day, Chinese New Years, etc.  Then place the start of each of those holidays on a timeline and discuss their significance.  In fact, I think Martin Luther King's Day should really be celebrated by everyone and not just minorities because he wanted us to never judge by the color of one's skin but by their character.  What a lesson for us all.Pages 54-55.  Empty tomb craft and no timelines...Pages 58-59.  WAY too much music listed - seriously unless your kid is music obsessed, just pick a few of them to listen to and add in a recent song - place each on the timeline after listening to it to get an idea of how music has changed over time.Pages 60-61.  Research a number of different weapons then place in a timeline... maybe even include things like chariots and the different metals like bronze, iron, steel etc.  Explain what gave each people group military advantage.Pages 62-63.  Goes over some church theologians but does not give much really... then does a memory game.  Really think you should use the number line and at least say something about what they believed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N568BG71Z5SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936648261#wasThisHelpful","R2N568BG71Z5SK","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a children's atlas that was not too much in depth, had great illustrations, and thus would not loose the interest of a 4-7 year old.  This book surpassed my expectations and in fact may be useful even with older kids.Pros:  The start of the book teaches all sorts of info in small easy to understand chunks... PLUS each section has pictures to find in the maps the correlate to that topic.  What an ingenious way to get kids to know the REAL difference in placement around the world.  The maps were filled with little icons that significantly added to the knowledge being introduced.  A big plus for me was that (Unlike the lift-the-flap atlas also by Usborne) this atlas had Ecuador on the map!  My 2005 edition also had no reference to controversial things like global warming etc.  Honestly, I found no agenda here at all - it just teaches the world, what lives there, and cultural diversity.  I also really liked that the end of the book had review questions.Cons:  It was difficult to read some information as in was in the crack of the two-page spread.  It is SMALL at only 5.5 x 7 inches.  If it had been slightly bigger, the information would have been easier to read and/or more information could have been included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JJHK8AJ184N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0746068255#wasThisHelpful","R5JJHK8AJ184N","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product:  This was given to me as a gift and I am not keeping it.  The keys are terribly out of tune.  Most people may not care because they plan to use it for babies and then donate it... HOWEVER why waste the money and resources by getting a toy that does not work properly so you just get rid of in a few weeks/months?  This is not a good buy in my opinion.  If you want temporary things for your baby to bang on - use plastic Tupperware then when they grow out of it, you can go back to using it as Tupperware in the kitchen.Better product:  What I wanted was a xylophone that could be used for years not just as a baby toy but for learning to play tunes, basic music knowledge, and even the science of sounds... so for just a few more dollars listing price I bought the one from Lakeshore.  Its in perfect tune and even has the letter scale imprinted on it!  Lakeshore often has coupons so in the end, I was actually able to purchase the Lakeshore model for LESS money than the Little Tikes version was listed for on amazon.

"I felt the educational value in the book was lower than expected (given the jungle sticker book was exceptional.)  This book is just ordinary to me but then again I am not a little boy obsessed with cars.  The book is pretty straightforward to use - find the sticker page matching the scene, then you place the vehicle stickers onto scene.  The vehicles are labeled on the sticker pages but those names are left behind as they are stickers themselves or part of the vehicle stickers that are removed.  I also don't really know if the names for each item is the same in the USA as in the UK... I am pretty sure a motorway is like a freeway or highway.Here are the scenes:In the country (farming)In the townAt the factoryOn the motorway (freeway?)At the building siteIn the mountainsAt the portMake your own picture (gives a road but you put in the scenery stickers in addition to the vehicles.Overall, I am sure a little boy would love this book, I just don't know home much he is learning from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLJC11E44WKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0746089414#wasThisHelpful","R1GLJC11E44WKG","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This refers to the red and grey outfit with doggies on the feet.NOTHING like what Carter's made for newborns and young babies!  I should have returned them immediately.#1 We started with the newborn-styled footed cotton pajamas from Carter's and loved them:My son at 6.5 months of age, grew out of his Carter's brand size 9 month pajamas.  This occurred because the leg portion of the pjs was not long enough and so he was starting to rip the seams around the feet and crotch area.  The 9 month pajamas were more than wide enough, soft, comfy, etc. but we needed them longer.  So we went online to buy more of the same pajamas just in the next size up.  An inch or two in length would do the trick...#2 Those great newborn-style pajamas end at 9 months:BUT there is no size 12 month pajamas with the snaps for easy diaper changes.  Everything jumps to using zippers or being 2 piece sets.  My baby was only 6 months old and still needed pajamas for babies not toddlers....  I was a bit worried and checked a lot of other brands, but ALL of them had the same transition.  I figured Carter's and all those other companies must know what they are doing and with this being our first baby, we trusted their judgement and bought what Carter's was offering in 12 months.#3 The toddler-style footed cotton pajamas DO NOT in any way fit BABY body shapes, meet their needs, or are even designed well:So when the new toddler-style pajamas arrived, the legs and torso of the new pajamas looked nice and long.  Since length was our issue and we had been so happy with our previous Carter's purchases, I really did not think much about the pjs.  I just washed them on cold and dried on delicate.  Then I put them on my then 7 month old for bed time.  I instantly I realized that buying these pajamas was a BIG mistake - I SO should have paid attention to the subtle differences and returned these pajamas immediately.  First, the fabric is stiff, not soft or stretchy.  A child trying to roll around, crawl, or be active is not going to have the flexibility they need in the pajama.  Second, there is elastic at the back of the each ankle that tries to cut my son's blood supply off to the foot.  It is easy to rip out the elastic since its not on a seam just set on top of the fabric but that means I now have to rip out the elastic on 12 feet!  The non-slip footing is also attached/sewn on with seams that protrude in on the foot area putting unneeded additional pressure.  Third, the zipper only opens on one side so you have to awkwardly remove both legs every time you need to do a diaper change then redress which completely wakes my son up and cannot go back to sleep.  Four, the wrist area is so tight I could not get it over my son's hands without him crying and that is a diameter issue as there is no elastic sewn in there.  Fifth, the legs and arm areas assume a thin and frail baby.  Seriously my son is AVERAGE weight and his only issue is being tall not too wide - he is only 7.5 months old and cannot fit into a 12 month toddler-style outfit?  That is ridiculous.  Every other baby i know is cubbier than my son and could never get their arms or legs in this outfit.  Going up to the 18 month size did not fix the issue either, these just are not made for babies.Now I know some of you are going to say just go out an buy the fleece pjs because they are looser.  Polyester makes me itch from head to toe so I cannot put my baby in it.. and is frankly way too hot to wear where i live.  We need lighter weight cotton footed pjs.I really thought Carter's was going to be the store i shopped at most, but they just lost my loyalty.

"Good book for under 6 dollars.  My son at 8 months thought it was great and wanted to read it a second time.  We got it because he loved the Zoom Zoom Baby book so much.  He liked the large high contrast letters, flaps, and mommy saying noises.  Mommy did not let him touch the flaps though because they could cause paper cuts esp with his current dexterity.  This is definitely going to be one of his top 5 favorite books for a while.  The only cons are the wording rhythm is changed from the Zoom Zoom baby book, so I simply adjust it to match AND the sounds do not really makes sense so I do my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1S0LRUOL49N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481417886#wasThisHelpful","R3I1S0LRUOL49N","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About me:  I love science - in fact, I teach science, I have a vast science library, and I spend my free time watching science shows.  One thing I especially love is children science books and great rhyming!  I even read myself kids books like 10 Tiny Tadpoles because the rhymes make me smile from ear to ear.  This is why my mother-in-law thought a Cat in the Hat rhyming book on weather would be perfect for my son and I... HOWEVER, I - a science obsessed person who loves rhyming - could not finish reading this book.My review:  This book bored me and made my brain hurt - seriously!  I have tried to read it 3 times now and I literally have to drag myself to even reach page 20 and then my brain shuts down as there is 21 more pages to go!  Yes, the book has a lot of facts on weather - but seriously it does not teach any of those facts very well, jumps to the next topic without any continuity, the rhyming plus images were awkward and strange, and placement of words in pop up boxes or around images was hard to follow.  Therefore, the entire book felt disjointed, poorly written, confusing, and tiring to read.  If I used this book for teaching, I could only use 2-4 pages at a time and would have to supplement every topic.  That makes the book not that useful.  There were a few nice moments like ""a tornado picks up everything it goes by, like a huge vacuum cleaner way up in the sky"" but moments like those are not able to save this book and frankly are not as good as what Dr. Sues would have written himself.Overall, I have never complained about a science book in my life unless it had inaccurate content - this is a first for me, but the book was just too random, too confusing, and poorly done.

"I bought this book as a first introduction to sea animals for my son and I expected to use it as part of my homeschool curriculum for ages 3-4, but after looking over the book I think its more of a 4-6 year old book.  Right now my son is just a baby, so we will just look at the pictures and names of the animals, but later on we will read the text.Cons: Text is a bit advanced and I think the parent might want to consider reading only as much text as is appropriate for the age of the child.  For children reading alone I think the child would have to be in 3rd-6th grade for words like polyps.  The photos for certain animals like the blue whale and shrimp just don't give the best view of what an animal really looks like.  Photos extend over the page divide which can make the image awkward to see and those images are unfortunately the large main image for the creature. The dispersal of animal types is pretty diverse though I thought a few more basic fish would seem appropriate - it only did a general coral fish and mackerel. The book does a lot of pre-knowledge assumption instead of teaching so a parent really needs to explain things in more detail as they read along.Pros: Good intro to sea animals. Includes some fun facts kids would find interesting (though you might need to look up more info or better pics online.)  Does show a lot of different species in a very short compact book. Bright bold colors for most of the animals and real life photos. Easy to read text with bolded vocabulary (though why so few words considered vocab?). Hardcover for durability. Includes contents, glossary, and index so can show kids how to find info for themselves.The animals included in this book are:Invertebrates: Coral, Anemone, Urchin, Starfish, Jellyfish, Sea Slug, Shellfish, Octopus, Shrimp, Crab, LobsterFish: Mackerel, Coral Fish, Seahorse, Ray, SharkAmphibians: NoneReptiles: Iguana, Sea snake, Turtle, CrocodileBirds: Penguin, AlbatrossMammals: Otter, Seal, Walrus, Dolphin, Sperm whale, Blue whaleOverall the the book seems like an early elementary book to introduce sea animals... but some of the language/text is not quite appropriate for that age group.  The text is more appropriate for middle to late elementary children if reading alone.... but at that age you might as well buy your child a full on encyclopedia of animals as it will be more thorough in species represented.  It would work with younger ages IF the parent / teacher reads it to the class and answers questions and teaches vocab.  I suggest only one animal at a time them a project regarding that animal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLK5Y596LLKES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784930121#wasThisHelpful","RLK5Y596LLKES","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like that the book teaches half past, quarter past, quarter to, etc. as those are typically harder phrases for a child to get.  It also includes the digital times in the bottom right for comparison.  You can check how you set the clock to the text as there is a small clock in the left side of the page spread.  Also like that the clock can be used without opening the book so it can be used for quizzing on time or using in time projects.What I did not like was the book never taught that the short hand pointed to the hour and the long hand to the minutes and that hours are listed first etc.  This seems like such basic things that I am surprised it was not outright taught in the text.  Also did not teach am/pm, 24 hours in a day, etc.  This is why the book lost 2 stars.Also, our family schedule (and no one else's I know about) matches the book's times in any way... I work evenings so our entire schedule starts at 9:30 am not 7am.  My friends work during the regular workday, so they get up between 5-6am.  But, I understand the book had to choose a general schedule time-frame to reference to... so its only a minor issue.  But it is something you should be aware of - that the schedule will not match whatever you do at home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O018VCJZ5FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848959648#wasThisHelpful","R16O018VCJZ5FU","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent book with high educational value.  I wish more toddler books were like this.  Board book so very sturdy.  Realistic images, lots of labeling, and even provides scenes without words so kids can practice naming things then check themselves on the next page.  Not all of the animals are included in the scenes, but enough are to make it challenging.  Great time spent together with my son.  He is only 6 months old but loves me reading to names of everything and making noises.  We only do 2-4 pages at a time throughout the day and its about what he can handle at his age.The only downsides are....1. it does not include a desert scene and I live in a desert so its odd for my son to not see something similar to his home to compare to.  The book only has: farm, country (British countryside), forest (North American), savanna (African), jungle (South American), and ocean (I cannot tell which particular region, but definitely not tropical and not kelp forest.)2. Not all of the continents are represented as I had hoped... It did have Europe, the Americas, Africa, Ocean, and Man-Made farms.  But, I wanted to use this book to enforce basic geography knowledge of the continents and their ecosystems.  It would not have taken much to include all the continents... Australian desert, Ice world of Antarctica, and the bamboo forests or high mountain ranges of Asia.Overall, I love the book.  The content is far better than most toddler books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BG0BDPJ0MQGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375815767#wasThisHelpful","R3BG0BDPJ0MQGK","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I think the book is work about 2 dollars.Content wise, I think this book is appropriate for a 3-4 year old.  Some of the areas to color are smaller than I would expect for that age group though.  Some would even be appropriate for age 2 esp if scanned and enlarged.  Note: I have only on son so I am not making duplicates.What it contains:- 18 pages color by capital letter- 16 pages color by basic shape- 15 pages color by number","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VU8Y4GY0GPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601596618#wasThisHelpful","R17VU8Y4GY0GPH","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I think the book is work about 2 dollars.Content wise, I think this book is appropriate for a 3 year old, but the coloring pages seem aimed more at a 5 year olds.  Why 3 years old?  Presents capital and lower case letters.  I usually only do only capitals with 2 year olds.  Plus it uses bigger words like alligator and butterfly instead of ant and bear so again not at the 2 year old level.  Why 5 years old?  Because some of the areas to color are pretty small and 5 years old is the soonest I think that level of fine coloring can be achieved.  However, the content is too low for many 5-year olds.What it contains:- A-Z coloring pages using animals.  Oddly it uses Fox for X instead of X-ray.- Counting coloring pages spread in the back: 1 sea lion, bear clown has 2 feet in the air, 3 carrots, juggling 4 balls, 5 kites, 6 fish, 6 flowers, 7 turtles, 8 butterflies, and 8 octopus legs.  Missing items of 9, 10, or higher.Seasons coloring pages spread in the back: summer beach, spring rain, winter snowman, and fall scarecrow.Holidays coloring pages spread in the back: jack-o-lantern and elf painting eggs.  Should have had something for Christmas and Thanksgiving at least.Random coloring pages spread in the back: artist yak, zebra in a blimp, alien in spaceship, mermaid, farm animals, and train engine.In my opinion, the extra coloring pages at the end are not really organized into anything useful, but with effort they can be included in curriculum.  I kinda wish they were organized into themes like numbers 1-20, seasons with major holidays, etc.Because of the above, I can only give it 3 stars... though I will be using it and am glad I bought it.  Overall my favorite alphabet coloring book is Nature ABC by Dover, but its for older kids and I needed something at the 2-3 year old level.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3LBOMXZG9PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601593104#wasThisHelpful","R2B3LBOMXZG9PY","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its the best sticker workbook I have found on the market for 123s and for 2-3 year olds. The only con is that its too short - it stops at number 12 when it should have gone to #20 then covered the tens to one hundred.Stickers are specified as to which pages they belong but the exact number needed is the exact number of stickers given so kids are not really forced to count to place the right number of stickers on the page.  Therefore this book does not have as much educational value as the ABC sticker workbook.Why is the book so good for two year olds? It enables the kid to show what they learn without having to write or say everything... they can point at stickers and place them. Practice writing is brief so you don't exhaust a very young one. Great way to interact with your child to ensure kids learn instead of randomly placing stickers. Might even be a good daddy comes home activity to review what was learned during the day. Plus, its fun. I cannot wait to do it with my son.What the book covers:Page 1, numbers 1 through 12 visually shown and can clearly see you add one more to go to the next number.Pages 2-25, find the object stickers that match each number, then on the following page place more stickers into a scene, and there is usually some directions to follow like circle something or color something.Pages 26-31, count and place the correct number sticker in the box, then on the following page add more stickers of an object until reach the designated number.Pages 32, 38-41, complete the number line with the missing number stickers.Pages 33 & 35, dot-to-dot numbers.Page 34, color by number.Page 36-37, count and place the correct number sticker in the box.Page 38, 56-59, basic addition.Pages 43-47, compare amounts.Pages 48-51, basic counting of coins using pennies.Pages 52-55, telling time.Page 60-63, basic subtraction.Page 64, review of counting 1-12.Rest of the pages are stickers both to complete the worksheets as well as reward stickers.There is a parent guide inside the front cover and a certificate of completion inside the back cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMDJL6RYLTJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601591136#wasThisHelpful","RYMDJL6RYLTJB","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never seen mazes so beautifully colored an interesting designs.  I think some of the puzzles are a bit challenging due to that creativity... so I would use this book with kids 4+ years old.  I think you could even do this book just using fingers so that its reusable.Warning - this book contains all of the mazes from The Usborne Very Big Maze Book (67+% of this book is identical).  So if your child already completed the previous Very Big Maze book, don't get this one because its too much the same.  I suspect all of the mazes came from previous books but I cannot verify that.Also, the colors are less bold than in The Usborne Very Big Maze Book... I was more drawn to the bolder colors and found them more engaging, but The Ultimate Maze Book had a greater number of mazes.  It was a hard choice, but I went with a greater number of mazes for my son and the bolder colors for my nephew.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9MJYDMYMY8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1474903142#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9MJYDMYMY8F","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wish the food/tool tiles had been cut the same size as for the shopping list game... these were unfortunately a tad smaller than the shopping list tiles.

"Its cute, but I would have made it with more words under the flaps and better thought through the flap usage as some are pretty small.  Also little kids could cut themselves on the paper flaps if their motor control and dexterity is not well honed.  Here is what you get in the book:When you lift the two mittens, I was expecting it to say hands, but it said ""fingers"" and the other mitten was blank underneath.... why couldn't it have said both since there were two flaps?  I will probably write in hands on the blank mitten.Inside of the boots is ""toes"" why not also feet?Under the hat is really under ear muffs... and it was only ""ears.""  There is no flap to look under the hat to see the head of hair.Beneath the scarf was a ""nose"" not a neck or mouth like i had expected.  Where i live, no one covers their nose with a scarf.Under the sleeve was an ""elbow "" but no mention of an arm.Under jeans is ""knee"" but no mention of legs.The image of the jacket is confusing because it covers the ""back""... the drawing did not look like it was the back of the girl unless you really think about the head and hair placement... even the hand placement made it look like the front.The jacket also covers a ""belly button.""  Since we did a jacket on the back of the page... why not use a shirt instead and do it on a boy so can say it covers the chest and belly button?Hands lift up to reveal ""teeth"" inside the mouth... would have preferred both mouth and teeth to be under the flap.Moving a candy lollipop reveals the ""tongue.""  I would have preferred if that had used a fruit Popsicle instead of candy.Sunglasses lift to reveal ""eyes.""At the end you lift up the flap to see the whole child.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQTK0PBLA0YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689847122#wasThisHelpful","RNQTK0PBLA0YS","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to homeschool my son for pre-school through kindergarten at least.  Being a science educator, I already have a lot of ideas, but I needed a sense of what was age appropriate and specifically hoped for science center activities that I could leave out and slowly rotate throughout the year.  Ultimately the book ended up being useful but not completely what I hoped for.  Only some of the activities would do well for self-exploration at an activity center and it lacked the variety I wanted.  Many of the ""experiments"" seemed like it will take a lot to maintain like a terrarium, raising tadpoles, etc.  Personally I prefer raising butterflies because the care is much simpler and you can just release them into the wild.  Some experiments need more to prepare than you would think... like buying a quality horseshoe magnet and putting together assortments of magnetic and non-magnetic objects that are non-toxic, kid-safe, and can be left out for a while... or collecting and printing a lot of images like animals etc.  Other sections of the book were underwhelming as kids just cut out and pasted images of things that go or planted seeds in various places.  However, I did like the ideas for gases, electricity, and senses.  Some of these might be no-brainers to an experienced pre-school educator, but I have been teaching high school through college for so long that I had forgotten that such simple activities are so educationally valuable.  Watching gas escape a submerged object for example is extremely simple to set up, but wow it really does display that empty containers are not empty, they just contain air you cannot see.  Also the experiments range significantly in difficulty.  For example:  I think learning about the sun and its rotation is best for a four your old and watching bubbles come out of a submerged empty container can be done with 2 year olds.  SO carefully pick which experiment you do and really think about if its age appropriate.Do I think the book is worth 11+ dollars... no its not enough material, I would say more like 6 dollars.  Will I use it?  Absolutely.  Did I learn from it?  Yes, I learned what can be done with pre-school so now I can design the rest of the experiments which is no problem for an experienced science educator.  However, I am going to supplement with the elementary school experiment books that I have.  I think a number of those projects can also been done in preschool but just on a lower level of difficulty.Experimentally and content-wise, I feel pretty ready to face pre-K and K.... but I still wish I had more science center creative ideas, but maybe I am just overthinking what a science center is.  I could have a few matching games like putting together cards of an animal parent and its baby, classification velcro board where foods are separated into food groups or animals into their natural ecosystems, dexterity games of placing certain things in proper containers which is another classification game, or string boards in which yarn is wrapped around push pins to connect things together that are the same, opposites, etc... plus you can have live plants/animals to observe or care for each day, a type of hands-on experiment/observation like using magnets, nature collections, books to read, sequences to order or life cycles, etc... so maybe I don't really need a book to tell me how to do a science center.  Its the same as warm-ups just at a very young child's level.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NRM2MSD1YXQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0876592418#wasThisHelpful","R3NRM2MSD1YXQ6","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased one at a local store and loved it so much we got a second one off of amazon.  This was even better than the previous model.  First, the six or so dollar price was way better than what we paid in store - thank you amazon.  Second this dry rack is squarer so it takes up less space on the counter.  Third the stopper holder slots in the front has deeper groves on both sides - which eliminated the weird tiny prongs on the previous version that were a pain to get the stoppers to stay in.Why these work Dr. Brown's bottles...  on the tall spokes we place the circular rings and the the bottle on top.  On the first row of short spokes we place the blue internal part that allows air to move.  We place two upright, one upside down, and repeat the pattern across the row.  The second row of short spokes holds the white inner parts.  We poke the tip into the round holders at an angle so fluid can drip out if need be.  You can fit one in between each spoke and one at each end.  I then place the bottle nipples on top of these spokes.  In the very front, goes the stoppers into the slots.  I place the bottle caps on any open spokes and on top of the stoppers if stable.  So one dry rack holds 5 complete Dr. Brown's bottles.Why we got a second dry rack:  to hold the bottles, stoppers, rings, and other parts used with my breast pump.  Plus hold small bowls used for cereal and we intend to continue using these with sippy cups etc.  We don't put anything plastic in the dishwasher and do it all by hand so these dry racks will be used for a long time.The only con is.... it was a pale purple not white.

"I posted my perspective because I felt the negative backlash to this book would dismay too many from purchasing it when there is nothing really wrong with it at all...  This book is exactly what I wanted for a 1-2 year old.  A book that just shows the continents, 3 animals that live there, and what the world looks like.  Simple, effective, and straightforward.Each two-page spread focuses on one continent - its good to only see one at a time.  However it still gives a lot of world map context (A smaller map in bottom right shows which continent you are in... in relation to which continent is covered next.)  The tactile sandpaper feel around the edges of the continent are nice but not scratchy enough for my tastes.  I like they are not indented into the page as that tends to lead to paper cuts.The main ""con"" others post are that the book colors do not match the color coding used in the Montessori classroom.... In my opinion, this is actually a VERY GOOD THING.  Let me explain my reasoning (as an educator who has taught 2 year olds through college).  It is VERY important that kids be able to see that things are the same regardless of color.  An apple is an apple whether its yellow, green, or red.  A bird is a bird because it has certain features like a bill/beak, feathers, lays eggs, etc. not because of its color.  So we should want kids to know that Asia is Asia by its shape, location on a world map, cultures, ecosystems, etc...  Classification and discrimination skills are essential to long term success in life, school, and in careers, so it is important that kids are taught to focus on essential characteristics for an object and frankly arbitrary country colors is not one of them.  I like a lot of Montessori ideas, but I take ALL educational philosophies under the microscope and the color coding part is way too rigid for true learning to occur.  Too often kids get questions right if you use the same color coding, because kids are remembering the colors NOT the content.  Others may disagree with my opinion, and that is fine - we each can choose to teach our children differently.  I just felt that the book is getting a far worse rap than it really deserved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3862BH26TNY0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419709348#wasThisHelpful","R3862BH26TNY0O","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a gift for me to use with my little baby.  When he was under 4 months old the bouncy chair was not really appropriate because there are no shoulder straps, so his spine would twist and bend in inappropriate ways or hold his head in ways that could cause him not to breath.  We therefore waited and started using it when he was 4.5 months old and he had pretty good neck strength.  Unfortunately, the arch was not constructed right... only one of the two ends fit properly in the provided holes plus the arch is too high for my son to touch with his hands.. he could only use his feet.  When he was around 5.5 months old, my son hit the objects so hard with his feet, the whole arch came out and hit him in the face.  So, we could not use the arch anymore.  Then at 6 months he leaned forward in the bouncy chair and the whole thing flipped forward and his face slammed into the ground with the chair on top of him and it was very hard to get his belt unsnapped to get him out from under it.  Fortunately the surface was soft so he was not hurt, but we threw the chair out.  We did not even take it to good will or donate it to the poor because its so poorly designed that I don't want other kids to get hurt.  Plus, I noticed the legs were completely warped from use and my son was always under the weight limit which means it wore out in only 1.5 months of use which hardly justifies the price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD1K264UV0O63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3RKC1I#wasThisHelpful","RD1K264UV0O63","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very simple mazes for your little ones.  I think this is the perfect first maze book because very colorful, engaging, and instructions are clear (though a parent needs to read them out loud for non-reading children).  All of the puzzles are in color and are age appropriate down to 2-year olds EXCEPT for one image... that is a ""Haunted Hollow"" Halloween ride with ghosts and skulls.  This book does not need to be written in and can be used over and over by just running your finger through the mazes.

"I really enjoyed this selection of bedtime appropriate material.  I was pleasantly surprised at the artwork which was incredibly realistic at times.  Plus, a number of the rhymes dealt with biological themes like nocturnal animals and baby animal names.  I did not all of the stories/rhymes because I have never liked ""Hush, Little Baby"" but I also did not like ""Gaelic Lullaby"" and ""Sleep Now and Rest"" even though I have a Scot-Irish heritage.

"Failure in design.The whole purpose of getting this was so my child can see all the numbers AT ONE TIME.  I even planned on combining this with the Theme Count Game also by Hape to create a giant math manipulative.However, the trees with holes and circles for #1-5 are ON THE immediate BACK of #6-10.  You cannot see both numbers at the same time.  Note: I had hoped they were at least on opposite sides so i could cut the wood in half and flip over one half of the wood to see all the number trees at once.... BUT since they are on the immediate back of each other, that is not possible.  If i cut the wood in half, all I'd get is two blank wood panels on the right... and on the left the trees and circles for #3 and #8 on the back of each other.This design flaw makes no sense because the manufacturer provides 55 pegs which is enough to fill all the holes at once for #1-10, BUT you can't fill all of the trees at once because they are on the back of each other.  You are also given by the manufacture 55 wooden discs which is also enough to fill all the circles at once for #1-10, BUT you can't fill all of them at once because they are on the back of each other.  So clearly the manufacturer was expecting you to use all the tree boards at once so why didn't they design it that way?On top of that, the trees show the number of dots needed on the bottom when the number of circles already shows the number needed.... this redundancy is not needed and I think the dots are ugly at the bottom of each tree.  But this is a minor design flaw compared to the above.Overall, I will use the cards in my Theme Count Game, the wooden disks/pegs for learning how to add and subtract but the wooden boards with the trees and circles will never be used in the way they were intended due to the design flaw of having the trees on the back of each other.I really wish I had not bought this because for that high of a price... there should not be such a huge design flaw.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C6QFXPWPNCBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3L271C#wasThisHelpful","R3C6QFXPWPNCBU","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this book, but its not quite what I expected.  In my opinion, sticker books should be aimed at 2-3 year olds who are just learning how to write and thus need a break from writing so need to express their knowledge in a different way.  Some of this book's material is appropriate for that age group, but some is not....  Overall, I am not excited to do this workbooks with my son because everything is covered too brief for any kind of mastery...  I liked the alphabet sticker book much better with all that repetition.  I still think this book is better than other sticker books because it does teach and has logic to it, but I just wanted more and it covered to great of a learning age range.What it covers:- Comparing size- Matching like to like- Completing patterns- Time (must be able to read written time like 4:00)- Coloring- Farm animals and babies (only 4 animals)- Match objects with their starting letter and letter tracing (brief and only capitals)- Simple mazes- Alphabet- Shapes- Dot-to-dot #1-10- Colors- Counting- Bar graph- Sequence/Order- Grouping/Classifications- Animal habitats/needs- Seasons- Money/Coins- Basic addition- Draw the second half- Match puzzle piece over image- Words- Opposites- Rhymes- Emotions- Rest of the pages are stickers both to complete the worksheets as well as reward stickers.- There is a parent guide inside the front cover and a certificate of completion inside the back cover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLUCCAGWRIDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589477472#wasThisHelpful","R1NLUCCAGWRIDR","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best sticker workbook I have found on the market for ABCs and for 2 year olds.  The only con is that its too short = )Why is this workbook so good?  Stickers are specified as to which pages they belong, but there are no hints as to where they go (in other words this book has no shadows of sticker shapes or object outlines, there is no word written as to which sticker to get, and no answers are hidden in the back of the book.)  So that means kids have to choose the correct answer from potential options.  That means they have to think the same way they would on a school test.  Excellent.  The book focuses on the alphabet instead of getting stuck on side activities which was the issues with other ABC sticker workbooks.Why is the book so good for two year olds?  It focuses only on capital letters (except on 9 pages in which words are used).  It enables the kid to show what they learn without having to write or say everything... they can point at stickers and place them.  Practice writing is brief so you don't exhaust a very young one.  Great way to interact with your child to ensure kids learn instead of randomly placing stickers.  Might even be a good daddy comes home activity to review what was learned during the day.  Plus, its fun.  I cannot wait to do it with my son.What the book covers:Page 1, find the object sticker to complete the alphabet.Pages 2-15, find the object stickers that match each letter then one the following page place more stickers into a scene.Pages 16-41, a rhyme is given using the letter, letter tracing for only capital letters and only 1 line for each, draw a line connecting all of the same letter, find stickers to match that letter and place in box, and write the letter two more times.Pages 42-45, find the stickers to complete the boxes must match a letter to an object starting with that letter.Pages 46-47, find the stickers to complete the alphabetPages 48-55, find the object stickers to match the word.  Circle these images in the scene. - Problem is the page uses lower case letters which this book has not taught the kid yet.  If the parent reads the word and has the kid point to the right sticker then this is not a problem... my 2 year old son can't read.Page 56, find the object stickers to match the word and the write the word - Problem is the words are in lower case and the book did not teach lower case.  This page should NOT have been included.Pages 57-64 is dot-to-dot with the alphabet.  I think its a bit too much for 2 year olds, but older kids will be able to handle it.  You could have the parent do the drawing and have the kid point to which letter is next.  Also, the alphabet is included at the top so the worksheets are for learning and memorizing the alphabet not practicing after memorization.Rest of the pages are stickers both to complete the worksheets as well as reward stickers.There is a parent guide inside the front cover and a certificate of completion inside the back cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OVYI8J4ID85L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589477464#wasThisHelpful","R2OVYI8J4ID85L","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent children's poetry book esp for very little kids as the poems deal with swinging, going to bed, weather, day/night, bugs, seasons, etc.  Just love it.  Very happy I bought it.Reason it lost one star:  One poem in my opinion should be skipped entirely.  The ""Threats"" poem is a child threatening to run away in order to force parents/guardians to do what they want.  This is not the sort of thing we should be teaching kids to do.  I cannot believe it was included in this wonderful book.The other poem I did not like is ""Bedtime"" because the child instead of obeying the parent and going to bed keeps asking for more time to play... but I could see it not being an issue in some families and used more as a way to get over that problem.

"This is the entire and complete set for BambinoLUK.  The books are listed for age 3-5 but you might be able to use them even with a slightly younger child.  To use them you must place an open book under a Beyond123 BambinoLUK Controller... then you move tiles from the top to bottom page to answer the questions. These books range in difficultly so kids can work at their own pace.  For very young kids and special education... I suggest you get the age 2 special primary book set as it focuses on the images on those 6 tiles, how to read the LUK icons, how to do LUK self-checking, etc.Overall, I am surprised how tricky some of the questions are and how it gets kids to work on that critical thinking / visual perception at a young age by removing the need to write.I have organized the books by ""difficulty packs"" in the following lists...Set 1:- My First Workbook (intro to the type of questions kids will face and helps you explain anything kids do not get at first so they can succeed in the books on their own)- See and Sort- Zoo Animals- Concentration Games- What Belongs Together- Starting to CountSet 2:- Seek and Compare- Farm Animals- More Concentration Games- Think and Associate- Starting to Do additionSet 3:- Identify and Relate- Brainteasers for Kids- What Belongs Together 2- All about Colors and Shapes- Transportation and Traffic Signs","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U90D3Z6HA7V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933748206#wasThisHelpful","R1U90D3Z6HA7V3","A37GAGAZDFRMZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37GAGAZDFRMZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book reinforces a number of learning concepts - it is not a teaching book but a practice book.  I think it would be good for kids age 3-4.  I actually got it to use with a 2 year old because it was simple in the drawings and page layouts etc, but a child that young cannot complete the pages on their own so its a book we will do together.  Plus the other book i had was lacking in the opposite department and this book had a number of worksheets on that topic (like inside/outside or wet/dry).  The biggest con is the pages are thin so you can see the images on the other side.  Also since the pages are not necessarily in the order you want to teach the subjects, I would usually xerox pages but by being see-through, I now have to scan, edit, then print the copy which wastes a lot of time.  I have only one son so I am not making copies for others, but I can't rip out a page, have my son complete one side, then store it for weeks before we use the second side of the page which is why i end up xeroxing.Here is what the book covers:- Matching same- Tracing lines- Drawing lines without tracing- Finding images within a picture- Drawing circles- Coloring images- Seasons- Clothing for seasons- Night sky- Hot/Cold- On/Off- Shapes- Sizes- Simple mazes- Inside/Outside- Finish a picture by drawing lines, circles, etc.- Where things belong- Counting- More/Less Amounts- Number tracing 1-5 (unstructured)- Opposite/Same- Positions/Directions- Out/In- Near/Far- With- Colors- Alphabet tracing (very simple 1 pager)- Uppercase/lowercase- Where animals live- Patterns- Sequencing- RhymingA tracking/reward chart on the inside of the front cover and a completion certificate at the end of the workbook.

"This super convenient and discreet little plastic bottle is perfect for an overnight bag or the guest bathroom.  It works by spritzing some essential oils onto the toilet water before you go, so that afterwards the only scent left in the bathroom is from the spray.

Everyone leaves the bathroom smelling fresh and clean.The Poo-Pourri eucalyptus and spearmint flavor smells very nice and lingers with an almost citrus inspired freshness for the commode.The packaging is lighthearted with plenty of #2 jokes and is about the size of a perfume bottle.

"I love my Multi-cooker.  I've had it for about a week at this point, and already I have used it as a rice cooker, crock pot, and bread machine! It is just an all-around great machine. Right out of the box it comes with a pretty handy full color recipe book that really got my creative juices going.The Multi-cooker itself allows you full control of time and temperature settings that allow you to slow cook, delay cook, and keep warm meals.  The best part of the process is that it is ""hands free"" once you set it to start.  The machine applies heat to a surprisingly heavy metal cooking pot.  The pot is built in such a way that food cooks evenly without crusting on the hot surface of the pot.  Better still, the nonstick surface makes it easy to use.I tested the nonstick surface with both ""no-fry fried eggs"" and a coconut flour banana raisin bread.  Both recipes usually call for a oil or butter on the pan, and in both cases I omitted this step in an effort to test the claims of the no-burn no-stick surface. My bread slid right out of pot, and I didn't break the yolks of my eggs!The easy clean up features of this Multi-cooker are also very nice.  All the accessories are dishwasher safe. So it was easy to rinse and put away.  The lid of the machine also slides off easily so if there is steam or boiling food that splatters the lid, it is easy to take the lid to the sink.The user interface works a bit like an alarm clock.  You press each control multiple times to make the numbers flash on the screen and then adjust the numbers with either ""+"" or ""-"".  Unfortunately the controls are the one area that could use a little work in a device that I otherwise like very much. It is not difficult to set the time and temperature that you want, but it is also not exactly intuitive.  I would've like to have seen a touch screen (or simply forgo the digital and include nobs or or controls).  As it is the Cooker definitely reminds me of trying to set my alarm clock. But this is a small note, and certainly not enough to take way from the stars.There are a few kitchen gadgets that earn precious space on my counters, and this one is definitely a great go-to machine.  Easy meals, with few dishes to clean up, are just a few button presses away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWPI2FW3OTTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R1AWPI2FW3OTTN","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collecting: Wolverines #16-20This book concludes the Wolverines series that spun out of the Death of Wolverine event.  Readers are treated to a grand finale that showcases the unleashed brutality of the Wolverines team against the white-knuckled survive-or-die battle with Mister Sinister.In this final Wolverines volume, the Paradise and Wolverines team tangle with Mister Sinister. While I have not been a fan of the ""control words"" plot device used throughout this series, the problematic reliance on ""control words"" is finally exploited in this episode. And I don't want to spoil anything, but it is brutal.In the previous volume, Wolverines Vol. 3: The Living and the Dead, hints were dropped that Mystique was plotting something.  Mystique's duplicity and her skillful manipulation of people and events is finally put on display in this book.  Lady Deathstrike and Shogun/Ogun's romance is tested by Sinister.  The Wolverines team is finally interesting!  In fact the only character that didn't quite feel ""right"" was Sabretooth: Sabretooth's recent realignment to the ""good guys"" isn't particularly well explored.  As opposed to say Wonder Man (who espouses Pacifism), the ""good"" Sabretooth still disembowels people, but he limits himself to ""bad"" people.The artwork in this volume rises to the sublime.  Jonathan Marks work on issue #18 is not to be missed. Marks uses a bright almost ""overexposed"" style that is really mesmerizing.This volume is probably the best in the series.  If you've been reading Wolverines up to this point, you'll want this book because it finally seems to rise to the promise of the series. This book ends by pointing readers toward [[ASIN:0785198849  Secret Wars]] where the Marvel Universe undergoes something of a reboot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYHX52217WFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785197672#wasThisHelpful","R2VYHX52217WFS","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collecting: Night of the Living Deadpool #1-4----- Prelude to Deadpool Corps #4Despite the title, Night of the Living Deadpool is more an homage to Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead than to it's namesake Night of the Living Dead.  Artist Nik Virella uses a black and white palette inspired by the Walking Dead with only Deadpool appearing in color.  This artwork really pops and has a fantastic atmosphere.  As in The Walking Dead, the protagonist (in this case Deadpool) awakens to nightmare world overrun run by zombies.  Also as occurs in the Walking Dead, zombies are the least of the heroes' worries: deranged survivors (of sorts, I don't want to spoil the plot for readers) present a the greatest danger.Despite the paean to The Walking Dead, this book is all Deadpool.  The humor is dark. These zombies moan snippets from their previous lives: so instead of crying ""braaaaaaaaiiinnns"", these zombies attack with groans of ""pot pies for dinner"" and ""walk the dog"". Maybe you have to see it in order to get it, but these panels had me cracking up.  There is plenty of blood, dismemberment, and disemboweling while Deadpool and his companion try to stop a plague worse than zombies.All in all, I recommend this Deadpool mini-series to 'pool fans who are looking for a fun self-contained story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3R9047T4E5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192573#wasThisHelpful","RA3R9047T4E5A","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collecting: Uncanny Avengers (2015) #1-5Counter Evolutionary collects the entire run of the second Uncanny Avengers series. This book picks up in the aftermath of Avengers & X-Men: Axis .  After the stunning revelation that Magneto is not their father, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch travel to the High Evolutionary's planet to confront him about their origin.  Rogue attempts to piece together a new Unity Squad with Vision, Dr Voodoo, Falcon, and a newly good guy Sabretooth to back them up.  Voodoo's spell goes awry, and the Avengers are scattered across High Evolutionary's world.Writer Rick Remender has earned a his reputation as a masterful storyteller.  The pacing and plot work well as Remender weaves the scatter team's individual plot lines together to meet for a grand finale. The High Evolutionary makes a maniacal enemy for our heroes, and Remender uses the High Evolutionary's particular brand of crazy to sound some rather profound thoughts on the nature of perfection and the virtues of flaws. Finally, Sabretooth as a living, thinking character (rather than simply Wolverine's nemesis) has a lot of potential to develop Sabreooth into a sympathetic character. I am enjoying watching his transition from supervillain to superhero.Readers who've followed the Uncanny Avengers will want to pick this volume up because it details critical changes in Wonder Man and Rogue's situation.  Longtime Avengers fans will also enjoy the moments that The Vision and Wanda share. The conclusion of this volume points readers towards Secret Wars in order to follow these characters' adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUFSJRGJVYBQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192379#wasThisHelpful","RUFSJRGJVYBQQ","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hard plastic vacuum attachment arrived and snapped together easily. I love this attachment. I have an antique 1950's gas stove in my kitchen that is beautiful, but it stands on little feet so there is a clearance underneath the entire appliance. It is just a just trap for kibble and cheerios (they both don't eat on the floor but you wouldn't know it to look under the stove). Maybe once or twice per year we would move the refrigerator in order to do a ""deep cleaning"" in the kitchen. Enter the flat vacuum attachment!  Messes underneath and beside the big appliances are no longer a big chore. We also use it to vacuum the underside of the couches (dog hair goes everywhere!).Anyways, this attachment works perfectly with my Shark Rotator NV752 Powered Lift-Away TruePet Vacuum, Bordeaux and fits securely on the hose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N34HRFR1YTJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5KMPCU#wasThisHelpful","R2N34HRFR1YTJ4","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Shark Rotator NV752 Powered Lift-Away TruePet Vacuum, Bordeaux and the Lint Lizard attachment fits the vacuum perfectly. The kit attaches to the vacuum hose with an adapter end and includes a long clear hose that extends deep into the lint trap area of the drier. I knew I needed something to help keep the trap clean because I could see the lint in the hole even after I removed and cleaned the screen.

"I am very pleased with this knife.  In my line of work, I come across many types of knives and consistently find myself disappointed in one aspect or another.

I have been using this knife a lot over the past couple of weeks, and I still have not had to sharpen the blade.The LED lights are extremely valuable.

"Collecting: Spider-Man and the X-Men #1-6Elliott Kalan's Spider-Man and the X-Men picks up after the tragic end of Wolverine's tenure at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning (see Wolverine & the X-Men Volume 2: Death of Wolverine ). This book collects the entire run of Spider-Man and the X-Men.  At Logan's request and against Storm's better judgment, Spider-Man joins the school's staff.  Spider-Man teaches a class on Super Power Ethics.The strength of this series is the juxtaposition of Spider-Man's philosophy, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility,"" against the philosophy of the X-Men, ""Protecting a World that Hates and Fears Mutants"".  Spider-Man is well written and there genuinely funny moments in this book. The students in the book are written a bit less convincingly, but a lot of depth is added to younger members of the X-Men.Just like the Wolverine and the X-Men series that preceded this one, the series is very much in the vein of the original New Mutants.  That is to say, it is a high school/teen book.  But these super-teens deal with some serious enemies in this book.  From the laughable plot of Sauron to begin a new Jurassic world on Staten Island to the insane Mojo to the evil Sinister these teens have their work cut out for them.Artist Marco Failla has a cartoony style that worked well for the series even and there were even a few ""show stopping"" panels that I lingered on (especially the Deathbird symbiote!).The book concludes by pointing readers to Secret Wars .  Hopefully a new series will follow the X-Men junior team after the event of the season concludes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0WKQBZG68L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785197001#wasThisHelpful","R3W0WKQBZG68L7","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collecting: All-New X-Men #37-41Bonus: Variant Cover Art Gallery--- 16-page Art gallery by Sorrento and Asrar--- Digital copyFirst a small note to buyers: issues #38-39 are also collected in Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex. Within this collection, the crossover issues are little disjointed but complete-ists like myself appreciate having the full run of All-New X-Men in once collection.After the alternate-earth adventures in the previous volume ( All-New X-Men Volume 6: The Ultimate Adventure ), The Utopians opening issue in Madripoor by far my favorite in a while. Utopians opens with a training session: Emma Frost and young Jean work on telekinesis in the Mutant Growth Hormone underworld of Madripoor. Mike Del Mundo's watercolor inspired artwork is just jaw dropping in this issue.The Black Vortex issues are better read in context of the crossover collection, but Andrea Sorrento's art amazes with its gritty vibe that works perfectly for this space-faring epic.Finally, Mahmud Asrar's artwork in the final issues of this collection are the least arresting.  Issues #40-41 have the young X-Men returning to the ruins Utopia off coast of San Francisco.  SHIELD has encountered mutant squatters on the island and tries to defuse the issue. The moment between Karma and young Jean was good, and the story's conclusion was impact-ful since it drew a clear line between how SHIELD handles superheroes such as the Avengers as opposed to mutants like the X-Men.The All-New X-Men concludes in Uncanny X-Men #600 which is collected in  Uncanny X-Men Vol. 6: Storyville","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FVH37FP6FRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192409#wasThisHelpful","R10FVH37FP6FRP","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These feature-rich fully wireless Xbox One headphones were a breeze to set up, incredibly comfortable, and produced beautiful sound.Set up was a breeze. A small USB stick plugs into the Xbox One. Then you turn on the headphones. That's it!  These headphones come pre-paired to the USB stick.  There are small red and blue lights on the mic that flash as the headphones search for the wireless signal.  The light will turn a solid color once the signal is connected.The power button also functions as a mute button.  It is easy to tell if the mic is muted because these headphones utilize a brilliant mic monitoring system: you can hear your voice through the headphones when the mic is on.  Headphones without mic monitoring tend to muffle your voice which leads to yelling/speaking loudly.  When the mic is muted the mic monitoring is also off, so you can't hear that audible feedback.A small button at the bottom corner of the headphones toggles between two available modes.  The mode displays a color code on the tiny LED on the edge of the boom mic.""Red"" mode is a bass boost. Explosions and rich thunderous sounds are perfect for gaming.""Blue"" mode is pure audio mode.  This mode is perfect for watching TV.The padded headband adjusts for different head sizes.  The leather-like ear pads are both soft and reduce external noise.  Above the ears, two volume wheels control the overall volume and balance between game and chat volume. The fit was overall very comfortable.The retractable boom mic worked well.  My friends reported a clear voice.  I really liked that the mic stows inside in the headphone for storage.The only ""negative"" I found with these headphones is the same negative I find with all the Xbox One wireless headphones.  The headphones work best with a fresh boot of the system, and the signal can be a little touchy if you move your head. Overall, I can recommend these headphones for anyone searching for a fully wireless option for their Xbox One.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RV6GG3MHWOM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO041RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RV6GG3MHWOM0","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not every situation calls for (expensive) surround sound headphones.  My home theater produces good sound, so this chat mic offers everything I need to talk to my friends.First, a small caveat: unless you have the new Xbox One controller, you will need to buy the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter in order to use this headset. If you do have a controller with headset jack, then the Recon 30X has all the controls you need with in-line mute toggle and volume control.My friends report that my voice was crystal clear using this headset. I was very happy with the slotted ear piece design.  The design allows users to hear themselves talk, so I would speak at a normal volume.  Full-ear headphones often muffle the user's voice, and in order to compensate users will yell to hear themselves.  Moreover I could hear if family members were trying to talk to me.I would recommend these headphones if you have a good sound level from your TV/sound system and you need to be able to hear what is going on in your home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKUSGFZWSUIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UXG#wasThisHelpful","R3KKUSGFZWSUIY","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are perfect headphones for frequent flyers. The headphones are designed to muffle quite a bit of external noise, including the roar of a jet engine! I was able to clearly and distinctly hear my music and audiobooks on my flight.In addition to good sound quality, there are a couple features that make these headphones a good idea for travel.  The ""lay flat"" design allows them to fold easily into my briefcase.  They take up precious little space, and since they are so compact, I can keep them in the seat pocket when not in use.Finally price is really something to consider when travelling. Quickly opening bags for the NSA and the general confusion of our sardine cans in the sky means that items have a higher tendency to be lost or broken. There are, of course, headphones available that cost much more and offer a lot more sound and features, but these headphones offer great sound and compact design at a price point that won't make me cry too much if they get damaged.I am happy with the quality, sound, and value of these headphones.

"The Energy Use Monitor is a real eye-opener.  This simple device by Belkin plugs into the wall and then provides a plug for a device that you'd like to monitor as well as a digital screen.

"This 80v string trimmer was the perfect solution for my 1/3 acre lot.The trimmer arrived and required some basic assembly (the only tool needed is a Phillips ""X"" head screwdriver). The trimmer guard has a reversible guide that needs is delivered in the 14"" position. If you want the full 16"" cutting swath, you need to reverse the guide (which is as simple as backing out two Phillips head screws and then putting them back in).  The large plastic handle was the most difficult part of the procedure: the plastic handle ships screwed together.  It should be a simple procedure to unscrew, fit the handle anywhere that is comfortable on the upper length of the trimmer and then screw together again.  Unfortunately the factor had tightened these screws very tight! And the screws are located slightly under the handle which makes it difficult to get a direct angle on the heads.  I had to use my cordless driver to back the screws out.The trimmer arrived with some string loaded, but you'll soon need more.  I was very pleased with how easy it was to load string into this trimmer.  I cut a sing 10-foot length off of SuperTrim2 SSQ080D1/2-12 1/2-Pound Spool of .08-Inch-by-200-Foot Home Owner-Grade Square Grass Trimmer Line.  The 0.08 thickness is the recommended string, but I have seen people use the 0.095 string as well.  After cutting the length of string, line up the lines on the trimmer head.  Insert the string through one hole and pull it through until both sides are approximately equal length.  The bump feed head has arrows showing you the direction to wind.  Hold the trimmer head and turn the button.  The button clicks as it winds the string into place.The bump feed also works brilliantly.  An easy tap or two on the grass and fresh string advances into place. This easy feed system means no down time even when working along the chain link fence line.Since I already had the GreenWorks GLM801600 80V 21-Inch Cordless Lawn Mower, I was familiar with the power in Greenworks 80v system. I also knew that I wanted the bigger GreenWorks GBA80400 80V 4.0Ah Lithium Ion Battery so that I could use it interchangeably with my mower.The trimmer equipped with the 4.0Ah battery has a lot of staying power. I was able to edge the front yard.  The handle allows you operate the trimmer sideways.  It makes beautiful lines along the edges of the sidewalk and driveway.  I still had plenty of juice to take the trimmer into the backyard. There is a turbo button on the handle that revs up the trimmer and slices through vines, weeds, and runaway stalks.The only downside to the 4.0Ah battery with this trimmer (besides cost) is that it can be heavy. Fortunately there is a shoulder strap that really helps balance the unit and takes all the weight off of the arms.  When I figured out the shoulder strap, it enabled me to use this trimmer indefinitely.Investing in this admittedly pricey system was worth it to me.  I had the freedom and power to do heavy yard work without the hassle of storing gasoline at my house.  Since my garage also doubles as a home gym, I can store the trimmer in the garage without introducing noxious fumes. I was very happy with how quickly the battery chopped through vines and tall grasses. Finally, the added convenience of a second battery to use with my mower means that I can work non-stop in my large yard by simply charging one battery when I trim and charging the other battery when I mow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4AFJY0GI7C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRNSCJE#wasThisHelpful","R1X4AFJY0GI7C0","AJXDBMJBVUGSR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJXDBMJBVUGSR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent holds up to extreme abuseAs someone who tends to break stuff and wear out shoes and gloves rapidly, this Shoe Goo is an excellent money saver. Shoe repairs can be expensive and time consuming, leaving a critical pair of footwear held hostage by a cobbler for multiple weeks.  Before owning this glue, I frequented various shoe repair shops only to deal with the hassle of waiting for a pair of shoes or boots that I needed immediately.  With a few strong spring clamps along with a carpenter clamp, i am able to affix a sole to a shoe with a tighter bond than the original. Highly recommended.Tips:1) follow the instructions allowing the glue to dry for a few minutes BEFORE the two surfaces are mated2) have several different clamps at your disposal before attempting to use the glue so that no air pockets are created (air pockets will cause the shoes to squawk like a duck)3) if you really are a perfectionist, inserting weights into the shoe during the curing process can provide additional assurance of a nice bondThe most important concept to understand is that labor is expensive. Time is money even at a shoe shop.  If you have Shoe Goo in your possession along with the proper clamps, you can do a better job of sole repair at home because you have the ability to take as much time as necessary to clamp the mating surfaces.  Meanwhile, you won't have to waste time on transportation and communicating with the shoe repair shop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJ66O51GRST6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GIFV6M#wasThisHelpful","R3FJ66O51GRST6","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchasing packs of these batteries along with various other [rare] sizes makes a great deal of sense.  Going to the hardware store when an needed on short notice is an expensive strategy.

"Over the past few years, I have am amazed a collection of splitting implements including the this item and the Fiskars 36 inch super splitting axe.  In short, these mauls do not work well with extremely hard to split logs like freshly cut 24 inch diameter slippery elm.  This maul will bounce right off the face of the log. The perfectly cylindrical handle aggravates the problem as it takes a little practice to achieve perfect normal (i.e. 90 degree) impact.  The only success I have with tougher woods is multiple splitting wedges and a 20 pound sledge hammer.Sledgehammers for CrossFit workouts go up to 150 pound head weights. So clearly, there are individuals out there who can swing much heavier weights.  It would great if there was much heavier version of this maul with a sharper blade.  Of course, this would require periodic sharpening with a grinder but nonetheless could serve a different group of users.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBADV0IQZK1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YZOJ7M#wasThisHelpful","R3UBADV0IQZK1T","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This brace it a moderately stable version with stays that can be used during everyday activities.  Yet, it is a bit long, making it somewhat more conspicuous than say a Futuro brace of the same style.  Also, if you have muscular calves and quadriceps, the extended material (compared with Futuro) could become an irritation.

"IMPORTANT - don't destroy your computer by using batteries from this supplier - WARNINGAs a tech-savvy engineer, I generally purchase top-the-line laptops and accessories. Moreover, I have hands-on experience with computer repair and board level electronics. Two batteries (original and replacement) from this supplier were defective and/or improperly designed.  More alarmingly, they appear to have damaged my 2,500 dollar XPS laptop.  In short, the batteries would cause abrupt computer shut-downs without any warning.  The first battery would reach about 35%-45% level and the computer would shut down without warning. Restarting the computer would indicate 1% charge.  Even more ridiculous was the the second battery.  It would lead to computer shutdowns as high as 85%.  Of the 30 or so laptop batteries, I have had over the years, nothing like this has ever occurred.Worst of all, after this happened about 25 times, my computer is damaged and is totally unresponsive. It is appears that a board-level failure has occurred.  Even more odd, is that have always avoided running on battery power, including with this 17 inch XPS when in possession of these new batteries.

"Let me try to add a few pieces of information not already discussed.For those who are not handy with tools, don't worry as the Mystic Rainwater Collection system is very easy to install.  Be sure to double check your your measurements however because it would be difficult to correct too large a section removed from the downspout.BENEFITS OTHER THAN COLLECTING THE WATER:Rapid downpours can lead to pooling around your home where water can seep into cracks that would otherwise not be a problem.  Slowing down the rate of water releases the surrounding environment can help in this regard.CONSIDERATIONS - FOR ANY RAINWATER COLLECTION SYSTEM1) First, the aesthetics of the converted food-grade plastic barrels aren't all that great. Costco has some fancier barrels spring 2015 if you care about aesthetics. Even more sophisticated collection systems blend better into the home's aesthetics. The slimline tanks are one example.2) Second, collecting enough rainwater in the rainy season for drier months later would require storage of thousands of gallons of water storage. The paradox being is that barrel is getting filled when you really don't need the water. Small collection systems make the most sense where sporadic rains throughout the season exist but are insufficient. I use the water for fruit trees.3) Lastly, the water pressure is quite low -- even with the barrel elevated by a foot. Typical municipal water pressure equates to a water elevation of greater than 50 feet. In my case, I water fruit trees so I can leave the hose slowly trickle out for 10 minutes while I engage in other activities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2558URSD3DZGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E1RJVU#wasThisHelpful","R2558URSD3DZGP","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As some reviewers have questioned the five amp fuse, let me explain a bit about the electronics employed.  Car chargers use  DC-DC voltage converters to reduce the output voltage to 5 volts per USB standards.  This charger has a max power consumption of 48 watts.  That is voltage*amps=power (watts).  At the 12 volt level, this is only about 4 amps, which explains why there is only a five amp fuse.  When the voltage is reduced to 5 volts, it can produce an output of 9.6 amp x 5 volts = 48 watts. The voltage decreases, current increases and power stays constant.  In practice, however, there are some losses by any voltage conversion device so slightly more than 4 amps at the socket would be required.********************As I have used about 15 different chargers for myriad portable devices, I can honestly say this one is the best -- so far. Longevity is often a problem with such devices, so time will tell.  I am often charging multiple iPhones and large Galaxy Note 2 and now a Note 3, which has an OEM wall charger of 2 amps.The Aleratec can handle whatever is connected to it.  I previously had another quad charger, which was a bit flimsy compared to the Aleratec, which has excellent build quality.  Moreover, the squarish plug holds firm in my second DC outlet, which is located in the [closed] center glove compartment.  When driving the previous charger, it often would shake loose.  As one can imagine, there is no safe way to push it back in while driving.Overall, the Aleratec is best car charger I have ever purchased and is worth the investment --- if it stands up to the test of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYVZOTRJN2YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP3IWG2#wasThisHelpful","R1QYVZOTRJN2YT","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This presumably is due to the release of hydrogen and/or hydrogen sulfide gas that fools the CO alarm.While I could clearly get the Kidde KN-COPP-B-LPM to trigger by using the exhaust of a snow blower, I was unable to do the same with heavy (10 amp) charging of a deep cycle battery connected to our emergency sump pump, unlike an older model of CO detector we own. Even with the battery bubbling, indicating sizable gas release, the ppm registered zero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ULFX6Z6P4DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y6V5CI#wasThisHelpful","R20ULFX6Z6P4DB","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As someone who has fixed a few phones and iPod Nanos, I have employed both the ""free"" tools that some with screen repair kits as well as higher-end third party sets.  In short, this extremely inexpensive set is a decent value for one or two repairs.  The grips are much better (i.e. larger) than  than the free tools. This becomes important when a tremendous amount of force needs to be applied on screws that have had Loctite applied at the factory.The actual metal on the drivers is roughly the same quality as that of tools included within various kits and is not at the level of pricey hardened steel sets.

"While I am not someone to spend the time on hand washing and waxing, I decided to give this product a try because of its claim to dirt repellency. Turtle Wax ICE liquid is not entirely dirt repellent but its results were impressive.  After application, the surface coating was so slippery that I almost lost my balance when resting my hand on the car's fender. Salt spray still sticks to the body but it easily comes off with a dry rag.  The manufacturer's claims are mostly valid because the exterior surfaces are so incredibly slippery, some dirt deflects off from the surface instead of adhering. That which remains is easily removed with a dry rag.In order to be somewhat scientific about application of this product, I carefully hand washed the car with 150 degree F water.  After thoroughly drying, I applied the wax in an 80 degree heated garage.  Cleaning the car was the 80 percent of the work because it only took about 15 minutes to apply the wax.  The one downside to Turtle Wax Ice is its very low viscosity.  This leads to wasteful over-application, spillage, etc.My overall opinion of this product is very positive. If you are someone that frequently washes your car, you may be able to save money by spreading out the wash intervals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKR61AXOISM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KTINZI#wasThisHelpful","R2MKR61AXOISM8","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After losing a one glove from a pair of North Face E-Tip gloves, I purchased a pair of these Head gloves from Costco at 1/4 the price.  In short, they appeared quite durable initially.

The overall fabric is slightly heavier than the North Face gloves.  Yet, the stitching and construction appears less precise.  At Costco prices, they are definitely worth MORE than the North Face gloves.  If you find yourself using a touchscreen frequently outdoors, the North Face might be better alternative.Lastly, take careful note of the size you need. I am always on the edge of medium/large depending on what type of gloves: weightlifting, work, bicycling, dress.  In the case of the Head gloves, I was happy to purchase medium.

"This device is limited by the current capacity of your vehicle's electrical system.  Most cars have a 15A or 20A cigarette adapter, which translates in 180 to 240 watt maximum output of this type of heater.  By comparison, the Tesla Model S, which must use an electric heater, provides 4000 watts of heating or ~20x as much. When I pre-heat my car in a subzero weather via a 110v timer, in an unheated garage, I generally use an 1100 watt modified pancake hairdryer for 1-2 hours. This is with no moving air around the  automobile to bring the interior temperature up to 75-80 degrees.Cars are not insulated that well because they generally don't need to be.  If the heating system was able to capture ALL of the waste heat from a 30mpg car using 2 gal/h, up to 43,000 watts of heat output would be available.  While this isn't feasible, it suggests the heating system of an automobile could conceivably capture 200 times the heat from a 12v plug-in heater. Hence, don't expect much from such heaters. These are for niche applications.Another way to look at the issue of electrical heating, is that 120 amp alternator will only have about 1000 watts of spare power after running the vehicle accessories. So, even if you had a special heater hard-wired to the battery, you still wouldn't be able to heat the car in extreme cold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EHAG14AH6OIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IXTGHW#wasThisHelpful","R2EHAG14AH6OIG","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In short, this is a solid product but really needs to be a bit more sophisticated (and expensive).  That is to say, it should provide clear indications of the car battery's voltage and a more precise charge state of its internal battery. Current flow in a numerical readingg would also be helpful. When testing this charger on a partially depleted, newly installed car battery that was sitting for a few hours or overnight in cold weather, the Stanley charger depleted quite rapidly -- well under 15 minutes. This was odd because the car battery charge state should have been about 95%+.  After showing total depletion, the Stanley charger would then indicate 3 out of 4 bars within ten or fifteen minutes sitting idle.  Given such information, I wouldn't trust this battery booster in extreme environments far from population centers.Another option is to consider a 30w, 15v hand crank generator by Humless.  It gives quite a workout but is always ready as long as you have the arm strength. You can use the included alligator clips by directly them attaching to the battery terminals or make a custom cable, as I have, with a cigarette lighter plug.

"This is a great productivity tool if you enjoy the exercise. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell the 48 inch wide version of this snow pusher from The Snow Plow. However, I was able to order it directly from the manufacturer/distributor. If you are a bigger/stronger guy and your time is valuable, this ultra wide shovel makes a lot of sense. Need to clear the driveway early in the morning before work but don't want to disturb your neighbors with your gas guzzling snow thrower? This could be your solution.While various descriptions suggest this is usable for light snows under four inches, I would suggest if you plan your work accordingly, you might save time (and gasoline) by making multiple passes while the snow is still falling with this snow pusher instead of waiting for the snow to reach 12"" and then fire up a noisy, smelly snow thrower that is half as wide.Overall, it is a great design. The use of UHMWPE (Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) is good but polycarbonate used in bulletproof glass may have been better. Polycarbonate would be stickier, so there would need to be a slippery edge of Teflon or UHMWPE at the contact surface.

"We had a moderately priced (180 dollar) executive chair that was in pristine condition as it was seldom used.  Sadly, two 1cm welds broke that rendered the chair useless for its 81 year old owner.  In short, there was a [poorly] spot welded tube going through a hollow pyramidal stamped metal structure underneath the bottom cushion of the chair. Think vertically through the Pyramid of Giza.With the two welds fractured, the seat wobbled about 10 degrees, making the owner feel very unsafe while bending other structural components. The other stamped structures around the weld, it would have been cost prohibitive to access the weld area.  Yet, the exterior of the pyramid was easily accessible. So, after drilling three large holes in one side, I poured the mixture after 120 seconds into the cavity.  The next day, I drilled three exploratory holes to see how far the mix migrated. It got around 230 degrees of the vertical tube.  So, I injected a second mix into the the second set of holes.  At the same, time I dabbed a little mix around the hard-to--reach spot welds.In the end, the Permoxy firmly fixed the vertical tube in much more stress conditions that the normal user would impose on the chair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULD7VHKO1H04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ALDXV2#wasThisHelpful","R3ULD7VHKO1H04","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you enjoy the benefits of rack drying clothes - lower energy costs, humidity in the winter and reduced clothing wear -- Downy Infusions is worth the investment. You may have noticed that pure cotton towels become abrasive when left to air dry after being saturated. That problem can be eliminated This particular softener works especially well with HE washers as very little softener is needed.  Towels will come out soft and fluffy despite never being placed in a hot dryer.Does the cost of this product offset any energy gains from not using a dryer? Probably not. If you include gas, electricity and wear/tear on dryer, a load of clothes could cost 25 cents to dry.  If you live in the city, coin operated dryers costs as much as $1.75 per load.  So 15 cents per load cost for the softener at full strength, air drying would come out on top in either case.  Moreover, a little goes lot goes a long way, so if the goal is merely to avoid scratchy cotton, you could probably use a tiny amount when drying cotton towels.  This of course, doesn't take into the other benefits of air drying -- indoor humidity in the winter, outdoor cooling in the summer and increased clothing life.On side note, recent climate models have suggested that direct heating of the atmosphere from energy intensive processes may be bigger factor than previously thought. That is to say your dryer exhaust heats the atmosphere while making your air conditioner work harder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC3QO1YAXP3PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQVEQU#wasThisHelpful","RC3QO1YAXP3PY","A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ZYFE8XMKKR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband loves to be outdoor all year long.  This is perfect for him to wear this winter, while enjoying the outdoor weather.  The Balaclava is well made and attractive.  It is comfortable to wear and is easy to get on and off.  It is very versatile, allowing the wearer to wear it in several different ways, including full, and half face mask, and as a neck gaiter.  It has a special mesh panel allow you to breathe with ease, without feeling claustrophobic.  It is machine washable and launders well, which is a must in my home.  It can become very dirty when riding four wheelers through the mud and muck.  This would be handy for those that race during the summer months too, as it allows you to breathe while protecting your face.

It washes away easily and doesn't irritate my skin, or stain any fabrics.  It is safe to use with ""pleasure aids"", and has added a little something extra to our love making.

"I love Shiatsu massages, and while I have another massage pillow, I like this one because I can leave it out on my couch or on my bed and it looks great.  It doesn't look like your average Shiatsu massager.  It makes a design statement, but if you want to get that great Shiatsu massage, you just flip the pillow over and turn it on.  It is multi-directional and provides a deep tissue massage, depending on how much pressure you put against the pillow.  The massage nodes change direction every minute, giving me great relief of my sore muscles, and releases tension in my muscles.  It can also be used to massage other parts of the body, like neck or legs.  You can use it with, or without heat as well.  The pillow is a great size, just about the size of an average throw pillow.  It seems to be made really well too.  The pillow is programmed not to overheat, and automatically shuts off after 20 minutes.  Several times I've fallen asleep on this pillow without worry that it will not shut off or cause damage to my furniture or myself.

"Of all the Bluetooth headphones I've reviewed, these are my absolute very favorite. The sound from these is incredible. The headphones are very comfortable to wear, and while I thought I would not like to go back to the bigger style headphones, I was wrong. When I'm using these I hear nothing else around me. I can block out the world and listen to my music. These are wonderful when I'm doing house or yard work as there is no cord to get tangled up in.

"I was looking for items for a baby shower gift basket that I was creating for a friend and wanted to include things that weren't the ""usual"" type of items.  When I saw this car seat cover for infant carriers I knew it was a perfect addition.  I was right.  The cover is made of a lightweight 100% cotton muslin.

It  not only shields the baby from the sun, but also from wind, insects and other things you want to protect your infant from.  The cover attaches to the handle with two fabric strips that Velcro around the handle to stay in place.  The fabric is breathable, allowing airflow so baby won't over heat and is still able to breathe normally.  It fits over the car seat, draping on the sides to protect from all angles.  The fabric is high quality and the cover is very well made.  If you've ever tried to throw a receiving blanket over an infant carrier, you know how much trouble that can be, keeping it in place.

"I had never heard of Shilajit until talking with a friend of mine.  I had no clue what it was, and the first time I actually saw it I was extremely resistant to trying it.  After a bit of cajoling, I gave it a try, and I'm glad I did.  It definitely isn't very appetizing in appearance, but the benefits of this superfood are plentiful.  Taking shilajit is helping me to get healthier and younger-looking skin and helping me to improve even the condition of the internal organs. Taking shilajit prevents kidney disorders, liver diseases, heart problems, and other health conditions. It also helps regulate menstrual cycle in women.Other benefits of shilajit include:  prevention of stress, anxiety, and depression, fight insomnia, improve the appearance of the skin, strengthen the immune system, improve lung functions, improve blood circulation, and reduce the risk of ulcers.Since starting the Shilajit I'm feeling more energetic, and happier.  I feel younger and healthier.  I don't know exactly how it works, but it does work, and Purblack Lilve Resin Shilajit is a wonderful addition to my healthy lifestyle.

"This is an inexpensive way to help the person in your life with hearing difficulties.  My husband has been having issues with his hearing for several years now.  Unfortunately, our insurance, if you want to call it that, won't pay for hearing aids.  This has helped my husband hear, without breaking the bank.  While these are not going to give you the sound quality that expensive, custom hearing aids will, they have increased my husband's hearing by leaps and bounds.  My husband was able to adjust to wearing them relatively quickly and, after becoming used to them, says they are comfortable.

"I'm always on the lookout for a good quality face cream and this one from Beautybliss is great!  It's made with high quality ingredients that include Hyaluronic acid and natural oils.  It feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly.  It doesn't leave a greasy residue like some creams I've tried.  Since I've started using this I've noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are slowly fading and I've noticed that my skin is starting regain some of its elasticity.  This is a wonderful moisturizer and anti-aging cream.  I'm very happy with the results I've seen so far, and can't wait to see how much younger I can look by using this cream.

"I was given this set of eight plastic food containers by a coworker after commenting on how I needed something like this to take my lunch to work. This set is great. There are four three compartment containers, as well as 4 round containers. These are great for taking my lunch to work. I can even make it up in advance and just grab it from the refrigerator on my way out the door. They are made of a decent plastic and the lids fit securely The containers are great for storing left overs as well. These are easily washed and I've been able to put them in the top rack of my dishwasher without issue. They stack easily in the refrigerator and store in the cabinets without taking up much room. I'm very happy that I was given these and wanted to share my honest and unbiased review.Comment Comment | Permalink","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBL7MYP6PGCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WD3UVC#wasThisHelpful","R1GBL7MYP6PGCT","A2TXC63EZNXCVP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TXC63EZNXCVP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great addition to my kitchen!  I love to cook, and having high quality knives is a must.  This set of 6 knives of various sizes is perfect for all my cutting and chopping needs.  It also comes with a knife sharpener to keep those blades at their sharpest.  The blades are well made and very sharp, while the handles are comfortable in my hand, allowing me to chop and cuts large amounts of food without my hand tiring or cramping.

"When looking for attractive and protective cases for my new iPhone 6 Plus, this one offered by ZeroChroma caught my eye.  I love the color, and the kickstand of the case.  The kickstand allows me to rotate my 360 degrees while watching videos, listening to music and playing games.  The case fits snugly on the phone and provides protection against impact.  While this is not a life proof case, it does offer decent protection for my phone.  The bright color is nice and attractive.  I'll be honest.  I like to change my cell phone cases with my wardrobe, and this is a great one to add to my collection.

"This Xtreme Bright X-99 LED Headlamp is perfect for so many things.  It's great for camping, hunting, fishing and also those projects around the house that require light and two free hands.  This headlamp recently came in very handy when my husband was working on the hot water heater.  It is located in a dark closet.  Normally, I would have had to stand there, over his shoulder, shining a flashlight in the area that he needed light.  Not this time. He put on the headlamp and was able to see perfectly without my help.  The light shines where he looks, so there is no problem with the light not being in the correct place.  He was able to work on the hot water heater without my assistance, and get us hot water again in a short amount of time.  The light fits securely and is adjustable.  The LED lamp produces a nice bright light.  I like that the light is waterproof and impact resistant, making it perfect for so many things.  The light runs on 3 AAA batteries, and didn't eat up the batteries nearly as quickly as I expected.  This is a perfect gift for my husband or anyone that can benefit from this hands free light.

They can be cleaned in our ultrasonic jewelry cleaner as well, which is a great plus to keep them clean and sanitize.

I loved themand wore out the nude one, ripping it in spots, and hating to throw it out, I seriously considered taking it to my seamstress to repair.

"I reorder many times.  When you first get the product, 'massage' the tube a bit to mix the contents as it may have settled.  When you squeeze a bit out it should be a flesh tinted color.

I squeeze enough out to do the entire eye, starting below the eye on the dark circles, and then using up what's on my fingers above the eye, lid and all.  I like it has a built-in SPF to protect the eye as most daycreams with SPF are not good to put on the eye area.  This product never causes any stinging or tearing.

"The temps are chilling down and now back to some comfort foods and turning on the oven.  I have a few other of Joanne's books and like her TV cooking shows.  I have tried several of her on-air recipes, the baked Semolina Gnocchi Alla Romano w/sage...to die for.  Having company in early Nov, I want to make that as a company side dish with sage, much growing in my garden...Fall is the season for sage.Here are some of my tagged pages in this new cookbook...(1) Mississippi Mud: a simple dessert that my 9 yr old g'daughter should love, and no eggs (she's allergic) so that is one for me to try. (2) Rhubarb Crostata (I have frozen cut up rhubarb from summer in my freezer I was going to use for jam, now I think it's got other plans!). I make my own pastas and pizzas and breads, and in this book there are several to try...(3) calzone with sausage, greens, and ricotta (and I will add shredded mozz, gotta have it) is one of them.  There's also several interesting homemade pastas such as (4) pepper fettuccine homemade pasta.  Another recipe calling my name is (5) Roasted Garlic and Gruyere Souffl, love garlic anything. There are several apps worth looking at (6) Roasted carrot hummus and (7) Crostini with artichokes and grape leaves.  I've seen bottled grape leaves sold in market but I didn't feel like making my own stuffed grape leaves with them; but this is another way to use them that is much easier.  Might buy some today in fact. I like making ice creams and sorbets and there's one in here (8) a Citrus Coconut Sorbet I will eventually try.  There's a (9) Panna Cotta using Greek Yogurt as well.  Probably the first savory recipe I will try is (10) the Spiced Chicken with Vinegar, looks easy.  I have just listed ten items,  but there is so much more.  The author and I seem not only to share the same name and similar spelling, but  a love for easy-to-prepare, tasty food with novel uses of easy-to-find ingredients that make it all the better.  When I cook for company, I like to make at least one unique recipe  (like the Gnocchi Romano w/sage that most people never have tried) or kohlrabi I made...something different.

"This is my second carpet shampooer. The Eureka Atlantis model I had for yrs , it worked fine, but this is more compact and yet as good as the larger one I had before. I am very pleased.  My husband attached the handle and when I first looked at it standing there, it looked small, especially in comparison to the one I had bc it was a beast--big, heavy, clunky... This one may be smaller, but it is mighty!  My older model also had only one hand tool, the upholstery brush.  This one has 3 attachments, a crevice tool and 2 small brushes for upholstery or spot cleaning.  I just did my entire L-shaped Jennifer Convertible sofa in the den which has a taupe faux suede fabric.  I never cleaned it before with a machine of any kind, just an occasional spot cleaning, but it was starting to look pretty nasty.  This brought it back to looking good again.  Considering the number of yrs I have owned the sofa and that we live in the den, watching TV everyday, often eat in there and snack in there, it was a valiant feat for this machine to handle.  It's easy to fill up the tanks and empty them.  I can't find anything bad to say about it.  This model is Bissell's lower-priced model, it's all the better.  Economical, works wonderfully, and easy to use.  I just ordered on Amazon a full-size container of Bissell cleaner to continue my shampooing frenzy. It's more economical to buy it on Amazon other than at Bed Bath & Beyond, and I don't have to drive anywhere to get it.  So check out all the various cleaning solutions Bissell gives you for this machine...one for pets, one with scent, etc...I got the deep cleaning one with Scotchguard to hopefully repel some future stains.

"I have two different sets for making Linzer Cookies, and this is the better one.  What makes it better is that to make all the cookies, top and bottom, you use only one side of the cutter for all cookies...then to create the center  'cut out', you go through half of the cookies using the raised side with the 'shape' of hearts, circle, etc... It has its advantages over my other set when cranking out cookies in the mass production line as these require two halves per cookie. And anything that moves things along quickly during the Christmas season is a help that I can appreciate.  This set also has 6 different shapes, my other set has four.  The price is about as fair as it gets for six molds--under $6 total.  It is also packaged very nicely which the illustration fails to show.

It has just the right amt of spicy kick, not over the top.  If I use the 1.5 oz bag of chips and half a can of this salsa, it keeps my diet under wraps.

"These molds snap tightly into the grooves so they stand erect and won't spill over the freshly poured contents.  Once frozen, which takes under 4 hrs, you can remove the pops from the base and lay them flat.  Some molds have interconnected molds, you can't remove just one, you have to handle all four or six at a time.  This is better.  I usually make ice cream by the tub, for scooping, but this is so much easier and faster.  I use a little recipe book I got as a gift on making different flavor ice pops, all easy, some even stupid easy, so you can whip these up a lot faster than you would with using an ice cream machine.

For 3 bottles under $20, you can't go wrong. The expiration date is two years from the date I received it, stamped on the bottle.  There is a piece of dried organic lemon peel floating in the jar, a nice touch, especially when gifting.  The bottle is glass. No allergens present, and sometimes even olive oils are unsafe with those with food allergies, I know, I have had to return some bc of that. This is also certified organic, produced in Italy...what more can you ask for at a cost of just over $6 a bottle? You won't find a better lemon olive oil at twice the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGD177WDM3GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DDBL5G#wasThisHelpful","R2TGD177WDM3GB","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a few cleansers I like using, and this is one of them. Tatcha which is high-end skincare and has a price to match it, has their version of this and I tried that first and liked it very much...then saw this one at less cost, and since I now have tried both, I see no difference in them other than price.  It has the same 'oil' application that when wet turns milky white and cleanses off dewy and not oily.  It goes a long way too. I like the application pump as well.  Nothing bad to say about it. Very good product. I also have to say that each time I check a price of skincare products at Amazon against the price I paid on QVC, I am saving money on Amazon. This product I got several times on QVC at a cost of $10 more when you factor in their shipping and tax.  Buy it here.  I also saved about $20 buying Dr. Perricone's MD PhotoPlasma SPF moisturizer, another great product, on Amazon over QVC's price.

"Sprouted blue corn tortilla chips are thin and crispy and taste like the ones you get in the Mexican restaurants.  I just bought a bag at the market to try them and love them, they cost $3.69, so for 12 bags at under $27, it's a good buy, almost half price.  The bag size is large, several people can enjoy one bag, don't let the 7.5 oz weight fool you; the bag size is large in itself, about 12"" high, not an individual portion, so it goes a long way. Low in sodium and 3 gr of fiber for each ounce (about 11 chips).  I am going on Subscribe and Save to keep these on hand.  I can salsas, and if I run low, I'll buy salsa just to have an excuse to eat these chips.

Yes, Wolfgang then had a digital setting PC using word settings preset to times; but I can use it for the newer version, you don't have to worry about 'rice' or 'fish' or 'veggie' settings anymore, so use this book for any electronic PC, just go by the time it cooks.  Same thing.  Someone was complaining about a 15 bean soup recipe being 'too store bought.' I love that recipe.  Beans are beans.  The company just mixes them up for you in advance, so if that's considered cheating, I'm in.  I still have to cook them. I cook from scratch too and this is a great soup.  Rinse them and dump them in, add canned tomato sauces along with the rest of pantry ingredients, it's the best, fastest soup I make on a wintry day.

"I think every cook should have a book like this, it's a primer.  Most every sauce you need is in here starting with the 'mother sauces' and more, dessert sauces too.  Recipes to help you use them once made.  The recipes are simple and easy to read, with care taken to font and white space on the page.  It's amazing how simple the fancy shmancy sauces we hear about are to make...bchamel, beurre blanc, and the rest of them. Easy peasy. I love anything with a sauce or gravy on top. This would make a great bridal shower gift, but everyone can use this bc it is so practical for weekday or company meals and desserts.  I even liked that there was a Caesar Salad dressing in here without egg yolks bc my g'daughter is allergic to eggs among other things.

"I found Michele Scicolone by a lucky accident, scanning my local newspaper yrs ago, there was a recipe printed from one of her earlier books to make Zeppole.  It is the real deal, I have never seen this recipe in any cookbook anywhere, nor on the many TV cooking shows, EVER.  It's my go to zeppole recipe, easy, fast, and is just like those you get at the pizza places that sell them.  The recipe was so stellar, I bought that book on that one recipe alone; then in that book, I found a Spumoni ice cream, just like the ones of yesteryear I remember as a little girl eating when going out with my parents to Italian restaurants for special occasions.  It is spot on.  You can't get Spumoni today at some of the most authentic Italian restaurants.  Based on that discovery, I bought this book too.  My only real objection to this cookbook is the TITLE.  It is ALL wrong.  It is not just about vegetables, it has chapters on soups, sides, pastas, risottos, etc., SOME of which use veggies, but not all.  I am fearful that most people will never have the pleasure of ever opeing this book bc of the misleading title alone.  Why they chose this title is truly a mystery.My first recipe was the Swiss Chard with Tomato and Garlic, straightforward and simple.  I made a baked slice butternut squash, but it was bland. I had to add a bit of sugar to brighten the taste.  I have a similar recipe that comes from a Lidia Bastianch cookbook that is to die for, so this one didn't measure up.  Then I went into the Dessert Section... the Polenta Berry Cake (no veggies!).  I love polenta and I always have it in my pantry.  It was easy, fast, and a great moist cake to even bring to someone's house.  I know 2 or 3 ways to make polenta, the usual way stirring in a pot, or a slow cooker, or even an oven. But she had a shortcut version of stovetop that saved some time stirring, it worked out very nicely!  I like learning new tricks.  I have other pages tagged, and will report back when I try them, but I had to give a preliminary shout out about this book to hopefully put it on your 'radar,' lest you dismiss it entirely; bc if the title is taken literally, and you like rice, grains, beans, fruits, etc., you might pass it up as 'just vegetables.'","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJVJ93IO9V3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547909160#wasThisHelpful","R3IJVJ93IO9V3V","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe I need more time to try more recipes, but this book is not a hit yet.  I tried the parsnips roasted, a non recipe recipe really, nothing wow.  I tried the chicken chili and wasn't thrilled.  The measurement of 4 cups of broth was all wrong and I knew it from the start bc I do cook a lot; so I cut back to only 2 cups, and that too was too much liquid. Too soupy and I had to now doctor it up in 5 mins that I had before serving it with a flour/broth slurry, which wasn't thick enough, so it still disappointing. My husband actually dug up a large slotted spoon to serve himself seconds bc it was that watery.  Chili needs to be thick and creamy.  So if you try this recipe, do NOT use 4 cups of broth, hold back to only one cup, if that.  This is not a minor error, it's huge.  I will try a few more recipes and report back and hope I can change my rating upwards.  The Chicken Chili in Ellie Kriegers book WEEKNIGHT WONDERS is great, made it several times, consistency great, and just as fast and easy to make.  I will stick with her recipe for chicken chili.  Her cookbooks stress light healthy eating too.  I hope I find some keepers in Bobby's book though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKM88YEHTGGBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177163#wasThisHelpful","RKM88YEHTGGBC","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this item but for one feature. The handle is too short and stubby. It needs to be longer.  When you are using this, the handle is so short, that when you apply the brush to whatever it is you are using it on, you can't see where you are putting the brush bc the handle is so low.  You have to almost tilt your head down and sideways to see UNDERNEATH the applicator. If the handle were a few inches taller, your grasp would allow you to tilt the brush with plenty of angle to see the brush in action.  It is the brush that you are looking at and using and applying, so your view of the brush and the placement of it is what makes this item work or not.  This is an annoying feature of this item...it could have been a home run, but the handle is too short and not user friendly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOR32AW8H9EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFT8VVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UOR32AW8H9EU","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this book as a gift in fall, and I used it to make peach pops with frozen peaches from our tree last August. It even uses the peel. It was simple but not sweet enough, so I would say, use common sense and taste it to decide if it needs more of 'this or that.' Use the recipes as a guide, and a very easy-to-use and follow guide it is.  I just made Raspberry-Mint pops today and it didn't need any extra sugar; surprisingly, it was sweeter than the peach pops.  WIth mint growing like crazy now in the garden, and the raspberries from our July pickin's last yr, these worked out well...trying to use up what's in the freezer.  Made the Fudge pops and Orange Creamsicles too, very good.  These recipes couldn't be simpler.  Next is the Chocolate-Banana.Other pluses for me are that most recipes are egg-free which I need bc my little granddaughter has allergies, so I am able to make these for all of us to enjoy.  I also appreciate it when recipes are given in a variety of measurements...this one gives grams, ozs, cups, you choose your preferred measurements.  It is SO much easier for me to whip out my digital scale and go by weight, especially with solid, fresh or frozen fruits.  Measuring by weight is so much more accurate and faster than putting berries in a cup and hope you have the right amount. Foolproof.  I give any cookbook HIGH marks if they do that, as it's one of my pet peeves when a book doesn't include all types of measurements to work with.The molds I had held only about 2 oz, good for making trial size pops, but now I find this book so good,  I just ordered the larger set of six 4oz molds. We want to want to make the pops adult size now.  Even though I do make a lot of churned ice creams, this has its place too bc it's faster and easier to throw together on a whim.  The pop molds that you put these concoctions into are small, so don't worry about a few of the recipes that use half n half or heavy cream.  It's barely going to register on the caloric chart.  That is another reason I like these recipes, even the ones with dairy...you can indulge a little without the guilt!  It's portion control this way, you eat far less calorically with a pop than you would of the same ice cream in a tub...we all know how we take extra scoops when we dip into that.So I say, go for it.  This is a good book to start or to add to other books you may have...the recipes are surprisingly easy and, more importantly, are very tasty!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEW32CWB0QS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616280107#wasThisHelpful","RXEW32CWB0QS3","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It will do for now.  I go thru oven thermometers like crazy, but then again I spend no more than $7 on each one...I just bought this one, and if nothing else, the numbers are BIG and I appreciate that.  It's totally useless if numbers can't be read even with your glasses on.  When I preheated to 375, I checked it to see it said about 300 or 325 degrees, but it was in the front right of center shelf.  I moved it to the back right of shelf, and after my lasagna was cooking the 30 mins, and I checked the thermometer, it registered 375 for sure.  I know that the moment an oven reaches its desired temp, it still gets hotter as it continues to bake, at the same temp.  WHen I make pizza, I preheat to 550.  WHen the oven signals it's ready, I wait another 20 mins preheating it, bc the oven will be really ready at that temp of 550 by then.  THis tells me that the immediate set temp of an oven is not the same temp it will be 30 mins later, despite the setting staying the same.  I can't fault the oven thermometer for that.  So if this one stays true as it has so far, then maybe my search for oven thermometers is over.  To attach it in oven, place the hook of the thermometer on any rung of any shelf, and pinch it slightly closed with your fingertips to assure it won't slip off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K30JSH97DUS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BPAIH4#wasThisHelpful","R3K30JSH97DUS7","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these for herbs yes, but now it also has a new purpose.  By accident, when I was opening a can of Mutti whole peeled tomatoes in a can, I went to grab a regular standard scissor from the drawer to cut them up and snip at them in the can, as I do, to make the tomatoes bite size.  I grabbed these by mistake bc they were in front, and I found they made short work of dicing whole tomatoes in the can.  Now I use them for this purpose all the time.  Just sayin'.

"I have been canning 1 1/2 yrs so I consider myself a beginner with one foot into intermediate.  I love these recipes both for their simplicity yet for their interesting combo of ingredients.  This explains it all with illustrations to guide the beginner in the craft of canning. Most recipes have photos.  I find it worth saying that when I buy a new canning book, I buy it for the recipes only and skip over the beginning bc I feel I know it already and ho hum.  But this book grabbed me so that I sat with my cup of coffee and read thru the beginning start up pages as if reading a prologue to some new novel.  I can't say anything negative about this book.  If I pushed myself, I'd say it seems more appropriate for the pressure canning recipes to have a section of their own instead of interspersing them in the section with watercanned vegetables...but like I say, I am nitpicking. The pages are laid out beautifully with many color photos of the finished product. There's enough white space so you don't need your Mr/Mrs Magoo eyeglasses to read it.  The headings/titles are big and bold and easy to see so you see at a glance what recipe is below it.  I never make marmalades bc to me right now they are too labor intensive, but this book had a 'strawberry lemon marmalade' which I dove into.  It was easy and a great way for me to test the waters. I made Honey Jelly, it set loose, so I am hoping it gels within a few weeks or else I will have honey syrup.  It didn't use lemon juice and sometimes  I think w/o acid, it does this.  I like also how each recipe states the size and number of jars needed, as many books do...but at the bottom it also mentions other sizes...4oz, 8oz, pints, etc...so you know you can have flexibility in how you portion it out.  As a beginner, I didn't know that and was too afraid to make any moves on my own for safety.  So even this little bit of info is something most books don't do.  So in short, good book and recipes, glad I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQJ5MUVT8UD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162710769X#wasThisHelpful","R3HQJ5MUVT8UD2","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The babyfood texture was totally uninteresting and we hated it....This brand is now my go to brand.  No need to go for 'instant' polenta either bc this only takes 15 mins on stovetop, not a big time investment. Just know that it sells for $3.99 in supermarkets if you can find it there.  I find it in a specialty Italian market called Uncle Giuseppe's...you have a gauge, going by that, of what's a fair price to pay.

The book appears fabulous with glossy, colorful illustrations, but the love stops there. The recipes list ingredients and measurements and so on, but never tells you how long to process the jars for safety!  This is crucial to know; it is unacceptable to proceed with any shelf canning w/o this knowledge.  Size of jars and the ingredients contained in those jars all determine various safe processing times.  How are we to know this if the recipe doesn't state this?  Dangerous.  Just a BIG opportunity missed.  These 'recipes' make huge portions too, most often eight 8oz jars.  That in itself wouldn't have mattered, recipes can be halved.  But considering you can't approach the recipe w/o the info of how long to cook it, you won't make it anyway, you shouldn't anyway, for safety's sake.  Home Preserving is the title, but don't be fooled.  It is not a 'how to' book.  It's a ""how not to"" book if you enjoy Russian Roulette games!  The non-Amazon seller where I got this book also charges restocking fees and won't refund your shipping. To make matters worse, you need to spend more money to send it back, and they didn't have the courtesy to send me a prepaid mailing envelope...if not for Amazon's direct intervention to help me out, I would have lost everything.. Without a 'sneak peak' into this book, I couldn't possibly know just how badly these recipes were written.  I ended up wasting my money and my time to remedy the return of this book.  I hope I can help someone else avoid the same fate.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOML36E9CSBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785828621#wasThisHelpful","R2MOML36E9CSBP","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Did my first test drive with this today.  Because of the learning curve, it took me a bit more time and effort to work through the steps properly as expected.  First, i read thru the manual and highlighted items i had questions on and I made a few phone calls to the helpline yesterday  Then I needed to make one more call today before canning, and the woman there called me back with a clarification I needed and that she didn't even know herself.  This is so new we're all learning together.  I believe that those who write 'user manuals' should not be let loose sometimes; bc if you leave certain tidbits out, it creates questions...that being said, here goes:  The advantage to this unit over their autocanner is that it holds large capacity of jars (12) 8 oz jars, (8) pint jars and (7) quart jars.  I have the Ball autocanner too, love that, but that unit holds 6, 4, and 3 jars respectively.  You are more limited in recipes with the autocanner, altho' I have figured out to make almost anything in it, but I digress.  In this watercanner, you can preserve anything at all, without question--home recipes or from whatever canning book you have.  You turn it on and set a timer as usual.  You let it rest 5 mins in the pot as usual.  This also can be used on countertop to free up your rangetop to make potsful of what you're going to fill up the watercanner with.  It should be near a sink so you are not lugging it too far to empty it out with the spigot.  This unit is a multicooker, it steams and you can cook foods/soups in it, etc... This would make a good pot for lobsters or seafood boils.  If you do not care to make larger quantities of preserves, you probably don't need this. I for one didn't NEED this either, but I don't play tennis or golf.  This is MY hobby so I look at it that way.  If you want to do just 3 or 4 jelly jars, or 2 or 3 pint jars in this, you certainly can do fewer jars and not just the entire full capacity. In using this unit for canning, you only use the part of the dial where the green is and ignore anything else.  You basically dial it all the way to the right, point the dial to ""canning"" to preheat jars (one piece of info the manual left out) and to preserve.  You can also use 4 oz jars and 12 oz jars (the manual didn't mention that either)...so any size jar that fits with space around each one for heat circulation and a 1 to 2 inch water level above it, just like stovetop preserving, is good....you do NOT have to preheat lids or rims (also not mentioned in manual).  I made 6 pints of carrots today, 3 jars with spears, made spicy, and 3 jars of carrot 'coins' with dill seasoning. Each jar sealed and popped almost immediately upon removing them from the pot. You can use your own jar rack in this, but they say it must be set on top of the one included though.  I will do that as mine has circular 'grooves' to hold the bottom of jars more securely in place than the one included.  So basically, today I made 2 small batches, 3 pints each, of 2 different carrot recipes.  I deliberately made the batches small so I could practice twice with it.  You can reuse the water with each new round of canning you do, one after the other; so no need to dump water out and waste it.This sells for $150, but I bought this on sale at Cooking.com at about 15% off, no shipping; so you might want to wait for their sale or for Amazon's price to come down a bit.I will write more as I experiment more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27FJ664RALL3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLLS2MI#wasThisHelpful","R27FJ664RALL3U","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a staple for me.  I have a simple recipe using this ingredient as a rub for steaks, it is out of this world good.  It is mixed with spices such as red and black pepper, brown sugar, garlic powder, etc., fresh chopped garlic, and then made into a thick paste to 'smear' over one side of a steak when grilling or frying.  It adds so much flavor. I mix up a dry batch and always have it in my fridge.  Then when I want to make the paste, I just add some oil to make it like wet sand, and spread it over the beef.

"I just made savory crepes using Pasta Flour (3 flour blend) bc this is my pasta substitute; and it worked very well.  Nothing was sticking.  I poured a little extra-light olive oil on a paper towel and swiped the pan before each crepe.  I could have used butter, but since this was for pasta, I used oil.  This pan comes with basic instructions, do not use spray oils, and do not use too-high heat, do not cut inside the pan, all common sense warnings.  I layered wax paper between each cooked crepe, put them in a ziplock bag, and froze them. The pan made a decent-sized 8"" crepe, good for stuffing with cheeses or meats for cannelloni.  I used 1/4 cup batter for each crepe.  I like the very low-sloped sides allowing easy maneuverability to get under the crepe to flip it.  I used a medium-high gas flame at first bc I found that browned the crepe adequately.  The first side of crepe you cook about a minute, then the other side 20 seconds or so.. Once you do about 4 crepes, the pan is hot enough to turn down the flame to medium-low.  Tomorrow I am going to try my egg-free chocolate crepe recipe.  I put a sticky-note on the pan when I put it away saying ""Use for crepes only!""  I don't want anyone abusing this pan using it for anything other than crepes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XI2UM4V4BSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GYUR5S#wasThisHelpful","R32XI2UM4V4BSJ","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are Italian or Italian-American, you will particularly like this book.  It has some of the harder-to-find desserts found in this culture.  It's a hardbound, weighty, and  impressive book.

"What a fantastic book!  I bought this for my DIL for a C'mas gift bc she is the pie maker in the family.  I decided on this one when seeing only ALL 5-star reviews.  One review said there was a pic for each recipe, I liked that a lot, so I dove in and bought it.  As I gingerly leafed thru the pages, I was further enchanted.  I am buying this book for me, myself and I.  Mind you, I am a cook, I prefer savory things to eat and make, I rarely bake or make pies--only on special occasions and major holidays.  I am someone who has dozens of books on bread baking, canning and preserving, Mexican, Italian, Indian cooking, you name it, but not ONE pie book.  However, this pie book made me see religion...you will be converted, too.  I saw a recipe for Old-fashioned Buttermilk Pie in here, I needed to find a way to use my buttermilk in fridge, so I used the recipe in this book (copying the page lest I splash the one I am gifting).  I had another buttermilk pie recipe in one of my dedicated 'buttermilk' books, but I passed that one up for this one.  This one was easier.  It needs no electric mixers.  Mix the ingredients in a bowl by hand, pour into a pie shell (I had a store-bought frozen one), and bake.  So yummy with a dollop of whipped cream.  I am sold!Another thing I was impressed by is that many of the recipes don't need eggs. My little g'daughter is allergic to, among other things, eggs.  There are so many lovely choices w/o eggs, traditional and otherwise. I like the short list of ingredients and process steps, I also appreciate the ""white space"" around the print making it easier to read w/o a lot of 'clutter.'  And it can't be said enough, every single recipe has a picture with it, to entice you further. There is one disappointment in that the measurements don't use both cups/ozs./grams.  I like to measure flour by weight so it is consistent each time I make it.  So I had to resort to noting it the first time I made it, jot it down on the page, and move on.  Another reason where weight measurements would have helped is the Marshmallow Pie.  It said use 30 large marshmallows.  Ok, I can count to 30.  But I had a partial bag of large marshmallows and a partial bag of small ones...they had to be melted anyway, so I wanted to use both sizes for the pie; and of course, I have no idea how many little marshmallows equal a large one...if the weight were there, I could just dump them all in a bowl and weigh it.  So I will make that pie one day and jot down my weight measurement, assuming it turns out good enough to make again. Despite this one letdown in the book, I love the book.UPDATE--Valentine's Day, 2015.  I made the Cranberry Cherry pie and it is waiting for after dinner.  I will report back then.  It looks good!Dec 4, 2014: CAUTION: ONE CAVEAT...I am baking the Union Pie as I type this. While prepping it, I noticed there is an error in recipe.  The list of ingredients shows 1/2 cup sugar, but the directions never mention this ingredient whatsoever.  So using my limited knowledge, I added the sugar to the 'wet' ingredients and just assumed the proofreading went awry and it was meant to be in the pie.  I hope there are not other snafus in other recipes.Dec 5, 2014: The Union Pie according to my husband was good, but I liked the Old Fashioned Buttermilk Pie better. I would also suggest that the Union pie be done in a tart pan, not a pie pan, bc it didn't fill it up my 9"" pie shell adequately from the get go, didn't reach the top of it; and then when it sat to cool, it deflated even further looking sad. More pies to follow, will report back.Dec 22, 2014: Made the savory chicken pot pie, I cheated and used store-bought roll-out pie crust bc the holidays made me pressed on time; but the recipe for the filling I followed and it was good, and the creamy base which is the most important part worked well...I just needed to add more broth than is called for, but that is typical.  Room to tweak it.  I added some poultry seasoning bc I always add that to pot pies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VM0PCTJXKATI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310335566#wasThisHelpful","R1VM0PCTJXKATI","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a wonderful find. I bought this on a Spanish food website and the cost of the product with shipping would have been close to $30.  With Prime, this product is much less money.  The expiration date was August of 2016, two years from now, so I decided since it lasts so long, to order another package of 10 at Amazon!  Each packet is sealed and fresh until you open it.  I like it better than buying and using an open bottle of saffron threads.  In addition, I like to share my food finds with family and special friends, and the packets allow me to do that.  This saffron infuses into liquids so quickly, as if it were powder, and gave a deep yellow color to my savory rice cake dish. One packet was plenty for the 1 1/2 cups of rice I cooked in 3 cups of water. Had I known the intensity, I would have used HALF a packet, thereby making this product last even longer!

"Bought this on sale at WmsSonoma, it was next to M. Symon's other book, CARNIVORE, which I knew I would not want. I am a meat eater, but I don't want to overindulge in carnivorous meals.  This book was lighter fare, and altho' you will find some recipes using sausage, chorizo, and even bologna, there are other options that are lighter...like steamed mussels in white wine, salmon, shrimp of several varieties, and I like that several of his meals include canned or fresh tomatoes, I always have them handy as I have tomato sauce running thru my veins. There are many colored pics of the recipes.  He uses pork tenderloin a lot, the lean pork. He uses boneless chicken thighs WITH skin, but I always take the skin off, even if ""Symon says"" to keep the skin on.  His Chicken Milanese is really a Skillet Chicken parm, sounds fast and easy. You can always tweak a recipe to your liking here and there. I never expect a cookbook to satisfy me 100%, that is impossible. I don't get militant if there are some downright unappealing' recipes as deemed by my own personal preferences of course...one woman's unappealing is another's stupendous.  It is in that vein that I try to be accepting of a cookbooks plus and minuses, I embrace the good in it.  It's a hobby to enjoy and not get flustered over.  I think my fave chapter in this book is ""Man with a pan"" implying simple easy meals, sorry guys... but no matter female or male, they appealed in great part to me too bc the offerings are simple and fast and look very tasty.  I tagged many pages in that chapter alone.  The chapter on desserts is really scaled down to just the 'sauces' that go over vanilla ice cream.  You will not have ice cream recipes in here, only the toppings, and the toppings seem awfully yummy to me...chocolate chili, bananas foster sans rum so the kids can have it too, cherries in sauce, etc., I find them appealing.  So yes the dessert chapter is limiting in the respect that the toppings are the star, not the ice cream, but so be it.  I have my ice cream books, I don't need more from this book.  The toppings are just as interesting and something that expands my dessert repetoire.  So with an open mind I'd say check the book out especially if you get it at a good, low price as I did.I will update when I make some of the recipes I have tagged.  I will probably start with the easiest one, skirt steak with parsley (chimichurri) sauce, bc I have a lot of parsley in garden that needs to be used up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRB36765W3Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770434320#wasThisHelpful","R2YRB36765W3Z2","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only thing not in here are pickling recipes and tomato sauces/salsas.  This does not address pressure canning, just waterbath canning. This is a book that uses 99% fruit as the main ingredient, some recipes use onion, beets, etc., but they are in the minority.This book has the tried-and-true recipes and many novel and innovative ones...there is a chapter of ""savory jellies"" which use libations such as rum, Campari, wines, tequila, as well as others using teas for instance. There are not pictures galore, but the interesting recipes and ease of making them with few ingredients and easy-to-follow steps make it just fine by me.  Recipes are mostly for half-pint jars, but allowances are given for the smaller, 4 oz ones too, and of course, you can halve many of the larger quantities of recipes if you want less. I find sometimes the lemon juice (acid) added to some jams/jellies is insufficient and comes out softer set than I like. So Ii tend to increase it more myself.  Other than that, it is a great book. I made ""Campari with a twist"" jam and Strawberry Margarita jam, both came out great using liquid pectin. The Sangria jam also used liquid pectin but it set soft. I don't know if it will firm up as they sometimes say it will, so I will wait a while and if not, that one was not the greatest.  This is one reason I always make a half recipe of a new recipe 'just in case.' There are many watermelon recipes, the plain watermelon jam and the watermelon raspberry jam were great. There are recipes for fruit butters, chutneys, conserves, marmalades, jams, and jellies...some of the more unusual, chocolate raspberry, banana, kiwi, prickly pear, quince, plumcot, and more.  Then there's a chapter on ""micro-mini"" jams which are very small batches of jam, cooked in the microwave.  Then another chapter on Special Jams, spreads, and mincemeats--no-cook, light no-cook, no-sugar, low-sugar, etc.. It ends with recipes to use your creations.  This book is a treasure trove of information and recipes, even a specific piece of info regarding liquid pectin brands that I wasn't aware of and how it determines your process of making the preserve in the first place. I hope to make something in the next few days when time allows. I will update more as I go along.UPDATE:  Made the Strawberry Cantaloupe Jam, (used raspberries bc I had them frozen from my summer bounty)...set well, easy, tasty. I made Kiwi Jam, worked great. Made Orange Mango Jam and Tropical Tango Spread, tasty.  The Tropical Tango Spread was looser, and I believe that is why it is called ""spread.""  I tried the Tequila Sunrise Jelly, but that didn't gel at all.  It was a syrup. So I will use it as that, adding it to seltzers. But I won't make it again. Made Mojito Jelly using up the mint running wild in the garden, along with lime juice and rum. Bits of mint float suspended in jelly, tastes just like the summer drink, one of my faves!  It also gives on the same page, ways to change it up making it Mexican Mojito (w/tequila) and Mint Julep Mojito (w/bourbon).  Made the Rosemary Apple Cider Jelly, set well, and it uses a little sprig of rosemary inserted in jars for visual effect. Made Garlic Jelly, yes, garlic jelly, so easy.  Uses your choice of liquid--apple juice, white wine, or water. I used white wine. THen you use either cider or white wine vinegar, I used the latter.  Add some sugar and pectin, done.  The chopped garlic pieces suspend nicely, even right after processing, which is often worrisome bc particles tend to float to the top until it gels.  Anyway, it's used for deglazing pans for gravy and other meat condiments.  You can add a little sprig of rosemary to jar too, which I love to do.  I am on a roll lately, a jelly roll I guess you could say!  Off to the store today to stock up on more jars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXZPAYDVL26P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CDUNSY#wasThisHelpful","R2IXZPAYDVL26P","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zero stars....I had this only 2 weeks; one day I opened the freezer and it showed -40 degrees, and of course, I knew that made no sense. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the entire inside strip of the thermometer split in two, rendering it useless.  So in short, it shattered inside the freezer, duh...this is where it was supposed to be at home, in a freezer. I have heard of the expression 'couldn't take the heat', but this piece of junk couldn't take the take the freezing COLD.  I threw away the receipt when I got it figuring no problem would arise, and certainly not so soon. I have purchased other refrigerator/freezer thermometers and never had issues before, so I assumed the same was true again...WRONG! I am appreciative that Amazon refunded me w/o a hassle. Now I can buy another brand freezer thermometer and recommend you do too!","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPK41FBZY067G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LLJYC4#wasThisHelpful","RPK41FBZY067G","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started out using Domino Light and now in stores it's practically impossible to find, so I use this brand now. It's just as good.  D. LIght had 32 ozs, this one has 24 ozs, otherwise a similarly good replacement.  I have found this on sale in supermarkets for about $6, give or take; so this price, $12 and change for two, is fair.  I don't use it for baking but I would if I baked!  I use it mainly in my multiple morning cups of coffee.  It has NO aftertaste to me, probably bc it has some sugar in it.  I feel better taking this bc it contains Stevia.  Since so much bad press is out there about Splenda, I don't use Splenda anymore.

"I bought this a yr ago and put it aside bc it seemed inferior to the other pans I had; the others were heavier and had perforated holes and brand names.  But I decided to use this pan the other day bc i needed a larger 16"" pizza, and now I love it.  I love the flat shape, I HATE pans with the rolled up edges, HATE it with a passion, bc when you oil the pan and stretch the dough on a pan like that, the dough keeps sliding down so you lose at least an inch of diameter. If you use a 16"" pan of a ROLLED edge pan, you're lucky if it is 14 to 15 inches when you're done. This one is totally FLAT, so you can push and stretch the dough to the very end of the pan utilizing the entire surface area and it stays put.  You still have to oil the pan well, but now it won't slide back on you.  I am into this pan and plan to buy one for my son and his wife! I make my own homemade pizza doughs, at least 2x a month, I cook them in oven in cooler months and outdoors directly on the BBQ grill with the pans, they stand up to the heat w/o warping.  The 16"" size is the maximum size I can fit into the oven, or else I'd buy even a bigger pan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8UQSJLC89CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OZ9WKQ#wasThisHelpful","R3G8UQSJLC89CO","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Taste is a personal matter I suppose. I liked the Keurig Kona when it was offered, so I tried one box of this Kona to see if it's one I would take to. I don't like it as much as the Kona I remember, that's all I can say.  It has a bitter or burnt afternote to me, one that I do not care for. I am one for Tully's Italian and Starbucks Verona and the Sumatra coffee beans, they all taste smooth to me and not bitter at all.  Yes, this doesn't seem like a medium roast, more toward a dark roast to me, but I like dark roast bc I put dairy in my coffee...so it's not that that I am concerned about, it's the taste in general.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GMD4AK59BNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPEK43G#wasThisHelpful","R17GMD4AK59BNC","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this for a friend and loved it so much I bought myself one. I have another book on tagine cooking, but this one looked too good to pass up--especially for the price. If you are new to this type of cuisine, I would try this one... not a million ingredients needed and very approachable recipes...meat, seafood, and vegetarian. A previous review complained of the use of cooked fruit...this is a very common ingredient in Morocco, dried apricots, raisins, etc., are prevalent. I don't like that much fruit in my savory meals either, so I simply use it sparingly. Another review stated they wished there were more vegetarian recipes, I found there to be quite a lot!  And those with meat can be made w/o the meat. In fact, some of the recipes in front of book using lamb, I will substitute chicken or beef bc I am not a fan of lamb. You still get the different spice mixes and blends to make each of those recipes different than another. Recipes can always be tweaked. These are no exception. Cooking is not an exact science like baking is, so make it your own. It shouldn't hold one back from seeing the good that this book offers.  There's a color pic of each recipe too, which I love!  It has fewer recipes than other books, but it's also half the price of other books.  So I think to be fair, you have to look at all the pros and cons, and for the money, this is a good book to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IF11WXWWS5ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1845974794#wasThisHelpful","R3IF11WXWWS5ZT","A3UCN2RGY7O6S1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UCN2RGY7O6S1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a pair of over the ear headphones of the same brand which are fantastic and built well. I saw these and was curious what the little caps would do and how well these would fit. I've never really cared for in ear buds as I've always had trouble keeping them in, especially if I'm moving about or working out.This company seems to strive for solid, well built equipment. These have the same quality as the set of headphones I have.They come with several sizes of tips. I found the smallest set worked the best for me and the best to keep them in my ear. These are metal and as expected they are heavier than most plastic earbuds. And since they are long they tend to hang out more and didn't always stay in for me. If I sit still they aren't bad for relaxing and listening to music.Sound is fantastic! Very clear, no hissing or other noticeable disturbances. They sound solid. There are three end caps that affect the sound and are labeled as black for Pop, titanium for Jazz and silver for Classic. For my ears the titanium/Jazz had more bass with the silver being the highest sounding with lighter base.  I think once you put on the ones that sound best to you they will stay. It's a bit much to count on them to switch sounds when desired.They work well with my iPod. There is a switch on the cord for Play and Pause.Overall, they are a great sounding set of earbuds and fit just as well if not better than a lot of other earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P59XM1RBB70R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176XTF4A#wasThisHelpful","R2P59XM1RBB70R","A3T7V207KRDE2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7V207KRDE2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price and what little I currently need one for this is a great little welder.You have variable control over the wire feed but only two voltage settings. I've mainly tried 1/8 inch steel.

"I prefer on-ear/over the ear headphones. For me they say on and I don't have to worry about them falling out and having to reset them in my ears.I have a few sets ranging from these at $17 retail to a set of Bose at $300. For the price these are a great set of headphones.They fit well if you like them hugging your ears. I notice they are there but they aren't uncomfortable or painful like some can be.They adjust to length and swivel at the ear pieces to get a good fit.The cord length works great. I can plug them into my MacBook at my desk but also my iPad on my and without too much excess.They look great all white. I have to wonder how long they will hold up before they start showing any markings or get that soiled look.But the important thing is that they sound great!

"Ive been using different types of security/network cameras for several years including those like this one where all of the cameras connect to a DVR. I also have several stand alone wireless cameras that upload photos and video to a Windows server. I prefer wireless cameras for their ease of installation, better software and control. The benefit of these DVR systems is that multiple cameras feed into one central box where they are all setup and controlled from. The hardest part of a wired DVR system is installing cables all around your house or business.It is a good idea to test the unit with a cable and camera connected to it before you go to the trouble of installing everythingFirst, you have to figure out where all of the cameras will be placed and where the DVR will be centrally located so that all of the camera cables can reach it. Eight 60 foot cables are included with this system. Keep in mind 60 feet can go quick when you have turns and walls to go down, etc.Next is stringing the cable. I laid mine up in the attic and out to the eaves for the outdoor cameras. Even though they are outdoor cameras drops of rain can give you a spotty image so I keep them dry. And even though they come with hoods the wind can blow the rain past them. Crawling out to the narrow edges of the roof is not a lot of fun, installation is a lot of work.The hard part is behind you (sort of) and now you connect all of the cameras at one end of each cable and the other ends of the cables connect to the DVR. I connected the DVR to a monitor and followed the simple steps to get the initial IP address. Then I tried connection from my MacBook and this is when the trouble starts.I have no idea why they dont certify their software. Even Avast Anti Virus software warns you about installing it. The problem is for both Windows and Mac the default settings of your computer security will not allow the plugin to be installed. You have to unsecure your computer to get it to install and run.I have a Windows 7 computer that does not have critical information on it which I was able to get the plugin to work. What I usually do with these systems is change the admin name and password (cant change the name on this one however), IP address and port number, date and all the camera settings, etc.The software is not great. I changed the admin password and it told me there was an error. When I changed pages it said I needed to save changes even though I had clicked OK. When I went to re-login apparently the new password did save. Navigation has improved over the years but still not on par with todays software.Their support website isnt any better. Images and links are broken and theres not a lot of information. They just dont put a lot into these systems. There are several brands out there but youll find the hardware all looks the same. Its the software that is different but none do a great job.These cameras are twice the size of my older Q-See system. They are better, wide angle, covering a good area and night vision works. While these are supposedly HD face recognition is still only about 20 feet.The beauty behind these systems is that they record on a hard drive and after time when it gets full it automatically writes over old video. You dont need to do anything unless you need to check to see if something was recorded. And you can check them remotely from anywhere in the world. I do recommend checking periodically to make sure there are recordings as anything can fail. To check my systems remotely I use IP Cam Viewer on my iOS devices  excellent, lots of features and easy to add cameras.Overall this is slightly improved over the QSee DVR Ive had for several years. But they still do not get their software certified. Its not great software, buggy and can be a pain to install. For what you get these are just too expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15G5TW1JO7VZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SGC7UQ#wasThisHelpful","R15G5TW1JO7VZZ","A3T7V207KRDE2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7V207KRDE2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice bag but there are a few things that could use improvement to make it my favorite bag.The size is great. In fact, just about perfect. My Nikon D810 with the 18-300 zoom lens including hood fit into the padded insert with room to spare.The cloth is thin and doesn't have a lot of support, it's a bit floppy. I haven't tried running water over it but the openings aren't sealed for waterproof anyway.I wish the flap and end pocket were secured with velcro instead of buckles and buttons. Buttons and buckles just aren't as efficient as Velcro.The front pocket, again with the light cloth, only has one zipper clasp. The problem is it zips down the sides too. So you have to unzip it completely to get into it but because it unzips down the sides it flops over so you really can't fill it, stuff will fall out. But I do like the pocket and would love it if it had a dual zipper or just opened at the top.It would have been nice to have a little pocket on the flap for easy access to wallet or keys, etc. As it is its just a flap.The end pockets aren't that big and the flap is not tight. Extra batteries or other accessories could fall out even closed. But it's really not big enough for a water bottle either.I like the little pocket inside even though it sits behind the padding for the camera.Overall, I like this style of bag for casual walking around photography. But there is room for improvement.I received a promotional discount for this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3LKF2Z0A5RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OIWQA6#wasThisHelpful","R2K3LKF2Z0A5RE","A3T7V207KRDE2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7V207KRDE2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great cable manager designed for 19"" racks. The holes are 18"" on center which was a little bit of a problem for me. I actually have a room where I keep my servers, routers and other equipment in so there are a lot of cables coming in which I tied to eye bolts screwed into a board.  Since this isn't stud spacing I screwed this to the board attached to the studs. It works great! Run the cables through or drop them down where needed and no need to tie them. It has a door in the front that can either open up or down. But the pieces that double as hinges and connections are a bit loose and can be a pain to close this up as they can easily come off. But once it's setup the cables stay organize and will be easy to move if necessary. Very sturdy even though it extends from the wall. Great way to organize all of those cable!

"We've used Brita filters/pitchers for years, decades. They only remove some chemicals and metals not bacteria or living microorganisms. But we do love the taste over what directly comes out of the faucet, which isn't all that bad in our area.One thing we've never liked is they weren't dishwasher safe and still aren't after all these years.This new design has a tube in the lid that sits over the filter. No idea why. It still fills the top but slower than our previous model.The timer died quickly on our previous model. Not even sure if this one is working. Held the required 5 seconds, it blinked but nothing else says OK like a solid green light or something. So I mark the calendar to change it when the time is up.The pieces fit snug which actually makes them difficult to take apart. Not sure why they need to be that snug, it's not air tight to begin with.One good thing is the flip up lid is held on better.

"Update: I had uninstalled the display drivers required to use external monitors and reinstalled them to try again. I don't know if they updated the drivers but both monitors now work at 1920 x 1080.The Apple icon is still missing, however.----------------------------------------------------------------The description said you could hook up two monitors to a Windows or Mac laptop. I was excited because I have an Elgato dock that you can't hook up two monitors to but it is connected via the Thunberbolt port. This one connects via USB.  Two monitors work but you may have to restart several times.I have two identical ViewSonic monitors. Unfortunately through this dock I can only go up to 1600 through the DVI connection. Directly connected to my MacBook it will go up to 1920. HDMI works fine.The Apple icon is missing off of the menu bar on the external monitors.You have to install their drivers.No Thunderbolt. I have two devices that connect via Thunderbolt. With this dock I have to have 3 connections to my MacBook (including the dock on USB). With the Elgato dock I only have need two connections: one of the monitors (can't run two through the Elgato dock) and the Thunderbolt to connect the Elgato.This has more USB connections: 4 USB 2, 2 USB 3. The Elgato has 3 USB 3 ports.This stands up, the Elgato sits flat. This one is easier to get to and takes less space.The Trendnet has a wider usage over USB. It can be used with Windows or Mac. But it also has two problems so I can't even use it. I will update if those get resolved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPN8ZXOUGPUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L49XDK0#wasThisHelpful","R1DPN8ZXOUGPUL","A3T7V207KRDE2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7V207KRDE2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First I opened the package and and tried to pull the vacuum out with the canister handle and the canister ripped off. Didn't break but it makes you wonder how well it will work as just a canister. Then I got it all out and started to put it together. I noticed a lot of issues:- carpet cleaner is about three quarters size of our old Kenmore- lots of attachments but they can drop off especially with the cord flopping around- most of the weight is on the handle which a lot of people won't like, could be tiring- a lot of plastic which could give it a short life- more cleaning: empty the dirt instead of throwing away a bag, occasional washing requiredBut does it clean! You can literally watch the dirt being sucked up. We had just vacuumed with our Kenmore and thought the carpet was clean - ouch!I also like how it ""steers"", just tilt the vac and it's easy to change directions.The canister does come off but it doesn't have wheels and might be a bit too heavy for most people to hold and carry around.Lots of attachments that work well. Ours came with extension wand, 3 in 1 pivoting brush with 3 different heads, crevice tool, turbo tool and pet hair tool. All are stored on the vac.

"I struggle to review cologne because I have trouble putting into words what I like about it. I do really like this scent, and so do those around me.This is a nice, clean, and masculine scent, that is woodsy with hints of fruit and vanilla. At first it struck me as a little too fruity, and it smelled a little feminine. However, after wearing it for a few minutes I came to appreciate it as more masculine.The main thing I like about this cologne is how strong it is, and how long it lasts. I currently use Inner Realm as my main cologne. I love its smell, but it doesn't seem to last very long. I have to reapply by the afternoon on an average workday if I want the scent to linger. Eternity Now definitely lasts and lingers! In fact, I am smelling it on my clothes right now, the morning after I wore it, as if no time had passed since yesterday.My main issue is the price. I know it is Calvin Klein, and it's going to be more expensive. However, I don't like the cologne enough to pay the higher price. That is why I gave it four stars. For guys who don't mind paying a higher price, by all means, this is a five star product for you.Overall, I like it, and will wear it regularly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUTE0G1DP5O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QWST3I#wasThisHelpful","R3BUTE0G1DP5O9","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking Vitamin D for many years, since I read about its many benefits. While the RDA is 400 IU, many experts suggest we need more like 2000-5000 IU per day, especially if we don't get much summer sunshine exposure.This is a high dose softgel of Vitamin D. At 5000 IU, it is pretty much the strongest dose you'll find readily available over the counter.It contains the preferable form of Vitamin D, D3, and since it is already in softgel form, you don't have to worry about eating some fat with the pill (Vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed).One thing to keep in mind is that there are possible side effects of too much Vitamin D. I have read studies that suggest possible calcium deposits forming in the brain from too much Vitamin D. I believe in supplementing with Vitamin D, but you can still get too much of a good thing. Since I get a lot of sun in the summer, I tend to only take Vitamin D in the winter months when in my area it can't be made from sunshine exposure (October-the end of March). So just be aware that this is a pretty high dose.In terms of price, this product also contains a lot of pills for a great price.Overall, if you are looking for good Vitamin D for a fair price, this is a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUM0T3P9Y72E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JV4934#wasThisHelpful","RUM0T3P9Y72E4","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cats like this fountain. They immediately took to using it, and even seem fascinated by it to the point of standing around and watching it, even when they aren't thirsty.It was fairly quick and easy to assemble. It required running the filter through some cold water, and basically filling up the basin and tank with water (and plugging it in).The unit holds quite a bit of water for our two cats and doesn't seem to need to be refilled often. It filters the water with a charcoal filter. Honestly, I won't be replacing that filter in the future, but instead will continue using filtered water from my pitcher. It is cheaper that way.I turn off the fountain at night and when I am gone, to save electricity and because I worry about any sort of fire hazard. They drink out of it either way (since really they don't have a choice of other water options!).The main drawback for me is the price. This is fancy, but a plain old water dish has kept my cats alive and healthy for the last five years so this type of water dish isn't necessary, but they do seem to like it.

"This is an interesting product that combines cranberry extract with some other nutrients and herbs that may help prevent and treat urinary tract infections, as well as enhance the antioxidant benefits of cranberry. These include Lingonberry (a relative of cranberry) and Bromelain (a protein digesting enzyme).The one thing I don't like about this product is that it doesn't really specify the strength of the cranberry extract, or even the amount of extract. There is a lot of variety of extracts out there, some strong, others weak. I would like to know what I am getting, especially for this price, which is a little higher than other places. The fact that the ingredients are listed as a ""urinary support blend"" without actual amounts of products within that ""blend"" means you aren't sure what you are getting of each ingredient.It also contains dl-alpha tocopherol, the cheapest, least effective form of vitamin E available (d-alpha is the most effective).

My family all thinks they taste really great. In fact they are very addictive.The taste is somewhat sweet, but not too much so. The bites have a nice slightly chewy texture that I expect from beef jerky.And their addictive nature is why I am only giving this four stars, because they are extremely expensive.

"I have taken enzymes for almost twenty years, with each meal, and I am always looking for a decent formula.This is a vegetarian enzyme blend, containing a wide spectrum of digestive enzymes, which will (theoretically) digest fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Because of this, it can possibly improve digestion and help with digestive problems.Enzymes are typically measured in activity as opposed to weight, so the strange units on the label provide the strength of their digesting capability. According to author Tom Bohagar who wrote Everything You Need To Know About Enzymes (who owns an enzyme company), under controlled conditions, 1000 HUT of protease will digest 11.25 grams of dairy protein. 1000 DU of amylase will digest about 3.33 grams of potato starch, and 1000 FIP of lipase will digest 5 grams of vegetable oil.This formula contains ample amounts of protein digesting enzymes, which will digest protein in a variety of settings with variable pH values (since the stomach is acidic, and the intestines are alkaline). Like most formulas of its kind, it seems low in lipase (a fat digesting enzyme), based on the figures I just mentioned.It also contains some lactase, which should help break down lactose. However, this wont have a huge effect since the amount isnt very high compared to supplements sold specifically to digest milk. So if you are lactose intolerant, you will need more than just this formula.This is a good vegetarian formula. My only complaint is that for non-vegetarians, it does lack enzymes that I consider beneficial, such as pancreatin (which is derived from animal pancreases).A minor complaint is that it lacks bromelain and papain, both vegetarian. I am not sure why it isnt included, but as a part of an overall enzyme formula, those two are important.The price is all right. Enzymes are usually a little pricey, and this formula is no exception.Overall, this is a standard vegetarian enzyme formula, with a fairly decent price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2T562ZGVOC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R3J2T562ZGVOC2","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I regularly used mid-priced photo editing programs to edit photos for multiple websites and for use in my books. While I dont do a lot of advanced layer editing and photo manipulation (such as cropping out a person and placing them into a new background), I do need a program that can easily and quickly correct color and lighting issues and make a photo look more exciting through different filters and effects.I own quite a few photo editing programs, including Serif's PhotoPlus X7  and Corel PaintShop Pro X6. Honestly, those two are very similar in their layout. This program is laid out differently, and took a little getting used to. That said, I think it is actually a better layout overall, and is much easier to navigate.This is a pretty powerful program that is also user-friendly. Like most similarly priced programs, it offers a wide array of essential features and adjustments, like Levels, Curves, White Balance, RAW support, hue/saturation, layer editing, red eye correction, noise removal/addition, cropping, text, lens corrections, and so forth.  It runs quickly and smoothly on my computer, with Windows 10.Some of what I like specifically about this program:- The HDR features are cool. You can not only create true HDR photos (by merging multiple images), but the program also allows you to fake a single image by adjusting the glow and edge of the photo, under the HDR Effects tab.- The blur features are very powerful and intuitive to use. No other program I have used makes it this easy to create cool blur effects.- The face and body adjustments are very powerful and intuitive, allowing the user to smooth wrinkles, brighten eyes, increase eye size, whiten teeth, and make the body and face thinner. I put my photo in it, and it detected my jawline, smile line, and eyes automatically. It is easy to adjust the points if needed, but the program was very accurate in guessing.- You can get a digital copy of the program if you want by visiting the website on the box and entering the product key. This makes it convenient if you dont have a CD Rom drive or just want a back up.The main issue I have with the program is that while I like the layout overall, I dont like that certain things can only be done in different tabs (for example, if you want to crop to selection, you have to go to the layers tab, as opposed to the edit or adjustment tab).Another issue is that I dont like that you have to import photos into the library before you edit them. On other programs, you can edit an image and it opens directly to the editing part of the program.Also, this program has fewer special effects than other programs. For example, there doesnt seem to be any painting type filters (such as turning a photo into an oil painting) or lighting effects (like adding lens flares).Finally, and this is minor, I wish the program allowed alternative colorspaces, such as LAB, which offers more editing flexibility, but most programs at this level dont offer that (but PhotoPlus X7 does).Overall, I like this program because it takes a lot of the common tasks I use and makes them quick and easy to carry out. While it may lack certain filters, what it does, it does extremely well, especially for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKKRZGX8VTIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158RGNR8#wasThisHelpful","R3MKKRZGX8VTIY","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should start by noting that this product does *not* contain turmeric extract, which is usually what is labeled curcumin. This product contains simple turmeric powder, which likely does contain the ingredient curcumin, but since the amount isnt standardized, we cant know for sure how much.Simple turmeric powder is considered less effective and less potent than the standardized extract. I personally take the powder, but I wanted everyone who reads this to be aware that they arent getting the extract contained in many other curcumin supplements.That being said, this formula does contain a lot of turmeric per capsule, and it includes black pepper extract, which seems to help absorption of the active compounds in turmeric. If you take any kind of turmeric, I suggest taking it with black pepper (and I would personally add bromelain and lecithin as well, both which can likely increase absorption of key components).I have taken turmeric for years, primarily because of research related to prevention of Alzheimer's. It seems to prevent the buildup of amyloid deposits in the brain. That alone is worth the price. I cant vouch for its ability to prevent and treat arthritis and other problems, although I am 37 and have run 10-20 miles a week for the last fifteen years without problems, so it is possible my regular supplemental turmeric has helped keep me feeling good.Since this is simple turmeric powder, and not the pricier extract, the price is kind of high compared to other brands, even if it is organic. That being said, I do like and trust Ubervita products based on my experience with other products. Overall, this is a good formula, just be aware of what you are getting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEOQPJGDVJNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RN5Q3K#wasThisHelpful","RLEOQPJGDVJNM","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really useful and cool vacuum. In fact, it is amazing. I don't like sweeping, and I often get annoyed at vacuums that don't do their jobs.It is simple to set up and operate. You put one of the mop pads on the bottom of the unit, fill it up with some water, and it is ready to go.What amazed me was how it mopped and swept at the same time AND did a great job at both. The vacuum is remarkably strong. I hand swept some cat litter pellets from the kitchen floor to the side of the room, thinking this vacuum couldn't handle them. Then I figured I might as well see if it could, and sure enough it swept up virtually everything on the floor, including the large pellets. It was as good, if not better, than the other vacuum's in my house. It did all of this while steam cleaning the floor at the same time!It comes with 2 washable, and 4 disposable mop pads.

"I have taken phosphatidylserine for many years to maintain my cognitive function as a I get older. I can't vouch for whether it is working or not, but everyone I meet is surprised my mind is so sharp. That's hardly scientific evidence, but it makes me feel good to hear it.A few, small, recent studies have shown that the combination of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid may have a positive effect on cognitive function and mood, as well as normalizing the stress response in hyper-stressed men, possibly by decreasing cortisol levels. So, this formula could be of great benefit to stressed out and/or people experiencing some cognitive decline.In the study mentioned above, it was ""hyper-stressed"" men who saw the benefit, so this could explain why I didn't feel anything from taking this supplement. However, that doesn't mean it isn't having a positive effect inside of me. I believe in phosphatidylserine and recommend it.The main drawback about supplementing with any phosphatidylserine product is that the price is high, and this is no exception. Also, I was surprised this wasn't a softgel product. Be sure to take this supplement with a little fat (such as with a meal or a fish oil or lecithin pill), because phosphatidylserine is fat soluble and needs some fat to be absorbed properly.If you are experiencing any of the issues that phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic Acid may treat, it is worth giving this product a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JLXZS0C0A3H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFOR9AK#wasThisHelpful","R3JLXZS0C0A3H0","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll admit that when I received this speaker, I was disappointed in how small it was, especially for the price. However, once I actually used it, I changed my tune.This speaker is very powerful for the size. I was amazed at the deep, rich, sound that came from it. I connected via Bluetooth with no problems. It pairs up immediately.It can be used to connect to different streaming services like Pandora directly from the unit (you will need your WiFi password). There are controls directly on the speaker.It comes with a remote that basically has the same buttons that are on the speaker.The only drawback is the price. It is pretty high for a single and (obviously) mono speaker, especially if you aren't going to take advantage of the streaming options.Overall this is a powerful  speaker that can very easily be used to connect to streaming services. Personally, I don't see a huge reason why you would need to use the speaker to access the services as opposed to your phone or computer and then connect to the speaker via Bluetooth, but that option is pretty cool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L3SGT2KP665B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH685E#wasThisHelpful","R2L3SGT2KP665B","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this backpack just before attending a very demanding leadership conference that involved walking around a city doing various projects. It really impressed me with its durability and comfort.My Toshiba Satellite 15.6 Inch Laptop doesn't fit perfectly. It does fit, but the corners of the laptop are barely zipped shut, and kind of protrude inside the pack. The backpack's specifications are for a 15 inch laptop, but I was hoping it would fit. Either way, I got a lot out of the backpack.It isn't huge, so it isn't bulky like bigger backpacks. It has a nice small pocket in the front bottom, and a cool hard case at the top for sunglasses and other items you want protected better. It really does do a good job of shielding your fragile items.Other reviewers have said it is uncomfortable.

"This is a smaller, bluetooth, novelty speaker. That is basically what you are getting with this product.I like this speaker. It is pretty small (only 7.3 inches tall). However, for being so small, the sound is actually pretty rich, full, and loud. I was honestly expecting something much different given the size. I have other similar sized speakers, and this one sounds a lot better.It paired easily to my computer and android phone. It tells you vocally what it is doing (like pairing, powering up, etc). The unit comes with a micro usb charging cord, but not an actual charger unit.The light show is a novelty. It is pretty cool for parties, but after awhile for simple home use, it loses its appeal. I am a teacher and am bringing it to school. If I play music, I'll use it. I think it will get a lot of interest there.Overall, for what it is (a small novelty speaker), it is very nice.

"This product does seem to work to ""brighten eyes."" Thanks to lots of moisturizing agents, it does work to make the area around the eyes brighter and reduce lines. Is this because of the licorice extract or antioxidants that are advertised on the label?  Possibly, but generally, it is just that this product moisturizes well.My wife and I both used this, and her reaction was ""it burns."" I did notice that effect as well, but nothing major. She has dark circles under her eyes, and this product didn't seem to have much of an effect on them. So I can only recommend you use it for brightening and (temporarily) reducing lines.Overall, this is an expensive product (at least from my perspective) that does generally work to make your eyes brighter and reduce fine lines. I guarantee cheaper products are out there that do the exact same thing, since it is basically a concentrated moisturizing agent. Personally, I would look for cheaper options. I give this four stars because it does actually work, but it is too expensive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7NQ2A4O2KKNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSM8#wasThisHelpful","R7NQ2A4O2KKNI","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I take quite a few supplements, and have taken Melatonin on and off for about 14 years. Melatonin sometimes works for me, and sometimes it doesn't. Lately, I have been taking anywhere from 3-6 mg of Melatonin, some of that as time release. It seems like it doesn't work that well, at least not consistently.I expected this product to work about the same way, and boy was I wrong.This product is very potent, and works amazingly well for me (it is definitely UBER-sleep). Every time I use it, I fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night. It produces a nice and relaxed state before I hit the pillow, but nothing too uncomfortable or weird. When I hit the pillow, I fall asleep very quickly. I also dream a lot every time I use it, which I haven't done regularly for a while.The various herbs in the formula (Valerian, Hops, Passion Flower, and Chamomile) are known to promote relaxation, as is Magnesium. Most sleep formulas include these ingredients, but actually have such low amounts, it is nearly pointless. Ubersleep contains a lot more than other formulas, in one capsule. In fact, by containing 125 mg of Magnesium (a mix of the Gluconate and Oxide forms)  it has more Magnesium than the actual Magnesium supplement I take daily.So, while it is quite a bit more expensive than a normal Melatonin supplement, it contains a lot more as well. I plan on using it somewhat regularly, when I really need a great night's sleep. I don't like to rely on Melatonin all the time, and I don't want to have to rely on this formula all the time either.Overall, it is a little expensive, but for what you get, it is a good value. I am actually so impressed I ordered more already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FANLQW632O28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGUJ9WG#wasThisHelpful","R3FANLQW632O28","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend introduced me to NVC about five years ago. From the beginning, I was aware of how effective it is at both getting my needs met, and making others feel that you are connecting with them. It really is a revolutionary way of communicating. That being said, I have read various books by Rosenberg on the subject.This 9 CD set is, in my opinion, the easiest and best way to learn about Nonviolent communication and put it into practice. I enjoyed Rosenberg's books, but hearing him present the material helped me absorb it much better than reading it alone.The CDs contain about an hour of material on each disc. The workbook is very helpful, and contains exercises and information along with the audio. The set also comes with six business card sized reminder cards, to help you practice NVC. Below are the general contents of each disc:1. Origins of Nonviolent Communication2. Applying NVC within ourselves3. A radically different kind of honesty4. Empathically connecting with others5. Meeting our needs in intimate relationships6. Experiencing and exercising authority7. Healing, mediation, and reconciliation8. How NVC supports social change9. Living compassionately with celebration and gratitudeThe price is a little high compared to the books, obviously, but what you get is much more in depth and easier to learn. I highly recommend this course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP1KQO27WJ0BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591794439#wasThisHelpful","RP1KQO27WJ0BG","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My morning routine is to shower and put on lotion immediately after the shower, which locks in moisture. This has saved me from having dry skin problems in the winter and actually keeps my face looking younger. Generally, I have to dry my face some to put on the cream I use (usually some vitamin C cream).I found this product fascinating because it is supposed to go on before toweling off, which theoretically locks in more moisture, so I ordered it. Honestly, it does work well. I applied it with my face soaking wet, and then lightly patted my face dry, per instructions.My experience is that when you apply it, initially it won't seem like it absorbed. My skin looked and felt like nothing happened. However, sure enough, a few minutes later, it felt soft and looked moisturized. The first time I used it, I looked a little oily because I used too much, since it didn't seem like anything was happening.The label says ""get ready in half the time, which is kind of ridiculous, since applying cream before toweling off doesn't eliminate the need to towel off after applying the cream. I doubt this lotion will save people a lot of time.It contains ""calming green tea oil"" according to the label. I find that amusing since green tea extract is a source of caffeine, so it is hardly calming, unless it means using this lotion can satisfy my caffeine addiction, which would make me calm. Whether topical green tea helps the skin is up for debate, since one 2005 study found no noticeable visual difference from using a 10% green tea product topically, although skin biopsies showed a positive effect. The green tea is a purely cosmetic (pun intended) ingredient anyway, since it is nowhere near 10% of the product, since it is literally the third-to-last ingredient, which means there isn't much of it at all.Overall, the cream definitely makes my skin feel soft, but I am not sure if it is a hugely noticeable improvement over my other method (toweling my face followed by cream). Maybe in the long run, locking in extra moisture will make a difference. Either way, it does work to soften and moisturize skin.I give this four stars, because while it does work like it says it does, it is pretty pricey, and doesn't seem to work *that* much better than more inexpensive products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16A5MI8SIWN61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB87XEU#wasThisHelpful","R16A5MI8SIWN61","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start my review saying I am not a professional boxer, and not even an amateur. I have a punching bag in my basement that I use for exercise purposes, to get stronger, faster, and more agile. I have a pair of bag gloves that came with the bag. They have very little padding, and if I hit even relatively hard, my hand stings.I like these gloves. They pad my punches from impact quite a bit, although my brother's Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves are much thicker and pretty much fully shield my hands from impact. However, those gloves are much more expensive.These gloves look cool, and seem durable. The stitching seems sturdy, and they feel like they are made to last. The Large/X-Large size fits my hands well, and I am 5'7"", about 155 pounds.The best thing about this product is the price. They are very affordable for the size and durability. They are better padded and more heavy-duty gloves out there. However, balancing price with durability, these are great gloves. I recommend them for anybody in my situation who wants an affordable heavy-duty glove.

"The first thing I look for when I buy an olive oil product is whether it is genuine olive oil, since so many bottles have been shown to contain other oils, like soybean oil. One simple way to tell if a product is olive oil is to refrigerate it over the course of about a week. If it turns into a ""green milkshake"" consistency (see my photo) then it is genuine. This is because Olive Oil is high in monounsaturated fats and this is how those fats respond to refrigeration.So, as you can see from the photos, these bottles contain genuine olive oil. Even expensive brands have failed this test, so it is important to always test.In terms of taste, these oils are great. I am used to cheaper oils that I buy at discount outlets, which although genuine based on my tests, don't taste like this. I am not an olive oil connoisseur by any means, but I noticed the quality taste of these right away.The Cornicabra oil is peppery. It has a spicier taste, which I like. My wife isn't a huge fan of black pepper, but she still liked this one. I liked this one the best. I am not used to oil having much flavor like this.The Arbequina is definitely more fruity. My wife's response was, ""Wow, so this is how good olive oil is supposed to taste."" I noticed the subtle hints of fruit, although to me it tasted more just like the plainer olive oil I have been used to.Overall, these are two nice olive oils that I will be using in a variety of dishes. They taste different, but both are excellent oils.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVMZ2WUHWTO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJP09WM#wasThisHelpful","RQVMZ2WUHWTO0","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I basically handed these to my wife and said, ""Tell me what you think."" So, these are her thoughts.She likes them a lot. They are big enough to hold two queen comforters, which means they have a lot of storage space. The material is thick and breathable, and more heavy-duty than she expected.It has two zippers,which is convenient. The handles are a nice idea, and seem sturdy. The stitching also seems sturdy, which is a must since an item like this should be designed to hold up to wear and tear. It also looks nice and elegant, but may look ""dated"" in a few years, but that is true of most things.The only drawback is it smells pretty bad, at least to my wife.

"I have owned a variety of body groomers over the last eight years, including the Remington BHT300 All Access Men's Bodygroomer and the Axe Philips Norelco Body Groomer. I use the Axe one currently, roughly once a week to keep my chest and back hair free, and I have been very satisfied with it.However, I will start using this groomer regularly, and it has become my favorite body groomer for a variety of reasons:- It is powerful. The Remington was just weak, behaving like it was constantly running on a dead battery. This is just as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Axe groomer, which is pretty powerful. It is the most powerful of the three.- It has the closest shave of any groomer I have used. It is so close, it looks a lot like I have used a wet razor. It missed a few small areas, which is typical of these groomers, but it didn't miss very many and was easily fixed on the second run.- It is the longest of the groomers I have owned. This may seem like a minor point, but it is about 1/4 inch longer than the Axe groomer, and even longer than the Remington one. This makes it a little easier to reach back areas by myself. I usually succeed in shaving my chest, back, and arms completely by myself, using a mirror and some contortions. The added length of this groomer made this easier.- The attachments work well. The Axe groomer only had one attachment, which wasn't enough to give me shaving options. The Remington one allowed hair to get stuck in the attachment, rendering it useless after one swipe down my arm. I used the shortest attachment with this unit on both forearms and it worked perfectly without me having to clean out hair.- This product comes with a two year warranty.- It looks pretty cool (this is ultimately irrelevant to my liking it, but it does look cool).- The price is lower than other groomers, including the Axe one.The only major drawback for me was the charging system. It is needlessly complicated, using a special stand with a piece that extends out to balance it. The plug didn't fit into the prongs underneath the stand very easily, and the worst part is that the base of the groomer doesn't fit too securely into the charging unit, which means I had to sit the thing just right to get a charge. I honestly don't know why it was designed that way. However, it did charge quickly; it just took a little effort to situate it properly.Another slight drawback is that it snagged my hair a little and made it hurt. However, this is likely because I waited longer than I normally do to shave, and happens with the other groomers.Overall, with all the factors added in, including price, I like this groomer slightly better than the Axe groomer, and would recommend it to other guys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5UWXVP9204P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O50I7CE#wasThisHelpful","RP5UWXVP9204P","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Samsung Galaxy S4 loses battery power fairly quickly, and I thought having something like this in my briefcase for when I am unable to get to a charging area would be helpful, since lately it seems like I have been getting to critically low battery levels a little too often.I am very impressed with this product. It comes with a roughly 2.5 feet USB cable (USB male to micro) that allows you to charge the unit, if you have a wall or car charging unit (it doesn't come with that, just the cable). It also means I can use it to charge my Samsung from the battery cell as well. Note that to charge this battery, you have to have this (or another) micro USB cable, because that is the input for charging it. Also, if you wish to charge an external device that doesn't use micro USB, you will have to provide your own USB cable, but most people have a lot of those already.To provide its charge, it has 1.0 and 2.4 amp USB slots, so it functions just like a normal USB charger. The 2.4 amp slot theoretically can charge your device very quickly because of the power it delivers. However, based on the app I use to determine charging speed on my phone, I am only getting 1.2 amps from the battery cell to my Samsung device. However, I should note that I never get higher than that on any charger, so it is my device's limitation, not the issue of this charger.The battery cell has a cool LED charge indicator, that automatically displays a percentage of charge while you are charging the cell, and can be displayed at any time by pushing a button. This is very helpful to see how much charge is left. It is fairly large and heavy, and is about as wide and long as my actual S4, but double the thickness. However, this also means it will deliver the necessary juice when needed. It also looks really sleek.Overall, this is a great product for the price. It delivers a lot of amps (more than my car charger) and can come in handy when you need more juice on the go. This is a very practical item for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0SBSK8CWL1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN9BYHQ#wasThisHelpful","RH0SBSK8CWL1Q","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is great sugar-free mint gum. I am a teacher and I regularly bring gum to school and my students have been bumming some from me all year, and then buying me packs to replace mine. I decided to order this set since it seemed right up my alley.The sweetmint is my favorite. It is mild and candy-like. The spearmint and peppermint are typical of these types of flavors, and are, to quote my four year old daughter, more ""spicy"" than sweetmint. The most intense is the wintermint. I like the intensity of it.One downside about this variety pack is that it gives preference to spearmint (4 packs) and wintergreen (4 packs), likely because those are the more familiar flavors. However, I actually prefer the sweetmint and wintermint, even though there are only two packs of each of those. My daughter had pretty much chewed all the sweetmint before I could get to it, and my students seemed to like the wintermint so much that I didn't even get much of that. So these two seem to be the favorite, but least represented.Another downside is that these gums contain sugar alcohols, which can cause gastrointestinal upset (like gas and bloating) if consumed in high enough quantities.

"This is a very attractive shower curtain. It looks really nice. It is also very reasonably priced. It lets in a lot of light as well, which is a plus (unless you want some privacy). Overall, my wife and I like it.However, it is pretty flimsy and it isn't the most functional and heavy-duty shower curtain. Because it is lace with no backing, it does have tiny holes in it. However, the water doesn't seem to leak out, and my floor was no more or less wet than with my original curtain. Because it is lace, and kind of flimsy, it seems like it will snag.Generally, this looks nice and works decently well, but don't expect it to resist too much water leakage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YY2HOF0YBUA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YY2HOF0YBUA0","A33VTJLP5VFAQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33VTJLP5VFAQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased two of these for my 1990 Chevy K2500 pickup and they wont get much use mostly for washing the windshield. The heat & sun will likely kill them more than anything else. I only paid 4-bucks each so Im not expecting too much but they are listed as 18-inch but the rubber is that length. The Bosch 40718A they replaced had rubber that was only 17-1/8 inches wide and I think nearly an inch of windshield not being covered by each blade is not good.

"Its much thinner at least half as much as the 100-foot drains in the home centers. I suspect this is much thinner so its fold up easy into a handy little retail package rather than a huge roll about 4-feet in diameter. Depending on use the thickness may not be an issue but thinner is much more flexible. We have an irrigation canal for the summer and getting water to many things involved a pump and sprinklers so we dug a series of narrow canals through the property to let the ground absorb it. The idea was fine and everything stays watered without any power but the little canals about 6 deep and 4 wide will get overgrown easily and then become a trip hazard and it makes mowing much more difficult. The answer was this pipe because its perforated and lets water out easily. The canals arent very straight so this conformed nicety and after putting some weed block over it we were able to cover it with dirt to get a level surface. We didnt cover the entire water system but just places for walkways and the riding mower. Excellent pipe and having the thicker pipe on hand was the reason for going with this one because the other stuff is just too rigid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TYDUBCDS6LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R41A3A#wasThisHelpful","R34TYDUBCDS6LS","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There seems to be some unfavorable reviews based on the length of the cable. I cant comment on what someone else received but mine was exactly 48-inches long. The junction box is about 6.5-inches long so Im guessing some think that the exposed cable of 41.5-inches makes it shorter than described. Ive had a lot of trailers and was an electrician in my earlier years and Ive never had a cable that was measured by the method I just mentioned. After the shielded cable enters the box the sheathing is removed to expose the individual wires and when you measure correctly from the face of the connector to the end of the exposed wires where they connect on the terminal bar it is 48-inches long. If you purchase the cable separately the length will also be measured from the face of the plug to the end of the exposed wires. I needed to cleanup some wiring on a utility trailer and add some electric brakes so I had to eliminate the existing 4-prong connector and go with this which also allows me to plug into my trucks outlet without needing an adapter. Most plugs are close to the receiver mounting the box close to the hitch still left me with plenty of cable. If your vehicle connector is near the center of the vehicle you dont need much cable slack for turning so the 3-feet I had is plenty. If you want the box closer to the trailer then a longer assembly may be required. This completed assembly was less then buying the cable and junction box separately and there was no adding wire connectors and connecting the two together. This is a rugged build and should last for many years and my only criticism is the lack of a seal under the cover but its not enough to knock off a star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RET5Q56QPOTQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044YQAPW#wasThisHelpful","RET5Q56QPOTQ9","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a 1990 Chevy K2500 pickup and many years ago had a shop replace my muffler and lose the lower half of the rear hanger. I probably could have fabricated something but this was much easier and less expensive elsewhere. This works on trucks that take a muffler that has two 2.25 exhaust holes and a fitting attached to the frame that this will slide into. It doesnt go in the pic shows so flip it over and slide the formed round piece into your frame holder and put the flat piece under your tailpipes with the clamp plate of the U-bolt between it and the pipe on the underside. Really helps to get a better clamp connection because the only other hanger after the muffle is the one in the back where the two tailpipes extend behind the rear wheel. Without this, or a similar clamp, right behind the muffler is sagged and I couldnt get a tight connection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTNLGWJGIBY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AX84P4#wasThisHelpful","R3MTNLGWJGIBY8","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ford recommended this type for my 1999 Expedition and at about twelve fifty the price was right. However, there are others that meet the specs and the prices are all over the map plus they come in concentrate or pre-diluted which is what they are now calling the water added 50/50 mix. Once you know what type you need then its pretty much a search for the best price. In doing so, make sure you know whether the price is for the concentrate or the 50/50 mix so youre not comparing apples to oranges. This product is the concentrate and the same brand 50/50 AF2100 is going for about eight fifty a gallon. Since you need one of these to equal two of the 50/50 then this is the better deal. Ive always used Prestone usually the yellow bottle but this is fine for me. I need to change radiator hoses so changing the anti-freeze should be done also along with a new thermostat & gasket. In many cases the concentrate and the 50/50 seem to run about the same price per gallon even though youre getting half as much with the pre-diluted. I need 4-gallons to do a change and this was both what I wanted and at a good price so 5-stars it is since there arent any faults I can find with it. You just have to shop and carefully compare but when youre doing a whole drain/refill. I needed 2-gallons of this for about 25-bucks or 6-gallons of the 50/50 for about 51-bucks so the math made it an easy decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQ8HBG77T06G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CCM5JU#wasThisHelpful","R1AQ8HBG77T06G","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Were on the high desert of ID at about 4,700-feet and tomatoes are always a problem with cold, frost and/or winds especially at night and the wee hours of the morning. We were starting everything indoors but that gets to be a problem because once theyre growing we seem more hesitant to move them outside and chance the weather will turn. Forecasts are not all that accurate because they cover such a vast area but the Frost Warnings are usually correct and now we dont have to run out at night to cover them with pots and rocks. We used these for the fist time this year and were able to get plants in the ground in early April and thats 2- months earlier than normal. They warmed nicely during the day and retained enough heat at night to survive through some very cold nights and some high winds. We were eating red tomatoes in July so we just purchased another dozen of these for next year. Normally, a red tomatoes doesnt appear until early September after about a month of watching them go slowly through the orange color stages that seems to last a month. If you like store tomatoes then this may be a waste but if you like those fresh from the garden and have weather that can make it difficult this is the answer. We use them for determinates so they dont outgrown it.

"This was a reluctant purchase because I dislike buying technology that serves a single purpose. I already have a Sony BluRay player but it doesnt have all the things I want to watch specifically Korean shows. I was watching them through a laptop connected to my TV but the quality wasnt great and they buffered & pixilated even though the computer was hard wired to my router. We gave up entirely on Viki because it streamed so poorly and moved on to Drama-Fever which was somewhat of an improvement but not great. Since Drama-Fever streams only Roku we gave it a shot because it was on sale for just under 40-bucks and all I can say is WOW! What a difference in picture quality and having a remote that has some features is a real plus. It was an easy install once I found my routers password. My only complaint is that I had to provide a credit card or PayPal before I could finish setting up the required Roku account.

"This is a trailer towing chain but I used it with a shop crane to swap engines in my 1990 Chevy K2500 pickup and it worked fine for about a 500 lb engine. I'm not sure what its lift capacity is rated at but the minimum break force is 5,000 lbs so at 1/10th of that i thought I was good to go. It was too long so I used a Galvanized Anchor Shackle to shorten it a bit so I didnt have to lift the engine too high to clear the front of the truck.

"I just pulled the 350 5.7L engine from my 1990 Chevy K2500 and replaced it with a 350 from a 1990 Suburban V2500 and they are the exact same blocks. However, the truck has oil cooler lines that run to the radiator and the Suburban engine did not so I had to swap the oil filter adapter over to the replacement engine. Without the oil cooler I would have needed a much larger filter but the fitment guide doesnt seem to factor in that pretty major difference. I did get the right filter for the oil cooler but its much too small to fit the same engine from the Suburban. The old truck engine had some major issues with oil consumption so I went through a lot of oil and changed filters often and went with several of these last year when they were under 5-bucks each and thought the description then stated these had a check valve but I dont see it now.

"Im swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and needed to replace the exhaust from the engine to the muffler the rest was replaced not too long ago. The Walker 15034 converter I was installing was shorter than the one that was being replaced so I try adding a Dynomax 41976 connector pipe to make up the difference but I didnt factor in enough for what slipped into the pipes and I was a few inches short so I cut a piece from another 41976 to make up the shortage. That ended up being a little sloppy, had some leakage and then I did it right by using this pipe and cutting it to the exact length needed. Im in a very rural area so most repairs get done in my driveway and it costs a lot less than going to a shop 40-miles away so as a do-it-yourselfer I have never had a complaint with any Walker/Dynomax item Ive used and I have replaced everything on my 1990 Chevy K2500 truck from the engine all the way to the back. I use the Walker site to make sure I get the correct part number because this site often shows the correct item as not fitting my vehicle but the prices here have ranged from good to excellent and a connector pipe I just purchased was about one-third the cost from the auto parts store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S666QI9ELKKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C8ZC8K#wasThisHelpful","R3S666QI9ELKKT","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"License plates here in Idaho have a mountain scene and a potato but a cracked windshield would be much more representative. I only drive on paved roads and in the last few trips I picked up 3 bulls-eye chips and a few minor chips and this kit did them all. The last kit I used was the Stoner 95141 and that was just enough for one large chip. Last year I went to a glass shop and had one repaired and it was no better than the results I got from  the Rain-X. Ive probably done about two dozen chips in the last 8-years and I have yet to get a repair anywhere near what many reviewers claim to have achieved and that is a repair that is so good that you cant detect it without knowing where I was beforehand. I know Im doing it correctly but if you want to believe your repair will be virtually invisible you may be open to disappointment. Im happy that this stuff stops the chip from becoming a running crack and my windshield doesnt look like every fifth vehicle I see on the road. This kit is about as goof-proof as they come and even after the first application you can still add a few drops more, put the plastic on it and let it cure and keep doing so until the repair is complete. Since I never expected an invisible repair I went with 5-stars primarily because I had not complaints with it but also because I did five repairs on the same windshield with it and I just purchased another kit for the next round of repairs on my truck because you really need to get something into these holes before a crack starts and you need to replace the whole windshield.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SHCIOL3EE9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPS4APU#wasThisHelpful","R22SHCIOL3EE9Z","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I suspect your exhaust system will rust and wear out long before this donut will fail. Not much you can say about it other than it works as intended and it gives a little flexibility to your exhaust pipe to move around slightly with a spring bolt kit. If you bolted your pipe to the manifold without it youll have a leak and the flared end on the pipe couldnt move on the rounded surface of the donut and would likely break. If there are any rough spots on the side toward the pipe they should be smoothed out before installation.

"I was swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 truck and getting the old pump off the engine was a pain that required a special tool to pull off the pressure fitted pulley to get to the bolts that held it in the frame.

The quart I purchased was just under 5-bucks and the same price as the closet auto parts store that is 40-miles away.

"I read a lot of reviews and checked a lot of mattresses and came to the conclusion the problems with waking to a sore back and knee pain was the box spring. In checking out possible alternatives to a new box spring I found that most countries European ones in particular either use a metal frame or just put the mattress on the floor. Not wanting to pay big bucks for another box spring I gave this a shot and no regrets whatsoever so far. It went together easily, is about the same height as my bed was with a box spring and looks good with the skirt around it. Ive had back issues for over 25-years and buying a new bed in the limited marketplace out here was not in the cards. I sleep comfortably, wake up without pain and weight is evenly distributed. What people choose to sleep on and how they rate those choices is very subjective but in our throwaway society I really didnt want to pay the price and out here mattresses & box springs are made locally and they just slap on the brand nametag so theres never a truck rolling into the sleep stores from the manufacturer. When its time to replace the mattress Ill likely buy one though Amazon comes compressed for shipping.

"Im swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and I got the old engine out with a 1-ton engine hoist set all the way out at the 1/4 ton setting. However, going back in was a whole different story. Since I latterly pulled the old one out I didnt have enough reach with the boom to get the new engine over the motor mounts I was about 10-inches short. I purchased the lift based on the measurements but they were a bit deceiving on the reach because of the way the hook was attached and the pump hit my bumper both of which cut the reach down by about 5-inches. The boom on the lift is just like a 2-inch receiver so I removed the hook form the lift, slid this in, clamped it in place with a safety chain and installed the hook in the end with the hitch pin. For about 20-bucks this solved my problem and the engine went in easily though I was probably pushing the weight limit with my DIY extension. I did get the engine safely in the vehicle before I made my modification and then lifted it again to get it back where it should go. This was the alternative to about 250-bucks for a 1-time use of a 2-ton lift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LP8RTOSYJ4YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00382UXKY#wasThisHelpful","R3LP8RTOSYJ4YF","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't really think that the Protected & Grounded lights need to be on constantly and a simple test button could eliminate it. I do have a peeve with things that need a constant light to tell me they're working or that they're on or off. I purchased this for my microwave because we're in a rural area and have some blips in the power that are so short the only way you know it happened is because a few clocks need to be reset. The last time it occurred when lost the use of a few buttons on the microwave keypad so a few bucks invested in this will hopefully eliminate that problem. It's really just a piece-of-mind item and I'll likely never know if it worked but I knocked off a star for the lights that will never go off if your outlet is properly installed.

"Update I did respond to Tektons Comment and they sent me another tool.There was an improvement in the replacement bar but it seems they are designed that way and that could be a plus if the pin shears and it would be an easy repair. Perhaps I was too demanding of a tool in this price range but I can see how many may think its a good addition to the tool chest and that could make it an easy 4-5 star breaker bar. However, I said 3-star for the purpose I was using it and that was freeing some 25-year old engine bolts with a little leverage and some penetrating oil but it wouldnt work in a tight spot. The size, price, fit & finish should be enough to satisfy most but if youre really looking to get into some tight areas where you just need a few inches of full you may be slightly disappointed. I purchased a vintage bar with a fixed pin and it did the job for me but I wont hesitate to grab my Tekton replacement when I have a little more maneuvering room. Since this is a product review Ill just say I was not disappointed with the warranty and service. Check the top review for the TEKTON 1695 (Nice, but not a precision tool) to get another perspective on the same issue I had with it.Im swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and my Craftsman 1/2"" bar was a little too long at 18 to get into some tight spots. First use was with a Tekton 3/8-drive 13mm deep socket to remove a stubborn bolt on my water inlet to the engine. I went with this bar based on price & reviews but the knuckle seemed too loose and it transferred about 3-inches of play out to the end of the handle I could wobble it back & forth a bit with just my fingers so it was visibly loose. Tightening the set screw wouldnt compensate at all for the space on either side of the knuckle it needs to have the prongs pressed closer together. The 3/8-socket fit was tight so theres no play there and with an adapter to use the Craftsman theres so little play its not even noticeable even with the added length. The purpose of a breaker bar, for me anyway, is to be able to slip into a tight space like where the bell housing bolts up with the upper rear of the engine but having 3-inches of play defeats the purpose and now Im back a wrench with a short cheater. Not to be too picky here but the body of this bar is only 11-3/8 you only get the full 12 when the head is straight out at the 180-degree position. Also, theres only 1-detent and thats also with the head straight out and its made in China. Perhaps its just one that slipped by quality control but when you start laying into a breaker bar the last thing you need is a poor fit right where all that force is being transferred to the socket head. I had one with a similar problem a few years ago and when exerting some force on it the pin broke because the head was pushing on it rather then the inside edge of the fork. On the plus side, its a good looking tool with a nice finish and good feel in the hand. Im usually pretty lenient on ratings but I have to go with 1-star on this one because it not only is too loose but Id say its dangerous to use it since the intended use is with a lot of pressure applied and Ive already lost enough meat on these old knuckles over the past 50-years. Using a breaker bar is an effective way to gain more torque at the head with the same amount of force by increasing the handle length and removing the possible slippage from the teeth in a ratchet. The same can be achieved by using a wrench with a cheater pipe over the end. A solid pin is going to give more shear resistance than on that is threaded, hence the different selection for different applications. The weak point is still the transition between the head and the square dive stud.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L302W2GVCK7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7ELVEO#wasThisHelpful","R1L302W2GVCK7X","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried the Victor Reinz GS33272 first, which is similar to the Fel-Pro ES72671 set, but theyre the wrong ones. Im swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 with a 350 (5.7L) engine and finding the correct gaskets wasnt all that easy. I thought this was a perfect fit and well worth the price to get the correct gaskets but after a few months I had to pull the cooler adapter to swap it to the new engine. Its really hard to get to the engine mounting plate to remove the old gasket but if you dont do it correctly this will leak. When I pulled it the fiber gasket was split and falling apart. When I removed it the first time to install this set there was a metal plate about twice the thickness of these gaskets so I figured the Reinz kit was an improvement and installed it. What I just realized is this is not the correct set of gaskets but the ACDelco and/or GM OEM 88893990 is the correct part. Not only does it come with the same type of metal plate that was originally installed it has an O-ring thats about twice the diameter as the one in the GS33272 kit. The metal plate looks pretty much like the fiber gasket but it really isnt intended to be a gasket but rather a diverter that oil will slash against to fill a small reservoir that has the connectors to the radiator so the splashing was what shredded the fiber gasket and that prevented oil from circulating to the radiator which made the whole unit non-functioning after a few weeks.  With the GM kit you get only the two items you need and the job gets done correctly. The Fel-Pro gets 3-stars because it was the wrong kit and the fitment guide was also wrong and the GM gets 5-stars because its OEM and is the correct kit. If you have a small block GM engine the GM kit is likely the one that you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LGAMY8X15MBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00268AA4K#wasThisHelpful","R2LGAMY8X15MBT","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the help of Terro I have created a large population of addicted ants and I doubt that anything has ever been carried back to the nest and killed the queen. We have a lot of ants sugar ants here in high desert and as soon as it gets hot they are everywhere and its not unique to our home. They are pretty much outdoor problems until the hot weather hits like now and they are also a problem with trees and aphids. Weve tried to keep them away from the house with many products to no long term avail. Weve been on Terro for about 2-years now and as long as the baits are filled in the kitchen and near the pet dishes were pretty much ant free.

"Im swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy 350 5.7L K2500 and needed this tool because the Chilton manual was wrong. All the pulleys, with the exception of the power steering, are held on with a bolt but someone at GM thought it was a better move to have one pulley pressed on so you need to buy a special tool to get it off. I thought it would be like the AC where you just pull a few bolts and move it to the side but theres no way thats going to happen because one of the block bolts for the frame is behind the pump. Anyway, I didnt buy this one but its identical in looks, case and number of parts to the one from HF (40749 for about 18 bucks) so all 3 kits may be from the same Chinese factory. I went cheap because I hate spending money on a tool I will likely never use again. As with most cheap tools the bolts are of a soft metal and dont take a lot of torque in stride like a hardened bolt. Leaning over the front end to use this tool isnt easy and even with the radiator and upper shroud removed its still difficult. I tried to minimize the amount of pressure applied by using some penetrating oil and I used Blaster. The pulley came off but I realized afterwards I used a wrong part in the removal process and it made it more difficult because the part I used was stuck in both the pulley and the jackshaft but absent decent instructions how would I know? There are some smooth shafts with an O-ring on one end and they are used for the removal process with the O-ring side slipping into the pulley (though the stubby one needs the O-ring in the jackshaft) to hold the stem in place just pick the correct length for your application. The threaded stems are only used for pressing the pulley back on once again the length is determined by your application and thats also where the bearing roller is used. Also, the collar is reversible with the flange on one side a little larger than the other so use the sides that fit the tightest on your pulley. When pulling it off the nut that slips into the clam shell will be at the bottom of the threads and for pressing it back on you start with it at the top end since youll be turning it toward the pump. You have to make sure you use the shaft in the pulley that leaves the most room in the bolt that threads over it or itll bottom out and youll likely break it off. I consider myself of average strength for a 63 220 lb guy and there was no way my pulley was coming off without a long 1/2"" breaker bar attached to a socket and if your radiator is still in then youre looking at a pretty difficult process. I suspect that I could have broken something without first using Blaster on both sides considering the amount of pressure I had on it with that 24 breaker bar. Its 5-stars for me because even though I used a threaded shaft instead of a smooth one the pulley came off and it did press it back onto my new pump. I would guess that breaking something in this set may be because the right combination of parts wasnt used like I did. You can buy more expensive sets or a separate tool to remove and another to install but for the few bucks I paid for this one it was worth it and if someone tells you dont need a special tool for a pressed on pulley dont believe it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SHNEHTTS3UAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00061SGTK#wasThisHelpful","R1SHNEHTTS3UAR","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Im in a very rural area so fixing a flat in the tread without removing the tire and running 12-miles to the closets garage was my goal. I have some big rigs with 10-ply tires and this kit made quick work out of a screw hole from one I dropped in my stone driveway on my Chevy K2500 pickup  I also have purchased a magnet to check for more before my tire finds it. Ive used the Slime liquid for years to keep my tires inflated but recently replaced a few tires so Ill also purchased more of it. I had a leaking sidewall that the Slime liquid fixed for years and I gave that 5-stars. This kit has everything needed and the T-handles are much better than the straight handles on a Victor set that I tried but couldnt get the plug in for lack of good leverage. This kit is 5-stars but it loses one from me because once you open the package theres no way to close it and keep the parts together so it ended up in a bag. Ill be buying another one for my Expedition. Not to insult anyones intelligence but if you want to use this on the road youll likely need a compressor but if you catch it quickly like I did you can get the tools out, pull whatever is in the hole, ream it out and leave the reamer in you stop the air, load up the other tool, add some glue to it, pull out the reamer and quickly insert the plug and you wont lose much air and should be good for a slow drive to an air pump.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R413PMQF12S9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ET9SAA#wasThisHelpful","R413PMQF12S9R","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished replacing the pins & rollers on both doors of my 1990 Chevy K2500 pickup and, once I figured it out, I did the second door in about an hour. I have electric windows/locks and didn't want to undo the connections to remove the doors so I used my engine hoist with some tie down straps as a sling and it worked fine and I could do the work without help. There are other ways to support your door when you remove the pins and I was going to just throw the straps up and over a garage rafter but the hoist worked and gave me a little more control of the door. I watched some You Tube and read some reviews first but most didn't help. One video said you can do it without removing the door and one reviewer stated you need to press the roller pin in... both were wrong. The Dorman pin Dorman 38433 Door Roller Pin has a knurled end that is much too large for the hole so it could never be pressed in: hammering it home will only destroy the roller and it still is too large for the hole; and drilling out the hole on a welded hinge doesn't make sense so it had to be ground down to get a proper fit so it gets 4-stars for being too large. I used a bench grinder but anything would work that's stable so you can turn the roller to get an even reduction in size. I popped the door spring with a screwdriver but the spring compressor made putting it back in a breeze and it gets 5-stars... pay a few bucks for it and you won't regret it. I purchased a set hinge pins on the auction site under 7-bucks and it was for both doors (4 pins, 8 bushings & 2 retainers) and a perfect fit... not sure why so many sites sell pins separately when you should be replacing both. However, the bushings fit in the hinge frame from the inside so if you don't pull the pin and separate the hinge halves you'll never get the old ones out... let alone the news in so that pretty much means the door is separated from the truck but really doesn't come off if you're splitting semantics. Just pulling the door a few inches away from the truck gave me enough room to do some hammering and get the old parts out and there's enough electrical cable in there if you loosen the boot to move it at least 6-inches. If you use a jack stand you could probably do one hinge at a time but it's a little cramped and alignment would require some help with the door. A 12-inch drift punch would have helped but I used a 1/4"" socket extension to drive the pins out. The roller was original and is stamped into place so a cold chisel to the top took it off quickly and the pin fell right out... remove the spring first. The pin set was great but the retainers were poor so I used the old ones and they are holding tight... just slip a socket over it and tap it into place. Considering the prices GM wanted for OEM parts I can live with the few issues I had with the aftermarket parts. Having parts left is usually not good but my doors didn't require bushings on the bottom pins... pins holes were smaller so they were snug and were replacing the original pins so not having bushings was by design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EPX1K1Q5RQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025CXPYY#wasThisHelpful","R34EPX1K1Q5RQC","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not much I can saw to knock such an inexpensive watch except for the band. Im about a 63 male with a wrist thats about 7.5 and Im near the end of the holes on the band. There are 11 holes and Im at number 9 and on a hot day its number 10 so that leaves almost no band to slip into the little holder so theres a stub constantly hanging out.

"I purchased these for my John Deere STX-38 and they look & feel about like the original tires that were on it. When I purchased them the title stated they were Oregon 70-316 but that didnt appear either on the tire or the package. The tires I received (2 purchased) are clearly marked Carlisle Turf Saver 2-Ply which was also in the title. I have purchased a lot of Oregon items (chain saw blades, inner tubes, wheelbarrow tires and more) and this is the first time Ive received something that didnt bear their name but I only mention that for those who may be expecting to receive something with their name on it. At a little more than 19-bucks each this was a deal and about half of what everyone other than Amazon wanted for just one. My old tires were lean on tread and mowing a few acres of fields was leading to flats from items long buried by the former owner. Im putting tubes in them because our hot days and cold summer nights leads to air loss not matter what I do and Im adding Slime Tube to them to avoid the further pain of trying to remove these to patch it. Anyway, nice tires but if I wasnt adding a tube Id probably opt for a 4-ply for my rough mowing terrain.

"I purchased this to burn off weeds and the hordes of sugar ants that invade us each summer and it does the job, it's easy to light and the canisters make it lightweight and easy to handle. I just lift a rock and torch the ants,,, because it's a lot cheaper than Terro. I also purchased the attachment to refill my canisters from a 20-pound tank and that was a real help... be sure to chill your canisters to make the refill process easy and complete. However, my weed issue is now so large that I'm going with one of the big boys Red Dragon VT 2-23 C Weed Dragon 100,000-BTU Propane Vapor Torch Kit connected to a 20-pound tank but will still use this for lighting my burn piles and burning off my irrigation canals every spring. I'm sure Bernzomatic has another one similar to this one and I only paid about 30-bucks for mine and it was well worth it... years later even the igniter is still working.

"Were trying to reclaim an acre from wild rye grass and about 20 types of weeds that blow in on the winds. The only successful way weve found is to plant fruit bearing bushes & trees and lots of clover. Unfortunately, the rye can grow so quickly when were irrigating that its often hiding things we dont want to cut and many of the bushes start out as sticks so they get lost quickly. We tried little fences but they were also lost quickly or also mowed over. We had some utility work done and the phone company marked their lines with neat little orange flags on metal sticks so we put a few near what we planted and nothing was mowed over. We purchased these and now everything is marked even starter plants in the big gardens and they are working perfectly. The rye grass the country version can grow to 6-10 inches in about a week when its in an area getting watered and it will quickly hide things that grow close to the ground so for a few bucks these flags were well worth it even though our acre looks like a construction zone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1CJBXZFD494/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00023RTXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3R1CJBXZFD494","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a single cable running from my router to the TV room and my Sony Blu-ray is connected to it.

I tried an ""Ethernet Splitter"" RJ45 CAT 5 6 LAN Ethernet Splitter Connector Adapter PC but the description doesn't explain it fully enough and it didn't do what was expected. The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I tried this device and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should.

I wanted to add my laptop because we stream from Viki and that's not on the Sony unit and only use 1-device at a time. I tried an ""Ethernet Splitter"" but the description doesn't explain it fully enough and it didn't do what was expected. The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I purchased a switch MT-VIKI 2 Ports Network Switch Splitter Selector Hub 2-In 1-Out or 1-In 2-Out 100M MT-RJ45-2M and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should. Wish I had purchased the switch first because one of these will do nothing for you... you need two and two router ports and if you have that this is likely a 5-star item but the description is very misleading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q2WQ422FGXAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C2QS90#wasThisHelpful","R3Q2WQ422FGXAP","A3V0D97QKXDN5R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V0D97QKXDN5R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was worried about the size of this brush when I ordered it, but the price of the bigger brushes was a lot more than I wanted to pay without knowing that I would love it.When I got it, I was pleased to find that the brush is  a fair size.  It is 3 fingers wide and the brushing surface is the diagonal length of my hand.  Sure it is smaller than some of the paddle brushes I own, but I don't find the size inhibits the brush in any way.The bristles are nice and firm.  The biggest problem that I often have is that natural bristles often bend too easily to be of any real use in my hair.  The bristles on this brush are nice and firm... I love it!Super glad I got this brush.  If I had known I was going to love it, I may have gone for the handy size, but I still don't think I can justify the expense of the largest sizes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV66G1VCPLNH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N444IG#wasThisHelpful","RV66G1VCPLNH6","A3IWSCI3KCL041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IWSCI3KCL041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok... yes, it smells... henna smells!  It doesn't smell great - it smells like stale tobacco and hay if you ask me.  All henna smells, there is really no getting around that!  So now that we have gotten past that truth, lets get to reviewing!I like this color.  It is just henna and hibiscus (which intensifies the red), so if you are dying from color treated hair (not bleached) or want to go back to color treating, it shouldn't kill your hair (*I am not a hair expert).  I had chemically dyed my hair in the last month, but I am not satisified with the speed that chemical red dyes bleed out of my hair.  I decided that I want to start using henna since it is more permanent and gentler on the hair.Applying is messy (just like with all hennas).  I got my henna mixed to a thick consistency about like brownie mix - kind of like a clay.  It spread well, kept moisture in while the dyes set, and it didn't run.  It could have made the rinsing a little more difficult, but I am jazzed about the results.  I left it on for the recommended 3 hours (I know some people leave it on 6-8 hours or overnight but I wanted to go by the package directions and see where that gets me).  The color is fantastic - it tinted my hair a nice deep red.  No orange tinge to this henna application!  It was exactly what I was going for.Update:  Still using this henna and still loving the results.  The biggest problem I have is thst the color doesnt relly fade on otherwise virgin hair, so my roots are very noticeable and I need to stay on top of it more than I did with chemicals.I still have a lot of bleeding but have some thoughts on that.  A bit more than half my length is previously color treated, which damages the hair cuticle, so that  could certainly be contributing to the bleeding.  Furthermore, the previously dyed length is where I have noticed fading after 3-4 weeks.I have found that reducing the time I leave the dye in my hair reduces bleeding.  Leaving it on the recommended 2-3 hours gives me the same color with less bleesing than j get with 6-8 hour processing times.Also, I have also found that doing an apple cider vinegar rinse after your first shampoo really helps to close the cuticles and stop the bleeding!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JV15ZVZKYGFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077C1XPK#wasThisHelpful","R3JV15ZVZKYGFX","A3IWSCI3KCL041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IWSCI3KCL041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Clarks shoes.  They are built to be comfortable for a day on your feet - after you have broken them in!  I got these shoes to replace my year old shoes that I have beaten up pretty well.  The old shoes are super comfortable, and while they show wear and tear, they are still usable, but for work, I decided to get a new pair - you know, professionalism or something...  I did make the mistake of wearing these shoes for a busy day on my feet right after I got them, but after that mistake, these shoes are nicely broken in and providing the expected comfort and support that I am used to.  The only bad thing about these shoes is that they do have steel shanks (which make the shoes comfortable) and if you use TSA pre-check, you will need to take these off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZG75OAAKAAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSHI8JI#wasThisHelpful","R2UZG75OAAKAAY","A3IWSCI3KCL041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IWSCI3KCL041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade to my rechargable e-series that I bought a few years ago.  I am perfectly happy with the basic level sonicare and don't needs lot of different settings, so this brush suits me just fine.  There is an easy start function if you are new to electronic tooth brushes (it eases you into these brushes with vibrations that increase each time you use it until you reach full power); obviously I don't need this function, but it would be great if you are just getting started with these brushes.I like that the head on these does not leave a huge crevice for paste and water to get caught in and grow - which was an issue with the e-series (BTW, if you have an e-series, clean out undre the cap with bleach each time you swap heads, and you won't have any funk growing).  It is great to have a brush that won't get funky!  The special bonus pack is great since you get a second head and a handy case.  This brush does change on my old base (although it does come with its own base as well).  It is nice to know that I have an extra base if I need it.The only things that I don't necessarily love about this brush is that the head is a little smaller than the e-series, but there are bigger heads that you can get.  Also, this brush is a little louder than the e-series, but it isn't anything that will stop me from using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FH7BRL7GFST7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVPDBA4#wasThisHelpful","R3FH7BRL7GFST7","A3IWSCI3KCL041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IWSCI3KCL041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a user of Diva Cup for almost a year and a half.  This is my second cup.The packaging: The packaging is not what is shown in the picture. The company has switched from a plastic box to a sturdy plastic bag.  The cup does not sit fully open in the bag, but this does not seem to have any impact on the product.Contents:  The package included the cup, cute cotton bag and instructions.  The instruction insert was only in English- not a problem for me, but could be an issue for people who are not native English speakers.The Cup:Material- Like the Diva Cup, the Sckoon is made of medical-grade silicon.  This particular silicon has an almost jelly feel to it and is a little softer than the Diva, but the material also feels thicker.Construction-  I have seen reviews that cited a layer of dust or silicon dust on their cups.  I did not see any dust on my cup.  Other reviews said that there were a lot of seams that were left on the cup from the mold and that holes were not punched all the way through.  Again, I didn't have these problems.  Presumably, there has been an improvement of QA on this brand.Use and shape- This cup has a different shape from most other cups.  It is much more flared than other cups.  I haven't had any issues with insertion or effectiveness so far.I am not sure this will become my go-to cup, but I definitely don't hate it ;).

"I love that menstral cups are becoming a socially acceptable thing (it even had a cameo in the movie Blended).  While there is definitely a cringe factor to using a cup, but the rewards also certainly exist.  I have been using diva cup for about a year now.  I have had one or two leaking incidents where the cup was not correctly positioned, but overall, these far out perform disposable alternatives for me!Pros:-Cheaper-Less leakage-No smell-They last up to 12 hours-No need to change at work-You get more familiar with your body-Green-No hazardous chemicalsCons:-You have to be comfortable with your body (and a lot of people aren't)-The plastic stains even with vigialant cleaning (I have used Lunette wipes and boiling between cycles)-Learning curge (learn a fold that works for you)I will also say that I don't typically talk about my cup use with anyone (except for my boyfriend) because I am concerned that they will think I am some crunchy, granola hippie or otherwise excentric (plus, you know, it is none of their business).  I can assure you that I am none of these things and I still prefer using a cup!Tips:-If you are new to cups or changing cups, wearing a panty liner or pad may help build confidence in the cup and catch any leaks until you get the hang of things.-Clean, clean, clean!  I have used lunette wipes - you don't need to use them every time you empty, but I have found every other is about good.  I also make sure I at least rinse unless I am in a public restroom.

"Ok, let me start by saying that this tracker is not for the super serious fitness folks.  It is not a replacement for polar and garmin fitness products.That being said, this is still a great product!  It is basically a smart pedometer!  It counts steps and estimates distance and calorie burn.  It also tracks sleep.  When it does all of that, it integrates with an app that allows you to visualize your data.The app allows you to track your weight and body composition (either by aria scale or by manual entry).  It allows you to enter the food you ate through the day (it has a good but not excellent food database).  It allows you to set step goals (and progress through the day is available on the tracker).  It also allows you to use silent alarms.If you want to take a closer look at your fitness, this tracker will help you to see patterns about your daily life.  Of course, the more you interact (entering food, weight, etc), the more powerful and insightful the data will be.One other thing to note is that this band has a lot of accessories.  Fitbit makes bands in all different colors (the tracker comes out of the band to charge or change the bands).  If you want to try other colors, this band will let you do that.  There are even metal bracelet and pendant holders for this tracker that will draw less attention to the tracker on your arm.Things that aren't the best:This tracker is not 100% accurate!  The step count is based on typical movement of the arm while you walk and run.  If you are pushing a shopping cart or otherwise keeping your arm stationary, your steps won't be counted.

For me, this isn't a huge deal - you win some, you lose some.The clasp on the band has been reported by some users to be unreliable.

"One my my favorite ""go to"" tools.This set is an adjustable wrench with a ratchet socket in the handle. It takes the sockets that come with it and they snap in nicely. It's all open ended so you don't really need deep sockets as the bolts will pass thru.  Note the sockets are the spline type, which means they fit US and Metric bolts/nuts, 12 point, 6 point, spline or many other types of nuts/bolt heads. So you basically have 3 sets of sockets here. The range is from 3/8""/10mm/CPT50 all the way up to 3/4""/19mm/CPT59. They are all very thin wall (both a blessing and curse) except for the 9/16-14mm which is massively thick.The adjustable wrench has some very nice features. First is that the jaw is reversible. The way it comes it's a standard adjustable wrench with parallel face jaws to engage a bold or nut. However if you open it up all the way, you can turn it around and put it back in and now you have the serrated jaws of a pipe wrench. Very nice idea.Also the adjustable wrench is indexed. By that I mean there are markings on the jaw that will show you want size the wrench is open to. So if you open the wrench and see the pointer at 3/4"" or whatever, that tells you want size socket or fixed wrench need. A simple and rough caliper of sorts.The only thing missing is an extension for the sockets.I bought mine at a big box store for less than $30. (actually bought 2, keep one in the car, one in the shop.)This is my 3rd Crescent brand tool and I'm very impressed with all of them. They have the quality and feel of the old days Craftsmen stuff.

"UPDATE: Due to poor customer service from the manuf. of the car I have to deduct one star. I ordered replacement parts on 7/14/15. By 7/24/15 when nothing showed up, I contacted the company. Was told on the 27th my order would ship ""tomorrow"" the 28th. Here is is Aug 4th and nothing is here. Pretty good product, lacking in customer service followup.I still recommend the car for the fun/price ratio, but it needs improvement in lacking important features and customer service. Manufacturing quality is very good.Original Review:This is my first remote car so I didn't know what to expect. For looks, it's just great. Looks like an F430, and for less than $200, I think it's decent, but there are areas it needs to be improved:1. Movement is all on or all off. It really jerks the childs head around. It really needs a 2 stage throttle, ie, Low/high, or better yet a real progressive throttle. It's just too jerky for me.2. One wheel wonder. Ie, does not have a solid rear axle or posi. This may sound stupid, but the problem is on tile and hardwood floors, due to the power of the motor, it spins the one drive wheel and actually turns the car right. It's very hard to go left on tile. You have to turn the wheel all way to the left and even then you only can go straight or slightly left. If you keep the wheels straight and hit the gas, the car goes right. Also on gravel or anything other than carpet or brick/pavers, it's easy to get stuck. Forget going up or down slight elevation changes. ie from the patio to the grass or vice versa. A solid rear axle or posi and some sort of suspension would solve this problem.3. Wide turning radius. For such a short wheelbase I expected it to be very nimble. It needs a bit more turning angle. If you want to play inside, you'll need a pretty big area to drive.4. I wish the on/off button was hidden or had a key. Super easy for the child to find it and play with the car when you are not around.5. This car has no suspension. Not a killer, but it's a little rough on anything other than carpet.Overall it's a pretty good toy. Our boy loves it and he was playing in it while I was putting it together. :) All the other remote cars I looked at were double the price. If it had a real gradual throttle or at least a hi/low switch, posi, and hidden power switch it'd be 5 stars for sure. I think all of these things would add only a modest amount to the price of the car, but it'd make it a much better toy.If the $500 remote cars have these same problems, then by all means get this one. It's worth the money. But if the $500 remote cars have a real throttle, posi, a real suspension, and hidden switch, you might want to one of those instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FNMC7DO1976R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW7DS0M#wasThisHelpful","R3FNMC7DO1976R","A17Y465UXZOJE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17Y465UXZOJE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So this book. I hate when something starts out so unbelievably amazing and then dissolves into complete mediocrity. The 1/3 of MAGONIA was awesome. I had all these wonderful John Green vibes and I actually cried at one scene. The voice was so intoxicating.But then...not so much.As soon as Aza goes up, the amazing voice gets strangled in a complicated world full of rules and history and just strangeness that failed to captivate me. One of the big problems with this book (and others like it) is that Aza is thrust into this sky world with a million questions (rightfully so), but guess how many get answered? Not many. And instead of demanding answers, Aza just lets people dismiss her and literally put her to work swabbing the deck. It was extremely frustrating. Worst of all though, is that the plot and worldbuilding is so complicated and unique in the sky that Aza's character fades into generic girl in a fantasy novel. Maybe if she hadn't be so dynamic and alive in the first 1/3 of the book, I wouldn't have noticed as much, but she was so I did.Also the introduction of a love triangle was so anemic as to be pointless. And yet it looks like it might develop more in the sequel. Bleh.Overall, this would have been one of my favorite books if the last 2/3 of the book (the fantasy) had lived up to the 1/3 (the contemporary). I love fantasy YA, but this just didn't work on that level. I will anxiously await this author's next contemporary offering, but I won't be returning to Magonia.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHRIF2N3H987/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320521#wasThisHelpful","RXHRIF2N3H987","AFEYHFH2GH0QZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFEYHFH2GH0QZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 starsI had the wind knocked out of me reading the first book in this lush and gorgeous YA series with it's transportive but still immensely accessible fantasy/historical landscape.  I still get chills thinking about the impossibly heart wrenching love story between Kestrel and Arin. So while I quickly and eagerly embraced them and this world in THE WINNER'S CRIME, the book does fall prey to the second book syndrome with some slow parts.i understand that the trilogy as a whole dictates that Kestrel and Arin be apart for most of this book, but that doesn't mean that the story delivers the same engrossing experience that the first book did. There is a lot of guilt and pain due to numerous misunderstandings between the couple. Sure much of that is because Kestrel is nobly sacrificing herself for Arin's good, but it did skirt the frustrating line for me a few times. The middle of the book especially felt slow as very little happened to advance the plot or characters. In the hands of a lesser writer, that may have fatally wounded the book, but not so with Marie Rutkoski.  Her words paint beautifully and provocatively throughout. And the ending of this book is simply gutting. I was so caught up in the anguish of these characters that it felt like my own.Marie Rutkoski has crafted a masterful story in The Winner's Trilogy. This second installment may have slowed some in the middle, but there is not a force on earth that could keep me from the final book.

"This book is a Twilight knockoff. I knew this going in, but since I fell hard for Twilight when it came out I figured a little something similar might be fun--and it was, for the first hundred pages or so. After that, it became derivative and tedious.First, lets go through the Twilight checklist:-A girl (Caitlin) moves to a small town to live with family she barely knows.-She immediately catches the eye of the lethally hot loner (Adrian) that all the girls want.-After witnessing an inhuman feat and Adrian leaps in to rescue her from some unwanted attention, Caitlin learns he's a vampire-Adrian tries to stay away from her and even tries to be a jerk to protect her for her own good-Adrian's eyes change color, he's rich, and lives with his family of beautiful loners,-Adrian has a sister who has visions-The sister has a vision about Caitlin in danger so the whole family decides to protect her-Adrian sneaks into her room each night-So. Many. More.But honestly, I was fine with the initial setup, and the writing wasn't bad (it was intentionally funny in places), what killed this book for me was the non-Twilight stuff and the overwhelming need for an editor to cut all the extraneous stuff.  This book is close to 400 pages which is about 200 pages too long. It drags, big time. If someone told me this book started out as Twilight fan fiction, I wouldn't doubt it for a second. It feels like the authors just wrote extremely long, meandering chapters to meet some arbitrary word count. And as for the non-Twilight stuff involving a demon trying to impregnate teenage girls and really unsettling nightmares, blech. It was creepy with a big side of eww.Also, cliffhanger.

The textured leather feels great in the hand and provides a little extra grip that makes me think I won't be dropping my phone again, maybe ever. I also like that the bright tangerine color makes it easy to spot my phone in the endless abyss that is my purse. I even like the cute little owl logo.My only drawback is the price. This is easily twice as expensive as any phone case I've owned before (and twice, sometimes three times as expensive as other leather cases here on Amazon).

" 0:59 Mins Set up was slightly time consuming (maybe if you are a veteran juicer you'll be able to figure it out easily enough), but it took us about twenty minutes. We decided to try one of the included recipes, Cucumber Refresher, in the video using the low pulp screen (which should be called no pulp because there was nothing much to my delight). Probably not one I'll repeat from a flavor standpoint. I'd also forgo the foam guard since it backed up and started to overflow (see pic at the end of the video). Overall, I loved how quiet this juicer is compared to cheaper juicers I've owned in the past. The so-called 'wide feed chute' leaves something to be desired. Oh and the drip tray is great--it lifts right out so you can pour back in any overflow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNP95P6F4EGYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVNKGNU#wasThisHelpful","RNP95P6F4EGYA","AFEYHFH2GH0QZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFEYHFH2GH0QZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*Updated* They have updated the description to remove TracFone from the list of compatible networks. I've updated my rating to reflect that.I got this phone specifically to use with Tracfone's service (which I love and currently use on two phones). I had previously activated an iPhone 4s using Tracfone's Bring Your Own Phone (BYOP) option and it was a breeze. The compatibility claim on the very top of this page says:""US Compatibility Nationwide on all GSM Networks including AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket, MetroPCS, Tracfone, Straight Talk and others""I saw the name Tracfone and I was sold. I didn't even notice that this is a GSM phone, and Tracfone's BYOP program only works with CDMA phones (see screenshot). The bottom of Tracfone's BYOP website says:"" TracFone network access code works only with CDMA phones that are compatible with our service. Branded phones including, but not limited to Blackberry, Sprint, Virgin Mobile, Metro PCS, Boost Mobile, TracFone, Net10, Straight Talk and Safelink are not eligible for this program. Your device must be in good standing to be activated. Network access code and plans are not refundable.""I still went ahead and tried to register and activate it with Tracfone since there are often conflicting reports about the BYOP program, but as you can see from the picture of the online activation page, it is not compatible.  I'm disappointed because this is a great phone for the price with a huge screen (that's an iPhone 5 next to it for size comparison).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQQRWP75CQAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZEFDH8#wasThisHelpful","R3AQQRWP75CQAX","AFEYHFH2GH0QZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFEYHFH2GH0QZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great gate and we love the auto-close function. It did arrive with a rather large scratch (see photo), but other than that, it's working great for us. I will say the instructions were less than helpful (no written instructions all all, just tons of diagrams that made my eyes want to cross). I ended up finding two videos on Muchkin's Youtube channel that perfectly showed me how to install and add the extension (do a search for ""Wood & Steel Designer Gate/The Deco by Munchkin: Installation"" and then ""How to install extensions on Munchkin pressure-mount baby gates""). Do yourself a huge favor and skip the included instructions in favor of the video.It does come with the option to screw in anchor cups, but the gate can mount very securely without them (in my opinion) and then you have more flexibility to move the gate between doorways if you need to (which we do).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HK1GYQTIJX4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INT0Y7O#wasThisHelpful","R1HK1GYQTIJX4L","AFEYHFH2GH0QZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFEYHFH2GH0QZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another excellent new Middle Grade series from Jennifer A. Nielsen. I adored the Ascendance Trilogy and expected Nielsen's new series to be just as exciting, smart, and adventurous, and that's exactly what this debut is.I love the blend of magic, mythology, and history in MARK OF THE THIEF. And of course we get another smart mouthed protagonist who is wise and crafty beyond his years. While not quite as compelling as Sage from the Ascendance Trilogy, Nic proved to be a worthy successor. Both boys start out on the dregs of society (an orphan and a slave) yet rise to notoriety through a series of seemingly coincidental circumstances.The romance was a bit stilted for me, but I think that had to do with the timeline of this book. Everything happens very quickly (I think the entire book spans less than a week), so that is going to be something that hopefully stretches out more in subsequent books. Since the romance is a very small part of this book, I'm still sticking with five stars. If you love Percy Jackson, you are going to find a new best friend in Nic. Can't wait for the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WKEJW9SXX7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054556154X#wasThisHelpful","R38WKEJW9SXX7Z","AFEYHFH2GH0QZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFEYHFH2GH0QZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am trying this product because, although I do eat a fair amount of dark leafy greens, whole grains, and other foods which contain magnesium, I'm not sure I do so consistently enough. I became interested in magnesium because it is said to help with sleep, and also because I know it is a necessary nutrient to aid in calcium absorption, especially calcium from non-plant sources (such as dairy). I have some bone issues which lead me to believe I may have inorganic calcium deposits in my body, and I am curious whether the magnesium will help with that, or at least prevent future damage.Normally I shy away from supplements and try to get nutrients from a healthy diet. But these tablets are chelated, meaning bound to an amino acid which supposedly enables it to be absorbed more easily through the intestinal wall. For that reason I consider it to be better than non-chelated supplements.I have been taking it for a short time and nutritional supplements usually take some time to make a difference. But I do think my sleep is somewhat improved. Time will tell whether it has other effects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXZ6GZQA45BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JUEDZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3SXZ6GZQA45BL","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the look of this charge and sync dock when I first took it out of the box. It has a super-sturdy cord, and I like standing the phone up in the protective cradle to charge and sync rather than leaving it on the desktop. I love the red color; it's a pleasant change from black or white tech devices.What I first noticed though, was also mentioned by another reviewer: if you do not have a case, or use a thin case, the phone stands rather awkwardly with nothing supporting it in the front or back. Sounds like some other reviewers have the opposite problem: lack of space for their case.I own and use other Belkin chargers which seemed to charge fairly quickly. This charger seems to take longer. It also seemed to take longer to start up. Like my other Belkin chargers, this one came with no instructions or literature of any kind. I know that's because it is supposed to be self-evident how to use it, but it would help to have some kind of booklet so I would know if my expectations for the device are realistic and if it is working as it's designed to. Even the Amazon product page says very little, so it's hard to know what to expect.Plugging it into my laptop and inserting the iPhone in the cradle automatically opens up iTunes on my computer. This, too, seemed to take a long time for some reason. And, unlike when I sync my phone directly from the laptop, where I can see on iTunes that it's syncing, there was no indication, either on iTunes or on the phone itself, that it synced.So I give it three starts for looks, and for basic functionality, but it's not what I hoped for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTW1THGPH7VSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","RTW1THGPH7VSI","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 12 year old daughter who is an avid reader and writer. Despite not being a big history buff, she could not put this book down. The event that serves as the backdrop to the story-- the sinking of the MV Wilhelm Gustloff with the largest loss of life on a single ship in history-- was something neither of us had ever heard of, despite studying World War II extensively in home schooling as well as reading other books on maritime disasters! And believe me, this is a story worth telling. The format of the book, with characters speaking in turns over just a few pages each, makes it a real page-turner. Sepetys takes the story from being simply a ""historical event"" down to the very real, personal level of individual lives, relationships, and emotions. The characterization is excellent.

The scoreboard is small (and the ""eraser"" would have been better off left out, it's so laughable) but we're just using this for family fun so that doesn't matter. We do notice that the fibers don't heal over to seal the holes made by the darts, but my husband thinks that continued use will cause the fibers to get pushed back by darts hitting other places. (I'm not explaining that very well!) It was easy to mount, the only difficulty being how to protect the surrounding area from getting damaged!

"I bought this book after a friend recommended the author's blog. As a contemplative, I was immediately drawn to the title of her blog (which is the same as the book) and enjoyed some of her writings as well as the beautiful images she finds for her blog, though I admit I don't read any blog very often.However, I was a bit disappointed with the book. I found it repetitive, but especially, I was surprised that the author was apparently unaware that the concept of a cloistered heart (which can be described using a variety of terms but is basically a heart set aside for God and removed from the world) was not at all new. She spends some time sharing this discovery, and I confess I grew impatient with it early on. I hoped the book would go deeper. Instead I felt it was kind of surface-level.The book contains the author's journal entries from some years ago. I wish she had updated it with some of her more recent blog entries. And I think some commentary to flesh out the passages from her journals would also help flesh out the book. I think it's a beautiful concept that needed more depth beyond just journal entries. I can imagine a format where the author shares a journal entry, then comments on that entry, then offers a brief reflection.  That would be a great meditation resource for Eucharistic Adoration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCEIBZ0ZJN8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466494581#wasThisHelpful","R3UCEIBZ0ZJN8R","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a student in a Natural Healing program, this book is incredibly useful to me for a number of reasons. The descriptions of every disorder, its etiology, symptoms and signs, how it is diagnosed, and the standard medical treatments are extremely clear. It is helpful to me as an alternative health practitioner to know and understand the medical tests and treatments a client may have undergone before coming to me. The book contains all sorts of other aids: tables, diagrams, and more. For example, in the section on the elderly, there is a table of questions to ask to determine if depression is present, and a two-page spread on a home assessment for hazards that increase the risk of falling. I could list many things like this, but suffice it to say that the book is as useful as a home reference as it is for professionals.Naturally, the book has a certain bias toward standard western medicine and away from alternative practices. While it sometimes mentions alternative modalities such as acupuncture, herbs, and others, it rarely attributes to them their true effectiveness. For example, the book will say that ""well-designed studies"" have shown that this or that herb is ineffective. However, I am familiar with these herbs, and also with these ""well-designed studies."" They often isolate one chemical component from the plant, instead of studying it the way an herbalist would use it: as a whole plant. Or, they give laboratory animals the equivalent of enormous doses of herbs that no human being would ever take, and then conclude the herb is dangerous. Or, they use the herb in isolation, not with other herbs that accentuate its effectiveness, and usually without the dietary changes or other changes a holistic health practitioner would recommend, and then yes, the herb is less effective than it might be.The section on rheumatoid arthritis made me laugh; under ""Rest and Nutrition"" in the Treatment section, it reads ""An ordinary nutritious diet is generally sufficient...Food and diet quackery is common and should be discouraged."" Well, I know what most doctors and hospitals call ""ordinary nutritious food,"" though the book fails to spell it out for the reader. While there certainly IS dietary quackery out there, a well-balanced vegetarian diet, for example, is hardly quackery and has proven very helpful for many arthritic patients.In short, this book is very thorough, but use it for what it is: an extremely useful guide to every conceivable ""western"" disorder and the standard medical interventions used to treat them. Don't expect to find complete or balanced coverage of alternative treatments here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1805M54GIN8LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0911910190#wasThisHelpful","R1805M54GIN8LQ","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book for my son who is a huge James Patterson fan. What strikes him about this book is that, unlike previous Patterson books he's read which clue the reader in fairly early on as to whodunit while the characters try to solve the mystery, this one leaves the reader as much in the dark as the characters, which makes it a real page turner. My son is a teenager, and I appreciate that Patterson's books are gripping and exciting with a minimum of bad language or sexual content.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NO1WBMW7TDET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446574724#wasThisHelpful","R2NO1WBMW7TDET","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time I thought affirmations were somewhat silly, probably because the ones I was exposed to were really simplistic and uninspiring, the tone often like ""cheerleading"" which is not my style. The affirmations in this book, though, are beautifully written and really speak to my heart. There is something in here for virtually every life situation, though many are general enough to use simply when you feel chaotic, stressed, upset, or any other negative emotion that you want to turn around. They are poetic, never seem false, and really impart a sense of peace and confidence. reading these affirmations really feels like truth, rather than something forced which I am trying to convince myself is true. After reading them for awhile, I find myself making up similar affirmations of my own in difficult situations, when I can't sleep, etc. I love this book and hope there are more by this author. I'd like to find one that is not in Kindle form to carry with me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE6P7LKQSNOCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VIND2M#wasThisHelpful","RE6P7LKQSNOCM","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading a lot lately about the power of affirmations, forgiveness, and basically, most of the themes represented in this book. And so when offered this book for free in exchange for a review, I thought I would give it a try.First of all, I am growing very weary of the ""Ten Things You Need to Know About XYZ,"" ""The Five Most Important Points About PQR,"" ""The Twelve Best ABC of All Time,"" etc. I see that device all over the internet on blogs, as well as in a plethora of book titles, and I'm really tired of it. It gives the impression that the author has summed up all there is to know on a topic. It taps into our need for a quick fix, for a simple plan all laid out in easy steps. In short, it's a marketing tool, and when I see it in spiritual or self-help topics, I cringe. So the subtitle of this book, ""7 Spiritual Practices to Heal Your Life,"" does not appeal to me.Second, this is an expensive book. It's a small hardcover with thick pages, kind of gift-book style, that could have been produced much less expensively. The content could have fit into a thin paperback.Much of the book consists in a conversation between the two authors. I found much of the conversation to be simplistic-- things you will have read before if you've read anything at all on these topics. I felt the conversational style took up unnecessary space and took many words to convey what could have been said in far fewer.Some of the concrete suggestions, such as the Affirmation Board where you will make a collage of everything you say ""yes"" to (not what your parent, spouse, or anyone else says yes to, just you), are creative and helpful. I like the idea of a visual Affirmation Board rather than a list that will get lost somewhere in a journal. It's meant to be an evolving self-portrait, and I like that idea very much; I might actually do that one.  Other suggestions, such as using a Forgiveness Scale of 1-100 to determine how much I've forgiven self and others, does not resonate with me. Those numbers would be hard to gauge and kind of meaningless, as well as possibly another reason for guilt.To sum up, there are a few good concrete ideas in this book, but otherwise the content, though valid, is nothing new: forgiveness, loving your inner child, learning to receive, gratitude, choosing love over fear. It's a very quick read somewhat expensively packaged. Wait for the paperback or try the authors' other books first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHXHE2O2TY91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946143#wasThisHelpful","R1VHXHE2O2TY91","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was going to be our cat's Christmas gift (and it would have been the biggest gift in the whole family!), but we just couldn't wait so we went ahead and set it up. Actually, my 12 year old daughter set it up fairly quickly and without any major hassles. This Cat Tree is HUGE. Kind of like a penthouse for cats. And it's heavy, which is a good thing because we have a hefty 15-pound Maine Coon. This cat tree or tower is very sturdy and can easily handle the weight of my cat or even a heavier one. The hammock might sag a bit under a heavy cat's weight, but no big deal, and I don't notice any other wobbling.We are placing this in front of a sunny window where our indoor cat likes to watch birds, squirrels, and passers-by. So far she has scratched at the ramp and explored the various sitting/sleeping surfaces. She has always been wary of going inside small spaces, especially if she's not sure there is space to turn around, so she hasn't tried the little hidey-hole or the tunnel yet, or put her head through the hole at the top of the ramp. But she also dislikes being observed until she perfects things, so she will probably try these out late at night when no one is standing there saying ""Come on, Virgil!"" and trying to coax her into it.The little ""tunnel"" (as I call it) is kind of oddly placed near the very top of the tree, so that when a cat emerges from it, there is nothing to step onto. That's one concern; I'm not sure she will like going through a tube that leads nowhere. And, as with every other one I have ever seen, the little roofed hidey-hole is rather snug for a large cat. I'll be hiding some treats in there, and she can either muster the courage to go in, or simply challenge herself to find a way to get them out! But she often surprises me with the places she likes to explore or sleep (for example, sleeping on a pile of coat hangers when a soft pillow is right nearby... or exploring the dark, cobweb-draped basement...or napping in the bathroom sink...) So she might end up loving those features.I am going to attach a few items to dangle from the tunnel so she can bat at them while lounging on the big pawprint below. I like the fact that there are scratching surfaces everywhere, a big plus for an indoor cat. Most cat scratching posts, since they offer no other interest or appeal and tend to topple easily, are pretty much worthless as far as diverting my car from the pleasures of scratching at our upholstery, but I think this Cat Tree just might do the trick and save our couches.I am extremely impressed with this Cat Tree for size, sturdiness, and the variety of places and surfaces to explore. Its soft carpeted surfaces are really cozy, with plenty of scratching surfaces to boot. Just be aware that you need a pretty big chunk of real estate in your house to accommodate it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFELGIEO1B3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY25OK2#wasThisHelpful","R1KFELGIEO1B3M","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I seem to be the first person so far who is not happy with this ring. It comes in an impressive presentation box, though one might want to remove the ""Made in China"" sticker before gifting. But upon opening the box, I was struck right away by the lack of sparkle to this ring. The white cubic zirconias just have a somewhat dull appearance, almost like ordinary glass. The green ones are so pale that they don't really stand out. The rhodium looks cheap and kind of industrial, more like stainless steel than a fine metal. Granted, Amazon is offering this ring for $14.30 (marked down from $39.99). But that's exactly what it looks like to me: a $14 ring. Another reviewer says hers sparkles and shines and catches the light; unfortunately mine definitely does not.

"This book is definitely not what I expected. The author is renowned and obviously knowledgeable, but what I was hoping from a book subtitled ""An Integration of Western Herbs Into the Traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic Systems"" was just that: a book on Western herbs, used according to Chinese and Ayurvedic principles. As someone trained in Chinese herbology, while I have a great love for the principles and system of Chinese medicine and believe it can be applied to anyone anywhere in the world since it is based on natural laws, I have lately been drawn to using local, or at least American, herbs instead of Chinese. It makes sense to me that the plants available in our own region would be best suited for our healing, just as local and seasonal foods are the healthiest for us. I hoped this book would use Western herbs according to the Chinese system.Instead, many of the herbs in this book are Chinese and Ayurvedic, mixed in with western herbs. The formulas, too, contain a combination of Asian and Western herbs. To me, this simply confuses the picture. Yes, the meridian and organs that western herbs enter are given. And they are placed in broad categories, though even here I find the same east-west mix, with some of the categories (""Surface-relieving"") being Chinese, and others (""Emmenagogues"") being western. But as far as, say, categorizing Western herbs according to Chinese or Ayurvedic properties, or taking a Chinese or Ayurvedic pattern of disharmony and offering a formula to address it using western herbs, that does not happen in this book.Therefore, while good basic information is given for each herb, this book did not serve the purpose I had hoped for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SF113V48X87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941524272#wasThisHelpful","R21SF113V48X87","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful book by one of the best-known old time American herbalists. I hear Dr. Shook referred to again and again in my herbal studies at the School of Natural Healing, founded by Dr. John Christopher, another great old-time herbalist. The book is in the form of lessons, which were based on a lecture series. Each lesson introduces different herbs as well as preparations and formulas that include those herbs. Many of the preparations and formulas are quite simple (this being an Elementary Treatise, but also because there is no need to complicate something when it works well). Dr. Shook also includes some questions after each lesson to self-test your grasp of the material, with answers provided after the following lesson.What I like best is the conversational style of Dr. Shook. He speaks to the reader like a friend or esteemed colleague, sharing lore and experience. His love and respect for herbal medicine is infectious (no pun intended!) Like every herbalist, Dr. Shook had his favorite herbs, and many of those he favors are quite well known. A few others, however, were unfamiliar to me.There are 20 lessons, and if one read a lesson per day, preparing one or more of the formulas for each lesson, you could acquire a considerable foundation in herbology in about 3 weeks, as well as a medicine cabinet full of remedies for common situations.There is a second volume, Advanced Treatise in Herbology, which is twice as long as this book and which you should definitely get for a more thorough treatment of herbal medicine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9UW2FYT9DIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006S457A#wasThisHelpful","R1P9UW2FYT9DIV","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love this planner. And where planners are concerned, I'm very hard to please! I can never seem to find one that suits my planning style, that has a design I won't tire of, or what-have-you. This one is perfect for me.First of all, ""Beautiful Day"" is a very apt name for this planner, as it is really lovely, from the matte, suede-like violet cover to the floral pages within. Each season's calendar pages are a different color, with a subtle watercolor flowered design.I like the way the cover partially covers the metal wire binding. This will prevent the binding from getting bent or damaged, which has happened to me with some other binders with the metal binding fully exposed, after being carried and knocked around for some months. This one looks like it will hold up.Labeled tabs make it easy to flip to the desired month. Opening to a month first takes you to a 2-page spread of the entire month at a glance, with lines to record the major events of that month. That makes it easy to see in one glance which days are booked and which are free for events, vacations, etc.After that is a two-page spread for each week, with space from top to bottom for each day. The day's space is divided into hours from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., with plenty of space for recording scheduled activities. That's one of the things I love about this planner: it gives ample space to actually write! And, the spaces are lined, unlike some planners which just leave an open block to write in. I find the lines encourage me to write more neatly; if there's just an empty space, I tend to scrawl. Saturday and Sunday are each given half the space of the weekdays, with lines but without an hourly breakdown.The planner goes from January to January. If, like me, you have found yourself needing to schedule things for early in the year without having next year's planner yet (or not wanting to carry two planners around, or scribble notes all over the December page), you will appreciate this. I can schedule January 2017 while still using my 2016 planner, and then simply transfer those items to the new planner.After the calendar pages, there are 4 pages for contacts, 6 pages for notes, and a one-page Event Calendar with a space for each month. Finally, there is a one-page Holiday List giving the dates for a large number of holidays (including Canada and Mexico!) from 2016 through 2019. It's helpful to have these all in one place so you don't have to flip through the planner to find them. This includes things like Daylight Savings Time, for which I would never know where to look if I had to flip through the calendar to find it.One reviewer commented on the need to copy everything from the contacts page to a new planner the following year, since the pages aren't removable. Well, this just isn't that kind of planner, and most in this price range aren't. There are plenty of Day Runner-type planners with removable pages that cost a fortune. The covers alone can cost several times what this planner costs, without even adding pages.A very attractive, very functional planner. It's uplifting to just look at it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVMHFSSNJEUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWVTSOY#wasThisHelpful","R1IVMHFSSNJEUZ","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the title, I thought this was a votive candle, though the fine print does say it uses tea lights. So rather than a votive candle burning down and glowing from within, the little tea candle sits in the uppermost part of the candle holder, where its flame always remains visible. The candle holder has a matte, snow white finish, a subtle gold rim around the top, a somewhat chunky style, and the quality Lenox is known for.The pretty raised design, of Santa in his sleigh pulled by reindeer, wraps all the way around the candle holder so that part of the design is visible from any direction. It would be an attractive part of a greenery centerpiece, on a mantle, a side table, or anywhere.The price and size make it a perfect hostess gift, or a gift for your child's favorite teacher.

"In our family we play a lot of games, and the age gap is fairly wide. What I like about this game versus Scrabble or Boggle is that building upwards instead of just two-dimensionally gives the younger kids a better chance of forming words. Their vocabularies may be more limited and so they are often frustrated in other word games when they play against older opponents because they can't make as many words.

"We are big board-game players in our house, but playing at the dining room table (the only suitable space) has always presented certain problems. Only one person gets the board facing them, and trying to turn it around causes pieces to get moved, etc. Someone always has the most uncomfortable seat. Someone is always too short for the table. So a certain amount of time is spent adjusting all this while trying to focus on the game.I was kind of reluctant to get this game set, as my 14-year-old is a bit too obsessed with his X-Box One, and I have a knee-jerk prejudice against anything high-tech, always being staunchly loyal to the old-fashioned or low-tech version of anything. Then it dawned on me: not only would this game pack solve some of the problems of playing at the table, but it would also involve the whole family and draw my son out of XBox-Isolation!It's great for everyone to be able to find their comfy spot in the living room and all be able to see the whole game from the same perspective.

"This is the best chocolate I have even eaten, hands down. And I've been given a lot of chocolate in my day, being a member of a family of foodies and inveterate chocolate lovers.First of all, it arrives at your door packed in a fitted heavy outer cardboard box to protect the precious contents. Nestled inside that is the cello-wrapped chocolate box itself. Around this, as a hint of delights to come, is a ribbon attaching a little colored booklet containing a photo and description (in English and French) of each type of candy in the box. Have you ever bitten into a chocolate without knowing what was inside and winced because it wasn't what you expected? Well, this little booklet solves that problem-- or WOULD solve it, if it wasn't for the fact that you will love EVERY kind of chocolate in this box!Once past the plastic, the next part of the ritual is to break a sealed sticker that assures the box has been reserved just for you. Then, on one side of the box, you press a little opening with your finger, which pushes the box containing the chocolates, drawer-like, out the other side.Lift the paper covering the chocolates, and the moment you have been waiting for has finally arrived.""Silken"" is the word that comes to mind when I eat these chocolates. First of all, they are visually beautiful and perfect. But the proof is in the pudding. Biting into one reveals them to be delicate, rich yet understated, and yes, silken, with melt-in-your-mouth chocolate combined with just enough other special ingredients to make each one a unique experience.The names of the different chocolates are as evocative as their descriptions in the little booklet. Some of the delights you will sample includeMidnight Delight: ""a crisp dark chocolate shell reveals a velvety heart of tempting dark ganache.""Dark Lemonette: ""Rich cocoa center with a delicate hint of lemon, decorated with a fine arabesque.""Mocca Gianduja: ""Rich, coffee heart embraced by smoothly melting gianduja with a light cocoa note.""Those are the only ones of the 11 varieties that I am going to reveal! You'll just have to wait and wonder about the rest...These chocolates are a little pricey, but they are completely worthy of any special event you might think of: as corporate gifts, a gift for that important person you want to impress but don't know what to give, Valentine's Day, Christmas, or any occasion. Everyone who has sampled these (and believe me, it was not easy to share) has agreed 100 percent that these chocolates rate the highest possible number of stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL2V13AKBTR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3PL2V13AKBTR7","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The workmanship on this shirt is excellent. The buttons are all sewn on tightly, the stitching is precise.

In fact, compared with some other oxford shirts with the same pattern/color scheme, this one is quite bright. The fit IS a tad ""trim"" as the description states (I missed that when ordering!). But to me the main issue is, the fabric is a bit stiff. Hoping it will soften a bit with wear and washings. Not sure how it can be ""100 percent Polyester, 100 Percent Cotton"" as the description states! It's actually 60% cotton, 40% poly.

"I considered buying ""Spilling Ink"" instead of this book based on some of the reviews, especially one that stated the buyer had tried all the other young writers' books and liked that one best. But as I skimmed through it online, I felt it had a jaded quality. I also concurred with one reviewer who thought it had some harsh topics and language to which her children had not been exposed, and I certainly did not want that. So I went with this one. Its title, cover, unpretensiousness, and lack of ""attitude"" appealed to me and seemed a better fit for my daughter.I am so glad I did. It fits my daughter's interests, personality, and writing style so much more. It's not trying to turn her into a young sophisticate; it is geared toward bringing out the magic, wistfulness, creativity, and wonder in a young writer's heart. My 12 year old will be receiving this for Christmas along with a special journal and other writing supplies.I know she will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RCHP8GQYAU9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006236717X#wasThisHelpful","R2RCHP8GQYAU9G","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scanner is great. It doesn't really come with much of a manual, so it took some time for me to figure out how to use it. I would use it to scan book ISBN codes in order to inventory the books on Amazon Seller, or to search for the book on the internet, or within Amazon, to find its value. Really, all you have to do is have its little dongle receiver plugged into a USB port, have Amazon's search function open, or have a search engine open, with the cursor within the search bar, press the trigger and scan a bar code. The ISBN code is automatically pasted into the search bar, and the search brings up whatever data is available.It can also be used to check inventory, and various other purposes.It is implied that it works with cellphones, but a closer reading of the scanty manual seems to indicate that it only works with Windows phones.It will also send the barcode number into other applications. For instance, if you set it on the store setting (using the handy barcode card provided; the scanner has no controls other than the trigger) it will store a large number of numbers scanned from barcodes, and then when you do the upload (again with that card) it can upload the data into a word processor, or spreadsheet, with line returns so that the data is entered vertically in a column.Aside from the fact that it was hard to figure out how to use it from the manual, I like it very much. It is quick, accurate, and fun to use, and if I knew what some of the other functions listed in the manual were, I could probably find other uses for it. Alas, the manual doesn't tell you what they are, so you'd have to either guess from the title of the function, or do some research on it. I could not find a website for the scanner, but maybe someone else has, and maybe there would be more useful info there...? I'd like to be able to use this with my iPhone at book sales.It came charged, and charges via the usb port of the computer, but could also be charged with a usb charger adapter. It seems to hold a charge for a good long time.It wills stand on its own, but precariously. The handle has a flat bottom, but it is narrow. I would only want to do this if I wanted to leave it standing and pass barcodes in front of it, but, you still have to pull the trigger, so what's the point of having it stand by itself. I'd just lay it on its side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KH2P2UX6HETT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1541Q6#wasThisHelpful","R3KH2P2UX6HETT","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I seem to be in the minority here, but I am not as enamored of this laptop cooling fan as most other reviewers are.The fan does not mount well universally to all laptops. On mine, the plate in one position will block the laptop's fan air intake, in another position, the plate is blocked by the laptop's rubber foot. So, I was not able to get a perfect mounting position.Also, the fan uses the laptop USB for power, which would seem to add an electrical load to the laptop, making it run even hotter, so does this balance out, cooling what would not be so hot if the fan were not plugged in? Perhaps one could plug it into an adapter rather than the laptop, IF you have an adapter. It doesn't come with one.At a median speed, it does not seem too loud. Once mounted, I could feel warm air exiting the fan, which seems to indicate that it is cooling the laptop. At a higher speed it is pretty loud.I was not able to get a really secure seal between the laptop and the silicone ""lip"" due to the awkwardness of the positioning in order to avoid the rubber ""foot,"" but it seemed to be fine as long as the laptop didn't move. It is nice to be able to remove the fan easily by sliding it off of its mounting plate.I'm not positive there is a true advantage to using this fan, but I am guessing there is a little advantage. To me, the results simply were not as dramatic as I'd hoped.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRCTNRRNW8GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FIVGPE#wasThisHelpful","R1SRCTNRRNW8GS","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought my daughter the $49.95 Kindle Fire for Christmas along with the Amazon Fire Case. The case had already been shipped when I was offered this NuPro Fire case for free in exchange for an unbiased review. I thought, great, I'll return the Amazon case and let her use this!I am sooo glad I did not do that. This case is a real disappointment. First, the cover for her Kindle Paperwhite (also a low-end cover) is made of similar material and got really scratched and torn up fairly quickly with normal use. This case feels cheap and bulky compared with the Amazon case.Second, this case simply does NOT stand. It just flops over annoyingly often. And when you fold the stand, you have to expose the inside lining of the case to the table surface, which means, when you close the case again, anything that may have been on the table could now be directly on the screen of your Kindle Fire: crumbs, a dab of butter, etc. These $49.95 Kindle Fires are being marketed for kids, so this could be an issue.The third problem is obvious right from the start: it ONLY stands in landscape mode, not portrait mode. That's a major drawback. Especially for reading Kindle books.Lastly, this lacks the auto-sleep function of the Amazon case. That function is really such a convenience. It seems like a small issue, but when you use the Kindle Fire a lot, pressing the on/off button repeatedly becomes a pain. With the auto-sleep function, you never have to close the case and then wonder whether you turned it off or not, and this NuPro case does not have that.Since the Kindle Fires this case was made for cost a mere $49.95, don't stint the extra $10 bucks for the Amazon case which is so much better. We're talking a ten dollar difference between this NuPro case and the Amazon one which has many features this one lacks. I love the Amazon case I got for my Kindle Fire HD 8. It is slim and trim, folds quickly and crisply to stand the Kindle Fire in either position, has auto-sleep, and is made of better materials.  I am so glad I held onto the Amazon case I ordered for my daughter's Kindle Fire because I will NOT be giving her this NuPro case!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPUL2DHW2ZI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LRVCTS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPUL2DHW2ZI4","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light is excellent. The floodlight feature has 2 brightness settings, one bright, another VERY bright. It also has a flasher for emergency use on a dark road.It has an adjustable stand, which seems to work pretty well. It didn't get as tight as I would have liked, but the light stayed in place without flopping over. I can imagine that if I were using it while working on something that required me to move it a lot, I'd have to be occasionally readjusting the positioning of the stand. It has a carrying handle which allows you to carry it sort of like a lantern, which is nice, but you can carry it by the body since the light doesn't seem to get hot.It came partly charged, and it didn't take too long to get it fully charged.I am very happy with the light, and look forward to the difficult applications, such as working under a car in the dark when usually I can barely see anything, and my former trouble light is difficult to position in a useful way.It is light enough to carry, too, so if a kid wanted a bright light for the walk home from a late football game, or for Halloween, it would definitely work for that. It would also be great for camping trips, fishing trips, power outages, hunting for things in the dark corners of my attic or garage, as a workroom light...the possibilities are endless.I think it's incredible that this can be used to charge mobile devices as well! What is worse in an emergency than a dead cellphone battery!

"Everything about this watch is BIG! You will definitely have to be a fairly large person to carry off a watch of this size.It's an attractive watch and works well. Though it would look best on a larger man, I think most men will still have to remove some links. Note: the edges of the watch face where the incised grooves are (at each of the hours) are a bit sharp, sharp enough to scratch and possibly to snag clothing.Some features I like:1. the tachymeter for measuring speed.2. It's waterproof to 330 feet.3. The subdials and date window.4. The substantial feel.5. The burnished gold color.The packaging for the watch I received is black faux leather with red lettering, not yellow as in the photo. The packaging is kind of overkill, but your recipient will be wowed as they open layer after layer to reveal the treasure within: First is a heavy outer cardboard box. This opens to reveal some fancy patterned tissue paper hinting at something precious beneath. Within that is the large faux leather presentation box, with a decorative rippled design and stitching. Inside that is padded white faux suede holding the watch. A little cloth covers the watch, while inside the box's lid is a pocket stuffed with instructions, warranty, extended warranty offer, owner's manual, etc.The attractive watch and snazzy presentation would make this a great gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OWG4UKZYNJ2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XNO0#wasThisHelpful","R2OWG4UKZYNJ2I","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter has a dog-walking business, and it's nice for her to have healthy treats to offer them to distract and calm them when sticky situations crop up. She tried these on a pair of corgis she walks every day, and they loved them! She walks them around the neighborhood and then to a wooded area where she lets them rest and sniff around on their own. They have a habit of barking at another dog they meet just before getting to those woods. Using the Nylabone, she distracted the corgis till they got to their usual stopping place, where she was able to reward them with these treats for not barking.

"I got this for my 6'2"" fashion-conscious 14-year-old. He's big enough to wear a watch of this size, and this watch is BIG. My son has a penchant for black clothing and so this watch goes well with everything he owns. He also has a penchant for walking in the rain, so the waterproof feature is a plus. The watch arrived in a bulky, black cube-shaped presentation box, pre-set and ready to go. I feel that this watch looks much more expensive than it is (based on the current $59.55 price, NOT the absurd $550 price). Which is a good thing because he's lost every watch he ever owned. It's very eye-catching without being gaudy. This will be a Christmas gift and I know just what he'll say when he opens it: ""Sick!!!""

"First of all, my kids and I agree that these Teriyaki Beef Steak bites are definitely NOT tender. In fact, they're kind of chewy. In a way, that makes them more satisfying because they last longer, which is a good thing, because, at 70 calories per three smallish pieces, I don't want to consume too many of these, which I would definitely do if they went down too easily.My 12 year old daughter (the most adventurous eater in the family who likes venison, beef heart, and snails) could take them or leave them. The real revelation was when my 14 year old son's face lit up at first bite. An inquisitive lad with very eclectic interests, when it comes to food his tastes are extremely pedestrian and narrow. He refuses to eat anything served in the school cafeteria, and for his lunches packed from home, he will eat only three things: fried chicken, rotisserie chicken, and plain turkey sandwiches with nothing else but ketchup, on white bread or rolls only. For snacks, he will only eat cookies, crackers, etc. Believe me, I have packed many a healthy, varied lunch for him, only to learn that he either traded it for junk, or else literally didn't eat all day rather than let salad, whole wheat bread, or fruit pass his lips. The fact that he loves these Jack Links gives me another snack alternative for him beyond junky baked goods. And, they actually taste pretty good! I don't usually like teriyaki, but I liked these. He LOVES them.Now, don't get me wrong, these are NOT health food. They contain sugar, hydrolized corn solids, potassium sorbate as a preservative, and, perhaps most troubling of all, MSG. (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5). So this is not something anyone should be eating on a daily basis. Also, they are, I think, quite expensive, and there's not a whole lot in the bag. But as an occasional high-protein snack that is fairly satisfying to eat, they have their place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCC77F589XP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDWY5J0#wasThisHelpful","R2MCC77F589XP8","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We go through a lot of water bottles in our house, especially my 12 year old daughter who is very athletic and is always bringing bottles of water, juice, or smoothies to her dance class or games--and and then leaving them there. So I liked the idea of an 8-pack of bottles. My husband refuses to drink anything stored in plastic, and likes to keep some chilled water on hand, so these will be handy. So I was excited to be offered these bottles in exchange for an honest review.The first problem was, they were packed in a smaller box inside a larger box, the smaller box arrived opened and upside-down, and one of the bottles had smashed. So I have a lot of glass chips and glass dust to clean up.The second problem is, the caps are really flimsy plastic. They bend easily in my hand and I can imagine they will not hold up well to repeated washings. They just don't seem really snug. They are also completely smooth, which means you can't get any grip on them at all with your hands, so tightening them or loosening them is a bit frustrating. I wish they were stiffer plastic with some texture so that they could be gripped more easily.The glass seems cheap; the seams are visible, and the glass appears to be of inconsistent thickness. Time will tell how easily they break.I do like the inclusion of the bottle brush.

"Wow, I really dislike the smell of this cat food! But my cat seems to like it. We have dry food available all day, and then put out wet food for her in the evening. We've found that if we put it out during the day, it just sits there in the bowl, but if we put it out later, she makes multiple nocturnal trips to the bowl and it is gone by morning. The price is a little bit high compared to other brands we commonly purchase in the supermarket, but still reasonable. Our cat is definitely a sauce lover, usually licking the sauce up first and going back for the chunks later. I like the flavor assortment, as our cat has never liked beef cat food in any form.

"This is the second volume I have purchased by this author. I am an herbalist and have often been surprised when, on walks through the woods when I encounter intriguing mosses, lichens, Indian pipes, etc., I realize I know nothing of their medicinal uses. For a long time I assumed they had none, until a book on the history of western herbalism clued me in to the fact that they do, in fact, have uses. That book gave scanty practical information, though.So I was pleased to discover this volume on ancient medicinal remedies. It gives a lot of little-known information on these ancient remedies as they were and are used by Native Americans in our own country, as well as in other parts of the world. The author includes a lot of historical information on each form of primitive vegetation included, as well as anecdotes and clinical experiences of other practitioners, including personality traits and spiritual aspects associated with each remedy. The book really breaks new ground and makes a unique contribution to herbal literature.However, the book suffers from a few problems:The first is, disorganization. The reader has to work awfully hard to figure out which member of the genus or family the author is talking about. For example, under Club Moss, numerous variations are listed, and throughout that chapter, the author switches back and forth from one to another instead of describing each in an ordered, systematic way. In a book on medicine, it's important to keep this information straight so as not to confuse one remedy for another.Second, the lack of clear separations between the chapters, the varieties of typeface, and the lack of paragraph indenting make the book hard on the eye, as the material seems to all run together.Third, the book is a little uneven. The types of information given for each remedy are inconsistent; for example, chemical composition is given for some but not others, and so forth.Fourth, the almost total lack of footnotes. There is a bibliography, but it lists literally hundreds of books that I seriously doubt were all used for this particular volume. In fact, the other book I own by this author uses the identical bibliography, and I suspect it is used in all his books, and therefore isn't helpful in figuring out what sources he used to research the present work. The lack of footnoting is very unhelpful because it leaves the reader unable to either verify or follow up on the material. Various Native American tribes and their usage of these remedies is mentioned throughout; I'd like to be able to delve into that more. And various other herbalists offer their experiences and perspectives on these remedies; where did these come from? We are not told.In short, this book and the others by this author, while containing a wealth of information, appear hastily put together and poorly edited. If the organization was cleaned up and the information properly footnoted, this would become a first-rate series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R400KZH00OQGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497313244#wasThisHelpful","R400KZH00OQGH","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Any other bottled dressing tastes stale to me after using Bragg's, and making dressing from scratch can be time consuming. But I feel great about everything in this bottle. It is SO flavorful, yet contains only simple, natural ingredients. It goes to show what quality ingredients can taste like without all sorts of additives.

"I received a review copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review. I selected it with my 12 year old daughter in mind, as she loves fantasy, loves to write, has a best friend with whom she is involved in a lot of creative endeavors, and so I thought this would right be up her alley.Although our uncorrected proof did not have the graphics (it did contain descriptions of the graphics which will appear in each section), my daughter rates it at 5 stars. She felt the plot was extremely creative, and liked the way Libby, the missing girl, used the Princess X story she and her friend May had created together when they were younger as a call for help, using clues only May would understand. She liked how someone they did not know helped capture the antagonist, and return Libby to her best friend May. She found it held her attention throughout.She would rate it 5 stars, but I took off one stars because of two concerns. First, there are two instances of swearing in the book. But more importantly, I am disturbed that so many recent books for this age range include a tragic and disturbing scenario-- in this case (spoiler alert), a man kills Libby's parents and kidnaps her to replace his own daughter who is dead. For a 12 year old, I find such a distressing plot device to be unnecessary. Yes, my daughter liked the book-- but I'm not thrilled with her becoming inured to stories of parricide and kidnapping. She hears enough about such things just by living in the modern world. Yes, there are other compelling aspects to the story-- the power of friendship and the meaningful bond created between the two friends through the Princess X character and how it ultimately leads to a semi-happy ending. But I feel about this book the same way about James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl: there too, the parents are killed right off the bat, and the ""happy ending"" has James living with a bunch of friendly insects. Both endings left me with a bit of a heartache.I LOVE the plot device of the Princess X character created by May and Libby. Very unique! I just wish it were used to resolve a less disturbing scenario.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LWP9GRTGUTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545620856#wasThisHelpful","R8LWP9GRTGUTP","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to review this product because my cat won't eat it. Another reviewer mentioned that it has almost no smell-- I agree, and that's a plus for humans perhaps, but might result in not enticing a cat to try it. Or maybe it's just not my cat's cup of tea. Cats are all individuals with individual tastes.As far as nutritional content, I applaud the absence of grains, and not only because they are potential allergens. Grains are simply not something a cat would ever choose to eat. They only do so when the grains are flavored by other ingredients. But then again, most of the ingredients in this product would never be naturally eaten by cats, such as peas and potatoes.Which brings me to the reason I give this three stars. There are SO many nutrients listed, such as vitamins, minerals, probiotics and various plant extracts, that it seems like the shotgun approach. I can't imagine that there can be much of any one of these in this food. I mean, come on, Green Tea and Spearmint extracts are at the bottom of a list of about 50 ingredients. How much can there actually be in this food? There's more canola oil in this product than the Duck which features so prominently on the label. Canola oil is a very unhealthy oil. It is genetically modified and has been shown in numerous studies to have many health risks.I think we as pet owners are making the mistake of thinking that what's good for humans must be good for our pets, and the more supplements we can cram in there, even if each is in such a time amount as to probably be ineffectual, we have ""covered our bases."" Most of the items in this food are things that are not a natural part of a cat's diet.Why can't someone make a cat food that contains, simply, what a cat in nature would choose to eat? The animals the cat would naturally hunt, and the kinds of greens they would naturally nibble? On a trip to Ireland I noticed cans of Squirrel and Rabbit cat food on the shelves. Why not here?I am glad some people's pets enjoy this product, and have appeared to be healthier for it.

"I use a lot of fresh-squeezed lemon juice in cooking but always dread squeezing the lemons. No matter what method I use, it seems to be messy and inefficient.This Superjuicer has changed all that. This product has good, old-fashioned quality; you can feel that it was made to last for years. It's very heavy and sturdy, which is necessary to survive squeezing lemon after lemon.This tool keeps your hands virtually free of lemon juice. No more picking seeds out of the juice. Just pop in a lemon half, give it a good squeeze, and the juice comes out of the 7 holes in the bottom into your cup, leaving the seeds and peel behind. Just open it up and drop the lemon seeds and peel into the compost, garbage disposal, trash, or whatever. All you need to do to wash it is just rinse it off, but it IS dishwasher safe. The silicone coating on the handles is non-slip and makes gripping the Superjuicer completely comfortable.It makes an annoying job so easy. I will never be tempted to use bottled lemon juice just to avoid squeezing lemons again. Great product.

"A great idea, though I'd seen similar attempts by others on the internet before I heard if this author. It's a concept I thought would appeal to my 14 year old pop-music-fanatic son who has an appreciation for Shakespeare. The sonnets are cleverly written and have an authentic Bardic ring to them. The book is aesthetically pleasing, with its archaic-looking typeface and illustrations. It's a convenient size to carry in order to regale your friends. The tongue-in-cheek introduction gives us the ""history"" of Shakespeare's sonnets which purportedly ""inspired"" pop songs. So far so good.However, there are two problems with the book.The first can't be helped, since this IS a book of ""Shakespearean Spins"" on pop songs, with a Shakespearean meter to match. But to me, the Shakespearean versions lose some of their humor when you can't sing them to the original music. They don't fit, and so the book is a bit more cerebral and a bit less fun.Second, the author cast his net wide and the choices of pop songs span generations and styles. That means, unless you are a ""person of a certain age"" who nonetheless listens to current pop music, or someone younger who has dug deep and appreciates pop music of bygone eras along with current hits, there will be a fair number songs in this book with which the reader will be unfamiliar. That, too, takes away the fun and makes the book's audience a little fuzzy. But there is a generous number of sonnets in the book. And the real fun, for me, is the way the book elevates the pop artists' work to a higher level. But you pretty much have to know the pop lyrics by heart to fully appreciate these ""spins.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2IDRH3EV740/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594748284#wasThisHelpful","RY2IDRH3EV740","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a small family and for years I have blindly bought the cheapest individual rolls of toilet paper in the store, deceived by the high number of ""sheets"" per roll and the length of the roll. Despite the need to use excessive amounts of this cheap paper due to the fact that it tears easily and doesn't absorb a lot, I kept buying the same thing.Finally I bought Quilted Northern ""Soft and Strong"" toilet paper on sale, and discovered that we needed to use dramatically less paper. However, the ""soft"" feature caused the paper to leave behind little bits which hardly seemed clean.I had the opportunity to try this Charmin Ultra Strong paper for free, and it's fantastic. Strong enough so you don't waste sheet after sheet, and it leaves behind NO maddening little bits of paper. The price is only slightly above $1 a roll, which is what I was paying for my cheap store brand, and is cheaper than other ""strong"" brands in my local store, so I need look no further.

"Our whole family uses the XBox One to watch movies on our widescreen TV. It can be maddeningly slow to use the XBox controller to hunt-and-peck each individual letter on the screen to search for a movie or TV show. I have always been stunned that something as high tech as the XBox couldn't find a better way. This keyboard installed quickly and easily and has solved that problem, making searching for movies, TV shows, or youtube videos much quicker and easier.My son, who uses the XBox primarily for gaming, does not like it as much. The keyboard makes the controller a bit awkward to hold, which interferes a bit with gaming (he says), and since it attached to the headphone portal, he can't use his headphones and the keyboard at the same time. So he can't really use it to speed up his chat on the XBox while playing a game. But it's not a big deal; he removes the keyboard when he plays games, and we reattach it when we gather around to watch a movie. Hopefully it will hold up despite the detaching/attaching.Great concept, and it does what it's meant to do. There really isn't any better way to add a keyboard to the XBox controller, and the fact that it's removable gives us the best of both worlds. It does need an audio jack to make it fully functional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CA2K5VKBMBHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YU4OQE#wasThisHelpful","R3CA2K5VKBMBHA","AYDC7F9UF6EQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYDC7F9UF6EQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd give this book 5 stars for the author's first-rate analysis of the events and testimony pertaining to the Borden murders, sifting through thousands of pages of testimony to find striking contradictions and inconsistencies that no one else noticed or cared about. However, her style is so plodding and contrived that, while I forced myself to continue for the sake of the subject matter, I could only bear to read it in small bites. She describes certain characters in the book as confusing, dull, or long-winded in their testimony or letter-writing, yet the author really loves to hear her own voice and doesn't spare us any of it; her narrative is overly precious and she condescendingly addresses her readers as if we were hanging spellbound on her every word. Her style really mars what would otherwise be a great book. She also vacillates between rejecting her hometown of Fall River (which she left 40 years before writing this book) as possessing a mindset she cannot relate to, and using her familiarity with the attitudes of the town and her proximity to the Bordens to cast an air of authority over her book. Lastly, the Kindle edition (purchased August 2015) is rife with typos and grammatical and punctuation errors which render some passages incomprehensible.

"This Green Square Tray from the Mexican Kitchen line by Rick Bayless is very attractive. It was larger than I expected, measuring 14"" across instead of 13"" as in the listing, and it weighs a ton. It's very substantial! I'm not exactly sure what makes this especially ""Mexican""; the color scheme, green glaze over terra cotta-colored stoneware, is somewhat rustic perhaps, but it's a more sophisticated take on Mexican pottery. As you can see in the photo, there is a central, flat square area of about 10"". From there, there is a very slight 2"" rise on each side, but at its deepest point, the tray is not more than 1/2"" deep. Very shallow. At 5.2 pounds, this is rather heavy to function as a tray. I think of a tray as something that can be passed, holding appetizers or cocktails and so forth. This is more of a platter. In any case, you're not going to want to carry this around!I can imagine many uses for this tray/ platter. If we're thinking Mexican, it wouldn't work for things that need support to stand upright, like tacos in a crisp shell. But for tamales, nachos, burritos, empanadas, quesadillas, all sorts of appetizers, meats, anything that can lay flat, it is perfect.Rick Bayless has designed companion items for Gorham's Mexican Kitchen line including individual square bowls with the same glaze. A very nice, understated line which will showcase your culinary offerings.

"Author Don Mardak has an interesting background in Christian mysticism. Couple that background with a talent for writing and you get ""Armageddon and the 4th Timeline,"" a thriller with metaphysical, religious, and new age themes. The inherent beauty in this novel is its ability to reach a wide audience with its main themes. Fans of Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy, and Richard Bach will all find something to enjoy in ""Armageddon and the 4th Timeline.""The historical synopsis caught my attention. It was both heartening and disheartening- thousands of years of humanity and we've done so much, both incredibly good and incredibly bad. The main characters, Kathy and Eric were relatable and interesting. The stakes are tremendously high for them and you (along with the rest of humankind) are rooting for them to succeed. I love how Armageddon was across two planes (physical and spiritual). It seems that oftentimes Armegeddon is only talked about on a physical level because it feels more immediate, but there are so many spiritual elements and implications as well.If you don't believe me or all the other reviewers who obviously enjoyed this novel, Mardak's novel has won various awards, including silvers in the IBPA Benjamin Franklin Awards, among numerous other accolades.

"I must admit that I was skeptical at first. There are so many cheap and shoddy books out there on this subject, as well as ""How to Keep Your Man Excited"" and so on. It can be very difficult to find a gem. Eugene Walker's ""How to Catch a Cheater in 48 Hours or Less"" is a diamond in the rough of all those titles out there. This book is the real deal.I thought it was interesting that there were more tell-tale signs if a woman is cheating than if a man, and even more interesting to me were the parallel signs and completely different signs (such as men being more apt to do something than women). The myriad of chapters were also interesting, such as how to catch them in the act and how to deal with toxic relationships. I found Walker's guide to be very thorough, interesting, and readable.I would toss out all the other books that you have in this genre- THIS is the only one that you need!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPOHH7HG8SFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NYR9N8#wasThisHelpful","RTPOHH7HG8SFD","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up, I knew a boy in my class whose family adopted a little from Russia. It was the early 90s and the Iron Curtain had fallen. She was intriguing and very interesting to all of us that got to meet this little girl and I can't imagine how many other classrooms, neighborhoods, and families probably experienced the wonder of bringing a child over from Russia to America. Fortunately for her, her situation was not like Alina's.The protagonist, Alina, suffers a heartbreaking journey in ""Estranged From Russia."" It was almost like a Greek tragedy. The only thing that keeps her going is her faith in God. This inspiring work would be enjoyed by adults and teens alike. 5-stars and beautiful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24BZ3WTVIV1GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRSOB20#wasThisHelpful","R24BZ3WTVIV1GY","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book*Sense never ceases to meet my needs for a summary and analysis and exceed them, satiating my cravings for more of the author's story and world. In this case, ""Seveneves"" is dissected and presented to us in an easy-to-digest format. There was so much that I missed in Neal Stephenson's original novel, and this companion shed a lot of light on some things that were lurking below the surface, just waiting to be discovered.I particularly enjoyed the ""story plot analysis,"" ""major symbols,"" and ""themes"" sections in this particular companion.

"Emily Walters' ""Investment in Love"" is a sweet contemporary romance that follows Calvin Barnard and Ellie Parker and how their paths cross. The premise is simple enough- young, handsome man inherits millions and a house from a little-known great-aunt, but with one caveat: he must marry a local girl in order to inherit his millions. Calvin finds his girl, but in Ellie, he may be finding more than the paper wife he was searching for.All this being said, ""Investment in Love"" was a quick read, but an enjoyable one. This would certainly make for great beach time reading. The characters and storyline were well-developed and engaging. I've read a few of Ms. Walters' novels in the past, and I think this one might be my new favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ADOEAO8R2XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1WDW5S#wasThisHelpful","R30ADOEAO8R2XX","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While each role may be challenging, to be placed in all three at once is imaginably very difficult. Combine this with returned from the Middle East and a near-death experience, PTSD is added to the mix and you have an explosive story.This wasn't just an amazing story with fantastic writing, but a wake up call that if you, or anyone you know, has PTSD, to see help immediately.

I've met one pescetarian and I always wondered a bit about her diet and what sort of benefits she was receiving from it, especially because she was so passionate about it.As stated in the guide, pescetarians are ""vegetarians who eat fish"" and they may or may not choose to eat dairy products and eggs. They receive a myriad of health benefits from following this diet and the author highlights many of the upsides and downsides to the diet. There are also some delicious recipes to help you get started and tips for how to cope if you find yourself missing meat.All in all, I would say that this is great guide to help get you started on a new, healthful path in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBJP2TGJZYVMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGZPD3A#wasThisHelpful","RBJP2TGJZYVMP","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Patrick Hatt's ""A Not So New World"" is a quirky story about Jack, a man wrongfully framed for a crime that he did not commit, and his ensuing adventures with a sympathizing FBI agent in his cat time machine. This book would be appropriate for YA readers and adults, and especially lovers of adventure. There are, of course, elements of sci-fi/fantasy and some mystery/suspense.I really enjoyed Hatt's smooth and engaging writing style, which kept me turning the pages until I found that I had suddenly finished the book at 2AM. I was so pulled in to Jack's and Agent Milano's adventures and I so badly wanted to know what would happen to them. Plus, whenever I think of a time machine, I think of that one in that old classic movie, not a cat, so that kept me interested. Sort of reminded me of the cat bus in ""My Neighbor Totoro.""All in all, this was a fun read and I am looking forward to checking out more of Hatt's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEWJJF6UQ4FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WWZ3NI#wasThisHelpful","R2BEWJJF6UQ4FM","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having spent three and a half years of my life living in the countryside of Honshu, the large main island of Japan, I can safely say that I know a few things about Japanese cuisine. I had the great fortune of spending a vacation in Okinawa and I was struck by the beauty of the string of islands, the different culture, different dialect, different rhythm of life...and the different cuisine from the rest of the Japan. Of course, Okinawans do eat the same foods as other Japanese people do, but their traditional cuisine is very unique and full of so much healthy goodness. For one week, I enjoyed a diet that was extremely varied and very rich in seafood, vegetables, and tropical fruits.Wade Migan does an excellent job of introducing Westerners to this delicious diet, while also thoughtfully warning against the possibility that you might not be used to the tastes. Personally, I love goya (bitter melon) and it is SO good for you, but it is an acquired taste for many people, Japanese included. Migan also introduces the reader to other common, healthy ingredients in Okinawan cuisine and what their health benefits are. This is a great diet for adventurous eaters who want to maximize superfoods in their diet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMQP20QUD52U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBB0Q7A#wasThisHelpful","R3CMQP20QUD52U","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jill Vance's ""Dark Between Shadows"" is a collection of short stories with intriguing twists and turns. None of the stories ended how I thought they would, even though I was expecting a twist at the end. I absolutely loved it. I finished the book in two sittings, although I easily could have sat for one! Such is life- we have other things that we must take care of sometimes that gets in the way of our reading! My two favorite stories were ""Letters from the Grave"" and ""One Bad Apple."" There is truly something for everyone in this collection and each story felt like a fresh, new start.It's so hard to find a decent collection of short stories and ""Dark Between Shadows"" did not disappoint.

"C.J. Lake's ""A Hot Winter"" is a new adult romance in ""The Attraction Series"" with Emma, a widow, and Matt, someone from her past.There were so many pluses to this novel. The main characters' romance was fresh, relatable, and most importantly, believable. So many times in romance novels the main characters and their situation are completely unbelievable, but not in this case.The love scenes were not trite or vulgar, but well executed. You could really feel their passion.I particularly liked the easy-to-follow plot that still kept me guessing what might happen next with Emma and Matt. Lake also executed the characters very well- Emma and Matt had excellent development for a novel under 400 pages.Overall, this was a steamy love story and a fun read, with very likable characters, great sexual chemistry, and some really touching moments.

Each novel is completely different, with a different heroine, dreamy guy, and unique plot.My personal favorite was the first novel in the bundle, ""In Love with a Haunted House."" It could be because I'm a Chicago girl, where Mallory's story begins. Goldman's pacing was done very well and there were no holes or dull moments in her plot and she effectively developed her characters.The other two novels were just as entertaining and well-written.

"Wildcard opens in Grenoble where 16 year-old Martha (genetically altered) has been made to have a baby in a corporate prison. Escaping with the boy - Karl, she is phoned (in hiding) by a secretive Artificial Intelligence. He forces her to abandon Karl for his protection. Years later, many entities (not all people - who have titles for names like the General - a quirky technique Mitchell sorts the characters with(maybe?)) - Sergeant, Mechanic and Benefactor, for example. The Sergeant emerges as the principal character which generates some narrative confusion since Karl is the seeming lead character. Anyway, the Sarge is holding the Mechanic, who negotiates a deal - they have to locate Karl and put him across the barrier into Mansworld - a creation of the unapproachable A.I. Wildcard. First, however, the team must send Martha to the Benefactor for a pretty awful fate.Thats chapter 2 of 60, so you can see its a pretty twisty tale. If complex stories float your boat, its a wicked read, but if simple is your preference, youll dislike it.Next, the General creates a crew- the Sergeant, RJ Sublime (gene altered luck), LuvRay Chose (wise primitive raised by wolves - very cool sub-story), together with Karl. They must work with Juniper a Manufactured Entity or M.E. (Mitchells cutesy term for A.I.). They trick Juniper and essentially kill him.Dartagnan and :3: - the remaining M.E.s - get Karl into Wildspace - the multi-verse generated by Wildcard. Wildcard was the first M.E. and was isolated by accident for 100,000 years (subjective timerate). He (they/it?) communicates through cryptic poetry to individuals. The poetry is not really great, but its not that bad. Its a unique device, too, so credit for that. Wildcard is pretty much a god, and has some need or goal beyond human understanding. He cant do it alone and absolutely requires Karls aid. And Karls requires the others aid. Its a sort of cosmic danger of going mad and living forever in that state. When WC was trapped, the human created part went totally crazy and out jumped this wiser aspect. Now the two are locked in a sort of death struggle to save/destroy humanity.At the same time, the Benafactor mentally racks Martha - a big spoiler, Ill skip over - very cool twist.Karl makes it over (of course), since no one else has the ability. The gate unlocks for everyone else who all follow into different parts of Wildspace. Karl makes his way to the Center, where a gentle elderly man and wife live - WCs attempt to create humans. Karl has to exit, though, to save Martha, knowing he will not be allowed back - no one can enter the Center twice.S-2 - the boy Sergant - finds Karl, but has secret orders to murder the old man at the Center. Karl attempts to prevent this, and I will not tell the outcome - another Big spoiler.Next, the pair go to find the Poet - who pens WCs questionable communiques, with Dartagnan in pursuit. Karl and the Poet become lovers. He leaves her world and is soon killed by the Mechanic - a fascinating concept and scene. The Sargeant finds RJ, Dartagnan and Luvrey. Together, the seek out Karls reincarnation - who happens to be the Poets unborn child by Karl. (A little fun weirdness).Ill hold back the end, but you can guess that WC and the Wound (the crazy part) battle it out with the humans caught in the mix, struggling and mostly failing to stay sane while reality comes apart at the seams. It falls to the Sargeant to save the world from the Wouond dissolving everything into chaotic soup.Bad - Probably too many sub-plots and some tenuous connections. Readers who prefer tidy stories should avoid it. Those who enjoy somewhat ramblin and wanderin tales will love it. Too many ends left loose - devices dropped. A few come back in the next book, I know. If a straightforward, clean narrative is your preference, give this book a pass.Good parts - The book has incredible imagination, a lot of gripping adventure and dialogue and a depth of philosophy seen in very few contemporary books. This is metered out and slipped in quietly so its not heavy-handed or boring. Mitchell has a great skill with that area. Quite a few intriguing questions are brought up with no impediment to the narrative. Each scene makes you eager to keep reading - nice style in ending scenes cryptically. The many sub-plots are great and well-twined into the main plot, so it doesnt get lost in the complexity, although it seems it will at times. Luvreys backstory (Ill leave it for you) is amazing, and revealed in a very cool way - however, its not integral to the overall story - which weakens it somewhat. The story does match up thematically with Marthas alone-liness. If youre a fan of complex stories and large multi-verses, then buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DUEWLQA0QQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVBYX9I#wasThisHelpful","R13DUEWLQA0QQ5","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's all about changing your mindset and approach, not you as a person like many other similar guides out there.Never expected it to happen so soon, but I'm very happy to report that I tried Monroe's three steps and I already have a date this weekend with the guy I've secretly had a crush on for years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFQ53BZACSAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT84GZS#wasThisHelpful","R1AFQ53BZACSAP","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dmytro Bondarenko's ""The Seventeenth Floor"" is a plausible tale of a young man who, although he loves and cares for his wife, has found his attentions wandering since the birth of his daughter and the passing of the sixth year of his marriage. At the suggestion of a co-worker, Kostya, the main character, visits a brothel. This is the story of his desires and the resulting consequences.Bondarenko writes in a very straightforward style that does not beat around the bush. From the first sentence onward, the reader will be drawn in to Kostya's tale. This is a story that has been written at its very essence and not fluffed up by extra, unnecessary words and situations. For the reader looking for a straightforward, realistic tale, this is a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYG6OUZTMOBVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087GA9TG#wasThisHelpful","RYG6OUZTMOBVB","A17HPUHGYQ6A3R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17HPUHGYQ6A3R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Andrew L.'s ""How to Live a Happier Life"" is chock full of useful strategies for living a happier, more optimistic life. Each strategy is a subset of a themed chapter and designed so that anyone can implement the strategy, provided that they have the right mindset and are ready for a positive change.My favorite strategy is strategy #6, ""deal with the past so that you can enjoy the present."" That strategy really spoke to me because I know that I do (and did) harbor a lot of negative feelings about various things in my past that I had to let go of in order to be happier. With the help from this book, I've already been able to let go of some things and it's been a tremendous weight off of my shoulders.I can't wait to try some more of Andrew's strategies.

"Cooking with spices and herbs? Using prescribed medical marijuana? You're gonna want to consider this grinder. As far as I'm concerned Golden Gate Grinders makes the best grinder out there. I don't even need to consider others.The grinders are made with aircraft grade aluminum thats harder than the fist of Chuck Norris and sharper than Einstein in his prime. I'm not even sure what aircraft grade aluminum is, but it sounds cool. And this is probably why the grinder has a nice weight to it. Just sitting in your hand it feels quality, and I don't have to worry about it slipping away or someone bumping me and off goes the grinder. It's heavy duty and certainly feels that way in my hands.The lid has teeth on the underside and a magnet around the rim to help keep the lid on and everything inside fresh. Be careful with the pieces with teeth - if you stick your finger in there you can feel just how sharp the teeth are even though they aren't knife-like.The chamber for the herbs and whatnot is pretty big, and there's a mesh pollen catcher at the bottom which is really cool. As for what you can grind - seeds, nuts, garlic cloves, cinnamon sticks, and of course medical marijuana. It can handle a variety of things and you can also leave your grounds inside it and rest assured they'll keep fresh thanks to the magnetized pieces.This grinder is great and I expect it will last a lifetime considering how durable and quality it is. It's also very affordable in comparison to other grinders that claim to be top of the line, so you're getting a great value too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IX2M3SM3A7M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXSFB1Q#wasThisHelpful","R2IX2M3SM3A7M1","A1BEKAQQGP8CMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BEKAQQGP8CMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live commute into the city for work, sometimes by bike. And when I take my bike out and about, having a reliable lock is a must. I like to use two locks at the same time - a combination cable lock and a sturdier U-lock as a safety net. I've been the victim of bike theft and the guy caught on camera just used his brute force to snap the cable lock. Had it been this CycleBeam lock, it could have been a different story!The CycleBeam cable lock is four feet long, comes with a mount for your seat post, and has a pretty straightforward method of setting your personal combination. The instructions are right on the packaging.The folks at CycleBeam are frequent night riders, so they know safety is important. Their goal is to bring their passion to developing and manufacturing cycling products, so as to enhance the safety of night riding. And the LED illuminated combo lock is perfect for when it's dark and hard to see. When it's dark - whether it's night time, early morning, or even in a dark basement or something, being able to see the combo can be a pain. With the CycleBeam lock all you've got to do is press the button and the dial lights up blue for about 10 seconds.As you'll see in my photo, the brightest part of the dial will be on the numbers that need to line up to unlock it. That's the important part obviously. The light isn't as bright for the rest of the dial, so it doesn't really matter. I've unlocked this in complete darkness a few times and it was pretty cool.

"First responders are trained to look for the star of life on bracelets and necklaces, so wearing an Endevr medical bracelet will give you peace of mind. It's ideal if you have heart conditions, diabetes, and allergies, and it looks cool too.

Let's hope it never comes to that...While I don't wear it on a daily basis since I don't have serious medical conditions, I pick my spots like running road races, biking to work, that kind of thing. If it happens that you wear off the ID numbers or QR code on the inside of the band, Endevr offers a lifetime guarantee and they'll replace it.People have even asked me about the Endevr bracelet when they see me wearing it, and I'm happy to recommend it and explain the benefits of having important personal information just a phone call away.

"I feel like I'm late to everything that's new in tech, but I recently got a Xbox 360 Bundle that includes the wireless version of this same controller. I had some doubts about the efficiency of the wireless controller, so I picked up a wired one as well.Despite my doubts, the battery for the wireless controller has met the expectations of 40 hours of usage and I haven't experienced any issues.Wireless is great for playing solo, but for the times when you play with others, wired controllers are key and will cut back on using batteries. The wire extends 9 feet, which is plenty far for typical gaming. I don't expect I or anyone I'm playing with will need to be farther than 9 feet away from the console. Well, maybe... but 9 feet is a reasonable limit.As for the feel in my hands, it's one of the more comfortable and ergonomic controllers I've ever held.

Each toothbrush comes individually boxed, and the packaging is completely recyclable. The brush is enclosed inside a sealed wrapper, and then enclosed within a box, so it's clean, protected, and completely sustainable.Did you know bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on earth? It's a versatile and environmentally sustainable grass. Bamboo is awesome.The handle is sturdy and a good size for the average hand. The bristles are soft and good quality. I'm not sure how long they'll last, but I expect a couple months is reasonable. This isn't a fancy brush - it's a sustainable brush, and Smile Squared gives one brush to a child in need for every brush that's purchased.

"I'm a pretty active person, and I'm glad I have this knee compression sleeve. I use it at the gym mostly for lifting weights (legs).I've been dealing with a patella issue in my right knee for awhile now, and on the days my knee is sensitive, using this sleeve is really helpful for load-bearing (i.e. squats or lifting weights with my legs). Rip Toned provides good support, and it fits snugly. And I mean very snugly. It's also durable, not at all flimsy, and I expect it will last a long time.As for sizing, I believe it runs a bit small. To get your sizing, measure the circumference around your leg at six inches below the knee cap. Mine measured 15 inches, so I chose the large size. It's very tight, and even a bit constricting for running. If you're 15 inches or more, get the XL obviously.

"I first discovered Squatty Potty while watching ABC's Shark Tank, a show where entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to investors. At first I chuckled when they did a quick demonstration to show how it's used. Let's face it, pooping is a funny topic.But then I started to take it seriously as the Squatty Potty founders explained how effective the stool is.As humans, we're designed to squat, but instead we sit on toilets. Sitting keeps the colon kinked, kind of like when there's a kink or wrinkle in a hose and the flow of water is slowed. Squatting, on the other hand, allows the colon to fully relax and empty quickly.I suffer from IBS, so constipation is a regular part of my life. My eyes lit up when I saw there's a solution that could help!

"I can't have dairy, so there isn't a wide selection of protein powders to choose from unfortunately. I give the non-dairy varieties a try when I see them. I've tried several powders that tasted like chalk dust.Enter Vega Sport.It's vegan. Free of dairy, gluten, and soy. Just about anyone can consume this one safely.I think no matter what protein powder you try it will be a bit chalky, but I feel picking the right flavor is important. I've previously tried the berry flavor, which is ideal for me since I like to make smoothies with fruit. Vanilla with fruit is a good mix too. Yes, you still get the powdery, chalky consistency, but the flavor is decent paired with real fruit. I tried mixing it with almond milk and drinking that straight... it was tough to get down without wincing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C41DLKP3SNYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y13K0#wasThisHelpful","R2C41DLKP3SNYH","A1BEKAQQGP8CMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BEKAQQGP8CMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""Oh, we just used the striped towel the other day so let's grab the solid one."" You could say I'm particular about usage...Despite the bright color the towels still hide stains fairly well.

"I feel like I'm late to everything that's new in tech, but I recently got a Xbox 360 Bundle that includes this black wireless controller. I had some doubts about the efficiency of the wireless controller, but I've been pleased with it so far.I initially had these quick thoughts... How long will the battery last? Will I experience lagging all the time? Lag is the most frustrating thing, and we all know it. I have a wireless controller for another system that has always given me problems, thus my reservations about Xbox 360. But fear not, prospective buyer, because Xbox 360 is awesome.The battery is advertised as having 40 hours of life. That's plenty of life for a couple of AA batteries, and frankly I expected less. Being that I've had the Xbox 360 for just awhile, I'm approaching 40 hours of controller usage and haven't experienced any issues. The time will soon come, but I'm happy with the amount of playing time I've got from a couple AAs. Plus, no tangled wires or tugging at the console.The controller also has a 30-foot range. I haven't needed to be 30 feet away from the console, but it works just fine from the opposite end of a typical living room. Maybe in some fantasy when I live in a mansion with an auditorium for a game room I'll truly be able to test out the range.As for the feel in my hands, it's one of the more comfortable and ergonomic controllers I've ever held. I'm seriously considering buying more wireless controllers rather than wired ones.

"There are three things I care about when buying litter.1 - Clumping - most litters I've used have clumped well, but there are some brands that just don't do it well enough. Cat's Pride, safe to say, clumps as expected. My little guy doesn't hesitate to use the litter, and he approves. He'll use almost anything, though. I could probably dump Grape Nuts into the litter box and he'd still use it.2 - Fragrance - I'm not a fan of fragrance since it can stink up a room, and if dust gets on the furniture or something then it's going to smell like litter. Cat's Pride is advertised as ""fragrance free"" and that's mostly true. It still has a faint scent, but certainly nothing to complain about.3 - Price - I've been buying Fresh Step for years, and Cat's Pride is cheaper pound for pound here on Amazon.

The Urban Armor Gear case unfortunately won't allow me to get my Note into the leather case. Life isn't perfect.The naming of the color (""Ice"") is pretty cool too.

"The biggest appeal to this AC is a very high 11.3 EEF, meaning 11.3 BTU/Watt, or less power for more cooling.  Also, it has some really nice + useful features such as digital temperature setting measured either (selectable) by the remote or the AC itself, and ""econ"" mode where the fan only runs while it is cooling.

The solid metal handle is coupled via a non-metal material, and could be a weak link with overly aggressive users.  Not sure if the faucet or in-laws are at fault, or if it is shared blame, but Pfister seems dedicated to supporting their product so I won't deduct a star.Update2: Pfister's support is world class.  I would not hesitate to install their faucets throughout the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4WOHL6A11CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VFY6VI#wasThisHelpful","R3V4WOHL6A11CX","A1YWMPU4NRLSW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YWMPU4NRLSW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased 4 of these from a different seller, your results may vary with this seller.  The four I received are great products except two major flaws:  First, the display will begin to fail after about 1 year, with the digits becoming progressively more scrambled.  Second, the temperature sensor will begin showing random numbers after it is hot for some period because the third wire which provides power to the DS18b20 is (in a Chinese way!) not connected internally in the metal sensor.  They ran but did not connect the 3rd wire, and without this 3rd wire, the sensor will work ""parasitically"" just fine at lower temperatures <~90C.  If you connect your own sensor this second flaw aspect will be resolved.Because the unit is sealed, you can't repair it when these problems occur.On a positive note, the display is nice and clear, compatible with other DS18b20 sensors, updates smoothly and quickly, and works great until it fails.  Again, my review is based on what I received from a different seller, so there is no guarantee that what this seller is selling has the same issues.  I've recently also purchased the blue version of this product also from another seller, and in this case it does not appear to have the ""3rd wire problem"" and potentially will last longer than a year, so based on benefit of the doubt, I'm giving the product 5-stars in this review though YRMV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHY50RT3QAKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D79YU9I#wasThisHelpful","RIHY50RT3QAKK","A1YWMPU4NRLSW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YWMPU4NRLSW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These units are rugged and will withstand some rough treatment and bad weather, although the size is more reminiscent of a walkie 20 years ago than today. The user interface and buttons are easy to work out and there's a clear manual available if needed. Sound quality is very good and it's possible to increase the range of broadcast using the push-to-talk power boost feature.The biggest weaknesses are unfortunately really important, hence only 3 stars in my rating. The battery life is very poor, lasting only around 10 hours, and the charger takes well over 24 hours to get to 100%. Given the short battery life, I wouldn't want to be stuck somewhere remotely depending on this.

"Once installed, this is a great unit, operating very quietly compared with similar door openers, together with the added benefit of smartphone app integration. The battery backup ensures that you can get into the garage if the power is out, and wall controller has some nice additional features such as a temperature thermometer.The biggest drawback is that installation is a total nightmare, and while it's probably not much worse than many garage installers, the instructions aren't particularly friendly and it feels like the install process was never tested before roll-out. You can spend a good part of a weekend figuring out how to put this thing up and then in between multiple trips to Home Depot, it seems like better instructions would have made the process much easier.

"What is initially set up as a run-of-the-mill stalker thriller (a family moving into a new neighborhood meets a stranger who turns their lives upside down) quickly becomes much more twisty and psychological, and is one of the best examples in recent years of how to keep audiences guessing what happens next.

"I was excited to try this machine but out of the box found a number of severe limitations and annoyances, but first the positives. This is a relatively fast laptop for the size and works wells as a basic device for email and browser-based functions. It doesn't perform well for memory intensive apps (Photoshop, Office) and sinks like a stone if you attempt to make the graphics chip handle a second monitor, but for quick student and office tasks, it's fairly snappy and the battery life seems to average about 7-8 hours before charging.The unit arrived with no power at all and so needed charging immediately. It took about an hour of charge before the power button ever worked, so gives the impression of being dead on arrival. This is not smart on the part of the manufacturer since many people will understandably return the unit. Although the charging cable looks like a regular mini-USB port, you'll also experience vastly different charging speeds so I would recommend sticking with the Asus cable. Charging overall seems very slow and I've had to leave it plugged in overnight to get to 100%.As a tablet, this is a great device - the screen is large and bright and the touch sensitivity works flawlessly. You can almost throw away the keyboard attachment which is too light and flimsy for the screen part and tips over easily. The mouse pad is cheap and inaccurate, and the keyboard feels like a $20 add-on. This is a shame since the main body of the computer is much higher quality and even the snapping on of off isn't as smooth as other devices using the same trick (especially the Surface).Admittedly this is only a $300 device but it falls in the middle, feature-wise. For users needing the keyboard, the Chromebook is much better way to go due to the keyboard quality and battery life. For tablet users, some may find the screen too large and not need the keyboard. And for laptop users, some may find it under-powered through the memory is there. I like Asus products but this one doesn't quite fire on all cylinders.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9PHWDX8X8JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RGK#wasThisHelpful","R3H9PHWDX8X8JE","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this isn't a bad budget case in terms of fabric quality and size, there are some drawbacks that you should consider even in this price range. Compared with the Amazon case that's $10 more, it doesn't have the auto-sleep function and the part of the case that wraps around the front of the device interferes with the buttons at the bottom and top of the screen.The stand feature isn't particularly obvious either - you'll see a number a reviews complaining that it falls over constantly. It actually doesn't, but it also doesn't show how to wrap the case and secure under the flap, and if you don't know this, it falls over. These are nit-picky items but since the number of case options in the market has exploded, they are worth thinking about. On balance, I would argue that the slightly pricier Amazon case is functionally a better alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1PPL7GJ2A0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LRUKFU#wasThisHelpful","RW1PPL7GJ2A0K","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The film fast forwards to a point where the public seems to have forgotten about the catastrophic events surrounding the first three parks and the T-Rex stomping around San Diego, and looks like a mixture of Sea World meets Islands of Adventures on steroids. The Heartless Park Manager (HPM) believes visitors need ever bigger and badder dinosaurs to keep returning (oh, the irony) so has created some giant super dinosaur that's a composite of the terrifying features of the others. Naturally, park security wasn't high on the priority list that the HPM was working from and chaos ensues.As soon as the new dinosaurs escapes from the enclosure - and you won't believe how that happens - a variety of lazily written plot mechanisms kick into place. The new Benevolent Park Owner decides to fly his own helicopter, dangerously, for no apparently reason and that doesn't end well. Our hero, Chris Pratt, believes he can talk to the Raptors while Vincent d'Onofrio as the Evil Corporate-Slash-Military Rep tries to weaponize them. Everyone with the gun has forgotten both basic training and common sense and it becomes a massacre caused by egregious stupidity more than a poorly designed dinosaur zoo. Once we get dumped into Act 3, it quickly draws on horror sequel devices with dinosaurs fighting each other and the human either becoming food or learning not to mess with nature.The main problem with Jurassic World isn't the illogical plotting, inconsistencies with the first film, unlikable characters or lack of originality, so much that it just isn't really very entertaining. The most scary element of the movie was the half-billion box office haul, meaning we'll have to suffer through many more sequels. Compared with the original, JW replaces tension and implied terror with mediocre CG and dino-fodder characters that limp from action sequence to action sequence. I never thought I would say this about a Jurassic Park movie but frankly I was bored.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R198LRF9GTZQ3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHWD78I#wasThisHelpful","R198LRF9GTZQ3X","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're new to Nespresso, these are the highly addictive and convenient pods of perfect espresso that will quickly become an expensive habit. They come in a variety of flavors and styles and there are also some off-brand versions (Bestpresso, Cafemundo, etc.) that are about half the price.There are a variety of Nespresso machines on the market and this De'Longhi represents one of the higher end non-commercial units. It's capable of producing a complete cappuccino in about 45 seconds from start-up. Operating the unit is very easy - simply fill up the tank in the back, drop the pod in the top and select the size of the cup. Adding frothed, steamed milk is just another button press with the cup staying in exactly the same place.De'Longhi couldn't have done a better job in terms of aesthetics and simplicity, and even the cleaning functions are mindlessly easy. The only downside is the cost - unless you really need an integrated frothing device, you can buy the two units separately for much less.

"If you're looking for an example of how to take an impeccable cast, best-selling novel and high-level concept and forge a muddy, depressing, overlong death-march, this is it. Like some post cold-war throwback, this is the sort of film that constantly reminds you that you're lucky to live on the 'right side' of the iron curtain while wondering why Russians talk with such funny accents.With a plot looser than many first-draft scripts, the most exciting and colorful action sequence happens right at the start while the finale is a whimper. The main character (Hardy) has no motivation to endlessly pursue the killer. destroy his career and kill his family. Rapace is unlikable throughout the entire flick and Kinneman is wasted as a monotone, two-dimension villain bested by even the tritest of TV cop shows. By the time the audience works out the main thrust of the narrative, it's too late to care and while editing is one of the many problems here, it's the relentlessly bleak, over-long and unfocused nature of the picture that kills it for the viewer.Overall, it's a thrill-less thriller that has pretensions of investigating the importance of finding a child killer in a society that denies the existence of murder. The story is uneven, simultaneously introducing too many distracting subplots while failing to follow the key ones thoroughly enough. While some of the lame plotting would be forgiven with more interesting characters, the combination of silly plot developments, expository dialog and confusing direction neuter any attempt by a skilled cast to save it. Add a thick serving of laughably fake Russian accents and this would be better suited as a made-for-TV movie or a drinking game where you take a shot every time something unbelievable happens.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DUNWYOKD0I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DRYNPE#wasThisHelpful","R36DUNWYOKD0I5","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not that Z For Zachariah is bad for any particular stand-out reason - it's more than it's an amalgamation of things that don't work together. As such, it comes across as some sort of Lifetime drama you might watch in a hospital where pain-relieving drugs might fix the problems of the third act. It's a gentle snooze, pregnant with promise to explode into violence, but instead is satisfied with turning a church into a hydro-electric generator somewhere towards the end.It needed some external force to nudge the main characters into action - either the threat of zombies (The Walking Dead), the end of the world's food supply (Interstellar) or the ticking timebomb of death (and watching Arnie trying to act) in Maggie. Instead, the cast is happy to eat, drink, farm, walking around slowly in radiation suits, and chat. And for readers of the original book who didn't see the trailer, Chris Pine's late arrival creates what is adventurously described as a ""love triangle"" which lets the movie coast into a finale that doesn't really resolve anything.Ultimately the movie conversion removes the themes of the book and replaces them with Chris Pine and a waterwheel. It's so spectacularly uncinematic that you have to wonder how it got through the production process. In all fairness, the acting is fine and Margot Robbie is good, but there is less tension in the whole movie than in the opening credits of The Walking Dead. It's a little like ordering a pizza and the car shows up with a pack of cereal - it's probably better for you but you can't escape the disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLS8LMNFG33E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KMLJGM#wasThisHelpful","RPLS8LMNFG33E","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is probably the best kettle I've ever used.

It very easy to set up, take apart and clean.Overall, my only minor complaint is that it takes 3-4 seconds to react to the ""On"" button when it's initially connected to base. Otherwise, it functions perfectly and looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPPAH37KADIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY2NDJK#wasThisHelpful","R1HPPAH37KADIZ","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the Dummies series can be overlooked for its seemingly jovial approach to a topic, some of the very top titles really represent best-in-class introductions to topics and Mark Layton's book can be considered one of these. Scrum is a beguilingly simply subject that's hard to write about effectively and communicate the pros and cons of the approach, and it's also even tougher to find practitioners who can talk about applications beyond IT and software.The author clearly has had considerable experience in the field and I was most impressed with his ability to talk about non-tech implementations, where increasingly I think the biggest impact can be seen. The book is concise and well-written, while also being crammed with useful examples, further resources and summaries. I'd highly recommend it for learning about Scrum or as a training tool if you want to bring Scrum or other agile techniques into a team - it's one of the best books I've read on the subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTSV3R1INRBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111890575X#wasThisHelpful","R1TTSV3R1INRBK","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I've had a protein shake lunch every day for the last six months, I've tested out a number of brands most of which you may have seen in the supermarkets. While I put a brave face on it, the truth is that none of them really tastes like the chocolate milkshake or vanilla ice-cream that they're trying to mimic, and they tend to be fairly powdery and have trouble mixing reliably.So I wasn't expecting much from Orgain's product beyond what I had seen with Vega, which is the next best alternative. Fortunately, Orgain resets the bar in terms what's possible with these mixtures. At once healthy, plant-based, inexpensive and, dare I say, even tasty, you can actually imagine the chocolate shake. Mix it with almond milk and it's practically a treat, though I'm also perfectly happy with the cold water concoction. Either way, it blends easily and is hands down the best protein powder I've tried so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3U4V0U7UK1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J074W94#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3U4V0U7UK1P","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is about as close as you can get to a derm-abrasion treatment at home, and creates visibly brighter, radiant and smoother skin after about 3 weeks of daily usage. The machine is easier to set up and use and the instructions are clear - the hardest part is remembering to add this 5-minute daily routine, thought it can be done while watching TV. The electrical sensation is barely noticeable if you apply a generous amount of the gel though it's more noticeable in some areas on the face than others. For my skin, I found it effectively tightens the surface and shrinks pores, which also had the effect of removing early-stage wrinkles. As home treatments go, this is about as good as it gets and although the unit seems expensive, is actually the equivalent of 3-4 visits to a professional.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SNBU06EQF3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY2RNUO#wasThisHelpful","R18SNBU06EQF3Z","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid entry-level offering that packs a considerable amount of hardware into the box for the price. With an average weight and above-average overall build quality, there are many good things to be said about this Toshiba range. From the snappy keyboard to the responsive and vibrant screen, it's hard to complain about what you're getting for under $500. For media fans the screen is more than adequate for movies, and the microphone and speakers work well for everything from Skype to Pandora. The only real let-down on the hardware is the mouse-pad which can be jerky and hard to control at times.On the Windows front, while version 10 is a major leap forward from version 8, it's still questionable how much we've really gained from Windows 7. While we're celebrating the return of the Start menu and other common sense UI elements, the touch controls seem mostly unnecessary and heavy office or educational users will get frustrated with the renovated accessories (calculator, please come back), missing media programs and difficulty around tasks such as managing devices and printers. None of this is the fault of this Toshiba device, however, which more than capably runs standard Windows programs with its 6GB of RAM.The PC comes packed with bloatware with everything from eBay to Dropbox vying for attention in the expanded Start Menu. It took about 30 minutes to uninstall all the junk that Toshiba have bundled here but once it was stripped down to a non-OEM build, we got along just fine. Bloatware and mousepad aside, there's much to recommend here - it's certainly leagues ahead of the Dells offered in this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGZFCPGAI6OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPL59LO#wasThisHelpful","R2UGZFCPGAI6OP","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few things to love about Burt's Bees - the products are mostly natural (many quote 99%+ natural ingredients), they're inexpensive and - most importantly - they work just as well as pricier brands. Like many of the other items in their range, the moisturizers work over an extended period and have a tendency to make your skin springier the longer you use them. The cleaning cream is extremely mild and definitely suited to sensitive or dry skin.

"Healthier than drinking a soda, but definitely nowhere near as nutritionally beneficial as a freshly made fruit juice, this V8 Veggie Blend at least tastes fairly palatable and is much lower in salt than some other brands I've seen (70mg per serving, 6 servings per container).Unfortunately, most of the veggie elements come from purees and concentrates, so there's a flat, bland flavor. But if you mix it with plenty of ice cubes or drink very cold, it doesn't taste too bad.

For some reason this pack contains two deodorants and one shower gel when it would have been more useful to have a shampoo, shower gel and deodorant combo.Although this is an inexpensive bundle, there's nothing about the package that screams ""gift"" in terms of special packaging or theme.

"I am frankly stunned at how well this works. We had a particularly destructive day last week, managing to break a porcelain vase into about 10 pieces and a fireplace Travertine tile into several awkward, jagged lumps. I was unconvinced that either could be fixed and made to look reasonably new again so tried this out fully expecting it to fail, leaving only my fingers glued together.Preparing the surfaces is the key - clean out the areas from dust and debris and then dampen the edges to be glued. Apply the glue very thinly (since it expands three times the volume in the curing process) and place the edges together. Using a clamp (or Gorilla glue tape) during the drying process helps form a solid bond but isn't essential. Wipe out any excess and then wait a few hours.After, I had to use a pocket knife to remove some excess glue that had leaked out the creaks but - truly shockingly - neither the tile nor the vase show any signs of ever being broken. I can't say enough good things about this product and with a container this large, it's going to last forever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1UIECUTR9XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001GAYRC#wasThisHelpful","RB1UIECUTR9XL","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The unit connects quickly to the gas tank (not included, don't forget) and it always lights within a couple of clicks.Barbecue purists will dislike the Teflon tray which prevent the flames from ever touching your food. Said purists will probably disapprove of gas too but overall the smokey flavor is maintained even if you don't get the striped griddle marks shown in the pictures.

"This is a small but bright led light with three white brightness settings and one red-light mode. It's not heavy at all and the opaque casing is made of rubber so it won't crack if thrown into a bag or dropped. Under the unit there's a small plastic hanging loop to allow it be supported on a pole or hook. In my testing, battery life is consistent with the manufacturer claims and you can easily get 16 hours of light on the lowest setting. The charging cable does not include a power adapter so you must have a USB-capable port available (or a different charging cable).

"While there's no doubt this is a conversation piece at any party here in Texas, it's more of an infrequent toy to produce on special occasions than something you would use routinely. It's a big machine and won't fit easily under cabinets so unless you have a very big kitchen (quite possible here in Texas!) it's probably not practical for most households.It's also a beast to clean and when you start poking around the machinery, it doesn't look any more well made than a basic blender. It certainly doesn't even compare that favorably to blenders in the same product range - I'm not honestly sure what you're getting for the extra hundred dollars or so on this model when the cheapest in the range is fine.That being said, I know some margarita fans who will rave about the shaved iced and the speed with which they can be holding their favorite drink.

"Motorola has clearly thought through the limitations of the Smart Watch concept and produced something that is attractive, functional and practical given the restraints of the technology. Apple is setting the tone for the land-grab to own your wrist but in my test of both the Apple and Android options, I much prefer the Moto 360.First, you can't get around the tragically bad battery life that all these devices have and the Moto stands out as nearly the best at a paltry 12-16 hours of charge. You can almost hear them wheezing out battery whenever the screen is on, which means this is yet another device you'll be charging every day. It's aggravating but until somebody makes a seismic leap forward in cell technology, it's what we're stuck with.It's also important to realize that the watches have very limited onboard processing power and not only rely on the phone's nearby presence but demand it for anything useful. The watches are basically an expensive notification accessory that also double as a heart-rate monitor and pedometer but they are simply not designed to do much else. Anything beyond checking an email or text always leans on the accompanying phone for processing and functionality. You won't be watching movies on your watch anytime soon.That said, Motorola has worked around the stark limitations and created a device that looks better than most of the smart watches currently on the market. It's comfortable, blends with casual attire or suits equally well, and will easily survive showering or swimming. The touchscreen is sensitive, accurate and apparently hard to scratch, and its designed to manage Android Wear very well. The wireless charging is also a great feature that works seamlessly. I especially love the way the screen activates automatically when held at the natural angle to look at the time - it's smart and endlessly entertaining.After two weeks of Android Wear, I'm enjoying the experience in every way with the exception of daily charging. I wish the strap were designed to unclip instead of fasten together but that's a minor peeve. The notification model works flawlessly with Android Lollipop and it's a great tool for runners, though don't forget you have to carry the phone too. It's a beautifully designed piece of hardware that would receive more accolades if it weren't overshadowed by Apple's device and you might be surprised how quickly you enjoy using it. At the moment, it's also only $165 on the Google Store which makes it the best value smart watch currently out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3158TUS7G1PBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC8PMUK#wasThisHelpful","R3158TUS7G1PBZ","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fine home basketball system that looks like it will withstand years of play - once you get it built. As others have commented, it's a nightmare to assemble for a product that's fundamentally not that complicated (heavy base, pole, board and hoop). It ships in a very large, heavy box that most consumers will need a partner to pull apart. There are a substantial number of pieces and the instructions aren't that great (disclaimer: I'm a pro at Ikea furniture). Talking to neighbors, it sounds like most basketball systems aren't that hard to build and this brand is an outlier. So 4.5 stars for the finished product but less than 3 for the experience of getting to your first game.

"Without knowing this was a Black & Decker appliance, I would never have guessed from the cheap build quality and disappointing performance. This is a fairly small box that gets exceptionally hot on the exterior, yet somehow manages to both burn and undercook different parts of the same frozen pizza. It's truly strange to taste frozen tomato and blistering hot carbon simultaneously, and certainly not likely to win compliments from your children let alone any culinary awards.The plasticky and flimsy design combined with its flagrant inability to keep the heat on the inside gives it a dangerous quality that made me glad it will only be switched on for 5 minutes at a time because I'm terrified to leave the room when it's in use. I have had more confidence in some indoor candles than I have from using this electrical fire waiting to happen, and I timidly disconnect and store it in the garage every time it cools down.At best this is a below-average toaster oven with a marketing bias towards pizza instead of toast. My local Target offers similar models for $30 that also unsuccessfully cook pizza but at least you've got $100 left over to order delivery. If you have a regular oven, it will undoubtedly cook more evenly and offer better odds of not burning down your kitchen than this, and even if it takes a few more minutes I think the result will be worth it.So there's a lot to not recommend here and if I sound fearful it's only because I've been through the emotional rollercoaster of getting excited about 5-minute pizza, feeling weird about frozen parts on burned parts, and then wondering if I need to put the fire department on speed-dial. While I'm generally a fan of Black & Decker products, I'd have to suggest giving this one a miss - sadly, the lure of 5-minute pizza is not worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACWCWN9XYG4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R1ACWCWN9XYG4J","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While WiB2 starts off solidly enough in the Hammer horror tradition (a collection of white, middle class people are driven to the middle of nowhere to get terrified and/or killed in creative ways), it loses its way around the mid-point and quickly descends into a disastrous mess. The 'lack of spooky' at the beginning can easily be mistaken for an attempt to build suspense but it turns out there are no horrors or plot-twists waiting - aside from a couple of CG jump scares, the once-terrifying lady of the title has been neutered into a generic ghost that can barely alarm the kids in the movie.There's nothing at all new here as the scenes veer between English wartime school drama and replaying ideas from the first film. Some of it makes absolutely no sense and you get the feeling that the director wanted the movie to end almost as much as the audience. It's a real shame since the book and stage play are really first class yet the key elements here could have been derived from any horror franchise. The actors struggle through it, probably knowing that the final product is just a wasted opportunity.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13KZHAE2FACVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U463R00#wasThisHelpful","R13KZHAE2FACVN","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"2015 has only just started but I'm pretty confident that I won't be premature in declaring this the worst film I'll see all year. Also by my math this  means, together with The Captive, Reynolds now owes me about $12 in unwatchable dross with his name in the last six months. Unable to decide what sort of genre to fit into, The Voices unsuccessfully veers from comedy to romance to grisly murder flick, finally ending as some sort of depressing ode to insanity, featuring hilarious scenes such as a child killing his mother and a dog telling the lead to commit suicide (in a miserable way). Jesus shows up at one point too, just for laughs.There are so many things wrong with this film that I don't know whether to rant or just create a bulleted list. At first I thought it must be Canadian given the off-kilter humor (Reynolds works at a toilet manufacturing plant where everyone has to wear pink which is probably side-splitting north of the border). Then they throw in a foodie Indian guy who has maybe 4 lines in the whole film, followed by an English girl whose main job is to get decapitated and start reeling off British cliches from the inside of a fridge. The attempts at comedy are punctuated by such violence that the entire balance is thrown off, so that it's just dark in a weirdly sinister but totally trite sort of way.On the other hand, the talking cat is really great and doesn't have nearly enough screen time.Back onto what doesn't work, it's also yet another movie where the trailer shows too many key plot points and scenes from the last 20 minutes, so there's not much point in seeing the whole thing afterwards. Or in this case maybe the reverse is true - watch the trailer instead of the movie and save $7 and 2 hours. The whole story is a wasted opportunity, the CG is bad, it has no production values and the script desperately needed a rewrite. Wasn't Reynolds in RIPD as well? If you loved that, you might enjoy this one - otherwise avoid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LLK2WXCDH4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9DFQCQ#wasThisHelpful","R10LLK2WXCDH4S","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicole Kidman cannot remember anything from the day before, psychiatrist Mark Strong is trying to figure out why, and husband Colin Firth has to explain this to her repeatedly. Or so it seems. Probably more accurately titled ""After I Wake Up"", it's two parts Memento to one part Groundhog Day, and has the potential to misdirect and trick the audience to keep you on the edge of your seat.Unfortunately, it does neither. The trailer manages to distil all the major events of the movie to make it appear much more intriguing, but in reality this is a snooze-fest that under-utilizes three great actors. It's a full hour into the film before anything really starts to happen and the promised twist is such a predictable disappointment that it derails the whole film.Without giving too much away, once you know the end, none of the lead-up makes any sense and the characters act unrealistically and illogically. Unlike Memento, which sidesteps logic problems in favor of fastidious plotting and expert audience manipulation, this is a banal story that you'd expect at least to explain itself at the end but instead collapses under the weight of its own absurdity. And it's a real shame since these are three people who should make a 5-star movie together.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1INJWZ2NT1HRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST1MU8W#wasThisHelpful","R1INJWZ2NT1HRS","A1V3TRGWOMA8LC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a simple two-step brushing process: use tube 1 for one minute, then tube 2 for another minute, without rinsing in between. Over a two-week period of twice-daily usage, it does produce noticeably whiter teeth, even if you're a coffee addict. The flavor is pleasant, the process is simple and it's really a matter of just switching out from regular toothpaste with no need for teeth guards or anything complicated. It doesn't whiten as much as targeted (and expensive) whitening products over the same time frame.At this stage, I don't know the price of this product but I can say it performs similarly to Arm & Hammer's bicarbonate of soda toothpaste, which is around $3-4 a tube in supermarkets. There is a difference in taste and I know some people cannot stand the A&H substitute but it definitely whitens very effectively.

The biggest problem, and my only reason for the low rating, is that this doesn't spray a continuous liquid stream compared with SABRE's other products I've tried. It sprays a mist (more like you would expect from a deodorant aerosol) that's as likely to hit the victim as the attacker. This makes it extremely difficult to aim at a third party at a 6-8 foot distance.

Unfolded, the napkins were a generous size and of a good quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIF6OVYEWP8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B18PXOI#wasThisHelpful","RIF6OVYEWP8B","A2BN9DIBP9A0XG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BN9DIBP9A0XG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow. Duo Underwater MP3 player is unlike any that we have tried before. Instead of ear buds, FINIS used a ""bone conduction audio transmission"" that delivers audio directly through the cheekbones to the inner ear. There is a clip that secures the device to goggle straps and allows it to rest on your cheekbone.I used them with my K180 and the fit was just fine. The controls are super simple with one four buttons to maneuver, and yet you can switch between music, audio books, or podcasts. I can't imagine swimming to an audiobook, but that's just me. I like music to help move me through the water.The sound is vastly improved when the player is underwater, as it is designed to work. This creates and issue when doing the breaststroke. Because your head is in and out of the water, the sound kind of goes in and out in an annoying fashion. It should be noted that the sound is a bit off. I'm guessing it's because it never actually goes through your ear, so it just sounds different. However, I did not expect it to sound to be the same as my speakers in my living room.The company tells us that this MP3 player is waterproof to 3 meters for 30 minutes. It is combatable with iTunes and I in fact, did use iTunes to download my favorites and had no problems. It does come with an Auxiliary USB cable that allows for Universal data transfers and charging. The device offers 4GB of flash memory and a Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery life of up to 7 hours. I did not get 7 hours of play on a charge, it was more like 5 1/2 hours. I know this only because I kept track of the times between swims. I'm not the sort of person who would swim for that long! So, unless you are that sort, using it, cleaning it, and recharging may be what you do as well.In appearance this player is very trendy looking, in black and acid green. It would be well like by either male of female swimmers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFYN9TCIQ4B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169RSNGK#wasThisHelpful","ROFYN9TCIQ4B4","A2BN9DIBP9A0XG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BN9DIBP9A0XG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It roasts beautifully as the heft of the pan circulates heat evenly. The rack is sturdy and has proven to be reliable. The lid can be used as a saut pan or serving dish.

"I own several water bottles from Contigo. The Matterhorn is one of my favorites. I like my water COLD, icy cold! And this water still had ice rattling around in it 8 hours after I filled it. I haven't tried it with coffee, as I never use a bottle for both. The lid unscrews, then there is an inner circle that unscrews and makes filling the bottle with ice much easier. I like that the inner seal makes a very nice edge to drink from. Other metal bottles have had rough or sharp edges.Unlike some others, I had no trouble getting the instruction sheet out of the bottle, I think it was clever to handle it that way, significantly reducing the amount of packaging needed.A couple of things:This bottle is heavy.

"I first purchased this game back in the 80s for my oldest daughter. This is the original 8 x 8 squares version, brought back by Winning Moves.  Basically Upwards is to Scrabble as 3D Chess is to Chess. New words are formed not only with horizontal and vertical tiles, but also in height. You can build on words, change words, and create chaos to those poor souls who love the order and method of traditional Scrabble.Play is as follows: Players draw 7 tiles. The first player forms a word that covers one of more of the center squares, and then draws more tiles to maintain 7. The next player can build words adjacent to and on top of the played word. For example, if the word ""sound"" were on the board, you could add an ""a"" and play a ""r"" over the ""s"" to make ""around"". You score one point for each tile in your word, plus a point for each tile UNDER your word. The board is purposely small to encourage building words up. Unlike Scrabble, there are no extra points squares on the board.Upwards is a fun family game, basically aimed at players over 10 years old. However, we do play it with our younger spellers, just with obviously simpler words. Any game that encourages kids spelling and word play gets a 5 star review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQSW3ARHEIJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V82MFSY#wasThisHelpful","R2JQSW3ARHEIJ1","A2BN9DIBP9A0XG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BN9DIBP9A0XG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These 36-grit 3"" IIT Roloc style sanding discs are working well for metal prep on my vehicle. I've been using them with my die grinder along with a 3"" IIT brand disc holder pad. I'm not sure if these will fit any other brands of disc holders though. The sanding discs spin on and off the holder easily and stay in place securely. Some of the sanding discs were mounted a little of center off their plastic hub, but it didn't seem to cause any noticeable vibration. These aluminum oxide discs are rated for 20,000 RPM's and have been doing a good job removing surface rust and old automotive paint.

"I recently purchased this new semi-auto P250 pellet-only pistol from Airgun Depot, since they seemed to be the only ones that had the black version in stock. This is an actual SIG Sauer product that is being manufactured in Japan and seems decently made. The pistol uses a standard 12g CO2 cartridge and is a blowback design. The package says it is rated at up to 500 FPS, but there is no mention of what ammo is used to achieve that, so I will assume it is probably with some type of lightweight alloy pellet. Accuracy seems pretty good at around 8-meters or less, as long as a proper two-hand grip is used to compensate for the hefty blowback. If you happen to already own SIG's other new all metal P226 pellet pistol, then this P250 with its polymer frame feels like it may not be in the same class as far as being a replica, but in reality, the actual P250 firearm also has the polymer frame, so is true to form. The slide on this pistol is metal, however the slide lock is not functional. Neither is the take down lever. The decocking button is functional though and also acts as a safety. The 16-round rotary clip is made of plastic and is the same one used in the P226. The front and rear sights are fixed and both have white dots.  The trigger is reasonably smooth and the pistol has both single and double action. The P250 weighs in at 1.89 lbs with a CO2 cartridge and fully loaded clip installed. This pistol does not have the nice self-piercing feature for the CO2 cartridge like the P226 does. Instead it uses a traditional piercing screw, but at least the piercing screw and knob are all metal and concealed inside the handle. I'm averaging around 45 to 50 solid rounds per cartridge. The literature recommends replacing the cartridge at 64 rounds, but so far I haven't even seen that number. SIG says the pistol is use-tested for 15,000 cycles just like the P226 and I think the overall build quality is very good for what it cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8W8N4L4BS15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIZQG6U#wasThisHelpful","R3N8W8N4L4BS15","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these Skenco Blue Arrow pellets here on Amazon for a very good price. These pointed 6.4 Grain lead free alloy pellets are actually a two-piece design using a smooth, blue plastic sleeve or sabot for a skirt. For pointed pellets, they have a short overall length and will fit into rotary type clips, so I'm using them with a collection of .177 Cal CO2 pistols for close range target shooting at 8-meters or less.  Oddly enough, the skirt of these pellets is just a little to large in diameter to allow them to fit into the clips of my Gamo PR-776 revolver, but they will fit perfectly into the clips of my Umarex S&W M&P 45, SIG Sauer P226 and P250 as well as my Crosman Vigilante 357. With my CO2 pistols, the pellets will blow clean through plastic soda bottles without issue, whereas the lead pellets I've used will just bounce off. They don't seem to compress or distort at all, even when hitting something hard, so they will penetrate nicely, at least at close range. Overall, for what I'm using them for, these pellets are working well and I would definitely purchase them again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4COGJFXYPDKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M4O61K#wasThisHelpful","R4COGJFXYPDKZ","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I occasionally use these Beeman .22 cal felt cleaning pellets as the last step when cleaning the bores of my Optimus break-barrel rifle and 2240 CO2 pistol. After cleaning, I'll put a few drops of RWS synthetic Chamber oil on some of these cleaning pellets and run them through the bore with my rod and Jag. They seem to do a decent job of distributing the oil and leaving a very thin film evenly all around the bore. The package says you can shoot these pellets through your gun to clean it, but I never use them that way. I prefer to just push them through the bore by hand with a Jag.

"I purchased this Air Venturi pellet pen to speed up loading my break-barrel rifle when out in the field. It's been working great, but took a little getting used to, like anything new and different does. This pen tube is made of green tinted plastic and holds fifteen .22 cal pellets, whether they are wadcutter, domed or pointed. It has a ratcheting thumb slide to advance the pellet and insert into the breech. This model also comes with a cap that has an adjustable depth pellet seating tool. The seating tool tip resembles the end of a retractable ball point pen and can be used to seat the pellet to the desired depth after loading. This pen is so much easier than fumbling around with a pouch or tin and trying to load a pellet with your fingers, especially when wearing gloves.

"This new SIG P226 MK-25 pellet pistol had been on backorder for weeks everywhere I looked, including here at Amazon, but I finally found it in stock at Cabela's, in both the Dark Earth and Black colors, so purchased it there. This is an actual SIG Sauer product and is being manufactured in Japan. For a CO2 pistol it's pretty powerful and the blowback is quite heavy. The package says it is rated for up to 510-FPS, but doesnt specify what ammo is used to achieve that number, so I'll just have to assume it is with alloy pellets. Accuracy seems very good at about 5 to 6-meters with the RWS Superdome, Beeman Hollow point, Gamo Rocket and Crosman Premier 10.5 Gr Domed pellets that I've used it with so far, however this pistol is kind of a beast and actually requires some getting used to in addition to a proper two-hand grip to maintain accuracy and compensate for the blowback. With a right handed shooter, if a proper two-hand grip is not used, the pistol will consistently shoot low and left due to the forward kick from the slide returning.The front and rear sights are fixed and both have white dots. Other than the grip and 16-round rotary pellet clip, which are both plastic, this pistol is all metal and weighs in at 2.8 lbs with a CO2 cartridge and loaded clip in place. The self-piercing CO2 cartridge loading system works very well. You just press the release button to open the access door on the back of the handle, slide the 12g cartridge in place and snap the cover closed. I'm averaging about 50 solid rounds per cartridge. The user instructions recommend replacing the cartridge at 64 rounds, but I haven't got near that number yet. You can either rack the slide for single action on the first round or just pull the trigger and the first round will be double action and then the slide cocks the hammer back for single action on each of the remaining seven rounds. Speaking of the trigger, it is very smooth and predictable on this pistol. SIG did a very good job of lubing all of the internal moving parts in this pistol, which is something a lot of manufactures seem to forget. The knurled metal cap on the tip of the 11.5mm X 1.0 threaded  barrel is removable. I'm guessing this is so a compensator or barrel extension can be installed, but not sure. The take-down button and slide lock buttons are not functional and the slide also does not lock back when the clip is empty. However, the decocking button is functional. It releases the hammer and also acts as the safety. Overall, the build quality on this pellet-only pistol is excellent and even more impressive when considering what it cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN4RS7UWUQS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIZQI6S#wasThisHelpful","R3UN4RS7UWUQS5","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Umarex .177 S&W M&P 45 pistol is very decently made for the price. It has mostly metal internal working parts surrounded by a black polymer plastic slide, frame and grip. At 1.7 pounds, it has a little bit of heft to it which adds to the realism factor. It came with one die cast metal 8-round rotary pellet clip along with one black plastic 8-round BB clip that will likely never get used with this pistol since it has a nice 3.1"" rifled steel barrel that I don't want to risk being damaged. The 12g CO2 cartridge loads into the rear of the handle through a hinged lift up plastic back strap cover that snaps securely closed to conceal the cartridge piercing screw knob, for a nice clean look. It is a non-blowback design and has both single and double action. For having such a short barrel, the pistol is quite accurate with very good target penetration at around 6-meters. I'm averaging a good 40 solid shots per CO2 cartridge, with probably still another 10 or so usable at closer range. I purchased an extra 3-pack of the 8-round pellet clips so I can spend more time shooting and less time reloading. Overall, for what it cost, this Umarex M&P pistol is nicely made and is a lot of fun to shoot, so would definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HH7ILHXBPY4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUNLX5G#wasThisHelpful","R2HH7ILHXBPY4F","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two tins of these .177 Gamo Hunter pellets here on Amazon and have had mixed results. The first tin of pellets was fine with absolutely no issues at all and they shot well. The second tin however was a different story altogether. It had lots of pellets with badly bent and misshapen skirts that wouldn't even load into the Umarex rotary clips I was using. It also had many pellets that were that were so badly undersized they would either fall out of the clip when loaded or would back out of the clip when firing the pistol, causing jams. About every sixth pellet had some sort of problem that made it unusable. Very frustrating to say the least. For that reason, I don't think I will be purchasing any more of these Gamo Hunter pellets anytime soon. For me, it's just not worth the aggravation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YSJB2H7SE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00066ZXS2#wasThisHelpful","R21YSJB2H7SE7","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sling swivel and mounting stud set was a perfect fit for my Crosman Optimus .22 air rifle with a barrel OD of .058"". Installation was pretty straight forward and the instructions were easy to follow. The front barrel band mount is two pieces so it can be slipped over the rifle's barrel without having to remove the front site or disassemble anything else. Once tightened down it holds tight and stays securely in place, even with rough handling. The rear mounting stud requires drilling a counter bored hole in the stock starting with 7/32"" to a depth of 1/8"" and finishing with 5/32"" to a depth of 7/8"". The swivels included are 1"" wide and are also the quick attach/detach style so the mounts can stay in place permanently even if the sling is removed. I'm using these with an Allen Endura 85 sling and it's been working out perfectly for my needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Y3Z1I5FBXQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6NMM0#wasThisHelpful","R32Y3Z1I5FBXQ1","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Crosman Vigilante is a decently made .177 cal pellet pistol for the price. Nothing too fancy, but it is quite accurate and lots of fun to shoot. The frame is die cast zinc and the barrel assembly is made of the same black polymer plastic that many other manufactures use for their air guns. For a CO2 pistol it has pretty good muzzle velocity and target penetration at 8-meters. This pistol kit included a nylon holster along with three extra 10-round pellet clips, in addition to the stock one that comes with it. There is also one 6-round BB clip included. The two-piece black plastic handle grip is easily removed for replacing the CO2 cartridge, but the two halves seemed a little loose on the frame and would rattle slightly when in place, which I found annoying, so I added black 3/16-inch diameter stick-on foam dots at each of the corners of the handle frame on both sides and the plastic handle grip now fits snuggly with no movement. I posted a pic below showing the location of the foam dots.

"This soft side case is a decent fit for my Optimus .22 air rifle with scope. It seems like it should be fine for basic, general purpose storage of my rifle to keep dust away and prevent scratches from minor scuffs and bumps when transporting it behind the seat of my truck. This case is from the Pit Bull Economy Series made in China by Bulldog. The overall exterior dimensions of my case are 48-inches long X 10-inches wide with approximately 46-inches X 9-inches of usable interior space.  My rifle is 43-inches long, so there are approximately 3-inches of additional length available inside as well as about 2-inches of additional width. The exterior of the case is made from black woven nylon and has a full length nylon zipper, so it can lay flat when opened. There are two woven nylon handles for carrying and also a plastic loop at the top for hanging the case when it's not being used to store your rifle. The interior is nicely foam padded with a soft woven black covering. There are no interior or exterior pockets, but at this price I wasn't really expecting any. The tag on it says ""It Floats"", but I'm assuming that just refers to the empty case, not one with a rifle in it. If I had a nicer, more expensive rifle I would probably get a more expensive case, but for my needs this economy case should be adequate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DK7C9B9CYSBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AQVHUK#wasThisHelpful","R3DK7C9B9CYSBS","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this Crosman Optimus air rifle is a real honey for the money. For just over a hundred dollars it is very nicely made and the fit and finish on mine were perfect right out of the box. For an air rifle it has quite a bit of power behind it. It sent a round of Crosman .22 Ultra Mag clear through a piece of 1X pine board at a distance of about 10-feet. When fired it has a satisfying kickback and bang, at least for an air gun, so much so that I need wear hearing protection when firing it in the indoor range I have set up in my basement or my ears will be ringing, because it's at least as loud, if not louder, than my Porter Cable FR350 framing nailer is. The stock is decently made from solid wood and has a nice low-sheen satin finish. A couple of coats of Trewax clear paste wax has made it look even better. The break barrel mechanism works smoothly and really isn't that difficult to operate. The trigger takes a little getting used to though in order squeeze it smoothly without jerking the rifle because it's stiff and has a lot of travel. Thankfully though, the trigger pull is adjustable. I backed the adjustment screw out [counterclockwise] about 1-1/2 turns and along with a couple of drops of RWS Spring Oil on the triggers pivot points, it made the trigger pull much lighter and more predictable than the factory setting.The trigger safety lever is a nice design. It holds positively when set and is easy to operate with your trigger finger. The CenterPoint scope is decently made as well and was easy to install. I didn't have any issues with it other than it took a bit of fiddling to get it zeroed in. Overall, considering what I paid for it, I'm pretty impressed with this air rifle and would have no problem recommending it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXRAJ4DAG95T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V957DG#wasThisHelpful","R1MXRAJ4DAG95T","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This .177 Cal. air gun cleaning kit is decent for what it costs. I think the Spring Cylinder Oil and Chamber Lube are where most of the cost is, but then the small 250 count tins of Meisterkugeln Pro Line 8.2gr and Superdome Field Line 8.3gr pellets as well as the booklet of ten 4-Inch sighting targets also adds to the total. The kits 3-piece cleaning rod has a rotating handle and is made in Italy by Stilcrin. When used with the two 9-Inch threaded extensions, it has a total usable length of just over 24-Inches, plus the length of the cleaning attachment. The nylon bristle bore brush and aluminum Jag are both about 2-1/2-Inches long overall. There is a 3-Inch long aluminum oiling needle that screws onto the plastic tips of the oil bottles. A pack of 25 felt cleaning pellets is also included. This same basic cleaning kit is available in .22 Cal. as well. Overall, I think it's a pretty decent cleaning kit and at the time I purchased it the price here on Amazon was the best I could find anywhere. One issue with the cleaning rod that comes with this kit though is going to be finding replacement bore brushes that will fit. It might be a little difficult because the rod has a 5/40 thread male end that connects to the brush. The .177 bore brushes from all the major manufactures seem to have a 5/40 thread male end, not female, which is what is needed to use this rod with the handle. I also have not been able to locate a 5/40 to 5/40 thread female/female conversion adapter, only the female/male versions.Update: I was able to have a 5/40 female to female threaded brass adapter custom made from a seller on eBay for 6.50 delivered. Now I can use the cleaning rod with any brand of .177 bore brush or jag and along with the addition of a 5/40 male to 8/32 female adapter, I can also use the same cleaning rod for .22 bore brushes and jags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GNUGFTRYAZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002INW50#wasThisHelpful","R37GNUGFTRYAZ6","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this WR25 gauge primarily to use for setting the cutter and blade height on my router table and table saw, but I'm also finding that it comes in handy for other things that need the height set or adjusted or depth measured, such as screw and dowel holes. It can straddle the cutter or blade so is a lot easier for me to use than a standard ruler. For a fairly inexpensive gauge, I've found it to be quite accurate and it saves me from a lot of extra test cutting and additional fiddling with height adjustments. The gauge has auto power-off and displays fractions in 1/32"" increments with a maximum depth range of approximately 3"". It seems decently made overall and even came with an extra CR2032 coin battery. The body is made of sturdy plastic with two magnets inset in the base of the legs so it can stick securely to ferrous metal tables, but of course they don't work if your tables are aluminum or MDF like mine. The mode settings on the gauge for inch/metric and incremental measurement are easy to figure out and the digital display itself is easy to read, but is not backlit. No storage case or pouch was included, but it should be easy enough to find a small zippered case at the camera store or someplace similar. For what it costs I think this height gauge is definitely worth having and would have no issue recommending it to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UG76MGGXJQMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WMRVS4#wasThisHelpful","R2UG76MGGXJQMQ","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These 2"" IIT Roloc style sanding discs are working well for some metal prep I'm doing.

Some of the sanding discs are a mounted a little off center of their plastic hub, but it doesn't seem to add any noticeable vibration or affect how they work. The 36-grit aluminum oxide is doing a good job removing automotive paint and surface rust in some of the areas that would be tough to get at with a larger disc sander. These discs are rated for 20,000 RPM's, but I have been using them in a 25,000 RPM die grinder since once in use and under load, the tools RPM's will drop enough that they will operate within their rated speed. I will go through quite a few of these discs at a time, but I think that is just to be expected with such a tiny disc and not really an issue. I'm only using them for smaller surface areas anyway.

"I purchased this rack for our 2004 RAV4 and it seems to be working out very well. The rack can hold two bikes which is great, but right away, I noticed that the lower support tube of the racks frame has no padding on it at all, so while the vehicle is driving down the road the front sprocket or pedal crank of the inner bike can bump or rub against the tube and damaged its paint, no matter how well you strap the bike down. To remedy this I put some foam pipe insulation on the tube, which worked to cushion the contact with the bike. For the price of this rack, I feel there there should have been some type of padding installed there from the factory because it seems like a pretty obvious problem. Other than that one issue, the rack seems to be well designed as well as made from good quality materials. Installation was fairly simple, but the instructions could probably be a little clearer as to which clip goes with which strap on the racks frame. With our RAV4, both the inner and outer halves of the spare tire cover had to be removed, which requires removing the spare tire from the vehicle and reinstalling it, so that adds a little more time to the install. Overall though, the rack is working well and seems like it should last for several years with regular use, so I think it was worth what I paid for it here on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20X6MCRWP8LAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QJDFMK#wasThisHelpful","R20X6MCRWP8LAH","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just recently purchased this Dewalt DCS370 band saw and really have taken a liking to it. I've always just used a corded band saw for the majority of my smaller metal cutting work, so this cordless has already proven itself to be to be a real time saver. The Dewalt saw is single-speed design and the 32-7/8"" X .020 blade runs at 570 SFPM, which is fast for a portable band saw and makes for some surprisingly quick cuts for such a small saw. In comparison, my corded Milwaukee's 44-7/8"" X .020 blade runs at a maximum speed of 350 SFPM. The Dewalt only has a 2-1/2"" capacity, but I find that it will actually cover many of the things I often cut like strut, allthread, PVC pipe and EMT or conduit where the extra capacity of a larger saw is not generally needed anyway. I prefer to use this saw with the Dewalt 18V Li-Ion batteries, which are quite a bit lighter than the NiCad's and makes for better balance and easier one handed cutting. The battery life has also been surprisingly good for this saw. For some reason the Lowes and HD stores in my area don't carry the 32-7/8"" replacement blades for this saw, but they are easy to come by online from Amazon as well as places like eBay, Grainger and MSC Supply. The blades usually come in packs of three for around twenty dollars and in addition to Dewalt's own branded blades, these blades are also being made by MK Morse. Makita has them available as well, but their price per blade seems to be a little on the expensive side. Olson doesn't currently make band saw blades of this size and apparently has no interest in making blades this small, even though just about every electrical, HVAC and plumbing contractor around seems to use a cordless band saw on the job these days. I find myself using this saw all the time now because it is just so compact and convenient. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this saw and I think the only regret I have with it is that I waited as long as I did to get one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7RSA7ZN0CXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W7J8NM#wasThisHelpful","R2J7RSA7ZN0CXD","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found the GD0601 to be a very decent die grinder for the price. The grinder is a single-speed 25,000 RPM unit, not variable-speed as the technical details seem to indicate. No storage case is included either as is also incorrectly indicated. I was able to find a really nice foam lined 14-7/8"" X 9-3/4"" X 4-1/4"" metal storage case from Coastal Tool, [Part#: CC] for around twenty-three dollars that fits the grinder well and also has a small removable metal parts bin that can hold the collet wrenches along with several bits and accessories. A side handle for this grinder is available from Makita [Part#: 192985-5], but requires sliding the rubber boot off the nose of the tool to install it. When the side handle is removed the rubber boot can be slipped back on the tool again if desired. The side handle is the same one that comes with the Makita GD0800C die grinder and I consider it to be a necessity for a straight die grinder when using it with wire end brushes and sanding discs. I had to find this out on my own though, because Makita's own Technical Support didn't even know that their die grinders could use a side handle. This grinder is fairly lightweight for its size. It's rated at 3.5A and is double insulated with an 8-foot 2-wire power cord. The power switch has a lock-on position for continuous use. The tool runs very smoothly and is also reasonably quiet for a die grinder. It can be used with many different types of bits and attachments like 3-inch cut-off wheels, grinding stones, sanding drums, wire brushes, flap wheels and burr bits as well as 2-inch and 3-inch Roloc wheels and sanding discs. I purchased a 1/8"" Makita collet cone [Part#: 763626-6] for the grinder so I can use it with my Dremel bits if needed.

"I've had this Dewalt DW059 impact wrench for several years and really like it a lot. I've always been impressed with how much torque it has, considering that its a cordless. This is the model that uses a detent pin to retain the socket on the shaft, not the other hog pin style that Dewalt also makes. It has a rocker switch that thankfully has no trigger lock to fiddle with, which makes it great for momentarily switching back and forth between forward and reverse to help break frozen nuts and bolts free. I use it for the usual things like lug nuts when rotating tires on my vehicles, but I've also found that it works great for RV leveling jacks. It makes the job of leveling an RV after parking a much faster and easier job than the regular method. I've run into some RV jacks that were so stiff and frozen from being exposed to salt air and beach sand all season that I doubt I could have ever gotten them to free up using a regular wrench with a breaker bar no matter how much PB blaster I soaked them with, but this impact wrench broke the jack screws loose and got them to operate freely again. For me, that alone was worth the purchase price of this bare tool. This impact wrench also works great for sinking lag bolts in ledger boards and for mounting conduit straps to poles for power and communication risers. I use it with both the Dewalt 18V NiCad and Li-Ion batteries and battery life has been pretty impressive for most jobs I've needed it for. Along with a set of SAE and Metric impact sockets, this wench is able to handle the majority of my needs for an impact wrench and is especially handy when working in remote areas with no power. I purchased a storage case for it from Dewalt [Part#: N142716] so I can carry all of the extensions and adapters I regularly use with the tool.

The tool feels solid in your hand with no noticeable flexing of the body at all, even when using it with larger size spade and self-feed auger bits or hole saws. I could sometimes feel the body of my older Dewalt DC988 hammerdrill flex under heavy load, so it seems Dewalt has addressed that issue. The keyless chuck on this one is a little different from the one on my older hammerdrill, but seems to hold the bits at least as securely, if not better than the old one did. Unlike my old hammerdrill, this one has a trigger activated LED light which comes in handy when working in dimly lit areas. There are three gear ranges on this tool as well as a variable speed trigger and it also has three settings on the collar for hammer drilling, straight drilling as well as a screw driver position that works along with the adjustable clutch setting to prevent overdriving fasteners. Battery life has been quite good when with the Li-Ion batteries when using it for normal drilling and screw driving, but naturally, when running something like a 7/8"" X 18"" nail eater ship auger through double 2X headers, they will run down more quickly. The hammerdrill itself though can handle that type of work all day without issue, just like my older model did. Overall, I'm pleased with the hammerdrill and would likely buy again when needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6IMXM1W18RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RT7K3W#wasThisHelpful","R1L6IMXM1W18RV","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this DW106 drill here on Amazon back in 2001 and still have and use it today. It doesn't get used every day, but has seen fairly regular use mainly for things like drilling holes to fish wires up into walls of older buildings with long whip type Diversibits and with small diameter cotton buffing wheels for polishing metals and plastics. It will also get used with the occasional flap disc or wire wheel for cleaning up rust and removing paint. The keyless chuck on this drill is a big help when I need to change bits frequently for a project. The motor is rated at 5.8A and has a variable speed range of 0-2500RPM. The trigger lock will only engage when the trigger is fully depressed for high speed, but is still an extremely useful feature that I use all the time. I believe Dewalt has discontinued this particular model, but you can still find this drill both new and used if you shop around. Considering how much work I've gotten out of this drill and how long I've owned it, I think it was an excellent purchase and is definitely worth getting if you're looking for a good smaller 3/8"" drill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRG6KHN86YCLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RHHH#wasThisHelpful","RRG6KHN86YCLZ","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased this Porter Cable PN650 palm nailer to install replacement stainless steel Simpson joist hangers on all of the PT joists under our deck. The old galvanized hangers where the deck joists attach to the ledger board were very badly corroded and starting to rot away. With the deck only being a couple of feet above the ground along with the working space between joist making it difficult to get a good hammer swing from a crouching or kneeling position, I got this palm nailer to help make the job easier and faster to complete with less fatigue on my aging  body. The nailer worked great for installing the 10 X 3"" nails as well as the shorter 10 X 1-1/2 stainless steel Simpson nails into the joist hangers. It was definitely much faster than trying to bang them in by hand and probably even gave more consistent results. I used it with a 1/4"" polyurethane air hose and kept the compressor air pressure set to 100-PSI and the nailer worked perfectly without a single lull or reduction in impact through the whole process. The nailer seems to be well made and came as a complete kit with several attachments along with wrenches to change them out all in a nice blow-molded fitted plastic case.  Overall, I'm quite happy with it and would have no issue recommending it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAM8EOPSWJUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006411G#wasThisHelpful","R3BAM8EOPSWJUJ","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This HS1828 tamper plate is made from a fairly hefty 5-inch square piece of solid steel that weighs a little over 3-pounds. I own a Spline-Drive rotary hammer, so use it with the Bosch HS1827 shank, but it can also be used with Bosch's HS1927 SDS-Max shank. Once on the shank, it is good and tight and usually requires a couple of taps with a ball peen hammer to remove it if I want to be able to store it in my hammers carry case. It's probably a little expensive for a hunk of steel with a hole through the center of it, but it does what it's supposed to so I think it was worth the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P52MMAQGJUS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009H5BLM#wasThisHelpful","R2P52MMAQGJUS2","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this set of Cuisinox salt and pepper mills a few months ago and they have been working out very nice. The mills give a nice even grind on the coarse kosher salt and mixed pepper corn blend we use in them. The cutters in these mills are ceramic so should stay sharp for years. The cutters themselves are adjustable via a threaded nut in the plastic base and once set, hold their setting without issue. The bottles are actually made of nice heavy glass instead of just cheap plastic. They both also have a stainless steel band around their base and nice easy to remove clear plastic push-on covers to help keep the contents fresh between uses. Overall, we are very pleased with this set of salt and pepper mills and would recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20JE7CMVJN7FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026SLB70#wasThisHelpful","R20JE7CMVJN7FY","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a little hard to tell from the product description, but this Bosch HS1827 tamper shank is the one you need if you own a Spline-Drive rotary hammer and want to use the Bosch tamper plate with it. This is the tamper shank only. You need to buy the tamper plate that it is used with separately. The overall length of this shank is 12"", but it only has about 7"" of useable length once installed in the hammer and inserted in the tamper plate. The shorter length doesn't seem to be an issue for me though. The shank is made in Italy from good quality steel, so seems like it should last for quite some time. I use this shank along with the Bosch HS1828 5"" X 5"" tamper plate for things like compacting crushed stone base for small retaining walls and it seems to do a good job with it overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PFTWQ39PDXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OOSCQ6#wasThisHelpful","R4PFTWQ39PDXY","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this HS1495 stubby chisel to use with my Bosch 11224VSR SDS rotary hammer. The chisel is decently made in Italy from good quality steel and has an overall length of 5-3/4"", but the length is further reduced to about 4"" when installed in the hammer, which makes it good for getting into tight spots where a standard SDS chisel would be too long. When used along with the Bosch right angle SDS adapter, it makes for an even more compact setup. It seems like it will hold up just as well as any other SDS chisel for concrete chipping, so I think it was a good buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDDD2RUWO2E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AO4T8K#wasThisHelpful","R2HDDD2RUWO2E8","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This L-shaped adapter allows you to convert Lenox's regular PVC saw into a flush cut saw and I have found it to be a very handy accessory. When used along with Lenox's longer 18"" saw blade, I can quickly cut larger diameter PVC like 3"" DWV pipe perfectly flush with the floor to install a closet flange for mounting a toilet. Using it with the shorter 12"" saw blade allows you to work in tight areas like inside a kitchen base cabinet to cut an 1-1/2"" PVC drain line flush to a wall. The adapter sort of looks like it might be made from cheap grey plastic, but it's actually quite sturdy. I've never cracked or broken mine in all  the years I've been using it, not even in cold weather. I don't use it every day so normally won't keep the adapter permanently installed on my saw, but instead just put it on when needed. It only involves two screws so is quick and simple to install and remove. Considering how little it cost, I think this flush cut adapter was a good investment and would recommend it to anyone that regularly uses a Lennox PVC saw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HUXEHPAIOXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00093DA0U#wasThisHelpful","R37HUXEHPAIOXK","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a set of four different sizes of these Crescent auto wrenches and this 15"" wrench is one of the sizes that I seem to use the most. The jaws on this wrench open to a max of 3-3/4"" compared to only 1-3/4"" capacity for my regular Crescent 15"" adjustable wrench, which makes it ideal for use on larger nuts and bolts.All sizes of these Crescent auto wrenches seem to be very expensive for what they are, especially considering they are now being manufactured in China, but at least they still seem to be made using decent quality steel. They all have a warning stamped into the collar of the lower jaw that says ""No hammering - No extensions"", but I still occasionally find myself using a hammer for initial loosening or final tightening of larger nuts. The smooth jaws on this wrench are much better than an ordinary pipe wrench for working with things like larger chrome plated brass nuts on exposed sink drain P-traps or urinal flush valves, since they won't chew them up and leave unprofessional looking teeth marks all over everything. Overall, the wrench seems reasonably well made and appears to be holding up to my use, so in general I'm happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPVUU9AUOR9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KL1YQI#wasThisHelpful","R1GPVUU9AUOR9O","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this TPI 343/C3 dual input thermometer for a few years now and it has been a good little unit. It comes as a kit with a rubber overboot and fold out tilt stand, two 48"" long type-K thermocouple beaded probes, two pipe clamp probes and a nylon storage case that has enough room for extra probes. The unit is waterproof and has auto power off. It has selectable inputs for degree C or F, T1/T2 or Delta/T temperature differential, Min/Max and display hold. When needed, the unit can be field calibrated using ice water. The temperature range depends on the type of probes used, but the user manual says the thermometer has a usable range from -58F to 2462F. The GK13M beaded probes that came with my thermometer are rated for -165F to 400F, but I also frequently use it with TPI's GK12M probe [-40F to 950F] for testing ovens. The two CK21M pipe clamp probes that also came with this kit make for easier superheat and subcooling temp readings. They will fit on pipes up to about 1"" in diameter and are rated for -58F to 482F. I think this is a decent unit overall, especially considering the price and features, so I would recommend it to anyone looking into buying one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LC0AKK7XSAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095X8FT6#wasThisHelpful","R36LC0AKK7XSAG","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this TPI hot-wire anemometer/air velocity meter several years ago and it seems to be holding up well. For a moderately priced unit, I think it has a lot of good features. It came with a rubber overboot and a decent nylon storage case as well as the 6 AAA batteries it uses. The unit has auto power off and reads degree C or F with temperature range from -5F to 175F as well as air velocity from 0.2 m/s to 20 m/s. It can be set to display either m/s, km/s, ft/min, knots or miles/h, but doesn't read CFM directly, so the reading must be converted using the formula in the manual. It has data recording and there is a 3.5mm serial RS232 output jack for printing and viewing the readings on a computer, but the actual RS232 cable isn't included. The remote hot-wire probe tip on this unit is approximately 3/8"" in diameter and the probe is permanently attached with a cable that allows for an overall probe length of about 4-feet when fully extended, so it has plenty of reach for getting deep into plenums and ductwork. TPI recommends having the meter recalibrated once a year, so will need to be shipped to their service facility for that. Overall though, this meter seems to be well made and hasn't given me any trouble to date, so I would have no issue with recommending it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AX4AJH4V2AAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095X8YZG#wasThisHelpful","R3AX4AJH4V2AAV","A2UEH0U5CV3053","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UEH0U5CV3053?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Went fishing for catfish. Casting out is sooo smooth. But the problems were-1st day-After catching a nice size 2 lb. cat, threw it out again and couldn't reel it in very easily. Looked in the bail and it had a rat's nest sitting on top. Got that fixed after 5 minutes and threw it out again. About the 4th cast, everything came out of the reel, my line went out and my hook.  It took time to redo, fished some more, caught 1 more cat and the line wouldn't go out far as it did before. Checked the line and it had like little twists on it every 1/2"". Back to the cabin, took all the ""cajun"" line that comes with the rod and put on new 12 lb Trilene. 2nd day worked well, but the screw kept loosening up from the handle. I didn't have a flathead screwdriver so I had to use my fingernail. The problem continued on the rest of the day and the next day. It loosened about every 5th cast.Pain in the butt, but I still have to give it 3 stars because of how nice it casts. Catfish-love shrimp and we didn't catch them on mackarel. Caught one on squid.

"Bought this nice looking rod and reel with great expectations. I've had many open reels before and was tired of it. Bought this, went to my friends' backyard and cast it into their pool. Very smooth. Took it fishing this past week and fished for 3 days. First day, nice catfish hit the line and reeled it in beautifully. While throwing out the second time and reeling it back in to check the bait (cats love shrimp!) and it wouldn't reel in easily. Once I got it in I gave it to my friend who has fished for say 60 years. He opened the bail and there was a rats nest in there. He got the mess out and fixed my line. I can cast out far and when I throw this out, it glides like a champ.  A few more tosses out and the hook and line gets tossed off the reel. I lose it all!! Gave it back to my friend who again fixed it for me. Caught another nice cat and noticed the handle on the reel is coming out. On the otherside of it is a big screw that had loosened. No flathead on the boat so I used my fingernail. This happened 3 more times. I shouldn't have to mess with something like that. After we got back to the cabin I had to take out all of the ""cajun"" line the manufacturer had put on there and put on 12 lb Trilene.  2nd day worked well with the new line, but the screw came loose again. 3rd day all went well except of course-the screw loosened again. I'm keeping it because when I go fishing with my friend, he fixes it for me. Don't know what I would do by myself. Caught only 5 catfish in 3 days, but they were good size and as they say, a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work! I am a 64 year old female who has fished for about 30 years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OPHA5Q627R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013B5M6C#wasThisHelpful","R16OPHA5Q627R3","A3IW02VPVOCNFG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IW02VPVOCNFG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered these for my son who is currently 11 years old and LOVES to watch YouTube videos and listen to music.  Over time he has tried out several types and brands of headphones and has stated that this is one of his favorite pairs.  He likes that they are comfortable to wear without too much pressure or being too loose while on his head.  The sound quality for what he uses them for are great - definitely crisp and clear.  As a parent I like these because they block the noise from seeping through, so when he's enjoying things on his tablet or phone in the same room we aren't distracted or having to ask him to turn his volume down (or turn ours up!).  The best feature is that these are bluetooth capable, so should you want to go wireless you certainly can.  My son prefers to plug the wire in and use them that way because he's not one to remember to charge them.  Another amazing feature is that you can insert a MP3 card into the slot and listen to music that way as well, although we have not tested this feature so we cannot comment on that at this time.

"This is a nice trio of dental items that are a nice addition to your brushing routine.  My main focus for ordering this set is due to the fact I have a permanent retainer and if you have one you know that it's not the easiest to keep the plaque from building next to it.  I go to the dentist regularly for cleanings and the tartar removal tool is a must-have for me (and I will caution, it is SHARP!).  I do use it in conjunction with the mirror which works really well with the LED light so you can see exactly what you need to in order to remove any remaining food or plaque build-up.  I will be honest and say I've not used the stain remover tool since I've not found a need for it yet.  I would not recommend that these tools replace dental visits but they will help reduce the amount of plaque on your teeth and in the gum area.

I am thrilled that giving my dogs a bath is just now that much easier, too! This installs incredibly easy (no tools required!) and sits well on the mount (ordered separately).  The jets/spray are perfectly placed for a relaxing experience; this was a welcome addition to our shower as the previous one we had lacked a decent level of water pressure.  Overall this earns five stars for ease of install, it's overall appearance, the price point and functionality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUKUTLRSNN53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012O5T9RS#wasThisHelpful","R3TUKUTLRSNN53","A22SHGSYPKM9L2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22SHGSYPKM9L2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Purelux arm mount is a perfect pairing for the Purelux hand-held shower head.  It is very durable, made out of a solid plastic with chrome finish.The mount is supplied with a roll of teflon plumber's tape which is a bonus so it's one less item to have to make sure you have on hand.  Installation was a breeze and no tools are required! Once we had it in place it is on tight and does not leak or drip.  It fit comfortably and swivels nice and smooth, and fits the shower head arm well.  This is a great price for the arm; be sure if you are purchasing other items such as the shower head that you also purchase the hose which is sold separately.  I received this item in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest opinion of the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKPR321I9VT98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OJOI4I#wasThisHelpful","RKPR321I9VT98","A22SHGSYPKM9L2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22SHGSYPKM9L2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags are great for reducing space in your bag or suitcase while traveling, or for storing extra clothing or linens. These are great for keeping out dust and debris, bugs, water and rodents (perfect use is for places like the cabin where you leave bed linens behind). These could also work great for storing or transporting documents or document folders, storing spare clothing on places like a boat or ATV, and storing baby items such as first outfit/christening clothing/first blanket to pass on.  I like the variety of sizes and the transparent material so you can see what's inside. The plastic material is thicker than the oversized ziplock plastic bags that you can find at the local big-box stores, and the vacuum compression ensures that you can stack and store items and reduce the amount of space in your closet or storage area.  I love these and definitely will be ordering more!

"I am a big fan of clear cases, I love their simplicity and versatility of putting a picture/drawing/decorated paper on the back. That being said, as you know not all cases are created equal. THIS clear case by Spigen is by far the top-of-the-line as far as clear cases go - I love that they kicked it up a notch with the gunmetal TPU bumper because it looks amazing! The entire case is so protective with it's thick poly material and encompasses every inch of the phone, leaving it secure in the event of an accidental drop. It feels great in my hand, and by that I am referring to I am confident it's not going to just slip right out because the material is that kind that is rather grippy. My buttons push easily, and this is no problem getting on and off my phone. If you are looking for a good, solid, well made clear case then look no further because I can assure you this is IT!

"I absolutely love this keratin shampoo and conditioner by Luseta! Aside from the way my hair feels it smells amazing and I noticed that I only needed two average pumps of both the shampoo and conditioner which is nearly half of the amount of the former brand I was using! It rinses out reallly easily, cleanly (no oily residue!) and quickly - you don't feel like you need a second set of hands or stand there rinsing for what feels like an eternity. I love that this is a pump form, it makes it so much easier to use. I have tried other Luseta products and every single one has been a winner!

I chose the bright pink and grey combo which is perfect for being able to locate my phone in my purse among the sea of other stuff floating around in it.  I like the textured ""grippy"" grey parts of the case, it not only adds an aesthetic touch but it gives extra security to hold onto the phone.

"This wireless bluetooth speaker by Aukey is great! I could not wait to get it out of the package the minute it arrived and check it out. It is easy to synch The quality of the sound itself is crystal clear and sharp. It is a nice compact size and with the carabiner clip you can easily carry it with you and clip it to a variety of spaces/places and use it indoors or outside.  The way we enjoy ours is in conjunction with a portable projector. We pair it to our laptop and immediately have a home theater system going - one that we can literally bring anywhere!

"I love these bluetooth headphones, they are so comfortable and lightweight.  I wear them when I am working out and I like that they stay in my ears without feeling too tight or too loose, and since they wear over the ear they don't fall out nearly as easily as traditional ear buds I was using.  The charge is great on these, I can typically get my hour workout in and recharge after about 5 days.  As far as the sound quality goes I have been using these for almost 3 weeks consistently so far and the sound is clear and all background noise is pretty much eliminated which I love so I can focus on what I am doing.

"We have been using our Pizza Peel and cutter for a couple of months now, and while we have a pizza cutter I am honestly shocked that we have not bought a pizza peel before this! We are a busy family of four, and pizza (take-n-bake, frozen and re-heating delivery) is a staple in our house and frequently on the dinner rotation.  The peel is perfect for removal of the pizza and taking it from oven to counter or table, but it isn't just for pizza.  With the large flat surface and reaching wooden handle we now can safely and easily remove other breads not only from the oven but grabbing other items like garlic toast off a pan no longer requires one-by-one with tongs or burned fingers if taken off the pan alone.  Now I can scoop up several items at once and bring the right to the table.  The accompanying cutter slices through the aforementioned pizza, quick breads, waffles and other ""finger"" foods with ease and does so swiftly.  These are two items that every kitchen should have because you will use them often!

"If you don't already use this, what are you waiting for?!? It has so many good uses! Personally for me, I love to have it on hand for cleaning.  Most people know it SMELLS good, but do you know it can remove permanent marker off of many surfaces? Or how at full strength right out of the bottle it effortlessly takes paint off of your hands (STOP using stinky mineral spirits!)? How it can deodorize your vacuum just by putting a couple drops of it on a cotton ball and vacuuming up that cotton? You don't have to be a full-time essential oil user or own a diffuser to have a bottle of this on hand.  If you have NEVER used an essential oil in your life, and even if you never plan on it or could care less, you want this, you really do.  I have several bottles on hand because I honestly do not want to ever be without.  It's that useful.  Get one.  Get two.

I like to use it as part of my nighttime facial care routine and have seen really great results with the overall appearance and texture.  In addition to the way my skin feels I am a big fan of the rose scent as it is so much different and refreshing than those that smell so strongly of alcohol that you are left almost wincing at their odor and burn.

"These solar powered string lights are PERFECT for this time of year! I currently have them inside of a (fake) pumpkin on my front porch.  I love that I don't have a cord draping across my step to an electrical box AND that I don't have to spend money keeping batteries in a battery pack.  This string simply recharges itself in the daylight and when the sun goes down the lights come on.  At first I was confused as to why I couldn't get them to work but realized that these only work where it's dim or dark, which is exactly the way I will use them.  I like that they are not traditional bulbs but the best way I can describe them is like a droplet of water on a string.

"I was recommended to take a fish oil supplement with my weight loss regimen for heart health and also elasticity repair of the skin.  There has been plenty of research done on the efficacy of Fish Oil/Omega-3 and studies show how in addition to heart health it is wonderful it is for brain health, vision, a handful of health ailments and even post-partum depression.  I have tried several brands over the years for different reasons but have found these by Nature's Branch to be a top favorite of mine.  I like that the ingredient list is small yet they are high in fish oil, EPA and DHA - more so than many you find over-the-counter.

I cannot recommend this shower head enough! It installed so easily - in under 20 minutes.  After using a single head shower, the dual head design is AMAZING experience in and of itself.  Adding to that is the ability to adjust the functions between a standard flow to massaging/rain and you have yourself one luxurious shower.  A bonus to us is being able to use the removable arm, as that is not only great for personal use but also for giving the pooches a bath! Where we used to have to use a cup to rinse now we simply use the detachable sprayer which is SO much more convenient (and also works terrifically for those times when you scrub down the shower and want to give the walls a good rinsing).

"Love, love, LOVE this case! I have several phone cases that range from bulky to slim-fit.  From clear to decorated.  I like having a variety to choose from; well when I received this case by Spigen and tried it on to see how it looked and fit I did not want to take it off.  It fits better than any other case I have and the color combination of the mint green and gold is so eye-catching! I have only been using this case for about a week and have had many compliments on it.  To install you simply slide the two pieces apart (the gold and the mint), slide your phone into the larger part and then slide the gold on - it's that simple! The case is not bulky at ALL and is completely protected end-to-end in the mishap of a fall or slip.  The buttons are covered, which I love - no pocket lint or dust getting in there! The camera is cut out wonderfully, as is the speaker/charging port/headphone jack. The mint green portion is kind of rubberized which makes it a no-slip grip. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!

"I am extremely impressed with this Fosmon Qi charger! I love having it at my desk as it makes it so easy to pop my phone on there about an hour before my day is up and my phone is fully charged for the evening.  No worries about alining the phone ""just so"" - I can simply lay it on the lip of the dock and it immediately begins charging.  I like that I can easily see the screen of my pone too since it sits UP and is not laying DOWN - so when texts or calls come in I can easily look over and see the screen.  I am definitely buying a second one for the bedroom so there's no fumbling about in the dark of the night for my husband who inevitably forgets to plug his phone in and then tries to find the plug in the dark!

"We have 4 people that each have a minimum of 2 devices each, and at any given time it seems like half of those need to be charged at the same time. I love this 6-port USB charger for that very reason! I have placed it in our living room and have attached spare charging cables (for us it was 4 apple cords and 2 android that was the best ratio!) to each slot so anytime someone needs to plug in, the charging station is available. No need to go hunt down the original cord or borrow one and fight over whose is whose. This is the perfect solution! It also comes in handy when visitors come over and need to recharge their device but don't have a cord along.

"I have charged this emergency power failure light overnight and it works wonderfully as a backup flashlight.  What I really like is that it doesn't require batteries so in the case where one might need a working flashlight (seems like batteries are always dead, right?!?) this is great! I leave it charging in my son's room because he tends to be afraid of the dark and this is always handy for him in a pinch.  That being said - this also has an automatic feature on it's toggle switch, should power run out it is supposed to automatically turn on within one minute.  Thankfully we've yet to use power so my review is not yet based on that functionality (and the reason I have not scored it 5 stars yet).

"I had high hopes for this, as our son regularly uses his iPhone 5S for watching YouTube.  I thought that this would be very handy to magnify the phone's screen (which of course is quite small) so he could see it better.  When it arrived I was slightly disappointed to discover it's not even made of glass, it's actually made of very thin plexiglass.  It was sent in a bubble mailer and was dented right out of the package from shipping so it rendered the item virtually useless as the dent/crease is in the center of the screen.  In addition, there is no clip or way to secure the phone on the bar (not sure if mine is defective? I didn't receive an insert on how to even use it) so it just kind of leans against the back arm.  Overall it is an interesting concept but quite thin and flimsy.  The framing is made of plastic as well so I am not expecting this to last very long.

"I have tried many different brands of foundation from cream, to cream-to-powder, to liquid.  Many of them have been fine but I really found that out of the several I have to choose from I keep turning back to this brand.  It comes with a soft/spongey applicator that applies the makeup flawlessly.  I tend to have really dark circles under my eyes and this makeup evens them out and makes them virtually disappear! I like the compact style, and the fact that the applicator is stored separately from the makeup so not only does it not dry out the makeup (that happened with my Mary Kay) but also the product is not soaking into the applicator.  The included mirror is perfect for touch-ups too! The color I chose was a perfect match to my skin and the makeup itself didn't cause any skin irritations.  I would buy this brand again!

"We wholeheartedly love Spigen products to protect our devices.  This screen protector is our favorite brand, and we have tried several.  Where others seem to chip or crack easily, Spigen's seem to outlast others yet are priced the same or cheaper! They install easily and quite flawlessly.  If you have installed a screen protector before it's really a no-brainer to do it again.  If you haven't you will find it takes literally mere minutes to protect your screen from hairline scratches and marks.

It's so protective with it's poly material and encompasses every inch of the phone, leaving it secure in the event of an accidental drop.  It feels great in my hand, and by that I am referring to I am confident it's not going to just slip right out because the material is that kind that is rather grippy.

The two-part case is flexible (the clear portion) yet sturdy (the colored band).  The rose gold is trendy and accents the clear case wonderfully! The cutouts for the camera, speaker, earphone jack and charging port are perfect.  I love the metallic button covers - they not only look great but they also keep dust and debris out of these areas and are responsive as if they were the buttons themselves.  The great thing about the clear back is the ability to put in pictures, drawings or designs that you can change up at any time!Spigen prides themselves on superior products and this case is no exception.

We used to use the meat ""hammer"" which has the spiked head on it but that only works well if you are looking to flatten your meat (as you would in preparation to roll it).  With this you simply press down and the nailed spikes poke the meat effortlessly and allow you to marinate your cuts of beef and chicken so easily.

"I have used many pre-workout powders over the last few years.  The majority of them almost always give me the jitters.  Cellucor's C4 Fitness Pre-Workout lists itself as explosive, but in my case,  it is a steady build-up that keeps me going during my workout.  The directions say to take it twenty to thirty minutes before your workout, and it definitely works that way in my case.  I take it about twenty minutes before getting started, and it slowly lifts me until my forty to sixty minute workout is complete.Each serving is only five calories, so you don't have to worry about burning any extra calories off.  The taste is somewhat medicinal, but it isn't bad.  This is one of the best blending workout powders that I've ever used.  I've only used a shaker bottle to mix this in my water, and it almost completely dissolves.This powder also contains a bit of creatine (1 gram per serving), which helps build and recover muscles during and after a workout.I really like this powder and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6WXIB2SWXO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U464HYK#wasThisHelpful","R2K6WXIB2SWXO9","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Dove Men + products in the past, and I am very impressed with them for the most part.  This Dove Men + Care Body Wash is no exception.  The moisturizing elements of this wash do exactly what Dove claims that they can do.  After just a couple of showers, I noticed my skin feeling much softer than normal.  My skin is normally very dry in certain areas and I have to use lotion (and, my goodness, how I hate lotion), so this Extra Fresh Body Wash definitely makes it easier for me to put on less lotion.The scent, as with all of the Dove products I've used in recent years, lasts all day long but isn't overbearing.  It smells quite nice, is light, and keeps you from smelling too bad after a long day at work.The cooling agent in this wash is a nice added touch, but it quickly dies off after getting out of the shower.  It's definitely a pick-me-up when getting ready for work in the morning, but don't expect to stay ""cool"" all day.The only reason that I'm taking off one star on this product is the fact that I have to use more of this body wash during a shower.  Other Dove products and most other body washes only require me to place a small amount on my scrubber and I'm good for the whole shower.  With this body wash, however, the lather vanishes after I clean the upper half of my body and I have to add more soap to my scrubber.  That could prove to be costly in the long run if you have to use more body wash than you normally do.Despite this shortfall, I still recommend Dove Men + Care Extra Fresh Body Wash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM81ZA9S2Q72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCURCYA#wasThisHelpful","R3NM81ZA9S2Q72","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear different shoes for different types of excercise.  For high impact training (Insanity, T25, etc.), Under Armour is my go-to brand.  For walking and general use throughout the day, FILA is the brand that I trust.  When I hit the trails, Adidas is on my feet.  For track running, though, I've never found that one company that I trust more than any other....until now.For years I alternated between Puma, Nike, and FILA for running.  Nike was the leader of the pack for a few years, but something changed (either in my feet or in Nike's shoe construction) that made them uncomfortable to me.  Puma is excellent, but after getting a few miles on them, they start to slip on my feet.  FILA is great at first, but the shoes don't hold up that well for very long.These Mizuno Wave Enigma 5 shoes have been excellent so far, and I don't see myself tossing them in the backup bin any time soon.  The first thing that I noticed about these shoes was how cool they look.  Bright blue with a little yellow on the soles makes these shoes look great.  When I put them on, though, it was the overall comfort that blew me away.  The arch support is exceptional, and the heel cushioning is wonderful.  The laces hold fast and the shoe stays snug on my feet as I'm running in them.  The toe cap is minimal and doesn't get in the way.These shoes made me feel ""faster"" (but the clock brought me back down to earth) and I really enjoy wearing them.

"I've eaten my share of protein bars in the last few years.  Some were good, but most of them were strictly functional and not flavorful.  Well, Pure Protein's Tropical Fruit Macadamia Fruit and Nut Bar definitely has flavor, but almost too much of a good thing.  When I bite into most protein bars, I've come to expect mild sweetness at best, but in the case of the Tropical Fruit Macadamia bar, the sweetness is almost too much, and that is without any artificial sweeteners.  That gave me reason enough to knock off one star in my review.I took off another star due to the fact that despite having eighteen grams of protein, this bar left me hungry and didn't help me recover quickly.  Clif Bars (which have less protein) and protein shakes always help me recover after a workout, but these bars just didn't do the trick.So, if you like your protein bars tasting like candy, this is the bar for you.  It's not terrible, just too much.

"**Full Disclosure:  Item received in return for honest review**I've been doing Insanity and other high impact aerobic workouts for a long time.  I also enjoy hiking when time allows.

"Based on the Batman Unlimited cartoons, this Batman and CybeRex toy combines Batman, robots, dinosaurs, and disc-launching weaponry to form an excellent toy that any kid can enjoy.  My son (and let's be honest, myself as well) really likes all of the aforementioned things, so this toy is perfect for him (and me).The toy is of a good size and the only assembly necessary is attaching the tail to the dino body.  Batman can be seated inside the CybeRex' spine and with a squeeze of the trigger under the tail, the disc launcher and Batman cockpit lift out of the dino spine.  Four discs can be fired from the launcher and you can adjust the angle of the launch by simply moving the CybeRex' tail.  The launcher can then be closed by simply pushing it back in place or by squeezing the trigger again to put the launcher back in position.The dino's rib cage can be opened to contain villains as well.This toy is meant for children, so adult collectors looking for some wonderfully detailed creation will be disappointed (unless said adult collector actually likes playing with toys, because this thing is fun).  Batman isn't very well articulated, but none of the figures in this line are, so this is no surprise to me.  This toy is compatible with most of the other figures in this line, and although there is a Joker figure included in all of the promotional material and on the box, the figure is not included with the CybeRex and Batman.  However, this is clearly stated on the packaging and in the promotional material, so I don't see where his not being included is a problem.My son has a couple of other toys from this line and he likes them for the most part.

"If you are a regular reader of my reviews, you already know that my son and I have collected a number of the Titan Hero series figures from Hasbro.  They all have at least five points of articulation, but in the case of Thor, he features seven total POA (head, shoulders, hips, and wrists).  They usually feature just one (if any) accessories and in the case of Thor, Mjolnir is right at his side.  The hammer is a cool accessory, but much like the recent Titan Hero Series figures of Star Lord and Rocket Raccoon, Thor has a hard time holding Mjolnir properly in his hand.  Since this figure will primarily be a display figure (he's mine, I claimed him from my son, haha), that isn't too much of a problem.Thor comes with a cloth cape which is nice.  I'm not a very big fan of vinyl capes on larger figures, and I'm really glad that Thor got the cloth treatment with this figure. While it may not flow in the wind, it definitely looks good on the God of Thunder's back.What sets the Titan Hero Tech series apart from the regular Titan figures is the added component of the figures talking and (at least in the case of the Age of Ultron figures) interacting with the Hulk Buster figure.  Thor says multiple phrases in a voice that attempts (but fails) to sound like Chris Hemsworth.  The phrases are cool and my son and I both enjoy them.Overall, this is a pretty cool figure.  I do plan on getting a few more of these figures in the future.  I knocked off a star for the limited articulation on the head of the figure (hampered by Thor's golden locks) and the poor-fitting Mjolnir in Thor's hand.  Other than those two setbacks, this figure is cool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VP68BOO0DKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZITC#wasThisHelpful","R20VP68BOO0DKS","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you are getting ready for a Halloween bash or just decorating for a horror film marathon, the DII Halloween table runner is an excellent choice for adding a bit of ""spooky"" to your event.  This runner is 18"" wide and 72"" long and spiders and stars are all about its webby design.  I've actually thought about using this for comic and horror conventions as a table accent as well as for Halloween parties in the very near future.The runner is 100% polyester and is also machine washable.  It looks great on a table and is an excellent bit of decoration.  I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27C7GOC29TB37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOEY8U#wasThisHelpful","R27C7GOC29TB37","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This body wash has a very pleasant and very light floral scent.  My wife has been using it for a few days now and I used it myself a couple of times as well.  The primary claim of this body wash is that it holds its scent on your skin for up to twelve hours and that it also has ""fragrance release"" technology that releases the scent of the wash when you touch your skin.Well, the ""up to"" part of the ""up to twelve hours"" takes precedence over the ""twelve hours"" portion.  In fact, the scent wears off in less than two hours after every single shower that my wife takes.  The ""fragrance release"" technology is flawed as well, because no matter how hard I press on my wife's skin, she smells no better than she did after getting out of the shower.In short, Caress' Love Forever Body Wash would be better advertised as ""Love For A Couple Of Hours.""  It does have a good scent and it does feel excellent on the skin, but it falls short on its primary claims.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TL1I1VQPWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJXFE#wasThisHelpful","R6TL1I1VQPWZ","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered the Stainmaster Chainlink Area Rug through the Amazon Vine Program.  When I ordered it, I wasn't expecting very much.  I figured it would just be a standard area rug that had nothing special about it.  I was wrong.For starters, the chainlink pattern is much, much more appealing in person.  The photo on the web does not do it justice.  It looks very good on the living room floor.  Also, the fabric used is very soft and quite warm if you lay on it for a bit.Being a Stainmaster carpet, it's also very easy to keep clean, which is essential in a home with two kids and a cat!My favorite aspect of this rug is the fact that it is very slip resistant.  We've had plenty of area rugs over the years, but this one holds its place quite well compared to the others.Overall this is an excellent area rug.

"Nivea makes me think of the the summer time with this product.  I want palm trees and lovely tanned ladies surrounding me!  I've always been impressed by Nivea products.  They almost always deliver on any claims that they make, and they come through again with their Coconut Body Wash.The claim is that this body wash refreshes and moisturizes the skin.  My skin is notoriously dry, especially during the winter, so I always have lotions and moisturizing body washes handy this time of year.  Does Nivea's body wash keep my skin moisturized?  Absolutely.  I've noticed a marked improvement in my skin, especially in my face and hands, which seem to suffer the most this time of year.As far as the refreshing bit is concerned, I do feel clean and a tad bit more alive after using this body wash, but I believe that that is primarily due to the fact that the coconut scent is so wonderful.  Smelling coconut while I'm in the shower quickly brings me to the much warmer (okay, really hot) summers of Louisiana.  The scent is clean and, yes, refreshing.The scent isn't too powerful after you get out of the shower and get on with your day, but I still smell clean.Basically this is another great product from Nivea.  I'm sure they've got more wonderful products waiting in the wings.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWR6GHHSE5GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2MYPHY#wasThisHelpful","R3RWR6GHHSE5GB","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfumes, eau de toilettes, powders, etc. are essentially a matter of opinion when it comes to their scent.  For that reason, I feel like the Laura Biagiotti Roma Eau de Toilette is a bit of a downer as far as I'm concerned.  Why?  For lack of a better description, I'd say that it has an ""old lady smell"" to it.  To bring a bit of clarity to this description, I suggest trying to remember back to the old lady or grandmother that smelled nice, but wore a perfume that smelled like an old lady would wear it.This eau de toilette does not stink at all.  It has a pleasant vanilla and musk scent to it, it just doesn't smell like something anybody under the age of sixty might want to wear on their body.  It's a nice fragrance and it lasts a long time, it just smells a bit....dated.So, if you enjoy dated or ""old lady"" fragrances, this eau de toilette gets five stars for you.  If you are under the age of sixty, though, you might want to skip this fragrance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2IE9DTKPL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RO2ZOI#wasThisHelpful","RW2IE9DTKPL8","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My eyes are a bit odd.  I wear presciptions glasses due to the fact that one eye is near-sighted and the other is far-sighted, but I primarily wear them at night (when glare also affects me) and whenever I'm doing very intensive work at a very close proximity to my face (I work with punchdown blocks, ethernet crimpers, small boards, etc.).  Doing this type of work can wreak havoc on my eyes, but my glasses help me a lot.When reading, I can usually make do without wearing glasses, but every once in awhile I have to break out my ""cheaters"" to assist me.  It was with this in mind that I decided to give Foster Grant's James Multifocus Glasses a whirl.For starters, I had an immediate headache when I put these on my noggin.  It took me quite a long time to adjust to these babies.  The three different levels are nice to have, but caused dizziness until I finally adjusted to them.  The lower level is for reading.  The middle level is for seeing things at a range a bit farther from your face (laptops, computer monitors, etc.).  The top level is for viewing things at a distance (across the room or just a bit closer).Of the three levels, I use the lower one the most.  I rarely use the other ones, but they are there if needed.I will say that these glasses are very well made.  They look pretty sharp and are very sturdy.So why three stars?  They aren't for everybody.  I would definitely try a pair on before purchasing them.  The three levels can take some getting used to (or not getting used to at all), so take that into consideration as well.Overall, these are decent glasses, but I really don't need all three levels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Q509FSCBFPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHUUT42#wasThisHelpful","R4Q509FSCBFPN","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chef-mate's Que Bueno White Queso sauce is an excellent choice as a stand-alone cheese dip, as a topping for spicy Mexican dishes, or as an added component to any beef or chicken based dish.The chiles and jalepeno add just enough heat to tell you that they mean business but without burning your tongue.  The texture of the sauce is thick and creamy but not so thick that you have to cut a chunk out of the dip with your chip.The container is big, so be sure to invite a lot of friends over or separate it into smaller containers for later use.  My family and I had a ""cheese"" party to help knock a considerable hole in the can, but we still have a good amount of sauce left over.Overall, this is a very good sauce that works well on its own and as part of a sauce featuring beef or chicken.

"There are tons of travel guides on the market these days. Setting one apart from another can be quite difficult, but National Geographic manages to set itself apart with its Traveler series.  This particular volume, Ireland, gives us an in depth look at the Emerald Isle and prepares just about anyone for their journey to this wonderful country.The volume starts off with ""Charting Your Trip.""  It's a brief informational section that lightly covers essentials like what to pack, when and where to go (depending on time of year and length of stay), and other useful topics.  Again, this is basically a ""gloss over"" for the rest of the book.  Once you've read this section, you get to move on to a quick overview of Ireland's history and a glimpse at the country's current vibe.  From there you get a deeper breakdown of the country as broken into seven different regions.Each region features an introduction, a map (with area maps that break down the region even more throughout each section), highlighted walks or drives from the viewpoint of the author, Christopher Somerville, featured locations, and an excellent description of each region's highlight and ""must see"" locales and events.The final section, ""Travelwise"" gives the reader a nice breakdown of hotels, restaurants, entertainment, etc.As always, National Geographic has loaded this volume with plenty of wonderful pictures, in depth articles, and historical diagrams.  It is essentially a large edition of the wonderful magazine that focuses entirely on Ireland.  If you read the magazine and enjoy all of the maps, articles, and pictures, you'll definitely love this book.  If you're just a curious traveler, this book will give you a wonderful look into the world of Ireland.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDK8N7CQJPY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426213654#wasThisHelpful","RPDK8N7CQJPY2","A2RKI7RPP5CJMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I definitely enjoy using as many of the latest gadgets that I can get my hands on, I'm not necessarily the most tech savvy guy out there.  I still listen to and enjoy collecting CDs, so keep that in mind while reading this review.First of all, I selected this speaker so that I could listen to my downloaded music (yep, kids, this grandpa knows how to download tunes off of the interwebz), listen to Spotify, and to take a few handsfree calls.  With just a tad bit of difficulty, I got all of these things to work.When connecting my Android Razr M, it took four attempts before the Braven 805 finally paired up with my phone.  On the first attempt, the message I got was that my phone did not recognize my device.  On the next two attempts, the message stated that the Braven 805 rejected my set.  On the final attempt, they finally paired up with one another.The first thing I did was play a Spider-Man game that was on my phone.  The sound was excellent and there was no delay between the action in the game and the sound that came out of the speaker.After playing game, I switched over to Spotify and again, the sound was excellent.  I listened to a couple of downloaded albums as well and had no problem with them.Finally I tested the speaker phone function and, for the most part, it was good.  It could have been a bit crisper, but that might be due to the connection itself between the devices.What I liked most about this speaker is how bottom heavy it is.  The sound is very good, with the treble being only slightly muffled.  I do hope that I can get another one of these speakers, as you can pair up to of them for a true stereo sound experience.Set up was fairly easy, excepting the aforementioned problems with connecting via Bluetooth, and the battery life seems to hold up pretty well (the specs say up to eighteen hours).  Also, you can charge your phone or connect an audio device directly to the speaker to play music.Overall, a very solid purchase.

I simply pass my power bands through the included clip after sliding the strap through the hinge side of any door in my home.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Selfie Stick,Premium Quality Bluetooth Self-portrait Monopod from Xtreme Accessories,pocket size with FREE Waterproof Storage Pouch (Gold)I received this a week ago and had time today to evaluate it for review.  I have taken a series of photos of it in case anyone is interested.This Xtreme Accessories selfie stick is part of the Locust Series.  Whats great about it is that it has 20 hours of battery life and only takes half an hour to charge based on the specs.  Thats pretty reasonable when youre traveling afar on a trip using the selfie stick and all of a sudden it powers out.  Half an hour is pretty much the time it would take to have a lunch break somewhere to charge this using a power bank or external battery source if a wall outlet is not available.  I would like to see this selfie stick being self-powered by the audio jack of the smartphones so that it doesnt have to rely on Bluetooth as an alternative model.The package comes with a short micro USB cable and a waterproof storage bag.  The bag itself is the first in the 5+ selfie sticks that Ive ever tried or gotten a chance to purchase.  Other brands just offer the selfie stick and micro USB cable and one would think, how would you travel around with this if it gets raining and the wall seeps into the micro USB charging port, which is fully exposed and does not have a cover flap to keep the water from entering in?  Youd have a possibly damaged selfie stick in those cases.  So Xtreme Accessories provides a very useful solution with this bag.  The bag itself is tall enough to not only hold the selfie stick and micro USB cable based on my tests, but also has a few inches of height left to store any other essentials into it.  It has the top corner knots to pull outwards and seal up the top of the hole of the pouch.  Very useful and handy.  I like Xtreme Accessories over this simple addition.When not storing away, theres a loop strap at the bottom base of the selfie stick so that you can hook it to your wrist.  From there, theres a fastener to adjust to the size of your width to have it cling on in case you have butter fingers or sweaty hands and it slips away from your grip.The pole extends out from the shortest being 7 and 1/4th inches and fully extended is 29 inches.The phone clip can freely rotate up to 270 degrees and does so in a way where you can have it bent 90 degrees in reference to the base handle for a front facing selfie shot using the front camera of the smartphone, or you can flip it the other way, in which there may be better resolution with the rear facing camera, time, and measure taking a photo with the rear camera facing you.  Ive tried that before.  Sometimes the pole gets in the way you have to make adjustments to retake the shot.  But, while youre not able to see yourself to easily measure to take the shot, if you practice, you end up getting higher resolution shots.The phone clip is adjustable to different sized phones to fit the landscape position into the clip with the expandable spring.  Theres a rubber coating on not only the base handle but also the phone clip so that everything rests comfortably without causing abrasions or scratches to the phone or to the hand grip.The camera button is flush on this model from Xtreme Accessories with the base handle.  This is a first for me because other brands of selfie sticks have the camera button which bulges out and not only does it bulge out, but it makes a mechanical click sound when you press down on it to hear the responsiveness.  With the Xtreme Accessories model, you can be more stealth mode with this by pressing down on it and you dont hear a thing.  I pressed it many times and you dont hear anything, so that can be useful for secret or hidden shots at the point of focus.The power on and Bluetooth pairing process was easy because even though the User Manual is emphasized in Chinese, I was able to figure it out by holding down the camera button long enough for it to power on Blue and flash blue when in pairing mode.  The pairing is simple on the iPhone because of the Bluetooth settings.  The blue light on the camera button is useful to know when the selfie stick is on or off.  If its OFF, the camera button will never light up.  But if its ON, then the camera button light is always on.Overall, I enjoyed taking selfies of myself while using this selfie stick and now I have a safe storage to put the selfie stick when not in use to prevent it from getting dirty or wet.  I can hang this on a door knob or hook if desired.  A much improved design to Bluetooth powered selfie sticks.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIF4AWAUC4Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAPXLE8#wasThisHelpful","RPIF4AWAUC4Y7","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Kingyou KF01 Classic Premium Stereo Headphones with Mic and 1 Button Control(Red)I received this product a few days ago and had time today to evaluate it for a review.  I have also included a set of photos in case anyone is interested.This headphone came in a nice and easy to open cardboard box with a lime color label of the product, website, and e-mail information.After opening the box, I was quite surprised.  On the Amazon product page, it said a Gift package but I didnt know what that meant.  Inside was a lime color tough shell zipper case that contained the headphones and a zip bag of two pairs of earbuds.  Outside of that was a zip bag with a Micro USB cable branded with Kingyou on it.  There was also a nice small microfiber cloth and a Velcro strap.  Although the headphones inside were kept tucked with a twist tie, you could use the reusable Velcro strap to hold the wiring together in a loop when you put the headphones away in the zipper case.Overall, I was impressed by the package.  I have received headphones before by other brands in this price range, but they never provided all of what Kingyou provided with its headphones.  This is nearly a complete kit of what youd need to travel with your Kingyou headphones.  Very attractive in this regards.After untwisting the tie to loosen the cables, I put the headphones with the preinstalled medium sized earbuds on and was able to fit it using the L and R notations on the bottom of the earpieces to know which one to put in which ear, which is important because theyre designed to be angled in a certain way to fit the ear.  I just twisted in until there was a seal.Previously, I tried an MEE Audio RX18 headphones and although that one had good noise cancellation technology, this headphone from Kingyou when plugged into the smartphone or tablet and listening to a radio station, you could hear everything around pretty well.  It does lower the environmental noise slightly, but not really good at that.  I think since these headphones werent specified to be noise reducing the environment, so nothing against them in that regards.  As a suggestion for improving models, I suggest that they add the noise cancellation technology into their headphones to make them even better.I tested listening to some Alternative Rock music using my AOL Radio app for about half an hour and felt the good sound quality through these headphones.  Even though I could hear and notice whats around me, I was able to enjoy listening to the music through these headphones without having to crank up the volume very loudly.  I think these are the types of headphones that Id switch to using if I wanted to be aware of my surroundings without ruining the enjoyment of listening to music.All of the instrumentations and vocals in the songs I heard could be heard well without muffling or hissing.I tested making a phone call to myself using a landline and talked into the microphone of the headphones which is near the right side of the earpiece where it rests near your cheek, and I was able to hear myself loud and clear through the speakerphone and echo back into the headphones.  It sounded quite loud and clear.  I was impressed.One of the benefits of this headphone over other headphones in this price range of $10 to $20 is that the headphones are small and portable.  They are not too distracting to look at.  Although it takes more effort to dig into your ear to twist them off, they are more hidden from view than other brands of in-ear headphones.  The built in mic is a benefit and it picks up on the voice very well.  At first, I didnt like the design when I saw it out of the zipper bag thinking it would get in the way, but it ends up being in a good location towards the mouth.Overall, I think these are good headphones from a company that I never heard of before from anyone else until this past week.  Kingyou makes good headphones.  If theres anything Id like to add, Id like for them to make better looking colors for their headphones.  Hopefully theyll expand their lines of headphones and create some more light versus darker shaded color designs.The package and the headphones are both impressive.  Ill be keeping my eyes out on them more now.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMQ9D5WWNHTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDTZ8RO#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMQ9D5WWNHTV","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:MEE Audio RX18 Comfort-Fit In-Ear Headphones with Enhanced Bass (White)I received this product last week and had time to evaluate it today for a review.This product came in a standard retail packaging.  I actually dont prefer this type of packaging because while its neat and has a clear display of the contents, its tough to break open and remove the contents.  I had to find a gardening tool to snip long the edges to open up one half in order to access everything inside and pull it out.  Not a user friendly packaging.  I suggest MEE Audio just bundle this into a zipper pouch and put it in a sealed cardboard box with the graphical design on the box.  These hard plastic enclosures can cause injury.  So this is a suggestion.Upon removing the contents, I found the cardboard insert was a small pamphlet of information about how to use the headphones, change the ear tips, proper cleaning and maintenance to avoid injury and damage to yourself and the headphones.The white headphones I had were a nice coating.  Smooth polished look to the ear pieces.  Theres an L and an R on each ear piece so that you know which side to put it into your ear because they are designed at an angle to fit each ear.  These letters may not be too clear or obvious, but under some lighting you can see it.  They molded it in the same color as the headphones, so its transparent without the molding sticking out.This headphone comes preinstalled with a medium sized ear tips.  There are two pairs of ear tips that can be used for different sized ear canals to help you get a proper sealed fit.The cable itself is long enough to stretch down from your ears to beyond your typical pants or shorts pockets.  It may maximize the length up to your knees which shouldnt be stressed that far, but you get that extra slack of cable so that when you put the phone into your pocket with this headphone plugged into the jack, you can move around your head and turn with having extra slack to accommodate for those movements without yanking the ear tips out of your ears.Whats nice about these headphones is that not only are they easy to put in your ears and comfortable, but they drown out some environmental noise.  While I was walking around with music playing at a low volume on my iPhone, I found that it blocked out the television sports programming and commercials pretty well up close when the volume of the TV was reasonable to hear.  I was able though to hear my family talk to me when close by, so it doesnt totally block out everything, and you probably dont want it to block out everything where it can be a safety issue.  I could hear my voice drown and go deer with these on.  You can hear the cables move though while you turn your head, but I notice that with all headphones that are wired and so that really cant be avoided.The music quality is pretty good for a $8 pair of headphones.  If I go to the retail store like Best Buy, Frys, Target, or others and buy this price range of headphones, not only will I not get the noise canceling technology, but the audio quality for the bass and other features may not be on par with these headphones from MEE Audio.For these priced at $7.99 currently on Amazon, they are more than a bargain for the value that you get.I would ask for features like, having a built in microphone to use this for calling, and perhaps sweat proof or sweat resistant technology, but then the price wouldnt make sense and theyd be at a loss to incorporate those features into a $7.99 product.  For $19.99, possibly.Overall, I have been listening to Alternative Rock music in my AOL Radio app while writing this review with these headphones on and I have not broken a sweat, felt uncomfortable from the ear tips, or had issues with the connectivity of the music going from the audio jack to my ears.  And this is at a low volume setting because I just want to relax and test it out.  The instrumental quality is heard clearly with these headphones.  Since they do not require battery usage, its given me a different perspective on wired versus wireless headphones and the technology comparisons that you can provide in both for the same price.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Meal Prep Republic Stackable Plastic Food Containers - Stackable, Microwave & Freezer Safe, Reusable, 28 Oz (Set of Seven)I received this product last week and had time today to evaluate it for a review.  I have also taken a series of photos in case anyone is interested.The set of 7 containers arrived wrapped on plastic to seal it from debris and keep it untouched from the factory.Inside the package was a card insert that read that these Meal Prep Republic Containers are:- Stackable- BPA Free- Microwave/Freezer Safe- Dishwasher Safe- And each container is 28 oz capacity- Made in CanadaThe back of the insert mentioned Do not microwave the lids.  I contacted meal prep about this and they told me while these components are microwave safe, they do not recommend microwaving the lids under high levels of heat because it can cause minor deformation of the lids.  Its not a safety issue though because these products are BPA free.  They recommend using food grade plastic wrap or Saran Wrap to cover the containers when being microwaved.I like how these appear to be a simple construction design.  They remind me of disposable lunch meal trays in cafeterias, only these are reusable.  The lids themselves have an interesting design in the interior.The lids snap on the tray fairly easily with a small click around the edges.  They looked very thin at first and didnt have a strong locking snap, so I did a water test with it.  I poured water from the sink into the tray, closed the lid shut all around, and inverted the tray sideways to tilt it to see if water would come out.  I tried every side and corner and there was no leakage.  That lets me know that the containers are not defective and if I were to cook meals with soup or other liquids inside, I dont have to worry about tipping this over and having it spill out.Overall, I like how these contains are because theyre at a size where its reasonable and reminds me of how much is enough for the time of day so that I dont overeat and I can watch my weight.  It also helps remind me to eat healthier options using rice and vegetable store into this container.  Theres enough for one day of each week to go through for the lunch hour for those who go to work.  For those who use them for 3 meals a day, then these will last you through a couple of days at a time before you need to wash and reuse them.  They are dishwasher safe, but Id hand wash them with liquid soap and let them air dry near a window before putting them away.The company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee, which is very nice of them.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This review is for the product listed on Amazon as:Stainless Steel Designer Door Wedge with Non-Skid Rubber Threads and Metal Handle - Easily Wedges Door Gaps up to 1.2 InchesI received this product last week and had time today for a review.This product is pretty small.  Its the first time that Ive ordered a door stopper.  Previously, I was using tin cans and laundry detergent boxes to hold weight against doors from the wind slamming them shut.  Although that was embarrassing to look at, it was a cheap and easy solution.But recently, I found out about BlueOrchids and gave their product a try.The product packaging was nice.  It came in a hard shell cardboard box with a lot of useful information such as:- Stainless steel design with TPR plastic treads- Can handle tile, stone, wood, carpet, etc- Fits all door types such as glass, metal, wood, and more- Does not slide or damage floorsI held it in my hand and while the material is touch and good in quality, it is light weight as expected for a door stopper.  I wouldnt expect to pull or carry around something like this that weighed more than 5 pounds.The rubber threads when I received it was sort of deformed unfortunately.  It wasnt like what was pictured in the box.  Likely from a sloppy assembly.  But fortunately, I was able to fix it easily by using my finger nails to adjust them since they freely move around with some effort, so I was able to straight then out.I did notice on my unit a damaged rubber thread in which it looked like someone knifed part of it and caused an obvious cut into one of the threads, so I contacted the seller about it to let them be aware of the issue and am in the process of getting a replacement.  Since these are specific issues related to my unit, then I wont hurt their ratings over it as long as their customer service is good, so those observations wont directly impact this review rating.The ring shaped handle is very secure and does not move around.  It is stuck in place which allows you to be able to fit a few fingers to grip to pull out or hold it to carry around.  It feels pretty good.I tested this door stopper first on my garage entrance door, which is a wooden door with a metal strip at the bottom, onto a wooden laminated floor surface.  I fit the door stopper in and pulled against the door.  With a lot of effort, the door stopper would move slightly but keep the door held at bay from slamming shut.  This was after repeatedly swinging the door into the door stopper.  Now in reality, the wind blowing may not have this kind of close range force onto the door like what Im doing with my hand, but I was just trying the more extreme cases.  Because it is rubber threads, there is friction, but it will move a little a lot of force.  But the good news is that it fit my door and it held it pretty well.I even went into my garage to try it on my garage door that leads to the backyard.  Thats also a wooden door, but on a concrete floor.  It too held well and kept the door from slamming shut.Overall, pretty good experience.  I would say that the rubber threads collect a lot of debris easily, so for handling purposes, youll want to wash it off occasionally in the sink or outside and dab it dry with a paper towel.I like this door stopper overall, with the exception of a few cosmetic issues that Ive contacted the seller about.  The quality of the material is pretty good and for a door stopper, it did its job.  Now, I can prepare well for this season of hard winds to keep the door still while I air out my garage after parking the car instead of having the garage opened for security purposes.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Apple Lightning Cord,Idaye MFi Certified 3M/10ft Nylon Braided USB Apple Cable Charging Cord for iPhone 5 /5c / 6 / 6 Plus/ 6s, iPod 7, iPad mini1/2/3, iPad Air / Air 2. (silver-3m/10ft)I received this product earlier this week and spent the last couple of days evaluating it for a review.I elected to get the Silver color just because I have too many white and black cables and wanted something different.The cable came in a nice cardboard box with the back describing a long list of Apple compatible products.  But basically, any product from Apple that uses a lightning cable connector will do.Whats nice about the cable from Idaye is that they are MFI Certified, which means theyve passed Apples standards for testing and design to allow them to be sold as an approved third party cable.  I find other sellers on Amazon not stating MFI certified and I dont bother to buy them because they may damage the Apple devices battery from frequent use based on articles that Ive read.  So MFI is the way to go.Inside the box was the lighting cable wrapped in a plastic bag and with a detachable Velcro strap.  The Velcro strap is nice because its much tougher to seal and is reusable than a twist ties that other 3rd parties provide.In looking at the cable, my first impression was, wow, these connector heads are pretty thick and big, and thats a good thing.  I hated my Apple OEM lightning cables that rea small, thin, and slippery to grip on, which makes it difficult to grip and pull out when using multiport chargers that have ports sandwiched close together.With this Idaye cable, I measured it as:- The lightning cable connector head is 5/8th inch long by  inch wide by 1/4th inch thickI took a photo of the comparison between the Apple OEM cable and the one by Idaye.  The little differences in measurement makes a big difference in comfort.In looking at the Nylon Braided design, it feels pretty thick and tough.  It is flexible in terms of how I can bend the shape of it in any direction and it will shape to it.The reason why I chose the 10 foot one was because I got tired of charging my iPhone and iPad leaving it on the ground because the 3 ft. cable provided by Apple wasnt long enough for me to reach my office desk table top.  But with this 10 ft. cable, Im able to move around more fluidly around my desk while it is charging from my charging station on the floor, which gives me more freedom to use it while charging.  I also thought about it in my vehicles perspective and having a longer cable will allow passengers from the back to charge their devices while it is charged towards the front side power outlet using a car charger.Overall, after 2 days of testing and 2 overnight charges from a nearly depleted iPhone, I found no issues using this lightning cable from a defective perspective.  It works well.  Idaye was an unfamiliar brand to me prior to getting this cable, but now I will be paying more attention to the products that they develop.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Honest Chef Knife Sharpener Chefs Choice - 3 Stages Knifes Sharpener - Steel Sharpener Ceramic Knife SharpenerI received this product earlier this week and had time today to evaluate it for review.The sharpener came packaged with protection in a hard plastic box that took a lot of beating and roughness during shipment from how I can see.  Inside was a card insert that showed the details of the sharpener, the 3 blade levels for ceramic, fine, and coarse, how to use it, what not to do with it, and other useful information.The handle has grooves to match the fingers gripping into a fist.  The sharpener can lay flat onto a kitchen top surface to provide stability to sharpen the knives.  Id suggest putting a wooden cutting board underneath it so that you dont scratch or risk damaging your counter tops.The sharpener has labels on one side etched in so that you dont forget which row is for which blade.It is recommended for routine sharpening to use the Coarse first followed by Fine if needed.  In about 3-5 swipes in one direction is what is needed to get a sharp blade.I like how simple and comfortable it is to grip this sharpener.  It doesnt cause any discomfort.  It was designed well.I would suggest this 3 stage knife sharpener tool over single sharpener tools just because this one is designed to be safer to handle and pull against for the knife to fit in and get sharpened.  Other ones Ive seen are more dangerous and prone to injury.  But if you could find an automated electric driven sharpening system, that would be nice as well.  But for non-power driven sharpeners, this will do.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Shannon Baby Car Seat Cover Lined with Ultra Soft Minky Fleece (Navy Blue Polka Dot With Soft Navy Blue Minky Fleece)I received this product yesterday and had time today to review.Shannon Baby is a small family owned business as described in the card insert when I opened up the package to take a look at the fleece.  Its a 100% cotton and feels really nice in the interior where it would face the baby in the car seat.  Softness is always a plus for sensitive baby skin.  I found the fleece material to be quite comfortable.  The polka dot color was selected because its more of a neutral pattern color for both baby boys and baby girls.Theres a pair of Velcro straps towards the mid-section of the cover.  They strap on fairly easily into a large loop that should fit the needs of any baby car seat handle.  I would like to see as a suggestion the Velcro straps being longer and adjustable to create a tighter foot around the loop handle of baby seats.One of the issues that I had with this unit that was that the sewing quality was defective and inconsistent within the interior fleece edges of the blanket.  On most ends of my unit, the sewing was very tight knit.  However, there was a second that was about 6 inches long in which the sewing string was very loose and had large gaps that shouldve been filled in.  My concern is that if I didnt exchange it on Amazon within 30 days, eventually the baby will poke at it and possibly cause a rip in the sewing pattern.  Because I suspect that this may be a quality issue with a defect unit, I will not penalize my review rating for Shannon Baby over it.  I suggest they use a better method to sew their product.The fleece feels very warm and has several lumps below the polka dot pattern that has an interesting look to it.  It is very comfortable to rub against.  I think a lot of babies out there will find it very comforting and soothing to play around with it while its covered over them to help them relax to sleep.This seat cover helps protect against unwelcoming visitors attention as well as the sun light, rain, or wind causing a distraction or discomfort.  I think as a small family business, theyve created a useful product for all families with newborns to provide protection against the elements and minimize distractions to put the baby to sleep.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review of the product listed on Amazon as:WODISON Basic Waterproof Sports Gym Sackpack Bag Lightweight Drawstring BackpackI received this product yesterday and had time today to evaluate it for review.  I have taken a set of photos of it and in use in case anyone is interested.This backpack was folded in 3 and packaged in a candy wrap sealed bag when it arrived from Amazon.The bag is made from a high quality nylon material and it feels very nice all around.  Not too rough to rub against.  Like any drawstring, the opening is at the top which can collapse by pulling both sides of the straps outwards to close it.  You can open it by prying out from the hole that was collapsed.  Like any drawstring bag, the hole of the sack does not create a complete seal, so be careful about what liquids may fall in there.  This bag is rated as waterproof, but I think the waterproof is based on the exterior of the bag and does not account for rainfall into the opening hole into the sack.  Considering that your clothes are likely to take the hit and not your personal accessories like your wallet, which is in one of the zipped compartments, it should be fine.There is a large compartment on the outside of the bag that is zipped up and can fit up to 9 inches in height and 8 inches in width of material.  Its pretty open ended what you can put in here.  For example, I could put my eyeglass case in there, my wallet, and some lotion trial sizes.Theres a small compartment within the sack that is enclosed when you compress the top hole opening which can be used to place more secure items, such as a wallet or keys.  That main compartment measures about 7 inches long and 5 inches wide to give it some perspective.These straps are very thick and comfortable.  I havent seen this type of cushioned thickness in the straps for quite some time.  Im used to getting drawstring bags and backpacks at corporate or advertising events and those straps tend to be thin and uncomfortable when it comes to added weight.  But here with Wodison, they are called soft carton shoulder straps and when worn on, provide comfort when handling the weight of gym clothes.I was able to place as an example my sweatpants, t-shirt, and pair of socks inside the sack and tie it up to wear around for a while without any noticeable issue.  Clothes are going to be fairly lightweight and this sackbag is intended for light weight baggage and not for school textbooks.Having a bag like this helps go around and travel lightly without the need of a duffle bag for storing clothes.  This gym bag is a more compact and mobile way to travel and walk from your car to the gym and back with your personal belongings secure, enclosed, and protected against light rainfall.The design creates an open ended solution to how different types of users can pack and store their belongings for a trip to the gym or to an event where lightweight carry-on is the key.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BINB49DEPD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XWCE84#wasThisHelpful","R33BINB49DEPD3","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:LAX Apple Certified [1 Year Warranty] iPhone Lightning Cable (4 FT Long) for iPhone 5 5S 6 6s 6S iPad Air iPad mini (Gray)I received this product yesterday and had time yesterday and overnight to evaluate this for review.The package came very nicely like a retail package that Id find at my local electronics store.  It even has the hook on top for the racks.  The box is easily reusable because of this design.  The front has a close up of the Lighting cable ends on it.The sides describe some information such as how this is a braided design, measures about 4 feet long, and is MFI certified.  For the longest time, Ive been trying to look for a third party lightning cable that was MFI Certified.  Buyers beware that on Amazon there are third party sellers selling lightning cables but dont say that its MFI so I wouldnt buy those if I were you because theyre not through the tested certification and approval process by Apples standards.  Bad cables can damage the phone or tablets battery, so always look for MFI Certified which is what this LAX brand mentions on the product page and on the box.Upon taking it out of the box, I found the color that I bought, Gray, looked very nice.  It looks different and is easily distinguishable from my Apple OEM lightning cable.  The cable has a nice glossy finish that shines under lighting.  You can see the nylon braided design.The cable itself feels very tough and durable.  It doesnt compress when you pinch down on it.  It feels tough.Both sides of the lightning cable have the LAX brand name so you cannot confuse this with other gray cable from other third parties.  Both the lightning cable head and the USB Type A head feel pretty smooth to rub onto, but they are not slippery to grip.I tested this cable yesterday by plugging it to my LED Desk Lamp that has a USB port and plugged my iPhone 5s to it.  It charged it right away.  I left it charging overnight for 5 hours and woke up to find my iPhone was fully charged without any issues.I used my iPhone all day today and it did not appear to have any issues from the charge.The benefit of this cable is that it is a little longer than the standard Apple OEM cable.  This one from LAX is mentioned as 4 feet, which is 48 inches, but it is actually shorter by 1 inch, and also, the cable length portion is more like 45 inches, but it is still a good length to work around and move at your desk if your charger is on the table top.  It allows more freedom to move around with this cable.Considering how tough this cable feels and how flexible it is, I find this to be a good replacement to my Apple OEM cable to carry around as my primary cable and leave the Apple OEM cable at home.  I think that LAX has a good quality lightning cable that it offers to the general public.I was initially uncertain how the LAX cable would be being that its an unfamiliar brand to me, but after trying it, I am satisfied of their quality of producing these cables.  I would recommend it and look more into its product line.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Mpow Easytalk Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Headset Headphone Universal Business Earpiece with Loud Voice, CSR8615 Technology for iPhone 6S 6S plus Galaxy S6 S5 and iOS android SmartphonesI received this product yesterday and had time yesterday and today to evaluate it in detail to provide a detailed review.  I have also taken a series of photos in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The Mpow EasyTalk came in a nice small black box that looks very much detailed like a retail store shelf box.  The top of the box has the picture of the Bluetooth headset, the Mpow logo and some symbols that indicate its usage.  The back of the box has a QR Code that can be scanned to provide more product details.After opening the box, I found the EasyTalk was nice placed snug within a sheet of foam that kept it still.  Removing the foam showed that it was held in a plastic cardboard cutout  After removing those layers, underneath that were a couple of plastic zip lock bags that contained 2 pairs of ear hooks, a 26 feet micro USB cable, and a roughly 20-inch-long micro USB Mono Single Stereo Earphone.There was also an Instruction Manual that was provided which I looked into right away and I recommend all users read prior to using the product.Some notables in the Instruction Manual includes:Specifications:- Bluetooth Standard v4.0- Frequency Range 2.4GHz- Operation: Class 2- Bluetooth Mode: A2DP, AVRCP- Operation Range: Up to 30 feet- Talk/Play Time: About 4 hours- Standby Time: Up to 130 hours- Charging time: About 2.5 hoursTo comment on some of these specs.Bluetooth 4.0 is the current standard for mobile accessories.  Some products do come out currently with Bluetooth 4.1, but 4.0 is very common and modern for any mobile accessory to get your hands on.  Its more energy efficient and steady with the signal than previous Bluetooth versions.The Frequency Range of 2.4 GHz is common to where using this headset will require some precaution because since theres many devices that operate on 2.4 GHz, there may be occasional interference depending on where you are and that can lead to reception issues.Talk and Play Time of 4 hours is OK.  On Amazons product page, it says 5 hours, so Im not sure why theres a difference between the Instructions Manual and the Amazon Product Page.  I suggest Mpow updates one or the other for consistency.  But even if it was 5 hours, this makes this Bluetooth headset a low to mid-range quality headset.  Theres some Bluetooth model from 2014 that I purchased for a relative called the Plantronics M55 and that one is currently priced at $32 on Amazon which is a little higher price, but offers 11 hours of play/talk time, and as I see more models roll out, I start seeing more headsets close to that double digit range of battery life for usage.  I think 4 to 5 hours will accommodate most people who dont talk to friends and family all day.  In my case, I could go at work and talk on the phone during traffic hours in the morning for up to 2 hours, then at lunch time for 1 hour, and then the drive home for up to 2 hours, and Id use up most if not all of the battery life of the headset in which Id charge overnight to use the next day.  If there are types of users who casually use their phones to make small chat calls throughout the day, I think that 4-5 hours should be sufficient.  If youre running into the holiday or celebratory dates and increase your talk time to friends, family, and coworkers, youll likely need to take a break in the middle of the day to charge your Bluetooth headset.  Thats when those double digit headsets would be handy, which last about the same amount of time as your fully charged smartphone would.  So its a preference and situation in the year.  I suggest Mpow creates a newer model headset that offers better battery life to keep it competitive and stand out among other headset models.Charge time of 2.5 hours is reasonable and common for Bluetooth headsets.In looking at the Bluetooth headset, it has a simple oval design.  The volume buttons are small, but responsive with a plus or minus symbol at the top side of the headset.  Oddly, I found the minus volume down button to sound more mechanically responsive for each button press than the volume up plus button.The microphone hole is at the bottom of the EasyTalk.Theres a multifunction button thats on the outer side where theres the Mpow brand name on the headset which has a circular metallic design to it.  It responds fairly loudly to button presses compared to the volume buttons.The micro USB port is completely opened and exposed.  It is located at the opposite side of the volume buttons.The ear bud is a silicon shaped piece that comes preinstalled on the EasyTalk.  The small hook is very flexible and moves around easily.  Theres a small cutout hole to control the direction of the sound coming out of the earphone.Theres 2 ear hooks thats provided in the package, which are a smooth flexible plastic that molds into the shape of part of your ear.The EasyTalk feels smoothly polished and nice to hold onto it.  Its small like any other Bluetooth headset to put away when not in use.Next was trying out the headset and features:USAGE:The first thing that I did do was charge the EasyTalk since the Instructions Manual stated to do so.  The side of the EasyTalk will light up red when its charging and turn off when fully charged.Next, I paired the EasyTalk to my iPhone 5s, which was simple because you hold down the multifunction button on the side of the headset for about 5 seconds which causes the LED to flicker red and blue.  On my iPhone 5s, the Bluetooth device is listed as Mpow Easytalk, so pairing was simple.I put the EasyTalk into my ear without the ear hook first to see how it fitted and felt like because I hadnt had my own Bluetooth headset before.  The result was that the small ear hook thats on the earbud provides some stability where it tucks under the antihelix of the ear and provides a fit.  Its definitely better than not having it out at all.  Because of this current design, its very easy to pull out or push in the Bluetooth headset, which can be desirable if youre lazy, but also easily prone to theft by someone walking by and swiping it out of your ear, which Ive found is easy to do with this current setup without the ear hook.The earbud is a one size earbud thats provided by Mpow.  I suggest that they provide other shaped and sized earbuds rather than just one size.  This one in particular held into my ear canal, but it was not a snug and fully enclosed fit.  There was an air pocket opening that made it feel a little loose.In looking at myself with this worn on, I felt pretty good.  It is noticeable, but not too bad.I turned on the EasyTalk by holding down the multifunction button for about 3 seconds which you could hear some alien type of sound effect to indicate that it is on.  The nice feature about this Easytalk is that it has a battery level indicator that I can see on my iPhone to let me preview how much battery is left.  While its not completely accurate and updated precisely, its better than nothing.  Not all Bluetooth devices support this feature on smartphones.One of the issues I had while trying out this headset is that when you press the multifunction button when worn on your ear, it makes a loud noticeable clicking noise and pushes the headset inwards deeper into your ear temporarily.  I wouldve liked to see the headset be subtler and responsive.  I suggest Mpow improve this feature.  I found it a little annoying when I was testing out with music and calls with the features like end call, redial, play, pause, and others and having the headset shift around and make a loud noise into my ears.  The volume button makes less noise when being pressed while worn on.I first tested listening to music because I wanted to test out the audio quality heard through the headset.  From my results, I was using AOL Radio to listen to some streaming music and found that I had to raise the volume of the Bluetooth about one third of the way up to hear well with the headset.  I found a better experience later on when testing plugging in the Mono Single Stereo Earphone to have audio from both sides of my ears.  That accessory piece is useful and provides enough length to have the cable stay in front underneath your chin or hang resting on the back of your neck.  For me, either way felt uncomfortable at first and needed some time to get used to.  I wouldve liked seeing a little adjuster piece to tighten up the slack that was remaining in the cable that dangled around so that it wouldnt irritate my skin as much with the loose wiring.  It needs to be loose to accommodate different users head sizes, but having the adjustment after flipping the cord in front or back would be helpful.  I suggest Mpow consider this piece to be added in future models or to review if its worthwhile to add it.I listened to the music for a while and it ended up being nice to have as an added feature.  A Bluetooth headset will not beat traditional Bluetooth headphones for audio quality, but it will be good as a secondary feature to have if you dont have that accessory around to use this as an interim.  Theres no clearly recognizable bass heard through this headset when running a bass test on my YouTube app, but thats fine.  Its just good to have the music playing option available when in need.The next test that I did was install the ear hook onto the headset.  It was simple by using the horseshoe shaped end of it and pressing onto the area in-between the headset and the earbuds.  It snapped in place pretty easily and from there, you could rotate the ear hook forward or backward.  Ive found to place this newly installed headset onto your ear to be a little tricky.  Its best to turn the ear hook about 90 degrees in reference to the headset, then get it wrapped over the flap of your ear, the upper helix, and from there, then push to fit in the earbud into your ear and make the proper final adjustments for a snug fit.  Then you can rotate the ear hook towards the back of you to get it a snug fit.  The ear hook makes a big difference in stability.  I shook my head around and tilted my head or reached down and it kept it fairly still.  Its a much different experience than the earbuds by themselves with the small hook.  However, putting on the headset with the hook on can be a bit of a pain to get used to when you want to put the headset on really quick because you have to make several adjustments for the fit to work out.  But once its on then youre good.I did a few tests yesterday and today of making calls, one to a friend for about 53 minutes with the fully setup headset on, and a few today calling to an advice nurse and a making voice mails to myself using my Magic Jack home phone.With my first test with my friend, I talked walking around within 5-10 feet from my phone placed on the kitchen table and he didnt complain of hearing me.  We had a good conversation.  I was in a quiet room and talking to him with the volume about 1/3rd up and I was able to hear him, but it was sort of lower in volume output than expected.  I had this Bluetooth volume setting on my headphones and it could hear the music loudly.  So I kept note of that.  But the good news is that while talking to him, his voice didnt really drown out, crackle, or cut off.  I was able to hear him well and have a good conversation.  That was yesterday.Today, I talked to an advice nurse and this time while waiting on the phone, I decided to test the Bluetooth connectivity while walking around the floor of my house.  The waiting music tone was playing so I was able to walk around and test when the music got choppy.  Within 10 feet, everything was good, clear, and a stable connection for the most part.  Music was heard clearly without no choppiness.  But then about 20 feet away when I started to walk across some of the dry walls, then I could tell the music started to get choppy.  When I walked back closer to my phone, then it got smooth again.  So based on this test and my household, I couldnt get the targeted 30 feet of signal clarity and stability from this Bluetooth 4.0 headset that I could get with my Bluetooth 4.0 speakers that Ive tested walking the same route.  It could be because the headset has a smaller Bluetooth antenna.When I talked to the nurse, she had a hard time hearing me well and it could be because my voice comes across as muffled a little, so I didnt factor that into evaluating the headset.What I did instead, was call and leave a 3 to 5 minute voice message on my Magic Jack phone and then play the voice mail file on my laptop so that I could hear my voice playback.  I compared that with recording a voice mail of me not using the Bluetooth headset and talking directly from my iPhone.  In comparing the two results, I found that the iPhone reception and call quality was a little louder, but more distinctive in picking up my speech that allowed better clarity in the playback.  Comparing that with the EasyTalk, I found at the same volume on my laptops speaker, the EasyTalk was a little quieter with the microphone less sensitive in picking up my voice than the iPhones microphone.  Also, my speech did not come out as clear as the iPhones test.  So from these results, talking directly from my iPhone was a better call quality experience than from the EasyTalk.  But the point of the EasyTalk is to be hands free, so this makes it considerably reasonable to have when driving or walking around without having to hold the phone onto you.  The differences in call quality was noticeable, but not a heavy contrast.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Comes with a set of accessories for the Bluetooth headset to prepare for different situations2) Volume and multifunction buttons are very responsive3) Smooth and polished lookCONS:1) Inconsistent statements made on the battery life between Amazon product page and Instructions Manual.  Is it 4 hours or 5 hours working time?2) Preinstalled earbud was a little loose in my ears and not adjustable because of no additional accessories for it3) Multifunction button clicks a little loud and pushes the headset into your ear canal for each button press4) Call quality not as close to 1:1 when comparing between recorded calls through EasyTalk compared to my iPhones built in microphone5) Bluetooth connectivity did not reach as far past 20 feet without getting choppy call quality based on testing indoorsSUGGESTIONS:1) Update the Amazon Product Page or Instructions Manual for consistent and accurate test measurements on the total play/talk time under one full charge2) Improve the battery life to near 10 hours to be more competitive with newer released Bluetooth headsets that approach double digits and compare with the current battery life of smartphones3) Provide different sized earbuds for different ear canal sizes and ear shape fits4) Make the multifunction button design to be subtler and respond with a softer button press5) Add a tightened piece to the micro USB Mono Single Stereo Earphone to remove some of the slack that dangles around the front or back of you when worn6) Improve the sensitivity of picking up the users voice from the EasyTalk microphone for better speech clarity and loudness7) Improve the Bluetooth antennae design for better signal connectivity and data transmission stabilityUSER SCENARIOS:This product would be useful for those who:1) Want to talk while driving2) Have their hands occupied while walking aroundOverall, I think this is a good accommodation for users who want to talk but cant hold their phone because of certain legal issues, not having your hands available, or just simply wanting to walk around hands free.  There are some issues with this EasyTalk model that needs improvement in terms of battery life, usability, and call quality that Ive mentioned that Mpow can work on for future models.  But if someone is in need of a solution, then the EasyTalk is second best for talking than holding your own smartphone.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RN05GCR15O6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YC4OAO2#wasThisHelpful","R3RN05GCR15O6V","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:iPhone Cable,[Apple MFI Certified] Mpow 8-Pin Lightning to USB Cable Cord 3.3 Feet-2 PackI received this package last week and had time today to write a review.  I have included a set of photos in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATION:The pair of lightning cables comes in a small box that indicates that its a 2 pack and shows a preview photo of the connector heads of the lightning cable.  The back of the box talks about how its MFI certified, which is very important.  I would not tough any lightning cable from any third party brand that does not state MFI certified on their cables because cables that are not certified can cause damage or harm to the battery.  Fortunately, MPow passed the Apple standards to sell as MFI.Upon opening the box, I found the two cables tied up inside with a white tie wrap.  What struck me right away when looking at the cables tied up is the following:1) They look like thick connector heads for the lightning connector and USB type A connector, which is a plus because I got frustrated with Apple branded cables that are so small and slick2) The lightning connector head has the Mpow brand imprinted on it to identify this cable from other third party brands3) The whiteness in appearance of the cable looks quite refreshing compared to my Apple cablesWhen loosening up the cables, I measured them to check and got the following measurements:- The full extent of the cable end to end measures about 40 inches, with 38 inches being the cord length.- The lightning connector head measures about 5/8th inch long by 3/8th inch wide by 1/4th inch thick- The USB Type A connector head measures about 11/16th inch long by 5/8th inch wide by 1/4th inch thickPretty good numbers there.  Every 1/8th of an inch more is very helpful with grip to pull and push into the smartphone or tablet charger port or especially when its challenging to pull out the USB end of the cable out of the USB ports on tightly squeezed multiport chargers.I would say that these connector ends made from Mpow are smooth, but theyre not slick or slippery like the Apple cables.  While I wouldve liked seeing a design that has some grooves into it for traction and grip, I tested pulling and pushing the cable ends with Mpow and had no issues with them.The connector ends curve like a U shape rather than a rectangular shape like the Apple cables.The thickness reminds like a chewable tablet.  Its comfortable to pinch with your thumb and finger to get a good grip.The cord itself doesnt compress as easily as the Apple cables when pinched hard, which I did as a test because I wanted to make sure these werent flimsy cables that couldnt withstand the strength of a person because these cables will need to be designed to handle some more extreme cases like the body weight of a person sitting on a wheeled chair and rolling over the cable.The Mpow brand name printed on the lightning connector head has a silver glossy appearance which shines under a light source.  It makes it easy to identify so I keep track of which cables Im using at all times.USAGE:I tested plugging in my iPhone 5s to the Mpow lightning cable and plugged it into my Anker lamp that has a USB port and it started to charge right away.  Both cables charged right away and worked, which shows no signs of defects in these new shipments.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Thicker connector heads provide an easier grip than Apple Lightning Cables2) Mpow brand name makes it easy to identify between Apples cable and other 3rd party cables3) Brighter white looking cable than the standard Apple cables4) Easy to push and pull the cable when plugged into a USB portCONS:NoneSUGGESTIONS:1) Add some groove design in the connector ends to provide better traction and grip.  Lose the smooth polishing finish.2) Create longer cables for multi-purpose use.  Newer releases are in 6 feet length and longer up to 10 feet, which allow devices to be charged from the wall to tabletops or to be used from the backseat of a car.USER SCENARIOS:People who would benefit from this product are those who:1) Need spare cables to use at different locations than the single cable their Apple product came with2) Need a replacement for their faulty third party or Apple cable3) Need a cheaper solution than the premium cost of an Apple lighting cableOverall, I am quite pleased with these Mpow cables.  They will be great as spares to leave one in the vehicle glove compartment and at the work office, so that Im covered everywhere I go and never have to remind myself to bring one cable with me.  Ill have them all placed at different locations now with the help of these 2 packs.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.

"Hi,This is my review of the product listed on Amazon as:[2-Pack] Poweradd Nylon Braided Stereo Audio Cable (6.6 Feet + 3.3 Feet) Gold Plated 3.5mm Male to Male AUX Cable for iPhone, iPad, iPod, Android and More  GrayI received this product last week and had time today to write a detailed review.  I have also taken a series of photos in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product came in a small mini lunch bag type of packaging that had a seal on the top loop of the brown bag to cut open with a blade or scissors.  The bag is conveniently reusable after that to store or put away those cables or any short length mobile accessory cables.One side of the bag has the name of the product, color display so that you know which one youve received correctly, a checkbox mark to verify before opening the box which cable length(s) you received, and some selling points for using these cables.The other side has the serial number barcode.Upon opening up the package, I found the two cables, 3 feet and 6 feet, winded up and tied down to fit the packaging.My initial impressions when looking at the cables is that these look like very thin wire gauges to fit into this nylon braided coating.  Theyre thinner than the Anker audio cable that I currently own that is thicker and of a different coated material.Being that its nylon braided, there is noticeable friction when rubbing back and forth against the cables, but these are not retractable cables, so they dont cause skin irritation like other nylon material.It bends and flexes around pretty easily and effortlessly, although I should note that because the cable was winded up a certain way and stored like that for a long duration of time, when you leave them alone, they naturally want to curl up the way they were originally packaged.  But, I can freely move around the cable to bend or turn them in any direction without much of any resistance.  Thats one of the benefits of a nylon braided design.The color of the coating is a charcoal gray, which looks kind of nice if youre used to seeing black colored cables all the time.I did a quick test to pinch the cable with my thumb and finger tightly and I didnt feel it compress to where I could damage the internal wiring with my own weighted pressure.At the end of each cable wiring is the connector head which has the PowerAdd brand name on it so that you do not mix up similar looking wires from different brands or generics together.The connector head where you can hold the handle is about 9/16th inches long, so that gives you an idea of how much room there is to grip with your thumb and finger.  This is shorter in comparison to the Anker audio cable that I have, but in testing out the grip, it feels sufficient what PowerAdd designed the length as and shouldnt be much of any problem for someone with typical sized thumb and fingertips.This audio cable has gold connectors with green stripes on them and from my understanding, gold connectors for audio or charging cables are a more premium quality and provide better performance.USAGE:The reason why I selected in the 2 pack was because I like the idea of being able to switch between a short 3 feet cable for certain scenarios while keeping in mind when longer cables may be useful, such as the 6 feet cable.For my test, I tried taking them to work and putting them in my glove compartment.  It takes me over an hour one way to go to work in the recent months, so I had plenty of time to evaluate and spot defects.I first tried out the 3 feet cable.  My vehicle has a AUX input that connects this cable to my iPhone 5s.  I then had the ignition on and set my music to AOL Radio to listen to a station while heading to work.  The music started to play after the connection and selection was made just fine.  I adjusted the volume on my vehicles volume knob and drove into traffic for about 1.5 hours listening to different tracks from my phone while using the data connection and had no issues with the PowerAdd audio cable not transferring the music data from my phone to vehicle.The 3 feet cable was nice because I was able to freely have enough slack from plugging it in the AUX input thats on the center infotainment system display and had room to move my phone between the front drive to passenger side.  If I wanted to, I could use a phone mount to mount the phone to my windshield and plug the audio cable to it and still have the cable length stretch to fit the AUX input.Alternatively, I tested the 6 feet cable on the way home from work for 1.5 hours.  I experienced the same results in which the music played just fine and it was a good experience.When I got home, I tested stretching the cable out to have my phone reach from the front center infotainment system to the back side of the rear passenger area and it was able to stretch out just fine to where I could have people in the back control my phone and play any media to have audio transmission to my vehicle to listen along.  6 feet is about enough length to have someone sitting in the rear center seat of a 4 door sedan control the phone and whatever sound outputs from it to the AUX input of the vehicle.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Slim portable design2) Freely bends and moves as desired with the nylon braided design3) Easy to identify the cable based on the etched PowerAdd label on the connector heads4) Gold plated connects offers an improved performance experience5) Charcoal gray color looks niceCONS:1) The product page mentions these are tangle free cables, but I noticed with the 6 feet cables that occasionally the natural looping that it wants to retract to causes some of the loops to cross into each other in which I need to unravel out of in-between use.2) Cables naturally want to curl back up to the way they were bent from stored packaging.SUGGESTIONS:1) Offer other colored designs2) Create thicker gauge cablesUSER SCENARIOS:People who would benefit from using this cable are those who:1) Like to listen to music or podcasts2) Go on long road trips3) Have long commutes4) Do not have desirable taste in the FM radio stations5) Have an AUX input port in their vehicleOverall, these are nice cables and a fair tradeoff experience when comparing these cables from PowerAdd and the cable Ive had for a while from Anker.  I suggest users give this a try and get the 6 feet cable 2 pack because it works well in different situations and you never want to be limited with what your length of cable allows for you to do.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRTQ3UZ2GQO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SQX7RK#wasThisHelpful","RHRTQ3UZ2GQO4","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review of the product TT-SK05/ TaoTrinics Portable speaker:  It is listed on Amazon as:Bluetooth Speakers TaoTronics Wireless Speaker Portable Speaker (Bluetooth 4.0, High Fidelity Audio, Built-in Microphone, LED Light, A2DP Profiling, 6 Hours Playtime)-BlackI received this product last weekend and had time yesterday for a couple of hours to try it out for evaluation and review.  I have also taken a series of photos and included it in my review if anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product comes in a reasonably packaged illustrated cardboard box.  One of the confusing things about this box is that its the same one thats used for both the black and white color speakers apparently.  My box showed the black colored speaker and initially, I thought I got the wrong one, but when I opened the box lid, it was the correct white one that I ordered.The front and top of the box has a photo of the Bluetooth speaker.  The left side has the serial and model number.  The backside has North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific e-mail support information.I look at this illustration and if I was walking into a retail store, Id actually pick this up to take a look at it.  Unfortunately, there are no technical specs of the speaker around any sides of the box.  I would recommend that this is stated, at least in summary, for the user to be aware of.  As an internet company, its not a big deal, but if this company moved into retail space, this would be important.Upon opening the top box lid, I found inside the white colored Bluetooth speaker wrapped in a plastic bag inside.  When lifting that up, theres a circular cutout cardboard that tucked the speaker into the box, and underneath that was the Micro USB cable and AUX cable included with the box.The Micro USB cable is a standard type of cable for Bluetooth accessories such as the speakers.  The AUX cable is used for plugging into a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop that does not have Bluetooth support so that you can use the speaker with limited functionality while not needing any power from the speakers internal battery.In looking all around at the Bluetooth speakerThe top side has the speaker output with a ring around it that I later found out is to change colors to indicate pairing status and ON or OFF status.  The front of the speakers has the Taotronics logo.  The right side has a Mic hole.  The backside has the ON/OFF sliding switch, DC 5V charging input port, Line IN for AUX cable, and a slider for the volume.The bottom of the speaker has a pair of U shaped rubber stoppers to provide friction against a smooth surface so that the speaker cant be slid around and knocked off of a table top easily.  I tap against the side and it rocks around briefly but doesnt really move that much.In knocking it around, I found out that based on the shape of this speaker, it can lay rested on any of the sides all around it so that the speaker doesnt necessary have to be stable and pointing up.  It could be facing you.  I liked that part of the design.What I initially considered as a suggestion is that I like a multi-function button that has separate push buttons that have rubber padding, for the volume up, down, and play/pause functionality.  In this case with this Taotronics speaker, its integrated together with a slider that rolls to the left or right, which is OK, but feels a little flimsy and feels like it can easily get mechanical failure or wear and tear over time.  Id rather have the push pads for buttons to control these functions.  Thats my personal opinion.I suggest all product owners read the users manual prior to operating this product so that they are aware of what you can and cant do with this product.Some notable information from the manual includes the following:Specifications:Bluetooth Version: 4.0Bluetooth Profile: HFP, HSP, AVRCP, A2DPOutput Power: 3WFrequency: 90Hz-20KhzInput: DC 5VBattery: 500 mAh Lithium BatteryRange: 33 feet (10m)Working Time: 6 hoursCharging Time: 2 hoursDimension: 2.48 x 2.48 x 2.95 inchesWeight: 5.94 ozSo in going through some of these specs with my perspective.Bluetooth Version 4.0 is the latest Bluetooth next to 4.1 that is available in the market for Bluetooth accessories.  I suggest all people find Bluetooth 4.0 products and not the 3.0 or lower.  The 4.0 has better stability in terms of connectivity and performance, and better battery power management.Output Power of 3W was something that I had to consider.  It didnt sound to the current level of power that Ive been looking at for Bluetooth speakers, which is around 5W.  But, at a current price of $10.99 whereas the others were selling for around $25, it was reasonable for the price.  Ill be taking close attention to how it feels by ear later on in the review.  For now, my expectations were not too high.I wouldve liked to see a higher battery capacity than 500mAh for this product.  Perhaps up to 1000mAh or 2000 mAh with an increased price for that.  6 hours of playtime is good for a portable speaker of this price range.  It may not last you the whole day, but if you use it off and on in the day, youll be good enough for about half of the day before you need to recharge the battery to full.Fortunately, the specs state the charge time is about 2 hours, which isnt too bad.  Thats a good standard charge rate.  I would like it to be down to 1 to 1.5 hours full charge time, but it may be a design or parts limitation.  2 hours is good enough to where you can charge this while heading out or having a bite to eat and watching TV or using your smartphone or tablet, then come back to see that its fully charged to use it again in the middle of the day.The dimensions of this product make it very portable.  I was looking at this and this could certainly fit into my jacket pockets.  It might even fit into some of my pants pockets, but would cause a noticeable bulge out of the shape of my pants which would look unfriendly.  But it is small and with it small, it can be stored in more possible locations for travel or placing onto crowded table top surfaces.  I like the size.The weight of it when lifted up with one hand is lightweight.  I dont see myself straining or tiring if I had to hold onto this with my hand for an extended period of time of more than 10 minutes.In the Users Manual, it talks about the LED indicator, which is the ring shape around the top of the speaker.  It will turn red when charged, turn off when fully charged, flash green when in pairing mode, flash green for every 10 seconds when paired.USAGE:The evaluation of this product will be detailed, but before doing that, you have to pair the device to your phone or tablet.  I had an iPhone 5s to test for the remainder of this review.When turning on the power button on the back of the speaker, youll hear this brush of tones, followed by another tone.  Youll see the LED flash on the top of the speaker.  By going to your Bluetooth Settings and letting it be in discover mode, it will find the product labeled as Taotronics TT-SK05.Connecting to it will cause another set of tone noises from the speaker.What I like about this Bluetooth speaker that my last two Bluetooth speakers of higher price failed to incorporate was support for the Bluetooth battery meter indicator on the smartphones like the iPhone.  This Taotronics product has that, which is handy to monitor and gauge where along the 6 hour playback battery life it currently is in to plan to when charge the product.It hurts the batterys lifespan if you charge it too often from just minimal use.  Its recommended to try to fully drain or use until its low battery before charging it all the way to full.After pairing, I tested the volume.  The disappointment that I didnt like about this product is that I found out it uses AVRCP 1.3 or older and I can tell because the volume on the speaker is separate and independent of the iPhones volume rocker meter.  So to get the full volume, Id have to crank up the speaker volume until it beeps, and also turn up my iPhone volume bar.  The same is in the case of turning down the volume, although in my tests, you can slide the volume slider held down on the speaker and it will eventually mute the volume without needing to touch the iPhone.For my test, I tried a few songs of both lyrical and instrumental and then bass.First lyrical test of the sound quality was the song that I chose, which is:Brandon Heath - The Light in MeIts a strong but calm lyrical song with mild instrumental accompaniment.As I tested it out, I noticed that I had to crank the volume on my iPhone about 50% towards the max just to have the song heard fairly well.  This was about 5-10 feet away.  To get a good audible experience, I had to crank the volume to about 75% of the maximum volume on my iPhone.  This was OK and expected for a 3W power output.  But, I didnt let it distract me too much.  I placed the speaker in the center of my home on the first floor at the kitchen table and walked around with my paired iPhone. I walked end to end the full 30 feet of experience all around and the Bluetooth connection never broke or crackled in the semi open space that I walked around with my iPhone.  I had minimal dry wood walls and exterior concrete walls that were in the way during some portions of the walk.  But, this was impressive how the connection stayed good for that long of a tested semi open spaced environment.At some points, I did crank the volume up to about 85% of the max to hear it loud and clear from near 30 feet away of semi open space.  It didnt hurt my iPhone, but this probably was draining the battery of the speaker more than tested.  But, for a small product like this, I had to crank the volume high enough to have an enjoyable experience.  And for me, I have normal hearing, but with these speakers, I did have to push my volume bar near max to hear it reasonably loud from about 20-30 feet away in a semi open space.The lyrics in the song were clearly heard and I liked how the instrumentation and lyrics were heard well and distinctive with this speaker.  Particularly the singing.  I played through the whole 3 minutes of the song without issues.My next test was the song by Nickelback - Figured You Out which has a combination of lyrics and instrumentals from a rock category.I was able to hear the voice of the singer well.  The instrumentation quality was second best.  It was heard, but meshed together with the instruments to where it felt noisier than clear and distinctive.  It was a good experience.I tried Linkin Park  Lying From You, which has a lot of yelling and hard singing with instrumentation.  The overall quality of how it sounded to my ears was OK.  I could hear it well.  It didnt feel pounding to my ears.  I heard some instruments loud and clear more than others in the song based on how it was projected through the speakers and the composition of the song.  It still had a combined mesh of a noisy experience than distinctively hearing each instrument well.My next song was a bass test.  I went on YouTube and searched up high quality bass.  I found a result that had over 1 million views and tested that song.  I had the instrumentation playing while I heard the bass very well, but I had to crank up the volume to 80-90% near max in order to hear it good.  It was noticeable with the thumping sound coming from the speakers during the bass test, which was good for this size of portable speakers.  Youll hear the sort of loud thumbs at this volume range without needing to feel the power pressure of the bass reaching your ears.  It was good for this size of a portable speaker.  It met my expectations.My next test for fun was testing out playing the 2015 best trailers video on YouTube just to test.  What I found out was that depending on the audio combination of voice and sound effects, if I heard through the speakers, I could turn up the volume to about 75-80% and hear it well in a quiet background noise setting within 5 feet away, but any further than that, and it was muffled and hard to pick up to distinguish the dialogue that was being mentioned.So from my tests, the speaker was good on clear lyrical singing in songs.  With hard instruments playing, it was loud enough to hear, but felt meshed together with noise generated instead of distinctiveness.  With bass, the bass was good as long as the volume was raised very high.  The movie watching test with these speakers didnt turn out as well, but I think its still better than not having a Bluetooth speaker and having to rely on your smartphone or tablets speaker.The final test that I did was the talking and calling test.  For this test, I used my landline speaker phone to call to my iPhone, and set the landline speaker volume up and in a different area of my house in which I had a sliding door close it from picking up my voice into the landline phone when I was talking into the Bluetooth speaker.  So initially, I heard the incoming call from the landline phone to the Bluetooth speaker playing the projected music form my iPhones ringtone music.  I was happy to say that I heard the ringtone well where it wasnt too loud or too quiet.  My previous experience with Bluetooth speakers was that it would play the ringtone music extremely loud and high to where it was harmful to the ears and ruined my experience.  But here, everything was OK.  I tested a few incoming calls and was able to take the call by pressing the multifunction button on the Bluetooth speaker.  Same with hanging up, redialing, and rejecting a call.  All of those required timing when to press into the play/pause multifunction button.The great news about the calling test was that I found out this Microphone hole built into the Taotronics Bluetooth speaker is as good as my iPhones built in microphone in terms of frequency and range.  I initially talked up close to the Bluetooth speaker and heard the audio echo through my landline speakerphone in the distance loud and clear.  Then I started to distance myself from a couple of feet away to several feet away, and at one point, being an estimated 10 feet away from the Bluetooth speaker, and when I talked in a normal tone of voice, I could hear the echo through my landline phone most of the time.  There were a few occasions where I had to repeat what I was saying to hear the echo come out word for word, but it was minimal.  This mic on the Taotronics speaker is good in sensitivity, which works out well for group settings placing it in the center around them talking to someone.One other thing to mention is the LED indicator.  Its a subtle green LED flashing light.  It looks pretty cool.  I was able to capture a photo of it in dim lighting.  It makes the product look more stylish and modern.  The light isnt bright to where it would be distracting when trying to sleep.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Small and portable enough to fit into most types of pants and jacket pockets2) Green LED ring has a stylish and nice look in a dim light setting that makes the product look more modern3) Good microphone sensitivity for picking up your voice during calls (tested up to 10 feet away)4) Reasonable sounding bass when turning the volume up about 80-90% near max5) The speaker can stand on its own or lay flat on either of its sides to face you with stability from rocking around6) The ratio of playtime versus charge time is good7) Connection testing with Bluetooth 4.0 on this product was good with semi open spacing of 30 feet all around the houseCONS:1) It uses AVRCP 1.3 or older ,which requires the user to independently control two sets of volume, one on the speaker, and one on the phone or tablet2) You have to raise the volume on your phone to about 75% to 85% to hear the music through this speaker fairly loud and clear from about 15+ feet away3) Quality for movie or TV show content listening, particularly for action movies, isnt as good as it could be.4) Music where the instrumentations are playing with the singing sound too meshed together with noise rather than distinctively hearing them separately.SUGGESTIONS:1) Rather than a sliding dial to control the volume and play/pause, it may be preferable to have a model with a push button rubber padding for each multifunction2) Provide a higher capacity battery into this product3) Provide a travel pouch or bag to carry this speaker around and protect it from wetness and dirt or debris4) Provide a lanyard extension from one part of the Bluetooth speaker to hook it onto the waist belt loop or travel bags5) Increase the power output of this speaker to what is currently standard in the market for portable speakers in the low end of competitors, which is 5W.  That way, the user does not need to raise the volume on their smartphone or tablet so high as I did with testing of at least 75% near max volume6) Make an IPX5 or greater waterproof design for this type of productUSER SCENARIOS:People who would use this product are those who:1) Are looking for a cheap budget solution that is an improvement to the speaker quality of their smartphone or tablet2) Cannot afford high end premium speakers3) Want to have calling features with music listening experience combined4) Have small group settings using this Bluetooth speaker, which allows a wide coverage of voice pickup to hear to the recipient of the call.5) Like to have stylish affordable accessories added to their gadget listOverall, this product proved to impress me than the initial expectations I had when reading the specs like the 3W power.  Although I did have to crank up the volume very high to get a reasonably loud audible experience, the small portable speaker from Taotronics will be handy on small trips to provide entertainment for myself and a small group of people that is an inexpensive risk of loss or damage.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to provide a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  This review is to also help prospective buyers make smart, informed decisions based on the information provided to them and the photos shared.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUR1Q0L8BV9M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SOSPLI#wasThisHelpful","RUR1Q0L8BV9M1","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:iClever 6ft Premium High Speed Micro USB to USB Cable, BlackI received this product last week and had time to provide a review.  Attached are a set of photos that I took of the experience.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product came in a small square box with the micro USB cable bolded on the top of the box with the iClever logo.  It states on the top right hand corner of that side that it contains the 6 ft. or 1.8 m Micro USB cable inside, so you know right away when you receive the package and prior to opening up the box that you got the right one.The bottom of the box has the SKU number (171-21004-19) and website.Inside the box was the USB cable tied up in a plastic bag.After removing everything and straightening the cable out, I made some quick observations.My first impression was that this cable is very thick and felt durable.  Its much thicker in diameter than other micro USB cables that Ive used from other brands.  I could pinch down on the cable and it felt pretty resistive and not bent in very easily.The micro USB connector head has the iClever branding on it so that you can use this cable among other micro USB cables to identify which brand it is compared to generic cables that have no label on them.  The ends of the cable measures as the following:The micro USB connector handle measures 5/8th inch long by 3/8th inch wide by 1/4th inch thick.The USB Type A connector handle measures 6/8th inch long by 5/8th inch wide by 5/16th inch thick.USAGE:The toughness of the material for the handles as well as the groves from the USB symbol and company name help gives it a nice grip to hold onto.  Micro USB cables have always felt pretty good to grip for me, but this one feels slightly better.  The measurements indicate that you can pinch down with your thumb and finger to give a nice secure grip to pull or push into a micro USB port or USB port, whichever direction you go.I tested using this cable on an Anker Bluetooth speaker that I had which uses a shorter Micro USB cable to see if it would charge.  The nice thing about this cable from iClever is that I am able to charge my Micro USB driven devices from my tabletop rather than leaving them on the ground to get dirty, dusty, stepped or kicked on.I plugged the USB connector into my USB charging station on the floor and had plenty of length of the iClever cable to bring it up to charge my Anker speaker on the table top with room to spare.  The LED light turned red to indicate there was current flow through the cable and supplying a charge to the speaker.  That was a quick test to show that the cable was not defective.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Thick durable material2) Comfortable sizing for connector head grip3) iClever branding etched on the micro USB connector handle helps distinguish it from other generic cables4) 6 feet of cable length allows more opportunities to rearrange where you charge your devicesCONS:1) Cable gets twisted and tangled easilySUGGESTIONS:1) Upgrade to the nylon braided material design that has less tangles2) Provide different colors for different styles and identitiesUSER SCENARIOS:This product would be useful for people who:1) Want a longer cable to not have to reach from the ground to grab or drop off devices for charging2) Want a more durable cable to handle accident prone situations3) Want a better gripped cable thats not very slippery to push and pull fromOverall, I think that this is a nice and useful cable from iClever.  Ill be able to charge from further distances away from the wall outlets and have things charged for visibility and accessibility on table tops such as my office workspace.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXOWHJQF6GL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OIC57K#wasThisHelpful","R1OXOWHJQF6GL5","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:TaoTronics Selfie Stick Telescopic Monopod for Android and iOS Smartphones, One Button Shutter/Remote, 3.5mm Universal Connector, No Power/Battery Required (Black)I received this product last week and had time today to evaluate it for a detailed review.  I have included a set of photos in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product came in a small, brown rectangular cardboard box with black printing to show the outline drawing of the monopod on the top side of the box followed by the serial number barcode on the side of the box.  The model number for this unit is TT-SH012.The bottom of the box has the address, phone, and e-mail contact for North America.  There are also e-mail addresses for Europe and Asia as well.After opening the box, I found that the selfie stick was fully exposed and wasnt wrapped on a plastic bag, which is fine I suppose, but Im used to products that are new being wrapped up, even when inside of the package.Also, I was a bit disappointed at how poorly treated the Quick Start Guide was packaged into the box.  Taotronics shippers had to force this thick multi language support quick guide into the box and in doing so, had to roll it up so that it could fit since leaving it flattened out would not fix the dimensions of the cardboard box.  Also, several of the pages got bent and folded in permanently from the top right hand corner of the Quick Start Guide which sort of bothered me because I couldnt reverse or correct this Quick Start Guide to flatten it out anymore.  So I received a new product with a new Quick Start Guide that looks like it had been sat on by someone sitting in a seat and caused it to wrinkle up and crumple on the corners and edges.  I suggest Taotronics does a better job at how they handle packaging these types of printouts.Before using the product, I read the manual to become familiar with the naming convention for all of the parts and how to use the selfie stick.  Ive had about 4 brands of selfie stick that requires charging the lithium ion battery inside of them with a micro USB connector.  But, with this Taotronics selfie stick, the new feature is having a 3.5mm connector built into the selfie stick supply the power for the capture button by connecting to the smartphones headphone jack.  That was one of the things that distinguishes this selfie stick from others.  Quite often with other brands of selfie sticks is that they dont design a Bluetooth battery level indicator for the smartphones, so while those selfie sticks are rated to last 20 hours under one charge, you dont know when those 20 hours will be up before charging from full depletion.  And on the other hand, you dont want to overcharge too often after using it for a couple of hours worth because the batteries have a tested and rated number of charge cycles that you can put it through.  But here, this Taotronics selfie stick doesnt need any of that.  But it will draw some battery from your smartphone when you use it, but it should be minimal.In looking at the selfie stick, when Taotronics said that they designed the lightest and smallest retractable selfie stick on the market, they were not kidding.  This thing is very small and thin.  The handle can be held with a full grip end to end in a babys hand.  I have sort of big long fingered hands so this was easy to clench with one hand.  But what I didnt like about it was that the handle, being that it was thin, didnt offer much of a cushion when holding and gripping the rubber handle.  It feels pretty hard and slightly uncomfortable when gripping it to a pinch and as my later tests showed when using it, my hand and wrist got a tired after holding it fully extended taking several shots after a while.  Nonetheless, the handle has a nice gloss to it and feels smooth to handle.  I would suggest Taotronics designs some grooves that help curve and fit better into a handled grip and provide some friction.In also looking at the camera button, its a dark orange colored button thats circular.  It has a nice mechanical sound when you press on it to know that its triggered the action that youre trying to make to take a photo, which is also good for troubleshooting purposes if your selfie stick isnt responding.  Again with the comfort issue, this camera button doesnt feel as nice as other selfie sticks.  For example, Taotronics made a selfie stick called the TaoTronics iFly Bluetooth Selfie Stick Extendable Monopod.  Model# TT-SH10.  You can look it up on Amazon.  From those photos, you can see the camera button design is different than the one pictured for this selfie stick.  That button design on the iFly actually feels nicer on the thumb, is more smooth, and comfortable than this one that Im currently reviewing.  Other newer brands of selfie stick have adopted to that design as well.  This orange button in the current design form of the selfie stick TT-SH012 is smaller to accompany the smaller cylinder shape of the monopod, but is not the most comfortable among Taotronics series of selfie sticks.  I suggest Taotronics reconsiders an improved design for the camera button for long term use of comfort when taking several photos, possibly 100, in a day.The wrist wrap feels nice and comfortable with the soft nylon material.  However, whats missing is that theres no fastener on this wrap, so you can fit your hand in this and have it wrap around your wrist, depending on different hand and wrist sizes of people, youd have twice the wrist size left as an opening in which youd have to require holding onto the handle of the selfie stick the whole time.  So this current design doesnt necessarily cling onto your wrist snug.  I suggest Taotronics improve on this feature by adding a fastener to adjust different wrist sizes for a more secure fit.The Phone Holder was interesting.  It moves pretty easily.  It has a rubberized groove pattern on the thin sides of the holder where you can expand it to fit the phone.  Theres a knob on the side where you can twist to loosen up the holder and then tighten it up so that the angle locks in without being able to move around easily for a secure lock with the weight of the phone.  What I didnt like was that Taotronics advertises that this phone holder can rotate 270 degrees.  There is a picture of that on the Amazon Product Page.  However, based on my testing, even though I loosened the adjusting knob, I was unable to get a complete 270 degree rotation towards having a 90 degree bent of the phone holder facing me while placing the handle straight on a table top or held in my hand.  In the pictures that I attached to the review, youll see that its off by 20-30 degrees and even with a lot of effort trying to bend it, I was unable to get the full 270 degree rotation.  It could be that my unit is defective.  Ive contacted Taotronics about it.  I suggest Taotronics does a quality check of this feature that it advertises before shipping out units.The last feature to talk about is the 3.5mm connector.  When I first opened the box, I found this was dangling around.  There is a spot for it to be securely closed loop on the side of the phone holder where there is a Wire Collector, which essentially is a hold to plug the connector head into.  In looking at the wire, it looks pretty frail.  I had to be extra careful handling it and avoid getting it jammed by rotating the phone holder in one direction or the other.  I wish the coating of the wire had more thickness and toughness.  But the design of the monopod was to be small and thin, so this is what happens.  The cable coils out from the back of the top of the handle and leans towards the side.  Initially I didnt find much of a problem with this cable dangling around, but as I started to test and use the monopod, I frequently ran into the issue where when I rotated the phone holder back and forth, a part of the cable would get caught and jammed against the phone holder when trying to collapse it to a close and that got me concerned with damaging the internal wire of the cable.  It happened quite often when rotating the phone holder back and forth.  Same problem occurred, or got worse, when I did a closed loop to tuck the dangling 3.5mm connector into the wire collector.  It just easily gets in the way.  I suggest Taotronics improves on this feature by redesigning the location of where the cable comes out and where it settles when not used with the perspective of the rotation of the phone holder.MEASUREMENTS:3.55 mm connector stretches out to about 7 inches with of cable length based on my measurements.Shortest capture length from base of selfie stick is 6 inches.  Furthest capture length from fully expanded pole from base of selfie stick is about 23 inches.USAGE:Since this selfie stick didnt have any Bluetooth pairing involved, the setup process to get ready to use it was pretty easy.  The phone holder expands out to fit your phone in a landscape position.  For my test, I used an iPhone 5s that had a fully protective case installed on it already.  It fit into the phone holder just fine and the rubber grip of the phone holder allowed me to make adjustments to slide around the iPhone to get the right placement of it.  Next, I opened up the headphone jack cover of my case and plugged in the 3.5mm connector from the selfie stick into the headphone jack and tested pressing the capture button while in the Camera app.  It started to take pictures right away without any issues.Next, I tested changing the length of the pole and taking different selfies at different angles and heres where I ran into a minor problem.  When I had the pole not extended out and be fully collapsed, or when the selfie stick was extended out to about one level of extension, when I turned the selfie stick a little too much one side or another, the pole over rotated due to the weight of the smartphone and tiled more to the side than what I had wanted it to.  That happened quite frequently and my iPhone 5s is an older model of the iPhone series.  Just moving it one way or the other just dropped more weight and rotation of the pole to the same side with more movement than what I had wanted, which got a bit annoying.  It seemed like a defect.  I contacted Taotronics about it with some recorded videos.  I suggest Taotronics look into this to see if this is a design or assembly flaw with their units.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Small, lightweight, and thin2) Users no internal battery and is self-powered by your smartphone3) Easy to setup and get ready to capture photos4) Can be shared with multiple users with ease and not have to worry about repairing to other devices5) Smooth handle with a comfortable wrist wrapCONS:1) Handle of selfie stick is not comfortable for long term use and causes hand and wrist fatigue after a few minutes of taking photos2) Camera button has a stiffness feeling to it thats not as comfortable to press on as the older model TT-SH10.3) No fastener for the wrist wrap4) 3.5mm connector gets caught and jammed easily when rotating back and forth the phone holder5) Phone holder when tested doesnt provide a full 270 degree rotation6) Connector wire seems frail or sensitive to accidental damage like from jamming7) Found a defective issue with my unit where turning the selfie stick with the phone installed side to side caused the weight of the phone to cause the pole to over rotate beyond the stopping point of the turn8) Quick Start Guide got damaged from the current form of packagingSUGGESTIONS:1) Reprint the Quick Start Guide or increase the dimensions of the product box so that the guide doesnt have to be curved and bent up to fit the current dimensions of the box2) Add some grooves to the handles for a more ergonomic handheld grip to better fit the shape of the hand and fingers3) Adopt the current camera button design of the TT-SH10 or improve the current design on the TT-SH012 to have a better comfort and groove of the camera button4) Add a fastener to the wrist wrap to have a tight snug fit around the wrist when worn5) Redesign the selfie stick so that it can actually rotate a full 270 degrees and not come up shorter than that based on the Amazon product page product description6) Change the location of the 3.5mm connector, where it comes out, and where it settles when left unused to avoid getting jammed by the phone holder rotation7) Create a tighter lock of the extension pole with the base handle so that rotation of the stick with the phone installed does not cause the pole to move on its ownUSER SCENARIOS:This product would be useful for people who:1) Take lots of photos of their life2) Go on trips frequently3) Take selfie videos for Video Blogging4) Want to take photos with a wider angled shot of whats around themOverall, it did feel good taking several selfies without worry about battery life of the monopod.  If theres anything to be careful about, its that since this is designed to be small, thin, and compact, the full extension of the monopod may not be as good as other brands of selfie sticks.  So with a shorter extension, theres not as much of a wide coverage that your selfie captures will be able to take for group or scenic photos if youre looking for the capability of a wider depth shot.  But for other people, who may just want to take a picture of themselves or with a couple of friends, this selfie stick is tolerable.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.

"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:iPhone 5S Screen Protector, iPhone 5 Screen Protector - Maxboost iPhone 5S 5 5C Glass Screen Protector - [Tempered Glass] Worlds Thinnest Ballistics Glass, 99% Touch-screen Accurate, Round Edge [0.2mm] Ultra-clear Casings Glass Screen Protector Perfect Fit for Apple iPhone 5 / 5S / 5C Case Maximum Screen Protection from Bumps, Drops, Scrapes, and Marks (Lifetime No-Hassle Warranty)I received this product recently and had time to evaluate it today for a review.  I have also included a set of photos of the contents in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:Whats nice that Maxboost did was that it planned out the packaging well for a screen protector that can be bent, crushed, or mishandled by the shipper and handlers.  Not only did this product come in a padded envelope, when you open it up, then it has another additional layer of bubble wrap pouch that tucks a hard plastic shell case inside of it that unveils the screen protector contents.  So theres almost 3 layers of protection to the screen protector and contents there.In opening up the package, inside had the following:- Instruction and installation manual- Screen protector wrapped in a foam like pouch- Guided Stickers with dust sticker- One dry wipe and one wet wipeOne of the disappointing things about these contents is that there was no micro fiber cloth.  That was clearly stated in the video installation guide, as well as the printed install manual inside the package.  I later found out from contacting Maxboost customer service that their old package had the micro fiber cloth and they received customer complaints about it for some reason, so they decided to change it to these wet and dry wipes.  Im not sure why someone would complain over micro fiber cloths.  Those tend to be very useful and helpful.  Also, they are reusable and easy to wash, whereas these dry and wet wipes are onetime use.  I think Maxboost should update their printouts, videos, and product page to let users know about this.The installation video is very helpful and Im glad that Maxboost made one that clearly shows you how to install the screen protector for people who are new to the process like me.  I suggest Maxboost also provides a video to show to users how to cleanly uninstall, remove, and detach the screen protector if it was not applied correctly or got damaged to where it needs to be removed for replacement.Speaking of which, whats great about Maxboost is that they offer a lifetime warranty on their screen protectors.  What this means, as mentioned and clarified by consulting with Maxboost customer service, is that once you buy one of their screen protectors for a phone model, you just have to go on their website to fill out a warranty form with your Amazon order number, and then whenever your screen protector gets damaged from drops or accidents, you just have to contact them, take a picture of it, and theyll look you up to process a replacement.  Seeing how iPhones tend to be kept or held in value for at least 4 years for each model, that means that a $8 screen protector for the first initial cost will end up repaying for itself for however reckless you are with your phone for drops or damages to the screen.  I think that is great that Maxboost offers this.  I dont hear about other brands that sells screen protectors that offer a lifetime warranty like this with no fine line conditions to them.  You can replace them as many times as you want.  Good policy Maxboost.USAGE:Installing was straight forward given the printed and video instructions.  I used to have to rely on asking the Apple store to have their employees do these screen protectors installs so that I wouldnt mess them up myself, but seeing how theres a lifetime warranty on these from Maxboost and an easy to follow video, I felt more confident in installing this myself at home.First, you use the wet wipe to clean around the surface of your iPhone.  Then you use the dry wipe.  The dust sticker is then helpful to dab around for any remaining dust around.  I suggest to all users to try to find a room that doesnt have too much activity or motion going on.  And have the windows closed shut to avoid any dust or debris flying around in the air while this install is taking place.  After that, then you put the screen protector faced down with the peeler facing the phones screen.  Using the guided stickers, you line the screen protector up with the phones screen so that theres little to no difference to tape it down on one side.  After that, then you lift the other side of the screen protector, peel of the adhesive, and flatten back down the screen protector onto the phone case.  After that, Id leave it settled and use a credit card to swipe around to get rid of air bubbles before removing the guided stickers.  Quick polish and youre good to go.The benefit of having this screen protector is that theres a lot of iPhone cases out there which do not have raised edges in the front or its very minimal and exposes the iPhones screen to a direct face plants or angled impacts to risk damaging the screen.  Before this screen protector, I resorted to using a case with a built in screen protector plate as a 2-in-1 solution, but the case isnt attractive, and if I wanted a pretty case, I needed a screen protector or risk exposing the front screen to any scratches or damages.  Now with this Maxboost screen protector, I can buy pretty or attractive looking case designs to walk around with and have a front facing solution that provides a complete all around solution.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Install video is very helpful2) Lifetime warranty with unlimited replacements3) Guided stickers for easier matching and mirroring of the screen protector with the iPhone.CONS:1) No micro fiber cloth that was expected to be in the contents based on the printed guide and video install guide showing it in the package2) Dry and Wet wipe packages are hard to tear and remove.  Very resistant.SUGGESTIONS:1) Provide an uninstall and removal video for users who damage their screen protector or install it incorrectly.  This video would be useful for replacement processes.2) Update the printed manual, install video, and product page to state that new packages do not have the microfiber cloth and that it has been replaced with a dry wipe.USER SCENARIOS:People who would be interested in using this product are those who:1) Currently have no screen protection for their phone2) Dont want to keep having to repurchase screen protectors from brands that dont offer a long term warranty3) Dont currently own a case that has front facing protection for their phoneOverall, this screen protector and its contents are a useful solution for protecting the investment and value of the phone.  For an item that costs less than $10 and has lifetime warranty, youll get your $10 worth of damages and replacements overtime.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PBVT9S7A271/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQAR95I#wasThisHelpful","R7PBVT9S7A271","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Tablet Stand, TROND A1 Multi-Angle Portable Stand Holder for 3.5""-10"" Tablets, Smartphones and E-Readers, Compatible with Apple iPad Air / Air 2, iPad Mini Retina 2, 3; iPhone 6 Plus 5s 5c 5 4S; Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 3, 4, Note 3, 4, 8.0 10.1, S5 S4 S3; Google Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10; ASUS EeePad Transformer, Lenovo Tab, Kindle Voyage Paperwhite / Fire HD HDX (Black)I received this a while back and had time today to evaluate it for a detailed review.  I have also taken a series of photos if anyone is interested.  This product was tested using my iPhone 5s.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:This TROND product came in a simple boxed packaging where the label for the product wrapped over the opening lid of the box to create a seal to show that it is brand new.  The TROND brand name and model number is on the top of the box.  Certifications and approvals are on the front of the box.  Serial barcode is at the bottom.Opening the box reveals the stand wrapped in a plastic bag followed by the Welcome Guide underneath it.Although the stand seems pretty straight forward to use, I suggest all users to read through the Welcome Guide first prior to using it.Some important information in the Welcome Guide includes:Technical Specifications:Model: TROND A1Material: Aluminum & ABSCompatibility: 3.5 to 10 inch smartphones, e-readers & TabletsDimensions: 4.72 x 3.94 x 1.18 inchesNet Weight: 4.59 oz.In looking at the stand, all areas where the device rests on the stand has a layer of ABS rubber.  This is important when it comes to bare bone smartphones or tablets with no cases installed on them to avoid scratches to the device when resting and adjusting the device on the stand.The TROND logo is on the rubber padding that the device rests on.  Its pretty thick.  It is recommended to not pull the rubber padding off of the stand.  The way it feels on my fingers does not indicate that the side of the phone or tablet resting and moving on this pad can cause any scratches or damage to that device.The top of the stand has a rubber padding for the rotated angle that you can adjust for the stand to protect the top part of the phone or tablet resting on this.There are a pair of rubber stoppers on the bottom of the stand, but its fairly minimal and based on my tests dragging or pushing the stand back and forth on the tabletop, it didnt do much use to where youd notice immediately the benefits of those rubber stoppers.The Aluminum body of the stand has a tough and glossy look to it, which some may find desirable.  I just noticed that while handling the stand, that my finger prints causes grease like stains on the stand that is easily captured when handling the stand normally.The back of the stand has a circular cutout portion of the back support of the stand that serves the purpose of being able to charge your phone or tablet while using the stand, which can happen to drain easily while using the stand to do FaceTime or Video Chat.One of the things that I felt fortunate about was that based on the cutout designs of this stand, nothing felt sharp or abrasive while rubbing around and holding anywhere on this stand.  Everything is rounded and smoothened out, which is a plus.USAGE:One of the things I knew was a limitation before getting the stand was that theres a limit of 60 degrees that this thing can tilt back on.  To some people who eventually use the stand with their camera, thats not too big of a deal.  However, I do know some brands who have stands like this that offer 325 degrees of free rotation, which can be handy for situations depending on what youre recording or taking a picture of.  I hope TROND updates this product with a more flexible range of adjustment with the angles.But with the limitation, I was able to adjust the stand so that I could rest my phone or tablet closer to vertical while still having the tablet stand stand up on its own, however, there was some sensitive stability issues.  But if you left everything alone and just played the video or took the photo with a tap on the screen, then it holds up just fine.Adjustments while the phone or tablet is settled on the stand should be with both hands, one to hold the phone or tablet, and the other to pull the back support leg of the stand.Moving the rotator was very easy and did not cause much resistance.  I was also able to readjust the rotation many times without seeing any obvious wear or tear of the rotator.The angle from near vertical to 60 degrees and how it should be used is user specific.  For me, I was sitting at the dinner table with this a couple of feet away from my body and near vertical captured my jacket and not my face.  However, the maximum extension of 60 degrees captured my face, but aimed too high and capture much of the unnecessary background.  It also shot up towards my nostril as well which was not welcomed.  But trying it on more elevated surfaces ended up being a better experience.  The angle will vary on the tabletop height that you have the stand on in comparison to whether youre standing or sitting.I used my FaceTime to record myself while having the phone on landscape resting on the rubber pad and having it at the maximum angle of 60 degrees.  Overall, it worked out quite nicely and is a definite improvement to what I was using before to capture myself, which was a selfie stick.  This is much different from a selfie stick because I can free up my hand that normally holds the stick to do more with myself in the video.  Also, this tablet stand can be placed far away in the background to catch a group or social moment going on within range without having to hold onto it.  For indoor use or outdoor use that doesnt require travel or movement, then this tablet stand is definitely preferable choice for photos and recording.  If youre walking around, then a selfie stick would make sense.I tested out poking through the charging cable from connecting it to my iPhone to pulling the cable through the hole on the back leg support of the stand to plug in.  That worked with little to no issues.  The charging cable has to bend and curve backwards and is something that would make sense for a phone thats in portrait position.  Otherwise, if youre going to do a wide shot on a landscape, you dont need to feed the cable through the hole because the cable will have free access and movement from the side of the stand.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Rubber padding allows unprotected devices to get comfort being rested on the stand without risk of damage2) Hole in the back leg support of the stand provides a solution for some who like to charge their devices while using the stand3) Stand holds up on its own without falling when angled near vertical thanks to the bottom supportCONS:1) Side edges of the aluminum portion of the stand can feel a bit roughSUGGESTIONS:1) Increase the angled ability for the rotation of the stand to match competitive brands that allow up to 325 degrees of rotatable ability2) Increase the thickness and placement of the rubber stopper on the front leg support of the standUSER SCENARIOS:This product would be useful for people who:1) Like to take photos2) Like to take videos3) Like to FaceTime or Video Chat4) Are holding a special social event that theyd like to capture a memory ofOverall, this product is a good starter for tablet stands to model behind.  I find this to be very helpful and useful for those who are confident in themselves to capture themselves, their family, or their friends in the moment to hold memories of on their phone or tablet.  But Id like to see TROND upgrade this stand so that it can support a larger angle that makes it competitive with other brands of tablet stands.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.

"Hi,This is my review for the Taotronics TT- SH13 Bicycle Mount Holder.  It is listed on Amazon as:TaoTronics Bicycle Mount Holder Cradle for Smartphone, GPS and other Devices (One-button Release, 360 Rotatable, Rubber Strap)I received this product last week and had time today to evaluate it on a bike for review.  I have also taken a set of photos of how the product looks like out of the box and when installed on a bike for anyone who is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product box itself is very simple and Taotronics wasted no time trying to make a flashy presentation.  After all, its whats inside that matters.  Still, I wouldve liked to see more around the box to make it more appealing.  The front of the box has a sketched drawing of the product with the Taotronics brand name and model number TT-SH013.  The side has the serial number barcode.  The back of the box has e-mail and phone contact information for North America, Europe, and Asia.Inside the box were a few items which included a cradle, clamp and rubber grip.  The clamp already had preinstalled the orange colored rubber grip.  Taotronics was nice enough to provide a black colored rubber grip for users preferences, but to swap that out requires a Philips screwdriver and some steps that the User Manual doesnt state.Since this was a totally new product to me, I went ahead and read the Users Manual to become familiar with the item prior to installing it.  The Users Manual doesnt describe everything in detail, so its best to consult with other users experiences within the Amazon product page community as well.So first looking at the cradle.  This cradle is interesting because it has a few features.  Theres the release button which will take the side holders and slowly expand them with a mechanical movement to fully open it wide so that it can fit certain smartphones and tablets in a portrait position.  It doesnt require any battery power to do so.  Its all mechanical.  You can collapse the side holders by pinching both sides that will create a cranking sound in doing so.  One of the things I didnt like about the release button is that it made a squealing sound whenever I pressed it and it was repetitive.  To most people it wouldnt be an issue and only noticed in a quiet environment, but for a product coming out of the box, I was expecting to have no defective issues.  I suggest Taotronics be careful about the assembly of their products to avoid this squealing.Whats neat about the cradle is that theres a bottom piece that folds out if you flick it out that serves as a bottom tray to hold the phone.  So now you have three sides that hug the phone together which gives a nice tighter fit from being shaken around and falling out of the cradle.Theres a lot of rubberized padding and designs to grip the phone thats on the cradle.  On the backside is a circular piece of rubber with a design pattern for grip onto the backside of the phone.  On both sides of the holder are teeth like rubberized patterns that help grip it like clenching the phone with your fingers.  They are safe on the phone and give a secure but massaging like feeling when rubbing them against your fingers.Taotronics has its logo on the bottom tray flap that closes up.On the back of the cradle are 4 key like patterns for inserting the clamp onto the cradle.The clamp itself comes preinstalled with the rubber grip and is loosened up already.  Theres a lock knob thats below the jaw of the clamp that can be spun in one direction to open up the mouth of the clamp more, while the other direction is to close the clamp shut when it is on the handlebar of the bike.  The lock knob can be folded up as well if need be.Inside the clamp has a rubberized padding with grooves in it to match the shape of the bikes handlebar while not causing any friction that could scratch up the handlebar.Clearly, Taotronics did a good job so far in this observation of how it placed rubberized patterns in places on the mount to provide a secure fit and traction against the devices or parts while avoiding it to cause any scratches on those as well.USAGE:Before directly applying the mount to the bike handle, I tested assembling and disassembling it a few times to get used to it and so that I can show it to others how to get it done since the visuals in the Users Manual are not fully clear.I tested installing a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone to the cradle.  To insert it, I pressed the release button to fully expand it and then flicked open the bottom tray to have it rest into the cradle while pinking the sides mechanically shut to squeeze along all 3 sides of the phone.  What I found out from this method was that when I have the phone sit into the bottom tray, that raises the height of where the top rubber grip corners could stretch to wrap over the corners while making the bottom corners with the longer grip too loose.  I think the bottom tray serves the purpose of certain types of cell phones and smartphones, but it was not compatible with the Samsung Galaxy smartphone because if I used the bottom tray, it was not possible to stretch the rubber grip corners at the top without possibly damaging it past elasticity.  That was how the top felt and I tried hard to wrap it over but couldnt do it.So instead, I took out the phone, flicked the bottom tray to close and then reinserted the phone into the cradle and centered it before pinking the sides of the holder shut to give a secure fit.  When I did this, then the rubber grip on the top and bottom corners were able to wrap over and give a secrete fit.I tried to shake the cradle around with the phone mounted back and forth, rocking it back and forth and moving it in different motions.  It was secure in place without any budge, which is great because if theres ever an impact or collision with the bike having this mount on, I wouldnt want the phone to be sailing off in the air and having a bad drop impact.After I installed the phone to the cradle, I looked at the clamp and saw how the 4 keys lined up to the holes behind the cradle.  You first push it in and then once all 4 keys are in, then you push up to secure it in the design to tentatively lock it in place so that it doesnt move around.  To detach the cradle, then you just reverse the motion by pushing down and then pulling out to separate the two pieces apart.Next up was the clamp.  The clamp was straight forward because it was already twisted mostly to have the jaws open.  I just twisted the bottom some more to loosen it up and then I took out a bike and tried it on the front center handle bar, which fit just fine.  Then while holding it still, I turned the bottom lock knob several circles until I couldnt turn it anymore.  The lock knob can fold inwards, but I found that if I do that, I had to loosen the screw some more to fold it in, and in doing so, that caused the clamp to slip from grip of the handle bar and move around, which isnt what I wanted to do, so I left it flipped outwards and tightened it all the way.Once it was secure, everything felt pretty good.  I tested with someone messaging on the phone and navigation while on the bike.  It did not slip off or have any issues.  It felt like a good mount that locked up tight.Whats a neat feature about this mount is that the 360 rotation allows the user to be able to put their phone in landscape or portrait display depending on what they do with their phone.  Or you can have it at a slanted angle if thats what youd like to do.  Its pretty free form and moves clockwise or counterclockwise without much effort.  But I found that the rotation worked only once the cradle was connected to the clamp.I decided to leave it on that way and leave the bike in the garage so that I wouldnt have to loosen it and reapply it.  It became part of the accessory thats permanently on the bike and will be good for most year around trips, with the exception of the rainy days that will be coming up in which will not protect the phone from water damage.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Rubberized design with the intent for secure protection and prevention of damage onto surfaces2) Neat mechanical design for having a single push button for slowly expanding the holder with a simple compression spring to pinch it tight for a snug fit of the device3) Comes with a spare color change rubber grip for different styles for bikes4) Secure grip to the bikes handlebar with the clamp5) Simple rotation to change orientation of the app or video that is being watched while on the bikeCONS:1) Lock knob does not fold in when securing a tight twist and requires to loosen it up to fold it correctly, but in doing so, causes a weak and slippery grip to the handlebar of the bike.2) Bottom tray usage doesnt allow the compatibility of the rubber grips to fit up and over the corners of the smartphone used for testing because it becomes off center in the placement of the phone with respect to the locations of the rubber grips3) Squealing noise can be heard whenever the release button is usedSUGGESTIONS:1) A redesign may be needed for the bottom tray or stating what devices are compatible to use it so that the rubber grips fit all along the corners2) Provide instructions for the use of the release button, 360 rotations, and replacing the rubber grip with the one provided in the boxUSER SCENARIOS:People who could use this product are those who:1) Ride a bike (obviously)2) Are bikers who need navigation or entertainment while riding around using their phone3) Are bikers who need access to their phone without stopping to reach from their pockets4) Are bikers with little to no pocket access on their clothes for phones or mobile devicesOverall, this is a neat product for a new category from Taotronics.  They did a pretty good job with their first design of this product, but as I suggested, more improvements can be made to make it an even better experience.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE3WTMKP96QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PS3ME2#wasThisHelpful","REE3WTMKP96QO","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:EasyAcc Monster 20000mAh Power Bank (4A Input 4.8A Smart Output) External Battery Portable Charger for Android Phone Samsung - Black and OrangeI received this product a couple of weeks ago and have used it a few times to provide a detailed review.  I have included a set of photos that I have taken in case anyone is interested.UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:The product comes in a very simple cardboard box that has no graphical designs on it.  If it was in a retail store, I wouldve passed by it.  But the presentation on the Amazon product page is what sells and when receiving this product box, the intention in my opinion is to use this product out of the box and discard the box.The top of the box has the brand name and model number of the power bank.  The right side had the serial number barcode.  The bottom of the box has some feature summary and example of compatible products for this power bank.  Basically, any mobile device that uses a USB Type A connector to charge the product can be used with this power bank.Upon opening the box, I found the power bank was wrapped in a plastic bag to protect it from dust and fingerprints by the factory or shipper.  In taking that out, I found the User Manual underneath with 2 micro USB cables that were in a hidden compartment that had to be lifted out of the layer of cardboard in the interior.  Everything was tightly snug when packaged.The first thing I recommend on doing is reading the users manual to be aware of how to use the product and what it can and cant do.  Some notable information includes:Smart Technology is built into this power bank.  What that means is that while the total output is capable of 4.8A max based on the technical specifications, plugging in devices that have less output will charge at their optimal rates based on the power banks chip detecting what type of device youve plugged into it.  So if I have an iPhone 5s and plug this in, it will charge at about 1A.The input is 4A with the use of two USB charging ports.  That is quite impressive as Ive used other power banks of heavy capacity thats 8000mAh and up from other brands like RavPower and HisGadget and they only provide a 1A to 2A port to charge at best and because of that, it can take easily 8-12 hours to fully charge from empty.  That means that if you have to go do something the next day and want one of those charged and ready for use at full capacity, rather than waiting until you go to sleep to start charging it like how you would with your phone or tablet, youd have to start charging it during your dinner time or well before that, and thats not something most people would think of doing during their busy lives.  So I was disappointed in those specs for other power banks from other brands, but here with the EasyAcc power bank model, it is stated that it will fully charge in 6 hours, which for 20000mAh, this is much more reasonable and bearable to deal with for overnight charging.There are a total of 4 Smart Output ports with a total output of 4.8A max.  That seems reasonable because anything more than that will just cause the power bank to get sensitive to getting too hot and deplete too quickly.  With 4.8A, that means that it is possible to charge 4 smartphones like 4 iPhones or Android phones since those usually charge at 1A each.  But with 4.8A, it is also possible to charge 2 tablets as well, but Its likely that you will not be able to fully charge two tablets to full, but more of giving an increased partial charge for both devices.A cool feature that will be tested later is the LED light thats built in as an additional feature for emergency lighting with this power bank.  I found power banks with an LED lighting can come in handy as an integrated feature for emergency situations, like power outages or doing something simple like looking for something in your car, or looking at a lock.Although its possible to charge the power bank at 4A max with 2 USB ports charging at 2A each, it is possible if youre limited with your settings or environment to just use one of the two ports and charge at 1A or 2A depending on if youve plugged it into the wall with a wall charger or own a charging station.  I would not charge this with the USB port from a laptop or computer because that will be a very slow charge that would drive you nuts.Technical Specifications for this product include:Capacity: 20000Mah/74WhBattery Type: Lithium ionInput: DC 5V 4A(max)Output: DC 5V 4.8(max)Size: 6.57 x 3.15 x 0.86inWeight: 454g/16 oz.There is a map in the User Manual that describes the 4 LED dotted indicators on the power bank and what they represent in terms of battery life remaining.  Each dot represents within a 25% range.The Power Bank will cut the energy output within 30 seconds once the devices have been fully disconnected from the power bank or fully charged.The product comes with a 12-month warranty, which should be sufficient time for anyone to use this product about once a week and see if theres any unexpected issues that may arise to report it and get the power bank replaced or fixed.Now in looking at the power bankI chose the Orange and Black color combination for this product because Ive had so many of my electronic products be a black or gray solid color that I wasnt something that could stand out and look fairly attractive.  This model does come in a Black and Gray colored combination, but I didnt opt in for that one.With the Black and Orange combination, the top and bottom of the power bank is in black while the mid layer lining is in orange, which includes that being the color surrounding the power button and USB ports.The top of the power bank has the EasyAcc logo engraved and the 4 dotted LEDS are in the opposite corner.Below the LED area is the power button ON/OFF on the side of the power bank.  You can press it on/off with a single press or double press to turn on or off the LED flashlight.On the opposite side of the power button are the 2 USB ports for charging, which is labeled as IN.  They use Micro USB connectors as inputs, so you can use the two provided by EasyAcc in the package, which are short in length for packaging and convenience, or you can get your own 3 to 10 feet micro USB cables and charge the power bank that way.There are 4 USB ports and the flashlight lens on the narrower side.  The output ports are labeled as SMART.  I wouldve liked to see the LED flashlight lens be dipped in more than it currently is by design.  That way, if you drop the power bank and it lands on the floor on that side, it doesnt end up chipping or cracking the lens.  The way it looks like now, I can glaze my finger over the surface of the power bank and hit the bulge of the lens.  I wouldve liked to see the lens be more protective by dipping it into the grove more by about  of an inch.  I offer that as a suggestion for improvement.If you were to lose the users manual, the bottom of the power bank has some etching of the technical specs for the power bank which may come in handy one day.The power bank can stand on any of its side that you put it in, but in this case, since the power bank is fairly heavy and is rectangular shaped, it would make since for it to lie flat down on the fat sides rather than have it stand on the thin sides.The overall look of the power bank under lighting has a slight shine to it under the reflection of the light.  It has a nice smooth feeling, not necessarily a slick polished feeling, but it is smooth and feels nice.  You can get a little friction on it with rubbing your thumb and fingers on it back and forth while holding it in one hand.  Because of how wide the power bank is, I cant clench my fingers together to create a closed grip, but the grip side to side is good enough to hold in your hand and walk around with you for a minimal amount of time.  It stands out quite nicely on my desktop to quickly identify it over my other mobile accessories, which is a plus.USAGE:My power bank unit came fully charged, so I tested it under a full load by plugging in a variety of mobile accessories.  In my photos, youll see that I plugged in two Bluetooth speakers, a selfie stick, and a Bluetooth headphone.  Immediately when I plugged them in, they started to charge and I could tell with the charge light.  I left them there while heading out for a couple of hours and when I came back, they were all fully charged and the lights were all turned off.  I tested the charged products and they were good to go.  The power bank still had 4 LED dotted lights on it due to these devices having little battery capacities compared to an iPhone or iPad, which would drain it more.  But overall testing showed that all 4 ports were functioning normally as expected and charging sufficiently.The next thing that I did was try the LED flashlight.  I turned off the lights in my area to see the deep contrast in the lighting from a dark place.  I double pressed the power button and turned on the LED light.  Id have to say that my first impressions were that this is a good lighting source when needed for looking around the house.  The light from far away hitting the wall about 20 feet from my spot showed the light was dim but helped me visibly identify surroundings and objects about 10 feet in diameter.  On the other hand, I could bring it to hone in on something just within 6 inches from the source that I wanted to focus on and the light is bright as an ordinary standalone flashlight.  Its pretty impressive for a power bank.  Ive used power banks from other brands that have had LED flashlights built into them and theyre nowhere near as strong or useful as this EasyAcc model.  Now, I wouldnt use this as a primary flashlight as there are better ones out there, but for a convenient access to a source of lighting for emergency situations, this products flashlight will do.IN SUMMARY:PROS:1) Meets the need for a large family2) High battery capacity can charge a tablet to full with room to spare for charging smartphones3) Useful built in flashlight that can provide adequate lighting for emergency situations4) Shorter charging rate compared to other brandsCONS:1) Flashlight lens curves out too close to the surface of the side of the power bank, making it likely to absorb some impact damage if dropped from a tall height and landing on different hard surfaces.SUGGESTIONS:1) Provide a travel carrying pouch for this power bank2) Dip the flashlight lens further by about a quarter of an inch to provide the curvature of the lens to have greater protection from drop testing impact when landing on that side with the ground3) Add a digital display of battery remaining rather than using LED dot indicatorsUSER SCENARIOS:This product would be useful for people who:1) Live with a family or roommates2) Plan to go on a road trip or outdoor trip with friends or family3) Own power hungry devices such as a tablet4) Have many different mobile products that are USB based for charging5) Dont have available access to wall outlet sockets or a power stripOverall, this is a major improvement in the power banks category for EasyAcc, a company of which I did not like originally when I first tried their 6400mAh model.  There have been much better improvements since then in their product line of power banks and chargers.  This one easily beats out at least two other brands of power banks that Ive tried of near the same range of battery capacity.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLZFFURTCY9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01422TC14#wasThisHelpful","RFLZFFURTCY9B","A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PPBVJ2QZBOHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
