"Based on content alone, I would have considered three stars; however, I have a hard time accepting *writing* advice from a book so badly written.  I realize Mr. Vogler is a story analyst, not a writer.  Still, the style here is atrocious, often to the point of distraction.As he describes various films, he frequently jumbles his characters and his actors, creating a rambling, grammatically nightmarish style: ""Recurring mentors include 'The Chief' on 'Get Smart', Will Geer and Ellen Corby as the grandparents on 'The Waltons', Alfred in 'Batman', James Earl Jones' CIA official in Patriot Games and The Hunt for Red October, etc.""  (For the record, I typed this sentence exactly as it appears in the book, other than my inability to italicize the Jack Ryan titles.  Yes, those commas are found outside the quotation marks; yes, Mr. Jones's name is made plural possessive.)  This utter disregard for parallelism can be found on nearly every page.  In addition, Mr. Vogler refers to some characters only by their names (""In the film The Last of the Mohicans, Major Duncan Hayward is the rival of hero Nathaniel Poe...""); he refers to still others as only the names of the actors (""James Stewart forces Kim Novak to change her hair and clothing ..."").  I was left with the feeling of a first draft, as if Mr. Vogler hadn't yet looked up the names he couldn't recall.If you can overlook these stylistic eyesores (obviously, I have a difficult time doing so), you might find something useful in these pages.  Or you might not.  As demonstrated by the variety of reviews, this book's usefulness really depends on the reader.Do you have an intermediate grasp of mythology and archetypes?  You'll be bored by this.  Have you read Joseph Campbell's THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES?  You'll probably wonder why anyone bothered to publish this, because Mr. Vogler quotes and paraphrases Mr. Campbell to a worshipful degree.  Do you write with characters in your mind first, and let them ""tell you what to do"" in terms of plot?  You'll want to approach this book as a road you can wander from, not a roller coaster track you must stick to or die.  Do you have some fully developed characters you'd love to explore, but struggle with plot?  This book (as well as any study of archetypes) can help you find some signposts to guide your way.  Are you entirely unschooled in archetypes and mythology but would like to learn?  This book isn't the best starting place available, but I doubt it's the worst.Before you start reading, examine your writing goals and your knowledge of archetypes to decide if this one is worthwhile for you.  (Oh, and examine yourself for grammatical-OCD tendencies to decide if you can endure it.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BYWM4TMCDT5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193290736X#wasThisHelpful","R3BYWM4TMCDT5Q","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes place over twenty-four hours, detailing the interpersonal fallout after a poor black woman called Tennessee is hit by a car while pushing a young man out of its path. The young man is Tip Doyle, the adopted black son of Boston's white former mayor. If my mention of race seems a bit forced, well, I'm only reflecting the book. This relatively short novel is jammed with so many Big Theme Messages that the characters come across as mouthpieces for the writer rather than real people, and the plot turns out to be a mere megaphone for said mouthpieces.When I finish reading a book, I love to feel a lingering presence of the people the author has created. What lingers after this book is instead a knowledge that Ms. Patchett has Something To Say about race, religion, politics, class. Most of this something is steeped in political correctness, to the point that she utilizes the very stereotypes she seems to find offensive. On top of this, one-scene characters in this novel have no personality, but their race is always noted. Is this the author's idea of taking on racism--paying obsessive attention to race?The writing style is mostly pleasing, the sentence construction easy to enjoy. The scenes, however, could be tighter; pacing is mired by interior monologue. And the characters aren't the only ones with never-ending Deep Thoughts. There were also times I wanted to muzzle the narrator. For example, on p. 93,94:>> ""Awake?"" Teddy said. They had been saying it to each other all their lives, sleeping in their opposite beds or, in this case, opposite couches. It meant, Are you there, are you listening to me, will you talk to me now? <<Yes, asking if one is awake implies that one wants to talk. What reader needs to be told this? And in this book, the spelling out of subtext is worse than irritating or insulting. Something about it tries to be wise, as if everything these characters say must somehow further what the writer has to say. Ultimately, this straining for profundity only marginalizes the characters, a fatal flaw for a character novel.At the end of this book, I felt as though Ms. Patchett did not start her work with Doyle, Tip, Teddy, Sullivan, or Kenya. I felt she started with a formula: ""Rich white father, white, wayward son and black, less wayward sons meet poor black mother and poor-but-amazingly-gifted black daughter.""As F. Scott Fitzgerald said so perfectly: ""Begin with an individual and you find that you have created a type; begin with a type and you find that you have created--nothing.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YU8D1ZFZZZLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061340634#wasThisHelpful","R1YU8D1ZFZZZLY","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this book contained only one fatal flaw, I could try to dredge up reasons to give it at least one more star; but it contains more than one.  Combined, they make me hope this book doesn't become well-known in middle school classrooms.First is an issue several reviewers have already highlighted: the sermon-not-story presentation.  These characters are cut from cardboard and propped up by the moral of their story, so much so that I would never use this book in a literature class purely because of the didactic spoonfeeding.  Good young adult literature presents its themes to the reader as a buried treasure to unearth, not as a suffocating blanket or a sledgehammer.Second, I take issue with the message itself: namely, ""tolerance covers all.""  The writers take this politically correct concept and dash far and wide with it.The plot takes off (actually, the plot never leaves the runway, but that's my third issue) when a student is arrested and accused of terrorist involvement.  ""He might be guilty,"" Amazon's product description says.  ""Or is he singled out because of his race?""  An excellent question that remains a question.  Haroon, the Muslim character, doesn't care if his fellow student is guilty or not.  By extension, since he is the most lauded character in the book, the writers don't care, either.  The plot meanders away from the jailed student until he's only one example of ""racial conflict.""  But doesn't every thinking reader want to know--was this boy planning to blow up his school, or not?  If he wasn't, the police will have a lawsuit on their hands.  If he was, shouldn't the intention to murder another human being, whatever his race, be addressed?  It isn't.In addition, the resolution (if one can call it that) is morally ambiguous at best.  Why is it noble for Haroon to let his classmates get away with vandalism?  Why is it noble for Jay to pretend he wasn't party to the crime?  Haroon says that honesty and justice would only create ""more anger, more hatred, more problems.""  What kind of reasoning is this?  Does he really believe the racists will be less racist if they get away with racism?  Do the writers?  This isn't the only instance of skewed logic.  More than once, the authors write off moral non sequiturs or double standards by having a ""good"" character say to a ""bad"" character, ""You just don't understand.""  Well, I don't, either.Finally, message aside, the book simply isn't engaging on any level whatsoever.  The characters are one-dimensional (Haroon may qualify as 2-D, if we're being generous).  I can say with certainty that neither of these writers is a Christian or a Muslim.  Both characters feel like products of shallow research, not like children of the writers' experience.  The plot plods along, mostly via bland or contrived dialogue.  The final scene is cliched and flat.Overall, from sermonizing to disturbing morality to lack of entertainment value, I can't find a shred to recommend in this story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTJJJF499AHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=155455036X#wasThisHelpful","R1LTJJJF499AHQ","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the Western myth too much to like this film, which does injustice to the savvy of Western characters in general, and to the Code that drives every classic Western. In these things, it becomes a pseudo-Western; if it *does* revive the Western genre, I hope its successors don't commit its same atrocities.The film is an exercise in Implausible Plotting. Cowboys and lawmen of the Old West escort a Notorious Outlaw across the wilderness and leave his hands cuffed in front of him, even after he kills two of the escort party in ways he never could have done had they just bothered to tie him up. Said cowboys and lawmen send a decoy ""outlaw"" in a stagecoach to throw the bad guys off the trail of the escort, and they just happen to lock the unfortunate decoy in the stage *for real* without giving him a key, so he can burn to death when the gang catches up and discovers his identity.  Said cowboys and lawmen, armed and holding the higher ground, look out a hotel window to engage in conversation with the Notorious Outlaw's psychotically murderous gang, and then allow them to ride away unaccosted after several death threats, so the carnage can come later. What sane person would behave as these characters do? They act stupidly so dramatic tension can last longer.Yes, the scenery is lovely. Yes, the acting is pretty much flawless, but who would have expected less from Crowe and Bale? The character actions and the conclusion are the problem here. After seeing this film, my 18-year-old brother remarked, ""Well, if that was reality, I'd definitely wanna be on the side of the bad guys ... all the good guys were either stupid or wimpy."" That is not the Western myth; that is the antithesis of the Western myth.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOMPU955HX8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XR9L50#wasThisHelpful","ROOMPU955HX8G","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a character reader first, and the Christian books I've checked out lately tend to substitute flesh and blood and feelings for sermonizing dialogue and overall sanitation. I'm not saying Christian books should emulate secular ones in terms of profanity, comedic or sadistic violence, or explicit sex. I am saying Christian characters should not find perfect peace with everything ten pages from the end of the book. They should make big mistakes and possess real flaws. Those who've had it rough shouldn't all be victims on the path to 10-pages-from-the-end forgiveness. In reality, Christians know life is gritty at times. Even those ready to ""give an answer for the hope that is within"" us sometimes struggle with those answers. Our fellows in fiction ought to struggle, too.Kristen Heitzmann understands this and writes this. Brilliantly.Jade's moral dilemmas relating to her career are refreshingly real, and no quickie solution is offered. Her determination and vulnerability as she regains her memories are well-portrayed. Cameron is an even deeper character--hiding a broken heart behind gruff suspicion, terrified of the world's propensity to steal what he loves, and continuing to believe in God despite it all, just no longer willing to trust Him.When summed up that way, neither of these characters sounds original, but they are. Jade's version of strength is willingness to trek into the Hawaiian wild by herself before asking a man who doesn't believe her for help. Cameron's version of heavenward fist-shaking is to pit his surfboard against the sea and beat it one wave at a time. What makes these characters work? A familiar core demonstrated by original quirks--quirks that at times actually drive the plot, rather than being submerged in it.In addition, Heitzmann's prose is a step above, treating us to interesting similes and specific verbs. A pitiless editor could have slimmed the book down a bit, but on the whole, I loved the writing here. I also loved the vivid Hawaiian setting, and there was nothing more fun than Cameron breaking into pidgin.Of course, expect the main characters to end up together. But Heitzmann's approach is far from syrupy, honest instead. The attraction between Jade and Cameron is rooted in their souls, not their bodies, yet this author acknowledges the physical desires of men and women. There are realistic reasons for them to be together but also realistic obstacles to keep them apart.All in all, highly recommended. If I can find more Christian fiction like this, maybe I'll come home to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGRBDBSJC2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764228293#wasThisHelpful","R2BGRBDBSJC2G","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... if we would ever get another Without a Trace season in region 1.  And this season contains some fascinating cases: a bus of kids abudcted, a satire-laden fake kidnapping, a murderous twin (but who knows which one?), and many more.  We're also treated to some great character moments.  Martin loses control and ends up shooting a suspect; Vivian makes an irreversible choice to lie to protect both their careers, and both have to deal with the consequences in later episodes.  Samantha is forced into counseling after being shot in the Season One finale; she says she's fine, but we know she isn't.  Danny has to choose whether to testify on his brother's behalf, or abandon him the way he once abandoned Danny.  An Alzheimer's diagnosis forces Jack to re-evaluate the strained relationship with his father (wonderfully played by Martin Landau), and a certain case causes him to relive his painful adolescence with an emotionally unstable mother.Overall, this season continues the watchability and excellent writing begun by Season One.For the curious, here is the episode list, first aired 09/25/03-05/20/04.The BusRevelationsConfidenceProdigyCopycatOur Sons And DaughtersA Tree FallsTrip BoxMoving OnComing HomeExposureHawks And HandsawsLife RulesThe LineWannabeRisenGung HoLegacyDoppelgangerShadowsTwo FamiliesThe SeasonLost And FoundBait","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A5VU49MM84WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LE178Y#wasThisHelpful","R3A5VU49MM84WZ","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the last season, we see more of the Carters and Wilders than the Ingallses.  You have to wonder why the writers did this; certainly there was a behind-the-scenes reason.  For some viewers, much of the show's charm is missing along with the Ingalls family, but it remains classic, family friendly TV with some truly great moments.  Nellie comes home to envious fireworks from Nancy (her face as she asks Caroline, ""Was I ever that bad?"" is priceless).  The Younger brothers are spoofed with a cheesy humor that is lost on children but makes the episode classic for probably many adults.  Jason Carter befriends a dying lady in maybe the best episode of the season.  Laura pens her first draft of Little House in the Big Woods, wins a writing contest, and concedes the prize when she realizes the publishers intend to change her story.  Isaiah Edwards is perhaps the most poignant character of this season, as he cares for and defends a circus ""wild boy"" (who later leaves town to live with his father) and falls in love only to decide that he's an ""old man"" and the girl's life will be better without him.Episode List, first aired September 1982-March 1983Times Are Changing (parts 1&2)Welcome To OlesonvilleRageLittle LouThe Wild Boy (parts 1&2)The Return of NellieThe Empire BuildersLoveAlden's DilemmaMarvin's GardenSins of the FathersThe Older BrothersOnce Upon a TimeHome Again (2-hour episode)A Child With No NameThe Last SummerFor the Love of BlancheMay I Have This DanceHello and Goodbye","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYUVBPYS6Q6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AA4KQ0#wasThisHelpful","RHYUVBPYS6Q6L","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess, if you pay under [dollar amount] for a DVD, you can't really complain. Unfortunately, all of Roy's movies will probably be shuffled off to DVD with just as little care. The sound crackles sometimes, and some of Dale's delightful solos are a bit distorted; the picture is fuzzier sometimes than others (even ""jumps"" once, as though it were a tape), and you have to turn the volume up pretty high compared to typical DVD.As for the movie itself, YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS is above average Roy Rogers fare. Included are the classic framed man with a beautiful daughter (Dale, of course), Roy's undercover identity as insurance agent, a stunt with Trigger to save a boy in a runaway wagon, a multi-fisted fight featuring the Sons of the Pioneers (minus Pat Brady, since this is 1944), the classic shot of black ""blood"" dripping through two ceiling boards to give away the winged fugitive (at a rate that says he must have hit an artery and needs a transfusion!), and lots more great nostalgia inducers.One number by the Sons of the Pioneers, ""Timber,"" is musically even better than usual. It's also interesting to see Dale Evans before that ""Queen of the West"" persona, which she was originally so against, was firmly established; you'll hear her sing and see her pout those pretty lips, but she won't be riding a horse. (This is partially due, of course, to the fact that much of this setting has to do with riverboats instead of ranches.) Even her hair is different than the typical ""Cowgirl Dale"" look that fans take for granted.All in all, if you want to see Roy and Dale in restored glory, don't bother with the Alpha Video releases.

"I found this book to be engaging almost from the beginning; it is meticulously researched, well organized, logical, yet passionate in its defense of an oppressed language minority.One could certainly argue that Mr. Lane short-changes his opponents by not really addressing their arguments on the benefits of mainstreaming Deaf children, but the purpose of this book is not to present both sides of the issues; the purpose is to demonstrate the oppression of the Deaf language and therefore their culture. It provides strong evidence that the Deaf child is a minority, not an invalid, and that the tendency of hearing parents to see mainstreaming as the only option is a dangerous mistake.This is deep reading and scholarly writing, at times to the point of near inaccessibility to a mainstream audience.  However, it is convincing and eye-opening if one is willing to put the effort into reading it.Note: the reader from New Jersey seems to have missed the point of this book. By condemning Mr. Lane as refusing to ""recognize that different lifestyles are better for different people,"" he fails to see that Mr. Lane defends the Deaf as a different lifestyle that deserves to be recognized. This book is not saying that no Deaf (especially late-deafened adults) should try to learn lip-reading or consider cochlear implants. It is simply saying that those Deaf who wish to take part in Deaf culture, who wish to be Deaf, should be given that option as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK41LV06XW2M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581210094#wasThisHelpful","RK41LV06XW2M1","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Perhaps the brightest star of this recording, however, especially for us twenty-year fans, is the bonus track: a live, unplugged version of the classic ""We Are the Reason.""The musical genius, passion, and uncompromising lyrics are as alive and well here as they were for 1981's COUNT THE COST.

"As a twelve-year-old first time Dwarf Rabbit owner, I read this book countless times and reveled in the vivid color photography.  Almost every color of rabbit imaginable is pictured within these pages, and almost every breed is described in a paragraph of its own.  Of course, at only 64 pages, this is hardly the exhaustive guide to owning a dwarf rabbit; it's not the book you want if you're going to get serious about showing and breeding (though there is a chapter on breeding toward the end of the book).  The contents also include chapters on ""Considerations before Buying,"" ""Selection,"" ""Acclimation,"" ""Feeding, ""Care,"" ""Behavior,"" and ""Health,"" among other topics.  Overall, this is the perfect book to guide an amateur bunny keeper of any age who wants the basics (and some nice pictures).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOQO5MSM214N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0866225374#wasThisHelpful","R1NOQO5MSM214N","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted this book to be great. The fact that a movie like this one, with such scope and depth and beauty and struggle, was novelized in less than 250 pages, should have been a serious clue to me that I was wanting too much. This book is little more than a transcript; it is exactly, scene for scene, the movie (including the deleted scenes).The writer fails to keep the reader in second-century Rome because 21st-century American phraseology continually creeps into his descriptions: ""whipped to a frenzy,"" ""cheering his head off,"" etc. Even some of the dialogue has been ""updated"" for today's audience, including some of the most memorable movie lines: ""The Emperor has been slain"" becomes ""The Emperor was murdered,"" and ""Is this not why you are here?"" is reduced to ""Is this not why you came?""  Converting ""we shall"" to ""we'll"" is simply insulting to the reader who loves this movie's sense of setting. Besides (and more importantly than) this, Mr. Gram writes with a choppy style that remains in third person objective for most of the story, rarely peeking into characters' minds and, therefore, never finding their hearts.The second star I gave the book is for Maximus, because even when reduced to this level of shallowness, I still love him. The third star is for the first several chapters, which give sufficient detail of the opening battle sequence and even seem to promise a bit of character depth. Unfortunately, this promise dies with Marcus Aurelius. The characters of this movie deserve a book that is rich both in historical detail and in emotional depth, but instead they got this, an ultra-quick read that reveals absolutely nothing new.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29QRETJ3WSVLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451409477#wasThisHelpful","R29QRETJ3WSVLD","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This double feature's first episode finds Albert employed by a guest character we've never heard from before (and never will again): Mr. Singerman, a Jewish coffin maker.  ""The Craftsman"" becomes typical Little House fare as Albert must stand against the prejudice of the Larrabee boys, who rough him up and call him a ""Jew lover,"" and as Laura must confront her unwillingness to get involved.  Wise Mr. Singerman teaches Albert some important lessons about work ethic and judging others, and any fan of the show expects the somewhat melodramatic ending.  This episode features Don ""Red"" Barry as the ultra-bigoted Larrabee, and is largely watchable for one of the only full laughs ever heard from Nels Oleson in the history of the show.The second episode has more to recommend it than the first.  ""The Christmas They Never Forgot"" is a beautiful holiday show that finds our favorite characters snowbound in the Ingalls home on Christmas Eve, swapping stories of their favorite childhood Christmases.  Caroline shares her memories of a rainy holiday with a stepfather she didn't want; Almanzo remembers the year Santa Claus gave his brother Royal no presents; and those who have seen the premiere episode will recall, along with Laura, the Ingalls family's first Christmas in Kansas.  But perhaps the dearest Christmas memory is Hester Sue's, as she recounts a year that she was convinced Santa Claus had ""a white beard and a white face,"" and that black children never got gifts from him.  Her father kept her faith alive with a sweet deception that she would not discover for many years later.This Little House double feature earns an average of four stars-three for ""The Craftsman,"" five for ""Christmas They Never Forgot.""  How the Powers That Be choose which episodes to restore to DVD remains a mystery to me, but at least one of these is a true classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R254O0R5WRZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B1Y1#wasThisHelpful","R3R254O0R5WRZZ","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the book that youth groups should mass order. Peretti recounts his own childhood growing up as a victim of both cystic hygroma (causing stunted growth and a speech impediment, among other problems) and bullying. He shares with painful detail how constant bullying affected his self-image (""I thought I was a monster"") and how the school system typically does little or nothing to protect the weak.Even further, he illustrates his view of the world as governed by a higher system of rules, explaining why ""might makes right"" is both a dangerous and a flawed philosophy. Peretti even confesses his own faults as an occasional bully, his failures to stick up for those weaker than himself. This is a quick read that will challenge adults to a new awareness of the bullying problem and will benefit every teen/pre-teen reader, whether he is a bully, a victim, or someone caught in the middle who doesn't know how to change ""the way things are.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8B92C8QCS61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=084994337X#wasThisHelpful","R3T8B92C8QCS61","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone already familiar with Nancy Rue's writing knows that her skill with imagery, characters, and dialogue is second to few, and this book is no exception. It is engaging from the first chapter and never ceases to be so. And as always, Rue's characters (especially the sardonic heroine) drive a unique plot in which real life events become captivating.As for the theme of ""intellectual Christianity,"" the two-star review below seems to expect a single author to explore every facet of faith, science, and religious diversity within a single, less-than-300-page novel. An unrealistic expectation, at best. Every religious argument ever concocted by humanity cannot be explored and refuted in a work of fiction that also contains a decent plot and round characters. This novel simply intends to cause Christians and non-Christians alike to examine faith as more than just blind belief.The main character, Jill, confronts her own beliefs regarding the existence God and the soul, comparing them with the convictions of a Christian man she is becoming more and more attracted to, despite what she deems his ""irrational"" faith. Of course, it is a Christian novel, so Jill's must be a ""conversion story."" However, this is not a typical Christian formula novel. The people within these pages make us care, and the painful twists of Jill's mother's illness are not always predictable. It is the journey, not the destination, that makes this book a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3WEKX1IQLDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576738264#wasThisHelpful","R3G3WEKX1IQLDD","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This release regains some of the grit that characterized Mr. Moore's last recording with the Distance (THREADS), the grit that he shelved in favor of a more folkish sound for his solo debut. Split nearly fifty-fifty between rock-to-mid-tempo tunes and ballads, the CD overall is a musical bridge between the self-titled solo album and the Distance days. Does this herald a return to rock and a phasing out of folk? I, for one, don't really care--I'll be a fan no matter which direction Mr. Moore takes his music.My concern with this release lies not in the music, but in the lyrics. The track list hints that even Geoff Moore has embraced song titles that have become Christian cliches (""All I Want,"" ""Come As You Are""). Considering his past creativity as a songwriter (""Home Run,"" ""Evolution, Redefined,"" ""String around My Finger,"" I could use the rest of my 1000-word limit listing songs!), we can only hope he isn't giving up that creative edge. If songs like ""The Artist"" are any indication, he isn't. What a unique look at God as Creator, a strong subject that Mr. Moore returns to again and again, always with great results.This CD is certainly only a taste of the greatness to come, as long as Geoff Moore steers clear of cliched Christianity. Overall, despite some reliance on the trite, both music and lyrics work well together. This is a worthy release from a talented veteran of Christian music who never ceases to be both pleasing and thought-provoking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUW2GGZG833E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000636BX#wasThisHelpful","RUW2GGZG833E5","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! This collection doesn't contain a single ""filler"" track, including songs from her latest release, True North (""Run to You"") and also some 80's classics (""We Bow Down,"" ""We Will Glorify""). Time only improves Twila's music, yet it's a pleasure to hear some of these old songs again! The three new tracks are all winners, showcasing Twila's newly developed vocal style. ""God of Miracles"" gives her voice a more lusty sound than she's ever achieved before. If these songs are a foreshadowing of future efforts, her fans will not be disappointed; she embraces a fresh, mature pop sound that suits her quite well. Overall, the variety here is simply perfect, with energetic tracks (""Not Afraid Anymore,"" ""Destiny"") as well as the beautiful ballads that have become her signature songs (""How Beautiful,"" ""The Time Is Now"").

"Of course, this is the timeless episode in which Laura and Almanzo are finally married. In addition to the final wedding scene, we also get some conflict between the would-be couple as Almanzo loses his first crop but stubbornly refuses to let Laura get a teaching job. (Watching the two insist that ""I didn't do anything wrong"" is a lot of fun.) Plus we have a snippet of subplot involving the news that Percival and Nellie are going to have their first baby (Harriet's misinterpretation of Nellie's having ""six months at the most"" is absolutely classic!). However, the whole show is quietly but earnestly stolen by Lucy Lee Flippin's portrayal of Eliza Jane Wilder, as she falls in love-for the first time-with a man who feels nothing in return. Probably no other non-regular ever turned in a performance quite so touching, or so convincing. Overall, owning ""Laura Ingalls Wilder"" is simply a must for any fan of the show. I only wish its prequel, ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not,"" were also available!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWVJWHFBKI5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B1XZ#wasThisHelpful","R1CWVJWHFBKI5Q","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this classic two-hour episode, the Ingalls family eagerly awaits the arrival of a new addition! All is bliss (despite Harriet Oleson's ability to turn even a new baby into an opportunity to insult Caroline) until Dr. Baker notices that Charles Ingalls Junior, the long-awaited son, is not gaining weight. Ma asks the girls to say a special prayer for their brother, but a jealous Laura refuses. The baby's condition worsens and he eventually dies, leaving Laura with overwhelming feelings of guilt for her ""mean thoughts."" Convinced that she can make it right by giving her life to God in exchange for the infant's, Laura runs away to the mountains. As Charles and Isaiah Edwards search frantically for Laura, a mysterious old man named Jonathan (Ernest Borgnine) cares for her. The finale is heart-warming, if predictable, and vaults ""The Lord is My Shepherd"" to the rank of Classic Little House.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QWD7HO80MUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B1XX#wasThisHelpful","R6QWD7HO80MUY","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, many classic episodes that might have been restored to DVD were abandoned in favor of this single episode featuring stars Johnny and June Carter Cash. ""The Collection"" clearly made it to DVD on star power alone, since the story isn't a vital one to the _Little House_ bigger picture. Reverend Alden becomes ill after encountering a settlement ravaged by prairie fire and is found by Caleb Hodgekiss (Cash) and his wife. Alden explains that he is from Walnut Grove and is on his way there to collect donations for the folks at the settlement, Graves Corner, who have lost everything they have. Considering himself and his wife more needy than anyone in Graves Corner, Hodgekiss goes to Walnut Grove on an ""errand of mercy"" to collect the items himself, fully intending to flee with his wife and the collection before anyone suspects him. I was surprised to find that Cash actually did a halfway decent job of showing his character's evolution from determined con man to uncertain, softening guy-in-need. The ending is predictable as one would expect from this show, but not altogether lame. Overall, not one I would have personally chosen to promote to DVD immortality, but definitely a watchable hour of _Little House on the Prairie._","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QTITY2H1FVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B1XY#wasThisHelpful","R6QTITY2H1FVP","A2ZS59R1GNT1JB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZS59R1GNT1JB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up watching the reruns of Little House on the Prairie every day when I got home from kindergarten. My mom taped them, so my family owns 170 of the 200 episodes, from Episode 1, ""Harvest of Friends,"" to the final episode, ""Hello and Goodbye."" Somehow, however, we missed taping ""Premiere,"" so when I bought this DVD, I had never seen it. Well, I was a bit disappointed that in two hours the Ingalls family never reaches Walnut Grove (I was looking forward to seeing introductions of our favorite characters!), but I'm still very glad to own this gem. I know from experience that VHS tapes degrade with time and many viewings, but DVD will last forever. The pilot introduces Mr. Edwards (with a much thinner beard!) as well as the Ingalls family and includes some memorable moments between Pa and Laura. Probably the best scene of all is the classic ""Errand for Santa,"" featuring a snow-caked Victor French who braves a blizzard to get his Christmas gifts to their recipients on time.

"I understand completely why kids assigned this reading for school did not enjoy it. Though told through a young boy's eyes, the writing style is mature and uses many descriptive paragraphs. Though sometimes impatient with description, I loved the story all the more for the details, but some pre-high-school kids will become bored.It's true that Bob's introspection is unusually discerning for his age. However, some remarks indicate that he could be writing this at a later time in his life, looking back on what happened with a wiser perspective. Either way, the author's depth of observation from an unlikely character can be forgiven as he elicits reader sympathy and understanding. Bob's view of his world may not always be reliable (especially when referring to his hero as ""invincible""), but he is always endearing. Reading about Bob's naïve, honest idolization of the mysterious gunman, I wanted Shane to stay, too. And looking beyond Bob's innocent perspective, the mature reader sees things that Bob does not, understanding his parents and Shane even better than he does.This work of art manages to stay short (120 pp.) without losing the substance and quality of much longer novels. Any shorter, and something would be missing. Any longer, and the added words or events would be unnecessary, lessening the ""punch"" that perfect length gives this tale.

"Can you say MIND BLOWN !! Did it really just end like that , I was so enjoying Aria and Mika. I had read Degrade and knew by the end that I had to have Aria's story. I mean she was so unique , like no other chick I have read before. The stories crossed over and some we already got from Degrade yet now we get in Aria's POV so although similar definitely not the same. I enjoyed seeing Bex and Zeke again , loved Aria's POV of her and Zeke's friendship !! I would say the picture was complete now but yet I still cannot believe some of the stuff going on with these business ventures and characters. Aria takes this job out of nowhere and surprise surprise she is the best they have ever seen. Yet this is no normal job and although it is wrong on most accounts you can't help but feel the heat and the power of what Aria does. Mika comes along out of nowhere all stalkerish and starts changing things up. He may have been watching Aria but he obviously hasn't followed the fact that she doesn't give in to anyone. It is funny to watch him try but then I was also a bit broken up for him and then again for her when a certain someone planted herself in their path. These were the times that my mind was screwed. Like no wait don't do that , ughh she did that and now we will suffer LOL. There were some twists and turns , a few added characters that I enjoyed and one or two that I hated !! All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the crazy ride Aria has taken us on and I honestly love her , despite her flaws and the things she has done I just love her.

"OMG this cannot end that way , there has to be more - RIGHT ?? I seriously don't know BUT I am banking on there being more. I am 5 starring this due to the OH CRAP action going on. I knew this story was going to go along with what we read about Bronson and Callie , that never matters to me since we are getting new POV's and obviously we could tell Bianka and Dakota had their own story , their own secrets and would have their own struggles to get over. Hard review to write due to the spoiler aspect but I shall try to get my point across, my point being you NEED to READ this story , both stories and really anything by this author she has always impressed me and captured me with her stories.The way this story starts just makes me sick , OMG what did Dakota find out and what the heck is he doing. I was so glad that we went back to their beginning after that little prologue. I was crushed already and anticipating this storm of trouble. Dakota and Bianca had to hide their relationship from Bronson , mainly because Bianca is the little sister , forbidden romance type stuff !! I loved their flirty and fun banter , I enjoyed seeing the 4 of them together and was heartbroken for Callie all over again. Dakota and Bianca find their way and it seems they will have happiness yet when they separate for college and Dakota realizes the impact his job could have on their relationship he makes some harsh decisions leaving Bianca heartbroken and alone. For years she deals with the 3 of them near each other and being happy while she is alone and suffering. Once devastation hits Bianca and Bronson's family Dakota feels in the clear to mend things with his girl yet one work folder changes his course of action. It was painful to read the rest. So much time and no light at the end of their tunnel. I can't imagine they have gone through all this pain and struggle to end up on their own ?? I mean there has to be a way right ??

He wore his heart on his sleeve , he played the big brother and protector role so well , he was a great uncle and OMG can you say HOT AS SIN ALPHA  !! I wanted Boomer's book , I wanted to know what ended up going down with him and Rayce , I wanted to get his side of the story of his family and their past BUT I didn't think he would end up being my favorite !! He was moody and OLD and I just assumed he would be a buzz kill !! Boy was I wrong !! He is everything and then some.Boomer is the oldest Steele sibling and the one who took on playing protector for his siblings and their parents house after they lost them that horrible night. Boomer carries much guilt from being the driver , he holds it in and carries on his business while everyone around him settles down and starts families. He has come to the realization that he wants all that and more and he wants it with this little firecracker Rayce !! A hot as sin chick , mechanic for Josh and dirt bike racer !! This book coincides with some of what we have already read and also comes before some of the CBB boys books yet it didn't bother me at all because I was so in tune with Boomer that I didn't even realize much else. While Boomer's issues are in the past Rayce has issues in the present with her father who despite his wrongdoings she insists on protecting. Boomer tries and tries to make Rayce his , to help her , to protect her and to give her everything she deserves and desires but of course it is never easy. Their journey is a whirlwind but HOT DARN it is a SUPER HOT SUPER SWEET SUPER AMAZING journey. I was drooling over their intimacy , I was blushing and fanning myself and wow just speechless. Their chemistry was above the charts hot and I re-read quite a few scenes LOL.So I could blabber on and on about how much I loved this story , the twists and turns , the pieces to the puzzle , there was a couple of BIG things happening here.

Trust me she is so worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUOJMQN7I7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150GZUA8#wasThisHelpful","R1QUOJMQN7I7F","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard review to write. I enjoyed the writing , the story and the unique setup of the whole plot, I couldn't put the book down and loved the angst and drama and heartache as I flew through the pages YET when I went to write my 5 star review I started to wonder if it had to go that way or if some things could have happened differently to avoid some of the suffering ?? So I took a few days and realized I am the type of reviewer that gives my rating very easily , normally right away and therefore I should always go with my first thoughts. I can still pick out things that may annoy me or confuse me but that may not lessen my rating because in the end I felt all the feels of a 5 star read for me and I enjoyed it and am putting enough thought into it which means the author did their job of making their work stick with me and at times hold my thoughts hostage !! So thank you Penelope because you really screwed with my mind not only while I was reading but for days after i finished !!WOW what perfect title for this book !! I mean the second we meet Sevin he is sinning in a BAD way !! During Sunday service with the Pastor's wife , way to go Sevin !! According to Sevin's story, his mom died and once his father remarried his new wife had them going to church and living the Christian life. Sevin was very much a free spirit like his mother so all the rules made for a hard childhood and a life of sin. Now after losing his father Sevin is given an opportunity that to many may seem old school yet to his father and their family friends it is the simple way of life. I honestly felt like I was in an episode of the Duggars or that scene in Twilight Eclipse when Edward was proposing to Bella telling her all about courting her and taking chaperoned strolls and drinking iced tea on the porch !! At this point Sevin will do anything to get away from his stepmother and out of the town he lived in. So he accepts and begins to court Elle over the phone while preparing to move to her families home and train to one day take over their family business as the son in law. Ironically during the drive in Sevin meets up with an amazing girl who ends up being none other than Elle's older sister. Evangeline is a free spirit just like Sevin and although she lives the Christian life as her family requires she finds ways to escape their rules and attempt to live a life that suits her. Never did the two imagine that their hopes and dreams were so in tune. Never did they imagine that they would sin the way they did. With no control over their feelings and actions they begin the downward spiral that becomes their lives. This is just the beginning for them. One event changes Elle's life and then throws Sevin and Evangeline's plans to the wind. The story takes a turn here and the heartache and angst become extreme and the time goes by fast as well. Once we hit 5 years later you will be shocked and possibly horrified at where the story goes. There may be an HEA but it is not an HEA in the sense that everyone gets back what they loss or ends up with everything they wanted. It is an HEA of sacrifice and growth and the understanding that the past cannot be changed yet we need to be thankful we are able to move on to a future where we create our own happiness and forgive. This is hard to grasp and also why i struggled thinking was all this pain worth it ?? But in the end , yes it was. There are a few characters I just cannot get on board with and one character who really shocked me and made me question a few things but being that this is Sevin and Evangeline's story I am able to look past that. I would have loved a bit of POV from Elle and even Olga, especially Olga !! I loved some of the sentimental pieces added into this story , the name Rose , the tattoos , the letter , the little girl and of course I loved Addy and her part in the story !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIT4IPK2N6DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1PULU#wasThisHelpful","R2VIT4IPK2N6DU","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not the first story I have read about husbands trading their wives or thinking they own their wives and they can be used for whatever they want. It is sick and twisted and definitely a hard read if abuse is a trigger for you. Emotional abuse can sometimes be so much worse than physical. Once your mind is taken over by doubt and the feeling of worthlessness your life is not your own.Elena believes she is to do everything her husband Dominic says. She is learning to be the perfect wife and since he loves her and married her she owes it to him since nobody else would want her. WOW what a horrible way to live. Yet being traded to another man to pay off a debt might just be the awakening needed for her to break free. Of course Elena is horrified and wondering what exactly Ashton will want from her. She is prepared to do anything he wants to protect her husband and pay off the debt. Little does she know Ashton is not as sick and twisted as Dominic. He may do bad business and be intimidating but he knows how to treat a woman right and with the help of his family he is about to change Elena's life forever. Dominic may have thought he had a great plan but he is in for the surprise of his life !!I really enjoyed this spin on the traded wife story !! Most women do fall for their new owner , so to speak , yet they do it because they have no choice or stockholm syndrome or because the guy is just so alpha demanding that it becomes a fascination for them. Ashton may be alpha demanding and super hot yet he is gentle and amazing and wants to prove to Elena that she is worth so much more. It is amazing to watch Elena come back to life and finally stand up for herself and what she wants. I also have to add that Ashton and Elena have an amazing chemistry in more ways than one and I enjoyed their journey. There were a few moments of holding my breath and a few times that I may have had to fan myself but in the end I loved how it all came together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VNCZOUT175M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017EKHROA#wasThisHelpful","R34VNCZOUT175M","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always loving the cover !! LLV has some serious skill when she picks her cover pictures !! Andrew is a great visual for Michael !! Every book I read by LLV has the same feels for me , things I love , things I don't love and tons of drama , heartache and SEX !! My reviews are easily 4-5 stars and never hard to write. I fly through the stories and love finding all the connections and trying to solve the puzzles. There is always some kind of danger and violence which is never easy to read but always keeps you hooked and in suspense. This story was harder to read than the rest because the horrific violence plaguing the town was involving children. Not so much trying to spoil but mainly a warning. It was heartbreaking and some of the details left a vivid visual. There were also a couple conversations that made me feel a little uneasy BUT they fit the story and the characters so it was easy enough to move on. I am sad to see this series end BUT hopefully as always we get a new series with some old connections ?? I look forward to more from LLV and will be a fan for as long as she writes stories !!Michael and Nikki are not strangers , in fact they have a past that has left some heartache. Michael suffers from some mental illness and although he is on meds it is not easy to cope. He has mood swings and he has ups and downs. Nikki we know comes from a huge family and she is loved by all, she misses Michael and wants to find a way back to him. Honestly this isn't really hard to do since Michael feels the same way. As always their jobs connect them , their friends and family have strong bonds with each other and the stories major drama will seal their fate. What Michael saw for his future will change drastically and Nikki may just get the HEA she hoped for. This is with no lack of drama and struggle. There are quite a few characters in this story that you will feel so much for and I don't doubt there will be tears. There may have been a couple characters that I just couldn't stand. Don't get me started on Michael's ex , WOW , who does she think she is ?? His family is kind of weird with that one and it annoyed me a bit yet I just focussed on blocking her crazy a$$ out !! I really suggest reading the whole series because the bonds that have formed are amazing and that is what makes these series so easy for me to read. I always look forward to the new couples and enjoy knowing that I will still see the old faves !!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2XOPXEHV8EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H3U2ZO#wasThisHelpful","R3V2XOPXEHV8EU","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debut erotic/ teacher-student story YES YES YES sign me up !! The cover is hot , the teasers were great and I was hooked from the start.I loved how we got Alexandria's story in the present- divorcing , not in love , he's cheating but she didn't blame him. Gave us a bit of insight to the type of person she was and the type of marriage she had been living in. Then we get to go back to college and the yummy years when she was consumed by lust and desire for her geeky HOT AS SIN calculus professor !! Professor Rodriguez , Javier , was basically living in the type of marriage Alexandria ended up in ironically, yet he craved love and happiness. He felt those things immediately with Alexandria and it may have been a whirlwind but it was super hot and super amazing. I am not a fan of cheating yet I honestly did not feel bad about this. I felt no connection to Amy or Javier's marriage and I felt badly for him because he was working so hard to keep up an act so he could provide the perfect home for his daughter. It really was sad and at times I did wonder if there was more to it , more mystery or unknown aspects to his claims. Yet I also felt he was very open and honest with Alexandria. Their connection was amazing and it really was a shame how it all came together so fast yet ended so quickly. Years later is there a possible second chance for them on the horizon ?? Can Alexandria forgive and forget or was her struggle to move on too much to get past ?? At this present time they are both doing what is right for them finally and it is no better time for them to face each other and face the facts and make that decision that can change their lives for the better or worse. I enjoyed how it all came together , I loved the ending and I was thrilled with this spin on the teacher/student romance. I loved how it was a past experience given to us by them both and now in the present we could see it play out verses being the current and never knowing what their futures came to be !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GH97NUIN4W3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146ZB0U8#wasThisHelpful","R3GH97NUIN4W3X","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW this is a challenging , super emotional read , for many reasons. Having said that it is also a wonderful read if you are able to handle reading about sickness. Normally I would avoid a book knowing the majority of it would be about a struggle with a condition as frustrating and horrific as Chiari can be BUT knowing this author and knowing her struggle with this condition I had to open up and allow myself to learn as much as I could about this condition. Anytime an author can tell a story , make you feel connected and also help you to learn something new about something very real you have to give credit and this story is just that. Is there happiness and joy ?? YES but it is found in the little things and you have to dig deep to be able to appreciate that.This is not just about Brenna's struggle with Chiari it is also about the struggle a serious brain condition can cause a family , a marriage and also everyday normal life. Nothing is simple anymore and everything , even cooking and cleaning becomes a struggle. I can imagine that at some point in all of our lives we have struggled with being sick or hurt , the guilt of not being there for your kids or spouse , the guilt of alienating yourself from friends and loved ones for a short amount of time. Sadly for people suffering this condition and many others in the world they live with this guilt daily because they have to sacrifice these things all the time. Having a dual POV is great , we feel and connect to both Brenna and Nick. We take this journey through Brenna first finding out about her condition to the choices she and her family have to make to attempt her feeling better. Of course these decisions do not always pan out and the outcome of some are just devastating to read about. It was frustrating to know that someone can suffer this much and not have any relief despite the lengths they have gone through to get there. Seeing the love between Nick and Brenna was amazing , seeing them build a family and have faith that it wouldn't always be so bad was phenomenal and being a part of their journey was eye opening and again I loved finding the joy and happiness they were able to provide their kids , each other and enjoy themselves.This story may end yet the struggle will go on and many families will go through these same struggles for years before they find a way to help. With research still being done Chiari is still a bit of a mystery to the doctors and those who have it. In the end you will see the strength of a family and a marriage that rivals many. If you cannot find relief from your symptoms at least you can see how important it is to have a family and loved ones to support the journey. Everyone suffers a different way through this. Everyone has a right to feel the emotions they may. BUT nobody can give up , strength and determination are vital to fighting this condition and living a life as normal as possible. I see it daily with this author and her family , being a friend I also see that side of it, knowing when and where to make my moves in trying to help. If you get anything out of this story let it be that Chiari awareness is important and support to those with this condition is a key factor in their recovery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JM2F2UKNII6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V4DO8I#wasThisHelpful","R1JM2F2UKNII6B","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read this author before it was a no brainer to sign on for this tour ! I have enjoyed her writing , the way she pulls you in and the uniqueness to her story lines. I am not familiar with anything horse so the whole jockey job was an eye opener for me. WOW it is a crazy world and I was shocked and horrified with all that goes into being fit for racing. BUT knowing that Tessa was pushing herself to be this made it easier to read and accept the challenges she placed on her body, had there been someone pushing her to do this to herself I may have had some issues !! Either way I enjoyed the story , I enjoyed learning the world of racing/jockeying , I enjoyed learning how Tessa and Jace grew from friends to much more and I enjoyed the ending and the HEA and joy I felt for the characters.The opening , WOW how sweet and swoon-worthy is that scene. I just melted and immediately fell in love with Jace and what would become the story of Tessa and Jace. Though this book is about so much more than that I knew with this childhood and family connection I would be invested. There may have been an age difference between them and yes they may have grown up with Jace being a protector almost brother like to Tessa but there was a clear time and place where all that changed and you knew it would. I enjoyed being in Tessa's head and if we hadn't had her POV I would not have understood her drive and sacrifice at all. I love male POV but again was happy to connect with Tessa and attempt to see things her way. Of course with Jace being who he was I wanted to smack her a few times, she was a mess at times and it sucked that she had to work hard to make her family and loved ones understand her goals. In the end she finally had a breakthrough not only getting the understanding of family and loved ones but also from herself allowing her to enjoy life and let herself love and be happy and have it all !! There were some seriously HOT scenes and I loved the "" her brother's BFF "" issues that came up. Happy to have read this and look forward to more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33UYRZCXYKHJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017E8OHKY#wasThisHelpful","R33UYRZCXYKHJ3","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOW I have been wanting Mason's book since I read Mica !! I mean he is such a strong presence in a lot of the books but he is my favorite and I just wanted to get his whole story. I think I struggle at the start of all these books with the way the author writes. I am such an alternating POV lover that anytime I read 1st , 3rd or anything but I have issues. There is also a ton going on in this book so you really need to pay attention to who is who and what is what. This is the same for all the books in this series and yes you should read them in order !!I honestly always wanted Mica to choose Mason , I still did even re-reading some of their scenes in Mason's book. I know she really didn't deserve him but I just adored the way he cared for her so it was a weakness for me I guess !! I am happy that Mason has found his always but damn the journey was long , crazy and just WOW. I was on the edge of my seat A LOT !! Mason's story starts long before he became the PREZ and a Rebel. You will be amazed at the life he has lived and survived. This story is long and not always easy to read BUT you get to witness the coming together of so many , family reuniting , family meeting , lives being taken too soon and others being born into the craziness. Some parts are beautiful and some parts are horrifying. I don't want to spoil so just prepare for a long crazy ride and know there will be some peace and happiness for a little while at least !!I look forward to see what comes next !!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G58LPPLDA44U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HUKGTI#wasThisHelpful","R1G58LPPLDA44U","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Farts are funny never cute but I will give him that one !! OMG Hayden made me laugh and I enjoyed this story because although it had a bigger picture and past stories of heartache it was delivered in such a real way you couldn't help but enjoy it !! Not only did I read this book in 1 sitting , like a matter of hours I am still laughing about it today and also swooning over how it all came to an end !!Hayden is typical manwhore material , screws his tenants and does it well !! He has a story and when you do get to it there is some serious heartache. Present time he is intrigued by the new hot tenant but he just promised his bff business partner that he would stop pursuing their tenants. So here lies the problem. He wants this chick in the worst way and he just can't have her. BUT maybe he can be her friend ?? This is a new attempt for Hayden. Will he be able to do it or will he fail ?? One of the best things about this was that we didn't have to sit through pages of mindless screwing. Hayden was up front and honest , we knew who he was and he didn't need to show us time and time again. He immediately began to focus on Emery and being her friend and I have to say it was genuine. I loved his thoughts , I loved his confessions and I loved his rude and crude statements because he was being 100% honest !! The best part of this was that it was dual pov !! Once we meet Emery we know these two are a match made in so many places !! They are funny , they are determined and they are honest. You cannot get more real than that !! Emery is new to the area , here for an intern and hoping to pass the bar and get an actual job. She is already warned about Hayden by another tenant so when he approaches she is determined to stay away. Of course they both go into this friendship with guidelines and determination which makes it all the more funny when they get out of control !! There was fun , there was sexy and sexual tension and of course there was that moment. Then we round it all out and the ending was perfect !! An amazing fast read with a refreshing amount of humor and honesty !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYH83G87MVT1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146ZAZSQ#wasThisHelpful","RYH83G87MVT1K","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mica , hmmm she was such a tortured soul , a hard nut to crack. Sometimes I felt I could see right through her and other times I felt I couldn't even begin to understand her. She has been through hell and back her whole life. Losing her mom , dealing with her father and brother's abuse and then off to a man who did nothing but hurt her. Basically on the run and hiding from anyone she knows and loves she is in Chicago starting life over. Her neighbor just happens to be smitten by her with one look. He is an MC president and Mason is not a man of ease ,he is tortured as well. Mica is a strong chick but when she needs help she needs it bad. Mason gives her anything she wants and protects her with his life and makes it known to the MC that she is their treasure , their princess. It is insane to see how serious they take this role. I loved their relationship , like a tortured friendship with sexual tension and angst !!In present time Mica is dealing with a loss and her brother being around. This stirs up a crap ton of trouble and one of these incidents has not only a stranger , Daniel , the hot hockey player, saving her but Mason as well. These two guys both fell instantly for Mica and oddly enough they stake their claim in different ways. I was a little confused by the 3 of them , I would have loved to just call it a threesome and get on with it !! BUT we go through months of angst filled back and forth. Mason loves Mica no doubt but he knows she cannot deal with the details of his MC life so he settles and insists that they are friends. Daniel loves Mica and she feels for him yet her past is haunting her and she is afraid to risk anyone getting hurt. The easiest thing for her is to shut people out. This is a lengthy book and so there are quite a few hold your breath moments and revelations that have you on the edge !! Even after finishing I am unsure of how I feel about Mica, I want to love her because she needs love yet she drives me crazy with these two guys and I just love Mason so much !! Uggghhhh I can't wait to get his story and until then I am hoping to get more of this odd triangular thing named Mason/Mica/Daniel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAVCJFHBQ9LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7H0W9O#wasThisHelpful","R1LAVCJFHBQ9LN","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another powerful story to immediately engage and hook me in. I read this in hours and I was so shocked and pleased with how Miranda and Brad's stories were so much more than just the brother and friend. They had layers and real life struggles and you could feel their emotions and you wanted more and better for them both. Brad is a great guy regardless but he really needed someone to show him there is more to life than work and being alone. Miranda's character was so fragile yet so strong to fight her addictions and past head on. It was a roller coaster and of course there was some angst , Brad may be nearing 30 but Miranda and the rest of the gang are very early 20's, which is known as the ANGST AGE !!This may have been Brad and Miranda's book BUT I enjoyed catching up with Mackenzie , Hayes and OMG their lil one is too cute !! The year that Mackenzie was gone was not good for Miranda AT ALL. She had met Preston , quickly got caught up with him and that landed her on the wrong path. Now on the right track she is drooling over Brad , the hot detective , Mackenzie's foster brother. He is older and more put together so of course she doesn't feel worthy of him. But being thrown together in a couple of situations allows for them to get to know each other , become friends and share with us that magical sexual tension that we all love !!!!! Miranda's struggles are so real and so heartfelt she has you on the edge of your seat more than once fearing the demons may drag her down. Once her and Brad make things clear the past then haunts Miranda every step of the way. She knows once Brad knows he won't want her , she acts as if they don't have a future because of what she is.

"Chase/Chaser OMG he is yummy and everything book boyfriend stands for !! The hot businessman with a wild and reckless side, the gorgeous pierced and tattooed body hidden beneath and fitted suit and tie. SWOON , PANTY MELTING and SEXY FUN FUN FUN !! You had me with the dual POV and the secret life.Chase as Chaser is fun and I love a good rock group story BUT then seeing him as Chase in a suit at an event , wow delicious !! Chase meeting Ivy for the first time was comical. He thinks one thing of her and she thinks one thing of him. they couldn't be more wrong. They both get a small glimpse of the real Ivy and Chase which eggs them on enough to want to find out more. Ivy goes against her better judgement to find out just who Chase Hudson is. She won't be let down !! Not only does Chase have his secrets but Ivy has hers too. I swear these two are so perfect for each other !! The story does go at a quick pace and there isn't too much drama in the midst of their relationship. I think the most shock for them was how easily they fell into the relationship status. The sex is off the charts hot and I could read all day long about Chase and his dirty talk and bedroom or anywhere sexy time !! Not until Ivy confesses her secret does Chase decide to do the same. Will Ivy accept his truths as easily as he does hers ?? Can these two save their relationship despite their other lives ?? This was a quick read and a very enjoyable one too !!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S45HG0SRP0VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156O7Q5G#wasThisHelpful","R1S45HG0SRP0VI","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taylor and Ethan SWOON !! I loved them so much. Not a typical love story at all. So many pieces to this book were refreshing and new. I couldn't get enough of these two together and that is just a piece of the story !!Taylor's backstory is heartbreaking. Orphaned at age 4 , stalked by an unknown guy for years and sadly then separated from her twin. There is so much more to that and wow the way it all played out is just so worth the read. Yet we get even more. Taylor is now 22 and in a band for the past 6 months. She has spent years moving around , never staying in one place too long. Now without a job she is questioning the ability to stay here, but she loves the guys in the band and when a job opportunity falls into her lap thanks to the hot EMT with glasses Taylor finally feels content. She ditches the useless Nathan and makes a friend at the hotel where she will be a lifeguard !! I love the guys in the band , they are funny , typical and also very caring and I did feel a connection with them and kind of want more from them all !! Especially AJ , his connecting piece to this story was insane !! Luckily for Taylor she keeps having run ins with Ethan. He is so sweet and innocent acting. They may seem like opposites but they have a great chemistry and it all falls into place so easily. This is a standout story to me. I have yet to read a story with all the same components. Sometimes you get the same names or jobs or places they live. This was refreshing to me because so many of those things were different. Ethan has a story as well and it is heartbreaking. The way Taylor deals with him is just amazing and it brought tears to my eyes. You really felt their connection and love. When the past and present collide all heck breaks lose. It gets crazy and I was on the edge of my seat with worry. Hang on tight and enjoy the ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVFVGMWDTXY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7JEG2C#wasThisHelpful","R1DVFVGMWDTXY7","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW I was unsure how I would feel about the age difference , I didn't mind the whole taboo in love with my BFF's dad , I was just wondering how severe the age gap would be. The second Theo Black roared into that neighborhood on his Harley all thoughts went out the window , I didn't care how old or who he was I just wanted to know him and yes KNOW HIM !! Thankfully she was legal !!Chloe was so excited to see the girl with a book moving in across the street. Having no friends and parents that didn't pay much attention Chloe needed someone to enjoy life with. Isabelle was the perfect match !! They went on to become best friends and journey through junior high and high school together. Now leaving for 2 different colleges there wasn't much worry , they had a great bond and a few hours was NOT going to wreck their friendship. I wonder if Chloe and Mr. Black's new found bond would ??When tragedy struck the Black family Izzy had Chloe to help her through. Sadly Mr. Black had nobody. Now with his daughter gone there was one person he chose to lean on , the one person he always felt something for , oddly it was his daughter's BFF. Chloe and Theo have a spark , a chemistry that might be wrong but feels so right. A moment of weakness makes crossing that line so sweet. Theo feels guilt , Chloe feels both guilt and hopeless. She leaves for school and doesn't look back.Years go by and now Chloe is back faced with her sick father and the infamous neighbor that has never left her thoughts. NOW we get to the story !! Juicy , suspenseful and down right full of angsty drama !! I feel for Theo and Chloe they have a great connection and although it comes from an odd place it should not matter. Theo opens up to her , we find out about his past , about Mrs. Black and the honesty that pours out of him is heartbreaking. Chloe has always craved to have people to connect with and someone to share her dreams with. These two have to be very sneaky and very quiet but of course there are many struggles and people that attempt to get in the way. On top of this impossible but very desired relationship Chloe has to deal with her father being sick and his caregivers random son !! It is a roller coaster for sure and I really enjoyed it. The ending , although a happy one , made me so sad. it was not what I expected or what I wanted. I don't think anyone will be truly happy with their outcomes BUT I would love a novella about Sterling and Chloe and I MUST HAVE a prequel about the young Mr. Black !!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MSX6W9D1OG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VN88Z0#wasThisHelpful","R17MSX6W9D1OG3","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another AMAZING Kelly story !! I say it just about every review and it never gets old for me. I love to read Kelly , we know what we will get , I know I will laugh , cry , enjoy the music , enjoy the true romance and swoon over these hot as sin country boys who know how to win their girls hearts despite the amount of messing up they may have done !! This story is slightly different than all the rest in the Wanted and the Love Wanted series because Noah is an outsider to the gang !! This is almost a first for everyone LOL. We met Noah earlier on in the series when he and Grace met up , hooked up and although they had an amazing connection and an amazing time Grace cut him loose. Grace is just like her mom , so much so she tries to hide her true feelings and lets her fears guide her to make the wrong choices. It is sad but true. When Noah came back around Grace read things wrong and Noah has spent so much time trying to fix his life and get back to Grace you can't help but love him.Noah's story is a sad one and I shed so many tears being in his head and seeing the torment his family was suffering. Grace was amazing and despite her fathers issues she made choices to show Noah how much she loved him. It was not an easy road for these two but they managed to overcome so much and still come out on top. There is more of that funny and sassy country girl attitude that Kelly Elliott writes so well. The romance and sex is off the charts , the angst is there and the drama is heartbreaking. There were some big milestones hit for a few and I loved seeing the other couples and as always the parents and Grams & Gramps there to join in the fun and celebrations.A great end of summer read. An amazing love story and it will leave you swooning for a country boy of your own , though Noah isn't straight off the farm he is still amazing !!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5V6TWPK4C0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LMAAZK#wasThisHelpful","RV5V6TWPK4C0N","A1X5V3LU8TC8QU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X5V3LU8TC8QU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Kathleen Spivack, in her episodic novel, Unspeakable Things, takes the reader from the dark precipice of the old world during the war-torn 1940s, to the new life which is being created, haltingly and painfully, by the intelligentsia who have escaped to New York. Refugees from Europe, they attempt to continue their lives in New York City. It is a moment in time which is suspended. There is little direction. Memories hold as much import and reality as actions for the family to whom the reader is introduced. There is Herbert, now a grandfather, who is struggling to accept his position as this small community's man with the answers. His wife has gone mad with the loss of their son Michael. Their other son, David, works in Washington as a decoder or cipher. His grandchildren are still young. Only Ilse, David's wife, who works, seems to have adapted to the new way of life they are living in New York.When the little Countess, Anna (also known as ""the Rat"", for her ugliness and beauty combined) arrives to live with the family, other forces begin to affect each member. Her powerful presence is a physical as well as intellectual signal for change.Additionally playing a critical part in this novel is Felix, a Nazi doctor who is a scientist attempting to realize the dream of the master race from specimens he collects and cultures. In fact, he has specimens from the Tolstoi Quartet. They too arrive in New York during the course of Unspeakable Things. Each one of them is missing something essential without which they will be unable to play pieces as they once did in Vienna.What are the ""Unspeakable Things"" which are brought to light by this novel? They could be construed as the unspeakable things which the little Countess, Anna, brings up to the child Maria. These concern the physical and sexual brutality she underwent at the hands of Rasputin in order to pay off a debt owed by her husband, a debauched count.The passion and depravity she experienced changed her forever.Even more however, the unspeakable things concern the horror and brutality brought upon Europe by Hitler and the Nazis.The loss and the darkness which swept away whole civilizations and peoples is portrayed within this novel frighteningly and horrifyingly, yet from one step removed.The author, with vivid and powerful writing, plunges the reader into this time period in New York. The balance of things is beginning to turn from old to new.  However, for many within this tiny cadre of refugees, memories hold them and keep them from taking action as if they are trapped within specimen jars, hopeless in a collection kept barely alive by a mad scientist. Only the little Countess make an ultimate sacrifice.Finally, from the haunting and horrible depths comes the unquenchable urge for a new Spring, and a new life. To accomplish this, values of beauty and refinement must be left behind, like photographs of former of strange children, in silver frames. Were they real? What significance did they have? Many things which represent the arts and beauty, and all that we embrace and cleave to in our humanity, are lost during this time of transition.In the end, Unspeakable Things turns and faces  renewal and change. A choice is made. The old is left behind. That which unfolds and adapts may be prosaic, however it promises a future for the next generation.Unspeakable Things by Kathleen Spivack is very beautifully written and completely worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTP6Q155JQFU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353960#wasThisHelpful","RTP6Q155JQFU9","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This set is actually very nice for the price. However it is indeed manufactured in China and imported as you can see in my photo of the bottom of the box. The knives, scissors and sharpening blade are properly weighted and the block is quite attractive, in black with the Sabatier logo on the front. I note little to detract from these fine, high quality knives however there are two things to remember if you decide to give them as a gift. One is that the receivers will know they are, in some form, not the ""original Sabatier knives"" forged in France. The name Sabatier is allowed at this point to be used by a number of manufacturers. Even if the knives were indeed forged in France, they could be poor quality, according to what I read when I researched this. These are fine for this price. The other thing to note is that when you give a gift of knives to anyone (as a wedding present, for example), you traditionally tape a penny to the box for luck! Just a side thing to realize for when you give knives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10MVSRRNXGQFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WFNRGU#wasThisHelpful","R10MVSRRNXGQFB","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This gorgeous teaching book puts Albion stitch front and center. As Marcia DeCoster says in her foreword, ""...I love a book that gives us a comprehensive set of skills within one beadweaving stitch. Heather had done that here, building upon the readers understanding of the stitch one chapter at a time."" Heather Kingsley-Heath further explains in her introduction that Albion stitch began ""during a conversation between bead artist friends about how to bring fresh ideas into our beadwork.""Heather explains her process from the very start to the point when she attained the terminology and the language for the stitch. It is fascinating to read. The author lives in the UK (thus the name for this stitch: Albion means ""a poetic or literary term for Britain or England (often used in referring to ancient or historical times""). However by now she has taught Albion stitch in several countries. She loves the excitement and experimentation which it engenders. You will too!After the fundamentals and the basics, the reader will begin with Chapter 1: Flat Albion Stitch. This is the easiest way to understand and work Albion stitch. The projects are as pretty as can be, even if they are your first introduction to the stitch. For example, the second project, which teaches the reader how to increase when she makes this delightful segmented bracelet replete with brightly colored fans and a sewn-in snap clasp, is charming in coral red, coral pink and frosted turquoise seed beads with a trim of Czech frosted pellet beads. Check her helpful note on snap fasteners.With projects like this to start off, what an inspiration this book promises to be! There are five fabulous project in Chapter 1 alone. The tech illustrations are wonderful throughout the book and the photos, which are plentiful, are super pretty.Chapter 2 offers Tubular Albion Stitch.  As the author says, ""Instead of a row of beads, the base row is a ring of beads...Tubular Albion stitch can be used to make pretty beaded beads and is the starting point for working three-dimensional designs."" The pretty ""Jangle Bangle"" from the book's cover is in this chapter, as are four other wonderful projects. The reader will appreciate the unique offering opening each chapter which discusses color inspiration. The author really boosts your imagination with her heady and rich descriptions.One project I could not take my eyes off of is the first one in Chapter 2. It is a necklace titled ""Magic Lanterns"". This name is appropriate, because the Tubular Albion stitch is made up here into various sizes of round beads. Strung on hand-dyed silken ropes in two colors of green, this looks like exotic jewelry purloined from Aladdin's Cave. The purples, yellows and brown seed beads play off the larger ginger brown seed beads and green SuperDuo beads. What fun this is! It is perfectly beautiful and very unusual. In this chapter, when the reader arrives at the ""Jangle Bangle"" check out the great notes the author has added to expand upon this project, if you fell for the book because of it!Chapter 3 is titled ""Ribbons and Lace"". It is a study in the popular vintage revival going on presently. Among the author's favorite projects in this book is ""Deco Delight."" She notes that it is so light and easy to wear, while also making a ""beady"" statement.""The lovely necklaces are shown in teal and worked in that color, however there is a second necklace shown in dusty rose tones. The reader will love this necklace!The bracelets following, ""Vintage Lace"" are also gorgeous. These lacy cuffs are wide and delicate. They lure the viewer in with their charm and subtle impact.There is a lively pendant sporting crystals among the seed beads and a rivoli in the middle to attract the reader as well. It is called ""Novely Lace"" and is very appealing worn on a ribbon. It can be adapted to make a cuff bracelet as well, if a few are stitched together.Moving on to Chapter 4, the reader will be learning about the last but not least part of understanding Albion Stitch. This chapter is concerned with Structure and Links. The author will pull from the previous chapters and explain how to ""create designs that bring them together in different ways"". This is very exciting for the reader. It more that double the understanding of this great stitch. The author offers these projects in neutral colors and they are stunning. The very first is a riff off of ""The Novely Lace"" pendant. It is titled ""Roundelay Ribbon"". There are two of these necklaces shown and the lighter colored one is the one the instructions are for. The basic shape is round here and doesn't hold a rivoli, but the glamour factor of this necklace, with five round circles asymmetrically attached by the basic Albion ribbon stitch is very cool looking. Another project impossible to pass up in this chapter is a cuff called ""Maderon Arches"". These lovely cuffs are depicted in two colors. The olive and silver is the one the reader will be working on. This is a gorgeous punchy bracelet with a lot of dimension because of the Rizo accent beads. Try this one and fall in love! The author calls it ""a wonderfully sturdy statement piece"".  This sort of design is the reason we love seed beads. You can't beat them for elegant, artisan beauty.Check out the final pages for further information and to follow the author.Introducing Albion Stitch, 20 Beaded Jewelry Projects, by Heather Kingsley-Heath, is a welcome addition to a beader's library.

"Mirrorvana's Large 8-inch Vanity Makeup Mirror is the prettiest makeup mirror I have had in ages. I am delighted with everything about it! I have always relied on a makeup mirror, especially because I don't want any surprises concerning my makeup when I get in the car late for an appointment or a date and check out my makeup as I am about to drive off. With Mirrovana's mirror, I have regular magnification on one side and 10X magnification on the other. I use the more powerful side when putting on my eye makeup, especially. For shaping up eyebrows it is perfect! Then I flip it over to see my whole face magnified normally on the other side and get the perspective I need on what I have yet to finish when doing my makeup.The Mirrorvana rotates 360 degrees, if you choose to move it that way.Just turn the edge with a couple of your fingers. You can also simply pick it up, holding the stand and turn it around. It's your choice. The mirror has a very feminine and elegant look,  which makes me love it even more!This high quality Vanity mirror is 15 inches in height, which is a lovely size. It will look fantastic on your makeup table or equally great in your master bath.I always had a mirror like this when I went off to college. It makes a thoughtful gift for your college-aged daughter or granddaughter for the holidays, her birthday, or ""just because"". What a terrifically well thought out, excellent mirror by Mirrovana!Note: I added the little birds shown in my photo, just for fun!

"This watch, from Swiss Legend, is a hot looking watch at a great price point. It comes with a really nice navy blue box for gift giving. It is water resistant to 330 feet and the marine blue edged silicone bezel rotates. However I wouldn't recommend using this watch for diving. One the other hand, it is waterproof.If there is a man in your life who loves to make a big impression with his watch, choose this one. Its Swiss Quartz movement is one tiny notch higher than the Invicta men's watches I have seen. They have almost as good Japanese Quartz movements (and yes, I love them as well).The colors on this watch are gorgeous, the gold (ion plated over stainless steel)  is really handsome with the marine blue and the ivory hands. As you can see, this is not a digital watch, it is an analog watch, and as such is kind of retro-cool. So if you have a guy in your life who has a personality you see as retro-cool, jump on this one for gift giving. If you know his taste, you may have nailed it with this really nice looking Swiss Legend Men's Neptune Force Analog Display Swiss Quartz Gold Watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZP4DG1EU7X2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01445IIV4#wasThisHelpful","R2ZP4DG1EU7X2V","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this is a work boot. As such, the requirements which it needs to fulfill are very critical. Good looking boots which fulfill all the requirements for this kind of work boot, such as this Stanley Men's Secure 6 Inch ST Safety Work Boot, don't often look this snappy. My son loves these. He can wear them for work and after work as well. We both like the really nice black leather with the yellow accents. Also, the synthetic EVA sole and inner sole are terrific. The inner sole is removable, too.The comfort which I take knowing that this work boot meets ASTM standards F2413-11, and is rated I/75 and C/75, including electric hazard resistance, is really wonderful.  The Stanley Men's Secure 6 Inch ST Safety Work Boot boot is worth the money! He likes them, and they are comfortable to wear. I like their looks and I worry less!

"Jamie Cloud Eakin is a much loved instructor and internationally famous designer in the beading world. She has produced a number of fascinating books, primarily featuring seed beads. Once the reader sees the amazing things which can be done using seed beads it is great to learn how to create with them from such a wonderful, knowledgeable teacher. She is energetic, enthusiastic and makes beauty wherever she goes.In Bead Play with Tassels, Techniques, Designs and Projects, the focus is on how to make some of the loveliest tassels the reader has ever seen. Tassels are a very popular fashion trend. They have also embellished every kind of accessories imaginable and been used as adornments for years. In this book, the reader will see how to employ them in all sort of fantastic and playful ways. From earrings to necklace focals to just the right finishing touch for a lariat, this book has all sorts of intriguing and pretty projects. Progressing from the simplest to grander projects which include gemstones or bead embroidery, the reader will enjoy learning and soon be totally entranced by the charming, cool, and flirty pieces she will be able to make.In the introduction the author defines what a tassel is (a ""collection of fringe strands concentrated in one spot""). She then explains why this can cause problems when making tassels (the strands become too big for the bead hole which is collecting them). The solution will be found in one of the methodologies in this book. As the author says, ""Creating bead tassels does NOT have to be a hassle!"" The seventeen projects will help you ""practice the techniques, refine your skills, and jump start your own creativity!""There are six chapters in this fascinating book. Chapter 1 discusses the minimum tassel. As defined by the author, a ""minimum tassel is one with less than seven fringe strands"".  There are lots of uses for these types of tassels, and they can create lots of impact even with an amount of strands smaller than seven. Directions and photos explain the minimum tassel. There is a really striking earring project offered for the reader to try. It couldn't be more glamorous, and takes minimum to the max. There is also a gorgeous necklace which employs minimum tassels as accents to grand effect. The reader will discover how adept this author is at creating designs and adding impact with color, by now, if she didn't know before! The third project is a pin with three minimum tassels and it is equally lovely.Chapter 2 is titled ""Standard Tassel"". This type of tassel has seven to seventeen strands, according to the author, and is what most of us picture when we hear the word tassel. The reader will learn how to construct the base and create variations of it, depending upon how many strands she wants for her design. The tech illustrations here (and throughout the book) are very clear, as are the photos of the variations. You are going to want to try to make tons of tassels at this point! They all beckon to the reader for any number of reasons. Each one looks so different it is hard to believe that they are all made from the same ""standard tassel"" springboard. The author also has some great tips, too. There are basic tips, and ""what if...?"" tips, and tips which are actually important notes on aspects the reader needs to know. These are very helpful.The first project ups the beauty of an already lovely lamp work bead by accenting its colors in a swirl pattern which is really pretty. From a fabulous lariat, to multicolored earrings, to a triple standard tassel necklace, to a flowery tassel necklace in the colors of orchid, dark blue and olivine, the reader really begins to understand how fresh and appealing adding movement with tassels can be to a myriad of designs.  There are variations of some of the projects offered, and they are just as pretty. The 6th project in the standard tassel collection is a very full tassel and as such is fascinating. To read how to create this is to understand how this teacher's mind works and why she is so terrific. I loved this gorgeous project. The variation of it is just as glorious; designed all in creamy white pearl. At the end of the chapter the reader is offered a number of tassels which are suggested as Christmas ornaments but would also be great fan pulls, embellishments for keys to an armoire, and more. These are enchanting!Chapter 3 concerns the Pom Pom Tassel which is defined as a very full, almost ""extreme"" tassel by the author. Created with a simple ladder stitch, the Pom Pom tassel is stitched onto a base. You create the base and add the fringe. There are variations such as Twisted Fringe and more. The explanation of how to design a Pom Pom Tassel contains lots of lovely photos, all with instructions. Each one is prettier than the next! The final one, ""Standard plus Pom Pom Necklace"" is a medley of raspberries, pinks, lilac lined seed beads and fucshias and it is gaspingly beautiful. Tassels in the hands of this author have everything needed to leave you breathless.The Spiral Tassel taught in Chapter 4 is just as pretty. Flouncy and full (or less so, if you choose), it spirals up to the beaded base in a completely mesmerizing way. The projects offered in this chapter are very cool and interesting because the viewer's eye is led to some many different places. Tassels have a lot of wonderful movement anyway. The projects offered here are fascinating to see and to try.  The third project, in a color combination which refers to blue and white as well as dark blue and a bit of brown, is just stunning. What pleasure the reader will get making this necklace!Where the previous chapters offered directions on how to make tassels, and bases of tassels, Chapter 5 is specifically concerned with ""Attaching Tassels"".Information on Top Loop Attachments, Double Strand Loop Attachments, Herringbone Loop Attachments, Ladder Stitch Top Loop Attachments and more are found in this essential chapter. There is a lovely photo for the Turn Bead Attachment, which can also be used on all the ornaments mentioned earlier in this review. It is super pretty! As well, there is a great explanation and instructions for how to attach fringe to other beadwork, such as the beautiful bead embroidered necklace, a photo of which the reader will find impossible to take her eyes off. It is used to help explain this section. What grand and pretty inspiration!Chapter 6 has you covered with ""Supplies and Basics"". Not only is it a good, comprehensive list, the tip concerning converting hanks of Czech beads to grams is very helpful! Basic procedures are offered after the supply section as well as some excellent instructions for basic technique.As an additional book to refer to when you try Bead Play with Tassels, consider Bead Play with Fringe, by the same author. It will expand your understanding of how to work with fringe and tassels together.Bead Play with Tassels, Techniques, Designs and Projects, is, by far, the definitive book on how to create beauty with tassels. Jamie Cloud Eakin truly loves to teach and understands what we all want to learn: how to design more beautifully and more exceptionally. Don't miss this outstanding book for your beading library!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106VLV651RYN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508945861#wasThisHelpful","R106VLV651RYN9","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Knitter's Book of Knowledge, A Complete Guide to Essential Knitting Techniques, by Debbie Bliss is a massive compendium of everything one might want to know about knitting. Although it is large, it is not unwieldy. The reader will be able to keep it by her side as she knits, to refer to when she has a question of any sort.Debbie Bliss is a top designer and instructor who is internationally famous for her patterns and her teaching. This guide contains a distillation of her years of knitting in an easy to understand, helpful and user-friendly guide.The book is divided into eleven parts. There is also an introduction (as well as resources and graph paper at the end).Chapter 1 contains information on the basics of ""Yarns, Needles, and Other Things"". This is a great beginning chapter which explains everything the reader might need. It goes into specific types and weights of yarn specifically and thoroughly. The photos are glorious. If you have never knitted before, this is a perfect place to begin. There is a list of equipment which will eventually be required as well, such as knitting needles of various sizes. Also explained are items such as row counters, scissors, cable needles, crochet hooks and more.Chapter 2 is titled ""First Steps"".  The knit stitch and the purl stitch are taught here. Readers who have already learned how to knit might want to check this beginner chapter out as well, as there are techniques for casting on and binding off which may be helpful to them. The great illustrations by Cathy Brear, which are essential to understanding exactly how something is being done, and which appear throughout this beautiful book, are in evidence here. They really assist in making the author's instructions that much clearer.The knit stitch and the purl stitch are also offered in their versions both in US and UK, as well as Continental! How cool! For you left-handed knitters, you are not left out either! The Knitter's Book of Knowledge has everyone covered. This is the chapter you will go back to again and again as you bind off, too. It has all the different methods here in one spot.Chapter 3 is called ""Understanding Knitting"". Here the reader will be exploring some of the technical aspects of knitting, as well as the language and terminology used. Basic knitted fabrics are explained, and how to read a knitting pattern and a charted pattern. You will learn how to knit a gauge swatch, and why. Certain basic essentials such as how to substitute a yarn and joining in a new ball of yarn appear here. A number of techniques including picking up stitches are included in this chapter.Chapter 4 is titled ""Shaping"". The reader will be learning more on how to add or subtract stitches and how to dome and disk shapes, for example, a sock heel.In the case of the sock heel, a special technique is provided to dispel any concerns about knitting socks. How cool is that? This book is truly fantastic and only gets better!Chapter 5 is called ""Knitting in the Round"". Circular knitting goes way back. Early knitters originally created garments in this manner. As the author says, ""[this is] perfect for knitters who tend to work a purl row tighter or looser than  the knit row, which can result in an uneven fabric."" Within this chapter you have circular needles, double-pointed needles, and a great method is explained concerning when and how to use the magic loop. Among other techniques in this chapter, a pattern for medallions is offered. This is very lovely.Chapter 6 is all about ""Knitting Texture"". This is a fascinating chapter which included patterns for all sorts of cables,back cross and front cross, a number of bobbles, knitted lace and more. Textural stitches explained here include the elongated stockinette stitch, elongated garter stitch, dip stitch and ladder stitch. This chapter is packed, as there are even more including loops, tucks. picots, and one of my special favorites, the entrelac technique.What a gift this book would make for the aspiring knitter in your circle of friends or family! It truly bursts with tons of information on knitting--and it is not done yet!Chapter 7 is an explanation of ""Color Knitting"". This will teach the reader all about patterns which use color as part of their design. There is a color wheel and discussions of color families and color values. I found this chapter to be wonderfully useful for any sort of designer of any kind of craft.. The author explains how to work from a chart, using color. She discusses techniques such as controlling multiple yarns. Stripes of all sorts and carrying multiple yarns are discussed here. Slip-stitch knitting and intarsia, vertical color change and how to hold different numbers of strands of yarn in your hands are all explained. Weaving in is explained here as well as edge stitches in color knitting.Take a breath; it is on to Chapter 8. This gorgeous chapter concerns embellished knitting. The reader will be adding embroidery, duplicate stitch, decorative stitches (wait until you see the offerings!), and bead knitting of all sorts, never forgetting to include how to finish your piece. Trimmings, fringe, pom-poms and other embellishments such as crocheting are offered in this chapter.  It is a mindblowing collection which will embellish the reader's plainer knitted pieces and adds that wow factor we all love.Chapter 9 is titled ""Finishing"".  As the author says, ""[Finishing] seems to be something that many knitters find rather intimidating"". However, she is reassuring, even as she stresses the importance of finishing your work properly. The reader will learn how to block, how to pin out on a blocking board, how to mattress stitch on stockinette,mattress stitch on reverse stockinette, on single rib, double rib and other patterns. Slip stitching and sewing on cast-on and bound-off ends are explained for the reader. As this is a very important part of the knitting process, there are pages and pages more on how to finish specific kinds of knitted pieces. The reader will be able to find and clearly understand  exactly what she needs in this very thorough and useful chapter.Chapter 10 is titled ""Designing Knits"". What a lovely introduction the author provides concerning designing your own projects!She explains that if the reader has been less than confident concerning her own designs, she might look back to the first thing she ever made. Possibly it was a scarf, self-designed. As she says, ""And the steps from designing a scarf to designing a sweater are smaller and easier that you might think.""This chapter goes from finding inspiration, to photography, to mood boards, scrapbooks and sketchbooks to creating a collection. Then the author discusses designing to fit and basic garment shapes.The reader will be constructing a diagram and developing a design. Insight into the use of patterns and their practicalities are given. Color-effect yarns and textures are discussed. Every single chapter which came before this one contributes to this elegant coming together of making a pattern. Then, the reader will learn to write a pattern, calculating yarn quantities, and considering whether this will be for a baby, an adult, a boy or a girl. Included are accessories and homewares such as blankets and pillows.  It is very cool at this point to realize what you have learned from this marvelous book by Debbie Bliss, The Knitter's Book of Knowledge, A Complete Guide to Essential Knitting Techniques. What a great job she did corralling all the information you might need into one really fine reference book!The following chapter is one we all need at one time or another: Chapter 11, ""Troubleshooting"". Here is where the reader will learn how to correct mistakes if they have been found early enough. The author assists the reader with dropped knit stitches and dropped purl stitches, up to multiple rows down, as well as dropped stitches on an edge and unraveling. Twisted stitches are resolved, as are extra stitches. There is a wealth of errors which are fixed for the reader in this chapter. Even mending and darning are included within this chapter. What a consolation to have this book when you realize you have made a mistake while knitting. It's terrific!The resources (international as well as US), including sites where the reader can obtain Debbie Bliss' own brand of yarn, and knitter's graph paper wind up this lovely and useful book. What a super wonderful find for any knitter, beginner or otherwise. The Knitter's Book of Knowledge, A Complete Guide to Essential Knitting Techniques, by Debbie Bliss is a must for the library of a fan of knitting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOIXOECBEGIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145470926X#wasThisHelpful","R1TOIXOECBEGIO","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hidden Bodies, the second novel by author Caroline Kepnes, is a disappointingly empty read. To read this novel is to be fooled into hoping against hope that something will happen to make it all worth it. It is like one of those foil-covered giant chocolate bunnies at Easter. You see it, and it looks fantastic; like it's going to deliver tons and tons of candy. When you unwrap it and bite into it, it turns out there is barely anything there. The chocolate is a thin layer. Hidden Bodies is hollow.I know I was supposed to have read You, the author's first novel, before I read this one. However I didn't. Kepnes plays catch-up for readers who aren't familiar with the protagonist of that novel, Joe Goldberg, because he is the protagonist of this novel as well. Hidden Bodies is written in the first person and in Joe's voice. It follows the path Joe takes when he seeks revenge on his latest girlfriend, Amy Adam. They have been living happily in New York City until she steals some very expensive antique books from the store where she works with Joe. He figures out she has headed to Los Angeles and follows her. At this point we already know he has murdered a number of people and plans to murder her when he locates her.The book introduces the reader to the some very unpleasant aspects of Los Angeles, through the eyes and words of Joe. The writing style is intentionally a bit self conscious. It is also up to date on social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Joe is always looking in from the outside, even when he meets his new love, ""Love"", her twin brother, ""Forty"" and her family. It is difficult not to sympathize with Joe to some degree as he peregrinates here and there, buffeted by the other characters. He is never far from being frightened he is going to be found out as the murderer he is. He is never far from feeling like a left-out loser either. Because he is one, he is a difficult hero to care about. He is also a total narcissist and a dreamer. On the other hand, Joe is just smart enough so that the reader believes that it could be possible for Joe to get lucky, realize the American dream, live the good life of a famous Hollywood writer, be absolved, and live happily ever after with his ""surrogate family"" and his true Love, Love. He wants the whole burrito.Much is made of the phoniness and mannerisms of today. The drugs and alcohol (Joe's not interested) and the awesome sex (Joe loves it ) which everyone is having is described very well in Hidden Bodies. It is dead on too, as are the characters. The secondary ones from back East (New York and Little Compton, RI) as well as in LA are quite fun and interesting. However there simply isn't enough to the plot. Besides that, there isn't enough humor. An author with this much promise and  potential, who is clearly talented and very smart owes us more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BH4TYANITSJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476785627#wasThisHelpful","R2BH4TYANITSJK","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very appealing ornament. A nutcracker is presented inside the globe, with a tiny decorated Christmas tree and a teddy bear. He is dressed  all in red and white, like Santa (however he has his monocle) if you look closely. People who love classic Christmas ornaments, or the Nutcracker Suite, traditionally performed during the holiday season, will love this ornament. It has a lovely gold tassel at the top, is decorated on the exterior with a holly leaf and berry pattern. There are snowflakes raised in the white porcelain. I think this looks adorable on a tree but it could also be hung on bare branches along with pretty glass globes for a table centerpiece. Great for gift giving as it comes in a nice red presentation box. It is very sweet and it totally gets you into the spirit of things!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYG4EVK6FC369/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJS6G#wasThisHelpful","RYG4EVK6FC369","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"60 Quick Cowls is a vibrant and charming collection of cowls the reader can make using merino/alpaca blend yarns. What a wow of a book! If you have some familiarity with knitting, there will be plenty of projects for you to try. The projects are all gorgeous; soft and pretty. A cowl knits up fast and is definitely fashion-forward, just as the book says. The projects range in skill level from one to four (a ""four"" level project is one where the knitter is able to work patterns with complicated shaping and finishing). Most of the projects are on a level two to three range. All the projects call for Cloud or Duo Yarns from Cascade. Cascade is a family owned business which was founded in 1987 and is going strong. It is no wonder, either, when you see the amazingly chic and lovely cowls offered in 60 Quick Cowls.The book opens with a fun section explaining where alpaca comes from. Called ""Peruvian Gold"", alpacas are also raised in North America. They are very light on their feet and barely harm the environment in any way. They are sweet, gentle animals who are members of the Camilid family. They are directly descended from vicunas. If you have never felt vicuna fabric, you are not alone, as this fabric is very expensive and rare. It was originally guarded like treasure. It is still used sparingly. Only Incan royalty could wear it for years. Alpaca is nearly as soft. It is called ""the cashmere of the Andes"".Once the reader has been introduced to the alpaca, it's on to the projects! A real advantage of this book is that the cowls are photographed in two ways in practically every instance. The first photo will depict the model holding the cowl, completely knit in her hands, so you can see a view of it straight on. The second photo is a larger, brilliant close up of the same model wearing the cowl. It is easy to picture yourself all cosied up and looking equally as fashionable, using these photos and your imagination.One hardly knows where to begin when choosing from these cowls. Each one has flair and personality. You may like the look of ""Leaning Tower"" a tall, diagonally ridged cowl knitted of vanilla colored baby alpaca/ merino wool, designed by Cheri Esper. This is a second level project and looks snug, warm, and perfect for a winter day.  Perhaps you want something more dramatic which you might like wearing indoors and out. The cowl shown captured by a brooch, called ""Entrelac Blocks"", designed by Rosemary Drysdale, could be just your style. It is a ridge stitch cowl with a woven look. Meant for third level knitters, the yarns used are Cascade's merino wool/ baby alpaca in plum and anemone. What a sophisticated look!Second level knitters will fall in love with the cape-like mood of ""Bold Shoulders"", complete with a turtleneck, and a decorative bobble design which is really pretty in dusty teal.

"Four mountains, one man's experience: The Sacred Mountains of ChinaIn the Sacred Mountains of China, An Epic Human-Powered Adventure through a Remote World, Ryan Pyle recounts the story of his experiences as he trekked the Minya Konka, the Amne Machin, Mount Kailash, and the Kawa Karpo mountains. He completed these treks in a grueling period of four months in 2013. These sacred mountains each gave him different experiences which effectively changed him. Already a thoughtful, intelligent man with a great love and respect for nature, when he was done with this mammoth undertaking, he realized that when he is in the mountains, it ""feels like going home"". It enables him to ""press the reset button"" so that he can deal with life. If you read the book, Sacred Mountains of China, you will be following his footsteps every step of the journey. It's a fascinating, worthwhile trip which few have taken.The book is divided into sections. The first one is called, ""The Concept Develops"". The author explains what a kora is, and that it means you travel around a mountain instead of climbing it. That is what he did when he encircled each of these sacred mountains. He did this respectfully, however not for religious reasons. This section is where he explains that he decided to do the four treks in four months; between July and October. Each mountain would present a different set of challenges. The author would be looking forward to different climates, different topography, and different experiences concerning each one.Minya Konka is the first of the mountains around which he travels. This beautiful mountain is the highest mountain in the Sichuan Province. As with each mountain in the book, the reader is shown a map of the trek. Some consider this mountain to be one of the most beautiful places on earth, but climbing it proves it to be one of the deadliest. Fortunately the author does not intend to climb it. However, as with all the mountains, he has high altitudes to traverse and incredible weather changes to deal with on an almost moment to moment basis. He will awake freezing, and an hour later be sweating in the hot sun. The reader will be interested to find small framed off sections scattered through the book. These deal with interesting, single facts. They present and cover such things as ""Yaks"", ""Tibetan time"" and ""Shangri-La"". One I especially loved was the ""Tibetan high-altitude gene"".The second mountain which Pyle trekked is Amne Machin. As with all the mountains he was worried he wouldn't get the photographs he needed for this book. The mountains are often completely covered with clouds. He had to leave a lot up to nature. While traveling around this mountain, he saw a couple performing a religious ritual called prostration. His description of this is interesting and humbling. One of the things I particularly admire concerning this book is the way the author treats the people he meets and travels with. He is not fast to judge other cultures.Mount Kailash is the third mountain the author trekked. The glaciers on this mountain are the source of many rivers, and some of the longest rivers in Asia. It is forbidden to attempt to climb to the summit of Mount Kailash.It was while trekking this mountain that the author awoke one day to total white-out conditions.They carried on anyway, ascending as they walked. Although it was incredibly difficult, as the author says, ""It helped that there weren't any moments on any of the treks that I was afraid for my life."" It may have helped, but his descriptions are still quite harrowing at times. At other times, they are very uplifting.The last mountain of the four is Kawa Karpo, the highest mountain in Yunnan Province. There were some complications during this trek involving borders which made it difficult in a different way. It was interesting to read how the author solved these problems and was able to complete his trek.Throughout each trek, the reader is there with the author, experiencing the biting snow, the brilliant sun, and the freezing nights. I felt an immediacy to this recounting which was very real and honest.Each time I came to the photographs offered in Sacred Mountains of China, I was able to understand with even more depth why Ryan Pyle does what he does. Each view of each mountain is poetic and  breathtaking. Each photo is a moment in time, of the people and places who were on this remarkable journey. The photos are presented to us in an openhearted, beautiful way, just as this book is openhearted and wholly beautiful. Sacred Mountains of China, An Epic Human-Powered Adventure through a Remote World, by Ryan Pyle is a super book for anyone who loves adventures and likes to study the world and its lesser known regions. Ryan Pyle is an explorer in the classic sense. The reader will be too, if he or she chooses to join him by reading this remarkable book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SK8LRH6KROM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0992864410#wasThisHelpful","R22SK8LRH6KROM","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beautiful ElementsCreative Components to Personalize Your Jewelryby Heather PowersBeautiful Elements, by Heather Powers shows you how to add your own creative touches to your jewelry using metal, clay, and wire.In her introduction, the author discusses the ""raw materials"" which will play a part in her book. Then she adds, ""The most important raw material you possess is your own creativity"". If you agree with that observation (and I do), and take joy in experimenting with simple materials in exciting new ways, this book will completely appeal to you. The first section concerns the Basics. The reader who is planning to try her hand at the projects will be working with metal, wire, chain, all kinds of beads, polymer clay, fibers, patinas, inks, liver of sulphur, and other materials. Techniques for jewelry making, preparing polymer clay, and using metal are illustrated in excellent step out photos. An easy to use tool kit is set up for the reader, as is a polymer clay kit. They are clear and complete. Included as well is a section called ""beyond the basics"" which notes a few more tools you might want for your studio.Beautiful Elements, Creative Components' first set of projects will teach you how to sketch on metal. You are taught the technique, and offered four complete projects to try, using freeform sketched metal as the focus. I particularly liked the ""Sketched Metal Toggle Bracelet"", because the wire wrapped pearls look so pretty paired with the copper toggle with its wildflower design. I get such delight from Heather's love of nature and her expressive style.The next section is titled ""Add Detail to Metal"". You will learn advanced metal sketching, how to make polymer clay tipped head pins, and how to create gorgeous wrapped beads with a bit of wire and brilliant colored sari silk. Then it is on to the projects, where they are all combined. You will have a hard time deciding what to make first. Everything is beautiful in this author's world. I loved her earrings from this section; they are as appealing as ripe fruit heavy on the branch. Her ""cover girl"" bracelet, the ""Reflecting Motif Bracelet"" is in this section too, and it is a knockout. This author thinks in ways which reach out to the reader and welcome her in to the whole wide world. It is a lovely quality for any artist to have.The next section, ""Add Shape & Texture"" invites you to ""create textured leaves that offer rustic charm"" and ""wreath-like links embellished with berry headpins"". These are very beautiful and a signature aspect of the author's style, to me. Wait until you see the unique ""Dangle & Drop Earrings"" you will be making! With dangling copper leaves and purple and gold clay head pin drops, they fall from entwined wreaths in a very striking manner. They are super! The following necklace and bracelet employing the techniques and colorways offered in this section are just as pretty; both rustic and wild.Following this is ""Create Mirrored Imagery"". I was very interested to see this section because what the author wrote invites the reader in. As she says,""Sketch pine branches onto metal with a riveting hammer and create tiny pine cones with a ball peen hammer. Bring the evergreen imagery into three dimensions with molded beads made from real pinecones. Reflect the evergreen theme with needle-shaped beads and teal colored patina."" I found this to be a magical way of describing the remarkable things that we can do when we make beautiful jewelry.This section covers sketching an evergreen metal branch and making molded beads (using a little pine cone). The resulting bracelet is wonderfully expressive of the woods, with Czech dagger beads as accents, looking like pine needles, a beautiful hand made toggle clasp with a pine needle theme you will create, one of the pretty polymer pine cone beads front and center, and some round green/blue ceramic beads all wired together. What a gorgeous display! Two different earring projects and a knockout necklace follow.The section called ""Make Charms & Drops"" had me completely mesmerized as I, like many others, love to create small designs which pack a very individualistic punch. You will learn how to make adorable metal leaf charms (like oak leaves) and acorn head pins. Combined with Czech glass pressed flowers and leaves, these make a very pretty earthy necklace, using the technique we learned of making an embellished wreath. Love this! The following project is for matching earrings. Finally, there is an offering for a beautiful double stranded oak leaf bracelet with charms. It couldn't be prettier! Wait! There's more! The oak leaf sister bracelet, the ""Balanced Bracelet""  is a different take on the metal oak leaves, and it may just take your breath away. It is totally stunning. Finally in this section we come to a front closing necklace which uses the oak leaf for its toggle which you wear in front. I particularly like the rutilated quartz sticks in this necklace. Overall, what a pretty collection.I cannot think of anything more fun than the section which comes next. It is called ""Add Color With Custom Beads"". These hibiscus buds are made from polymer clay and alcohol inks in an assortment of blues, pinks and plums. Gorgeous beads! You will shortly be making my favorite pendant of all, the ""Pretty Pendant"", which has a clutch of charms (including a hibiscus, potent in magenta) in pinks and coppers, as well as copper chain wired up with crystals. It looks like a forgotten treasure hanging from a forest branch. The earrings and the other necklaces here are just as gorgeous.The final section is titled ""Play with Textures And Patterns"".  This section is very valuable and helpful if you are interested in learning how to transfer patterns from the world around you to the polymer clay beads you are making. The author explains bead shapes and caps and offers projects using what has been taught. I especially liked the ""Color-Block Bouquet Bracelet and Earrings"". It is very feminine and interesting at the same time.At the end of the book, you aren't left in the lurch: there are templates available in all sizes for the reader's use. They will come in very handy as I expect you will love this super new book by Heather Powers, Beautiful Elements, Creative Components to Personalize Your Jewelry, and will be as excited to read it and learn from it as I have been.I am very happy that Heather has once again offered us such a beautiful and inspiring book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFNUUT9BLGYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627002057#wasThisHelpful","RVFNUUT9BLGYN","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tumi Alpha 2 Carry-On 4 wheel Garment Bag is a really well thought out travel partner for anyone looking for a garment bag or even just a suitcase. It can be packed both ways. It is pricey but it's worth it. I haven't seen such a beautiful bag since I was a kid. At that time, people got their luggage and frequently kept it the rest of their lives. It saw a person straight through school and onward. This Tumi Alpha 2 has the chops to deliver, if you want a lifelong bag.I like the fact that it is made from ballistic nylon, which has been around since DuPont developed it for flak jackets in WW II. That is a huge plus, as ballistic nylon is extremely durable. It is really tightly woven. I don't know the weight of the nylon on this bag, but it is extremely tough. Every zipper, every buckle and even the wheels are built to be as sturdy as the bag itself. They meet the standard which Alpha 2 sets. Even the interior is well designed. Parts of it are waterproof, such as two see through bags you can detach, and hold by their  black nylon handles, if you want toiletry bags for your trip. There is a lot of handsome leather trim as well, including the Tumi ""declaration"" which is posted in my photos. That appears inside the bag. There is a great leather luggage tag and a tiny framed section on the outside of the bag you can use additionally to give your information unobtrusively, in case you want a separate way to identify your bag.  The telescoping handle is awesome. There are three locking positions you get when you depress the button on the handle. It zips out of sight when not needed. You simply press the button and pack it back on the top to the side, where there is a special zippered pocked for it. Then you can carry your bag, using the tough rubber-like secondary handle imprinted with the name Tumi, right onto the plane. This bag is designed to fit down the aisles, and to be carried on if you wish. The wheels are easy to maneuver and not at all unsteady. They are nicely designed and well protected so they won't break.Their are some great exterior pockets for last minute items you might want to bring.This bag is expensive, however it is beautiful in form as well as function.  I have tried Tumi before and I am very happy with their products.  They seem to really care about their customers' needs.I would consider this as a gift for someone heading off on his or her honeymoon, or for someone who needs a bag for a first job which requires a lot of traveling. It would also be greatly appreciated by anyone at holiday time.Tumi's Alpha 2 Carry-On 4 Wheel Garment Bag is a terrific example of mindful quality. This is hands-down a totally super looking, hard working bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3TDSIMPRGMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQBU4WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3G3TDSIMPRGMP","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Armitron Sport Men's Digital Chronograph Black Resin Strap Watch is a gorgeous watch for a guy. It is quite large and has the advantage of being very easy to read. It gives you the day and date as well as the time. It has a comfortable resin strap (and case). It provides you with military time, dual time, can time laps and has a backlight feature. I like that it is waterproof to 330 feet. However, it is not suitable for scuba diving.This is an all around good looking watch. I love watches, and the Armitron Sport Men's 40/8309RED Grey Cased Digital Chronograph Black Resin Strap Watch looks like it is worth far more than the asking price. It has a very handsome face--I love the orangey-red trim and the grey against the black! This is the perfect watch for the gym or for when you are running. This is more than just a throwaway watch.

In this version, the 2015 snowman is bringing home his own Christmas tree, with his holly berry scarf flying behind him in the wind.

"Simple Soldering, A Beginner's Guide to Jewelry Making, by Kate Ferrant Richbourg is a complete course in soldering. It is taught with all the clarity and enthusiasm for which the author is famous. The reader learns to solder from this book (assisted throughout by the two hour accompanying DVD). Then he or she is offered some wonderful projects which progress in complexity. All of them are beautiful and add major incentive to master each technique being taught.The first part of the book devotes itself to the basics of soldering. Every step of the way, the author is a reassuring presence. The reader will learn how to set up a work space, what tools will be needed for a ""Solder Setup"", and the additional materials needed. You are provided with everything necessary to know how to proceed from the idea of being a jewelry maker, to the actuality. Even the littlest questions you may have are discussed in sidebars. And always, safety is a factor in the equation, in Simple Soldering.I was knocked out by the method of learning devised by the author. I have never seen anything like it. It is wonderful. What the reader is presented with is a step by step sampler to learn the different methods required in soldering. You go through the sampler projects one by one, until you have completed the entire sampler.When you are finished, you have sixteen little squares, each of which has taught you a technique you need to know for soldering. These can be mounted and framed like a picture, or made into a linked necklace. Personally I would go for the necklace, because the little squares, which have served to instruct so well, are very beautiful. They each measure 1"" by 1"" and use copper as the base.  When linked up they would look incredibly hip and fascinating. What a way to learn and what a way to show the world what you now know!The second part of the book is comprised of projects which will add to your understanding of soldering. It plays an irreplaceable part in jewelry design. The projects go from easiest to most complicated. It is the hope of the author that the reader will start with the beginning project, and learn by making each succeeding one in order. In this way the reader masters every aspect of what is being taught seamlessly.This is where the Sampler you created in part one really shows its stuff. Each project refers back to the Sampler squares which you made (and are probably wearing on your neck right now, and maybe sleeping in it, too! I plan to!).The first project is the ""Hook & Eye Clasp"" and the ""Dapped Bead Caps"". In this project, you will be referring to techniques you learned from Sampler square 2 (Texturing) and Sampler square 14 (Shaping and soldering domes). Isn't this method of teaching wonderfully fun? As you progress, you will be making beautiful rings, chain earrings, a lovely pendant with a pearl dangle, stack rings, cool ear wires you would never be able to find in any store, a stunning soldered key pendant, and more. Each project has the charm of artisan style. The hand crafted look is very evident and completely appealing. None of the designs are anything less than keenly beautiful. Kate Ferrant Richbourg is not only one of our greatest instructors, she is one of our greatest designers.When you reach the end of Simple Soldering, A Beginner's Guide to Jewelry Making you will want to keep this super book close by your side for reference. It will be able to help you always, now that you have made the leap from learning to designing using soldering. What a treasure this book and DVD set is. Soldering becomes accessible and fun, with the help of this terrific book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28IC31P6P0SC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596685506#wasThisHelpful","R28IC31P6P0SC6","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AT-A-GLANCE Professional Monthly Planner for 2016 is just what I wanted.It is the solution to shaping up my desk clutter and getting organized. Perhaps, like me, you have appointments already scheduled for next year.  Are you are writing them on your wall calendar (or maybe just writing them on your wall? I have done that). For some reason these past few years I have taken to crowding them into one day--the last day of the year. They are all piled up on Dec. 31, 2015. I can't even decipher them very well. Now, though, I am turning a new page. With this pretty, large ( 8.5 x 11 Inches!), soft-colored lavender planner I will be able to see what's up for me at lot more efficiently, day by day.It is roomy and attractive, with a charming but non-intrusive flower theme. The high quality paper used prevents bleed-through. This is a big help if you are on the phone with the office and suddenly need to grab the nearest pen to jot down something you have to remember. And the nearest pen is a red Sharpie. Even if you do this ( I do this!) you won't have Sharpie marks on the other side of the paper when you flip the page.The months are divided into different colors of paper--one for winter, one for spring, one for summer and one for fall. The tabs on the side assist you when you flip through so you can find the date you wish to write on right away.Another good thing you can do with this sizeable planner is to use it for your diary. I used to keep a journal every year, starting from the age of 16. The dated planner notebooks I used for this were very similar to this planner. I simply wrote down what I had done that day, every night before I went to sleep. It was a ritual which had a comforting continuity to it. If you have a college age daughter or grand daughter, she might like trying to chronicle her days in that manner, too. Someday she might have fun looking back over her collection of notebooks.A planner like this is also perfect for older people who need all their info in one place. As it is big, if a lady doesn't have her reading glasses close by. she won't be at a loss.  If you are a business person, it is suitable as well. It has plenty of room for your daily and weekly appointments. You will be able to see them at a glance.I have already started using my planner, marking important birthdays so I don't forget them. I am going to transfer those 2016 appointments next.I really like everything about this planner. It is attractive, soft to the touch, and very well made. It is definitely a high quality planner. I am already looking forward to 2016 with the AT-A-GLANCE Professional Monthly Planner ready and waiting prettily on my desk!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKPSPHKA5GCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWVTSOY#wasThisHelpful","R1DKPSPHKA5GCW","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was no shrinking (I washed in warm, with a cold rinse). Both the towel and washcloth look great after hanging to dry. The towel has a loop so you can hang it out to dry when camping. The set is really gorgeous looking--I chose the emerald green. The washcloth has the logo of the Wanderluxe company embossed into the fibers. The towel and the washcloth are well bound and edged in steel-grey colored trim.This set is great for campers, bicycle enthusiasts, and anyone who loves to be outdoors.It is also good for bringing to the gym. Wanderluxe's Travel Towel set is really light in weight and compact. What a cool large towel and a washcloth you get, in such an easy to stow and carry little bag. This is a great gift for the adventurer in your family.It is an awesome set!I received mine in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBJEQPFG8N2RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XCRIKO#wasThisHelpful","RBJEQPFG8N2RO","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hefty is a brand I like and use all the time. I haven't seen these Renew bags locally yet, but I really appreciate the fact that they are 65% recycled plastic. They are worth ordering. We have always saved boxtops for children here at home, and you get the opportunity to collect those as well when you choose Hefty Renew Recycled Plastic Tall Kitchen Drawstring Bags. These bags are exactly like the ones I was using, right down to the count in the box (45), and the convenient drawstring. They are grey, not white. This change in color doesn't bother me. I am glad this company is contributing in this manner to recycling. It is a great way to care for our planet. Our children will be following in our footsteps. It is good to model mindful behavior for them, even in the little things. They add up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYDLZZ6JM9XY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR4TTG0#wasThisHelpful","RYDLZZ6JM9XY0","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Invicta Men's 21446 Pro Diver Analog Display Japanese Quartz Black Watch is very good looking. I love Invicta designs; they are always very handsome and appealing. This watch has a comfortable polyurethane strap which makes it slightly more sporty and casual looking. The face of the watch is great. It is gold plated stainless steel ringed with a cool green to black marker. It is truly unique looking. It has a luminous dial and is water resistant to 330 feet. I doubt anyone would really use this as a pro diver watch. Rather, it seems they are referring to the style and look of this Invicta's men's watch, not its function.I received mine in a navy box instead of the yellow box shown when you look at the watch offered here. Just a heads up.At these prices, Invicta cannot be beat. Having a watch with a nice Japanese Quartz movement, and a stainless steel 18 k ion-plated gold face this lovely is a bargain, if this is to your taste. Great gift!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3NHQ1ASGU23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XPV6#wasThisHelpful","R3I3NHQ1ASGU23","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this at a much higher cost at my local pharmacy. I am growing out my hair. I wanted to see if a new shampoo would help gear up my enthusiasm during this awkward ""in between"" time of having no hairstyle to speak of.The shampoo went on great, with nice suds. However after rinsing, it left my hair dull and somewhat dry. Where were the great conditioning properties of Argan Oil? I didn't notice anything.It actually stripped my hair a bit.I will use up this bottle, however I won't purchase this product again.I also tried a leave in conditioner from the same company.

"I am very pleased with the purity and high quality of Sabai Wellness' Lavender Essential Oil.This soothing scent is carefully crafted from Lavandula Angustifolia and Lavandula Latifolia. Always look for the Latin names of the flowers, when you are buying essential oils: they indicate that the oils distilled from them are truly legitimate.Lavender oil can be used for many purposes. I like Sabai Wellness Lavender essential oil especially in my diffuser. The fragrance calms me as I drift off to sleep.I also have tried a suggestion from a friend of mine. I added a few drops to a clean washcloth and tossed it in the dryer. My laundry has never smelled so fabulous!Lavender oil is a wonderful essential oil to keep around for quick stress relief. It is like having serenity in a bottle!I carry Sabai Wellness Lavender oil in my purse when I travel. I put a little on my hands and inhale the calming scent when I am in crowded places and becoming bothered by large groups of people. It helps to ground me and give me peace.I have not tried ingesting it yet but many people do. I am considering adding it to my tea (you can even use it to bake with!). Lavender oil is recommended to enhance flavor enjoyment, and also to aid in alleviating digestive complaints.There are tons of ways to use Lavender essential oil!The purity of Sabai's product, this delightful Premium, High End Pure Undiluted French Lavender Essential Oil, is trusted by me.I love this wonderful wonder worker!I was provided with this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA0C7G13KZ7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N78I6HQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WA0C7G13KZ7C","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This analog watch has a gorgeous high end appearance. Invicta goes all out with presentation.The Invicta Men's 19241 Specialty Analog Display Japanese Quartz Gold Watch arrives double boxed in glamorous yellow, to wow the recipient.  There is an impressive outer box in yellow, and within is found a second yellow colored sueded box. The inner box holds this beautiful man's watch. The effect upon opening, both breathtaking and exciting, is one of luxury and good taste. This is not a flashy, cheap watch. It is a well designed, high end analog watch.What is an analog watch? Simply put, an analog watch is one in which the display is not digital. Look at the face of this watch. The time is indicated by the continuous motion of rotating hands pointing to numbers arrayed on the circular dial. The hour hand's movement is analogous to the path of the Sun across the sky. There you go: that is what an analog watch is.However, there is more to this watch. It also has chronograph functions, with 60 second, 60 minute and 24 hour subdials. It has a luminous band to light up the bezel at night.The case and band are comprised of gold plated stainless steel.The Invicta Men's 109241 has a Japanese quartz movement. The Japapese are second only to the Swiss in this area. They are catching up fast. A Japanese quartz movement denotes high quality timekeeping these days. While researching Japanese quartz movements vis a vis Swiss quartz movements, I learned this online: ""Japanese quartz is known for accuracy, and was used as the official timekeeper at many Olympic games"". The Japanese quartz movement is a fine, slightly less expensive but close competitor to the Swiss quartz movement. Both are considered supremely accurate. You can be proud to own this Invicta, or to give it. Not only is it good looking, it will be dependable. It is not going to let you down in the time keeping department.This watch is not for the shy. It is very glamorous in design. It is a bold looking, very masculine watch.The sapphire dial with its gold accents is especially beautiful to look at. I love the elegant layout of the 60 second, 60 minute, and 24 hour subdials. They are useful as well as entrancing to look at. The body of the watch, heavily matte gold plated stainless steel, has a elegant and comfortable adjustable bracelet. If you are looking for a gift for the man in your life, look no further! This big gorgeous chunk of a watch, shining brilliant in gold and blue, will be loved by him for years to come. It comes with a guarantee, and is water resistant to over 300 feet. The Invicta Men's 19241 Specialty Analog Display Japanese Quartz Gold Watch is a watch to depend on. A beautiful man's watch for a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FT6G9YF7YQ76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTOIPSC#wasThisHelpful","R2FT6G9YF7YQ76","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has a ""following"", as has the toothpaste by the same company!The Natural Dentist Antigingivitis Rinse for Gums obviously isn't a substitute for visiting your dentist when you need to.

"The Secret Lives of Bats: My Adventures with the World's Most Misunderstood Mammals, is a wonderful book. I have recommended this delightful and informative adventure story to everyone.Merlin Tuttle is a great storyteller and a fount of knowledge on bats. He is open, honest and charming as he relates the remarkable history of his life as a bat enthusiast.Having studied bats for more than fifty years, his passion and love for these creatures is evident. He started Bat Conservation International back in 1982. Tuttle, one of the foremost educators in this field, is a dedicated scientist, and ecologist. He is a heck of a terrific human being.There is no self indulgence  in this charmingly related history of  Merlin Tuttle's lifelong love of bats. Rather it is funny, fun and informative. If you know little about bats you will love learning lots with Tuttle as your teacher! If you like animal stories, such as those by Durrell, Mowat, and Herriot, this book's perspective will pull you right in. If you love adventure, close encounters with danger, tons of fun, and even scares with wild and woolly tales of moonshiners and other offbeat sorts, come along for the ride. This compassionate teacher will open to you all of the beauty and all that is fine about our own species as well as bats. The years it spans add to the flavor of the book, as the author learns from childhood about bats and their nature. You are given amazing, evolving insight into  the secret world  of bats from start to finish.Ultimately you will be moved by the nobility of this book. People seem to bring out the best in each other, united in their fascination with Tuttle's love for bats. It is a delight.This a positive story which is real, fun and true. It is very educational as well. The Secret Lives of Bats: My Adventures with the World's Most Misunderstood Mammals is an upbeat gem from a great nature writer.There is something  enduring about The Secret Lives of Bats which everyone who reads it will adore.Bats are beautiful to me now, thanks to Merlin Tuttle..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F28BTD7XV1GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544382277#wasThisHelpful","R1F28BTD7XV1GH","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To say I like this company is to put it mildly. I think they are one of the leaders in the health and beauty industry. Their focus, to me seems targeted toward the older demographic (which I fit into). However,  the InstaNaturals line is surely great as well, for younger skin.  It is downright perfect for ,my dull, dry, aging skin in particular though! Light up your face by using this lovely night cream! As it says, it ""hydrates and plumps skin"". My skin has never felt so soft.I would not use this right after exfoliating (it will sting a little if you have sensitive skin like me, but the sting goes away fast). I use this instead after toning, and using serum, at night.  It smooths right on after you deliver it by way of a cleverly designed pump. You don't need much but do add some to your neck and even your decollete. The improvement in even skin tone is almost instantaneous.The scent is not very pretty, however it dissipates rapidly. I can feel the effects of this night cream on the surface of my skin hours after I have applied it. It works through the night very well, lasting through the hours until you wake up refreshed and ready to greet the day with your fresh, pretty and radiant skin!

"Effective and pleasantly scented with oranges, this product by InstaNaturals is a winner! Their Pro-Radiant Skin Brightening Serum is just wonderful for my aging skin. I was surprised to see the orange color of the serum but you don't care about the color after you see the beautiful effects of this treatment on your skin.  When I used this for the first time, I felt an immediate softening of my skin. You do not need to use much as it goes a long way. Orange or not, it pampers your facial skin and prepares it for your night cream, or for moisturizers and makeup.My skin looks more refined since I have been using this serum. I notice that my fine lines are lessening, possibly due to some of the ingredients. I am thrilled about that as I am in my sixties. It is never too late to care for your skin!

"InstaNatural's Vitamin C Facial Toner is a wonderfully refreshing skin toner. I have found that it instantly gives my complexion a wake up call, but without any sting to it. It is comfortably soothing to sensitive skin. However you can tell that your skin is being treated to a pore tightening, cleansing, and refining toner. I am pleased to have this toner to use on the days I am not doing a deep exfoliating cleanse. It is very calming and has the lovely scent of oranges, due to the Vitamin C it contains.Vitamin C Facial Toner is simple to use. I just spray it on a cotton pad and gently pat it off.

"What a wonderful and well designed product  LaMagia's Essential Oil Diffuser  is!LaMagia went above and beyond in thinking the design and intention of this diffuser through.I have found this product to be everything I could possibly want in a home essential oil diffuser. I can see it easily being used in a spa, as well.I like the ease of set up and the excellent, high quality sturdiness.The mist from the diffuser can be controlled to your liking, as can the dispersal of the essential oil you choose to use.People are growing more and more aware of alternative ways to reduce the stress and strain of daily living. A diffuser is one way you can do something luxurious and calming for yourself in a fairly inexpensive way.The design of LaMagia's diffuser is really excellent. The cord fits into its own slot in the bottom. A water cup is thoughtfully provided to measure the water used for misting and dispersing. The unit shuts off when the water well is empty, so you don't need to worry about that.The cleaning instructions are clear and easy to follow.The colors are amazing--I wish I could photograph them all! I am mesmerized by them. They are beautiful and relaxing to watch.Essential oil (which is not included) is getting more popular as we all learn more about aromatherapy and alternative medicine. It is worth researching. I have been doing just that because of this lovely diffuser.Do something good for yourself and give yourself the gift of  LaMagia's well made, pretty and sleek diffuser, The peace and tranquility you will get in return will be more than worth it. The LaMiglia diffuser affects in a positive manner your sense of smell, and what you see in your surroundings as well,It is a great investment in well-being!This diffuser would make a delightful wedding gift or birthday present for someone you love.note: I was provided with this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PN69FW1RPS3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W0EV0O#wasThisHelpful","R1PN69FW1RPS3A","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first Proactiv+ product I have tried. However I have a number of friends who swear by this line of products, both for their own beauty regimens, and also for the young adults in the family.I don't have acne but I chose this cream because over time it should  clarify and even out my skin tone. As a woman in her sixties, having great skin tone and having a glowing complexion is a  big priority of mine.So far, here is what I have found.It is not too harsh for my skin ( and I have fair, sensitive skin).It goes on in a very pleasant way and sinks in fast. No residue is left.It really keeps my skin feeling noticeably softer.I think the main ingredients are not only effective for acne (as I have learned from people I am friends with), but possibly act to exfoliate your skin. If not overdone, and it isn't overdone by Proactive+  in their Clarifying Night Cream, your skin should look and feel softer, clearer, less blotchy and prettier in general.It has given me a luminosity I am pleased with.I am proud of my skin and always try to treat it right as I continue to get older.

"The Char-Broil Standard Digital Electric Smoker is a high quality, mindfully designed product. Let it be your partner-in-arms as you try out smoking ribs, pork and other meats. It is fun and almost effortless!I was interested in the Char-Broil Standard Digital Electric Smoker for a couple of reasons.1) We eat out less because of the expense of going out, but we love good food2) We are learning to enjoy cooking as a hobby.When I first considered ordering it, I looked up health concerns, as smoking meats brings up the subject of carcinogens. From what I read online, smoked meat, when eaten in moderation, has negligible ill effects. Just don't over do it.My other worry was whether or not the smoker would give off heat. However it is cool to the touch and therefore safe around children (who should be supervised around it anyway, obviously). Once my mind was put at ease. I was totally gung ho to try it. I have not been disappointed yet!It is easy to use. Set up was a breeze, with no assembly required. It is spacious and nicely designed. It has four racks and holds tons of food at one time!  The Char-Broil Standard Digital Electric Smoker has a useful and efficient digital thermometer, automatic shut off, and easy rolling wheels.If you like to throw parties it is perfect as you can cook for a crowd.I am still trying out different recipes (yes, I watch the Food Network) but eventually I plan to have that big party. I am all for staycations at home these days for economic reasons. This smoker really helps you rediscover the pleasures of decompressing by hanging out with friends, something cool to drink, and some great eats in your own backyard.I am very happy with this standard edition of the Char-Broil Standard Digital Electric Smoker.The only difference with the standard is a) it is black instead of stainless and b) it doesn't have a front window so you can't look inside...You are just going to have to be surprised. ;)I have tried smoked chicken, which came out deliciously. It makes great leftovers for use in salads. I also tried smoked baby back ribs with a rub. I used mesquite wood chips for that and they came out amazing. I love the wood chips and want to try apple next. WoodChar-Broil Mesquite Wood Chips chips are easier to use with this smoker; a great advantage over some of the other smokers where you have to change the chips more often.The Char-Broil Standard Digital Electric Smoker is a wonderful addition for the avid food lover. It would be a thoughtful and much appreciated gift for newlyweds, if they have the room for it. It is pretty, large, and sturdy, with a really nice design. Once you get one, you can't imagine how much enjoyment you will get from the yummy meals you will be making yourself. I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0VT5HQSG98N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMRXY06#wasThisHelpful","RT0VT5HQSG98N","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"FINE ART WIRE WEAVING, Weaving Techniques for stunning jewelry designs, by Sarah Thompson, is a breathtakingly beautiful introduction to the art of wire weaving.The book isn't just about the beauty of this jewelry however, although it has that in spades. It also delivers a solid, concise learning base for the reader. You can see just from the cover photo alone how amazing fine art wire weaving is, when taught by author Sarah Thompson. Her step-by-step instructions are clear and understandable. The photos of the projects are totally gorgeous.You will be seeing rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. Some are fashioned from wire alone. Some have gems, pearls or crystals as a part of the design, front and center or as accents. Many of the projects have really fine variations. You get your money's worth when you purchase  FINE ART WIRE WEAVING! There is a holistic sensibility to these woven wire designs,  They are classic in form yet have gorgeous leaps of freedom and wildness. Sarah Thompson balances artful tension and control, backed up by her dynamite originality .  FINE ART WIRE WEAVING  is very  complete, containing not only the projects, but lists of materials,tools, ways to fix mistakes (I love her for that!) and other great additions such as instructions with photos on how to make your own findings for your jewelry. There is also a resource section.The projects range from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so don't be afraid of this style of making jewelry. You will be able to make your own chic jewelry right away.There is nothing which isn't exceptional about  FINE ART WIRE WEAVING. I was immediately engaged by it.  Every detail is carefully thought out and explained. The author has translated her own experience and love of creating this style of jewelry into a treasure chest of inspiration for the reader.For example, in the earliest section of projects, for beginners, I found the ""Embrace"" adjustable ring. As the author says, ""This ring is beautiful on its own, but when combined with a splash of balled wire ends and an hint of a swirl, you get a wonderful, yet simple, adjustable ring.""  This is an understatement--I was blown away by the smashing artistry of her design! It is a knockout. Even better, as with her other designs, there is no sense that anything is forced. It is so great to see such intact design work, with no unnecessary extras clogging it up. All of the designs flow perfectly.When you reach the intermediate section, take a look at the Petal bracelet. This is an instant classic if I ever saw one. Made up of really cool components linked together, it will stop traffic whenever you wear it. Her variation, a pair of earrings made from the same components but with sexy fringe added, are divine!Speaking of earrings, check out the ""Scorpio"" earrings while you are at it. If you are like me, you are going to fall flat when you see these. I have never seen earrings so unique and incredible. Learning to make these earrings alone is worth the price of the book. This is great work from an outstanding teacher.Finally, to give you an idea of what you will find in the advanced section, take a look at the ""Kayla"" pendant. Employing different sizes of crystals, chain and a graceful symmetrical focal, it has a hand made clasp component to complete the elegance. Wear this one to meet the Queen!Or just hang out at home in it. It is perfect, either way.If you are intrigued by the look of woven wire (whether plain or set with gems and pearls) but don't know where to start, this will be a great work book to teach and inspire you. Perhaps you don't believe you have the skills to weave wire but would love to try it. With  FINE ART WIRE WEAVING, you will access the confidence to learn, as well the understanding to make your own woven wire jewelry. Sarah Thompson shares her knowledge with great generosity and flair.She wholeheartedly hands over the ""How To"" key to fine art woven wire.Classic chic, hip and fun,  Fine Art Wire Weaving  has it all going on!  Sarah Thompson is a wire wonder worker!Her book will entrance you, coax your creativity into full gear, and help you understand how to grow as a jewelry designer at every turn, twist, and swirl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYZ01EJ0K53P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632500256#wasThisHelpful","RMYZ01EJ0K53P","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch is flat out beautiful! I love watches for their looks as well as their performance, so I am as delighted with the look of this stylish watch as I am happy with its performance.It is a perfect watch to wear when you are swimming laps, as you can time yourself using it. Even better, the dial is very visible in every detail so you won't have to stop or waste time looking at it when you are working out. You can see it easily!It has a jelly strap so you have to expect somewhat of a sticky feel when you are wearing it on a hot summer day. I don't mind it, and it plays a part in the watch's cool look.If it begins to bother you, just jump in the water wearing it--because that is part of the fun of it--you can, with no worries!As a piece of jewelry, this watch will update your sporty style. It is a great wear alone piece, or would goes nicely with a simple sterling bracelet to accentuate and play up the lovely silver face.I am delighted with the Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch, and recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGVHXQ7027HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0QPTW4#wasThisHelpful","RKGVHXQ7027HF","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having loved all the Kneipp products for years, I tried the one I had overlooked before: Kneipp ""Pure Bliss Bath"". The sturdy bottle contains enough for 10 baths. That is a good value for a spa level treatment you can give yourself at home.I specifically turned to Kneipp because I was under the weather from stress and I trust the therapeutic value of their products. I chose the Pure Bliss because the box says. ""relaxes body and soul, with natural essential oils.""  The Kneipp line has many selections and normally I choose the Spruce & Pine (great in winter!) or the Lavender (great before bed) and recommend both of them as well.This oil is a clear deep tone of red when you first pour it into the cap in order to measure it. Make sure you already have some water filling the tub because it could stain otherwise.It disperses into a lovely pink tone.The scent is very soothing. It took away the headache I had, and calmed me noticeably the first time I used it.Pure Bliss Huile de Bain Instant Plaisir, with Red Poppy and Hemp (also known as Coquelicot (wild corn poppy) and Chanvre if you look the French up), relaxes you for the rest of your day.Who wouldn't love to have the gift of Pure Bliss?Lovely stuff!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8MZXU22XA4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C7MRBW#wasThisHelpful","R2S8MZXU22XA4X","A2K4HN6EECBNR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K4HN6EECBNR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"L'Occitane has long been offering this version of shea butter. The company had it way before shea butter was accepted by mainstream companies, who then added to their health and beauty lines, either as a stand alone ingredient or combined with other ingredients to make it fragrant or to make it cheaper.However, if you want the best, the most drenchingly moisturizing, the longest lasting skin (and even hair!) moisturizer, use this one. Shea butter comes from the nuts of the African Kante tree. It is a wonderful purveyor of Vitamin A.L'Occitaine's Pure Shea Butter is both organic and Fair Trade Approved.You can layer this product with L'Occitaine's lighter versions (their hand and foot creams which contain less shea, for example) but if you want the heavy hitter, get this: the one, the only, the original, by L'Occitaine.This product is great for dry cracked hands, feet, elbows, lips and, yes, dry hair!

I've done some very basic trimming of videos and minor manipulation of the contents before, but nothing advanced.

I'd recommend this for anyone starting out, but from what I can tell, it would also be appropriate for relatively advanced users. I'd give it five stars if the learning curve wasn't so steep.

"The Origami case for the Kindle Voyage is a tad bit on the heavy side, which is probably because it uses a lot of magnets--magnets for the cover to work properly and magnets to hold the Kindle in the shell. When it arrived, I was very disappointed, and planned to send it back the next day. I thought Amazon had really messed up with this monstrosity! But, not wanting to use the Kindle naked, I put it on until the replacement arrived.Weeks later, it's still on. I've owned all of the Kindles since the second version (including the DX) and had all of the Amazon cases. This is the best one I've ever had, even though I kind of wonder if I'd been better off going for something a bit more subdued than the greenish yellow ""Citron"" (I posted this there, but it shows up for some reason as a review for the purple case, which I don't own).There is one reason the case works so well for me: I have always enjoyed reading without holding my books. I set it up on the kitchen table and can read for hours over breakfast, or set it up on the table at a coffee shop while reading and freely taking notes. It's pure pleasure. Up until now, I've been using Kindles in conjunction with my BookGem stand (best book stand ever made), but now I can use that exclusively with my iPad, whose folding cover is slick, but won't let it stand up like the Kindle in portrait mode. I've also discovered that the origami case works wonderfully in bed as well, because it props up on its side at the perfect angle. As for protection, this thing is much more solid than any other Kindle case I've owned.You may not like this if you want to hold your Kindle while reading because of its weight and the weight distribution, though you could easily slip it in and out of its magnetic holster to read it in its birthday suit -- the case is not so heavy until you pick up the feather-weight Kindle and realize that whatever weight Amazon shaved off the device it shifted over to the case. In addition, if you don't like opening the case like a communicator from the old Star Trek shows (this is actually fun every time for me), then go for something else. Finally, I should mention that my fears about the magnets erasing credit cards or computer drives have so far been unnecessary. Between the magnets in my iPad + case and the magnets in this case for the Kindle I may be messing with compasses in the room :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTKHUJX1HL7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I14F19M#wasThisHelpful","RYTKHUJX1HL7B","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been pleased with Moshi products in the past, and I think this screen protector lives up to Moshi's reputation for excellence, but with one caveat: as so many other reviewers have mentioned, it is shiny.It is quite thick, fits the Kindle perfectly, is completely clear, and there isn't a single bubble. This is what I was looking for with it, so I am quite pleased.  I don't read outside so much, I read inside at an angle that is unaffected by the lights, and I read at night, so the reflectivity isn't a big deal to me; hence, the five stars.However, one of the selling points of the Kindle is it's readability in any lighting conditions, even direct sunlight. Why Moshi would make a product that would completely undermine the Kindle in this way is a mystery to me. Did they not read or view any of the Amazon advertisements over the last few years? Kindle owners who bought the Kindle to read outside had better stay away from this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FY0VDB881XUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7COAE#wasThisHelpful","R2FY0VDB881XUC","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had much experience with projectors, but judging by the quality of the  Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 3500 1080 Widescreen, HDMI, 3LCD, 2500 Lumens color brightness, 2500 lumens White Brightness, Projector I've been missing out on all this time. I'm coming from the perspective of a 42"" flat screen TV, which I was quite pleased with until I turned on the projector. Even against a flat white wall, it beats my TV hands down. It's not just the size, but the crisp resolution and the beautiful colors. I've read in the past about projectors that were criticized for being too dim, and I've certainly used my fair share of them with presentations, but I think Epson has overcome that obstacle here.It seems durable to me, though surprisingly heavy. I think you'll want to be careful if you intend to mount this on a ceiling. This isn't a complaint, by any means, but it must be packed with a lot of stuff for such a small thing to weigh this much. It is easy to set up and use. My only concern is the durability of the light, but I suppose it will outlast any TV I purchase, so I guess that is a relatively minor concern.Normally, when I do reviews, I try to point out the pros and cons of a device. I cannot find any cons at this point -- it has far exceeded my expectations, which might be because I've read so many lukewarm tech blog postings on projectors over the years and/or because Epson has raised the bar with this one. Either way, I doubt anyone will be disappointed by it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUN6A4I3HQO57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJTXW9A#wasThisHelpful","RUN6A4I3HQO57","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Incipio Journal Cover for Kindle Voyage, Black is a lot lighter than the official Kindle cover, but it is clearly not the same level of quality, and I don't think it is worth the price. It's true that it doesn't shut off your Kindle when you close the cover, but that isn't a big deal, because the Kindle will automatically shut off anyhow. The elastic bands and the unnecessary thickness bugged me. This doesn't even live up to the Amazon cover for the paperwhite, which is an old item.I'd recommend springing for the official cover. It is heavy, yes, and I am not a big fan of so many magnets, but it really works well -- protecting the device, looking good, and providing a stand.

"The Sony AZ1VR/W Action Camera Mini Kit with Live View Remote is a pretty good camera with no particular shortcomings, but when you consider the competition, it might be a difficult choice.PROS- Pretty tough. It gets banged around a bit, but no problems so far.- Water. I haven't tried it, but it says it can handle water, so that is good to know. It isn't, though, for underwater filming.- It's tiny and lightweight. Actually, it's amazing, and this is its strongest feature compared to the GoPro.CONS- The wristband is pretty bulky and the range isn't all that far; I'm not terribly keen on it. Theoretically, you could control 5 of these, but would you? Maybe I need to get some drones.- It's a bit of a pain to move files around. I guess now that so much on smart phones works seamlessly, having to mess around with cables seems antiquated.- Battery. It is very short-lived, but I guess that is the price you pay for the size.- Where is the SD card?SUMMARY- It's pretty good and about what you would expect from Sony at this price. The size and the remote on the wrist seems to be the differentiating factor, and if these are important to you, then you'll want to seriously consider it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2J8T1YXEMEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2KD9KI#wasThisHelpful","RD2J8T1YXEMEQ","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DeLonghi AC150 Energy Star Air Purifier with Ionizer, 150 Square Feet is a great product and I've got no complaints about it, but you'll want to think about the cost / coverage ratio.HARDWARENo problems so far with it. I loathe LED lights on stuff, because it means you can't use it in your bedroom at night, and they are just annoying. But, DeLonghi wisely gave users the options to turn these off. I wish other manufacturers would do the same with their products. Otherwise, there isn't much to say. It is a little bit stocky, but not terribly bulky. It runs quietly, and it seems to be doing something.THE PROBLEMThe problem is that I cannot figure out if it is working very well. It turns out that 150 square feet is a really, really small space. Perhaps it is our vaulted ceilings that is throwing it off, but I think the only place where it is really going to be able to circulate all of the air might be the bathroom or closets, where it is in a small, closed-off space. For some reason, the Vornado air purifier (175 feet of coverage) we have seems to be a lot more powerful for about the same money.SUMMARYThere is nothing bad to say about the unit itself. In fact, it seems quite nice. It's just that it is terribly underpowered for the price, and I think to cover our condo we'd need 7 or 8 of them. If you've got a small space, this is the unit for you, but if you live in a large space, or have vaulted ceilings, you might want to consider something that is more cost effective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78FRE62NCAWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXSBJ7Q#wasThisHelpful","R78FRE62NCAWE","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oster Kettle seemed kind of gimmicky with its transparent glass and lights. But, I was interested in it because there was no heating element inside, so I thought it might stay cleaner over time.What I discovered is that when I can see inside, it reminds me to clean it, and now I am a lot more careful to regularly empty the water and wipe it down.

It has a huge tank for water, it is not unbearably loud (compared to others in this price range), and it has plenty of adjustments to fit your use case.We have it in the living room, but I don't think it is a good idea to put it in the bedroom unless you like the sound of fans when you sleep (actually, I do). At the high settings, the fan noise is definitely noticeable. With a name like ""Vornado,"" you shouldn't expect whisper-quite. (By the way, the name always makes me think of ""Sharknado,"" but I digress.)I should also mention that it is surprisingly easy to fill, and I think it will probably fit easily under most kitchen faucets. I highly recommend this humidifier, and we've been pleased with it for everyday use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2XUWODK14KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00826ORV2#wasThisHelpful","R3K2XUWODK14KQ","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't know.They tasted a bit medicinal and I can't tell if it worked for the cough or had any more soothing effect than regular candies.

"The Panasonic ""Milano"" ER-GS60-S Self-Hair Clipper, Wet/Dry works exactly as expected. It is very lightweight, it cut my hair, and it cleaned up easily when I ran water over it.My only complaint would be that the battery seems a little weak. I expected it to be running strong by the end of my haircut (shaving off two or three inches of hair down to the number 4 setting), but it had grown noticeably weaker. Because of the way it is designed, you can't just plug it into the wall and keep going. It sits in a special stand, but ideally the cord for recharging would be separate from the stand and you could continue using it if the charge drains (my rechargeable razor works this way). It's not a big deal for me (I'll be cutting a lot less hair now that I shaved it all off), but if you have a family with two or three people who will use it, you might want to space out the haircuts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9E3WJFTXUO3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F89U5NK#wasThisHelpful","R9E3WJFTXUO3K","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kensington Corner Case is the best case I have ever owned, and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their iPad. It is also surprisingly inexpensive.I should explain that I have had iPads since the first one came out, and I have tried all sorts of products ranging from Apple's case for the original iPad (I liked it a lot, but later iterations were cheap and of lower quality) to the Kensington KeyFolio keyboard cases (I am not impressed with them). This inexpensive and simple (looking) case stands out from the rest.1. It is flexible.Unlike the hard Belkin cases I usually get, it isn't a rigid shell. Normally, you only find these kinds ""softer"" (and higher quality) plastic cases for phone-sized products.2. It is shaped to match the iPad Air.No extra case material where the case isn't needed, and the shape sticks out from the device ever so slightly so that buttons don't get accidentally pressed (i kept accidentally shutting off the iPad before when I had it flipped upside down in portrait charging -- no more of that now). It also has a lip that sticks up slightly higher than the screen so that if you lay the iPad flat on the table the screen will actually be resting a millimeter above the surface safe and sound. Worried about the shiny chamfered edges? Worry no more, because the majority of them are now covered.3. It is lightweight and unobtrusive.I barely notice it is on the iPad (I have the smoke case with the space gray iPad -- you'll probably want the clear case if you are a white iPad owner). I also have the Apple smart cover (green), which is now made without the metal hinges, so both the case and the cover now seem to get out of my way. One slight problem with the smart cover is that it used to adhere firmly to the back of the case instead of flapping around like previous smart cover models. However, with this case (as you would expect) the tiny magnets no longer work to hold it flat against the back -- sometimes it stays, and sometimes it doesn't. I think that is the price you have to pay for protection, though.4. It is tough.I hurled my iPad onto the concrete and it was fine. Just kidding! Unlike the hard Belkin cases, I do think if this were dropped from a few feet up onto a hard floor, the device might be more likely to survive unscathed, because there is more ""give"" in this case.My only recommendation to Kensington for improvement would be to somehow get rid of the ridge running around it (from the joining of the molds in production?), because it could be annoying. I've used the iPad for hours without being bothered in the slightest, but some people are quite sensitive to these ""sharp"" edges, and will not like it for that reason.[EDIT:] I just realized the Amazon image is quite misleading. Users should know that the Kensington branding is in white (on my smoke-colored case), not the smokey looking color they have shown in the image. I don't care much, but it isn't terribly good looking (can't they come up with a better logo?) , and scratching it off does not seem to be an option. You'll have to do some of Kensington's marketing for them if you want the case -- perhaps a tasteful sticker is in order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XVGFIAV3N6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEN9U8I#wasThisHelpful","R5XVGFIAV3N6V","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[ Update November 9]An unhelpful review?----------A lot of customers are marking this review as unhelpful. I am sorry to hear that. In my opinion, if you are spending $80 on a product, you want to know a lot of details about the quality of the product in regular use, and as someone who uses bluetooth keyboards paired with the iPad for most of the working day, I feel like I have some helpful advice. However, if you think I am leading customers astray, please mark my review as ""unhelpful,"" but also consider commenting on the review with some advice for how I can improve it.Customer service---------A customer service representative from Kensington commented on this review and kindly offered to replace my keyboards. Clearly, the Kensington customer support is excellent, and the company deserves to be recognized for how it stands behind its products.How did the replacements stand up in my tests, though? I received them, and have changed my rating from one star to three, because I saw a slight improvement (see the original review below for a more comprehensive review of the case).Is the replacement keyboard an improvement?----------Yes. I was sent two replacement keyboards (I have the KeyFolio Pro and KeyFolio Exact models), and one of them was significantly better than the original. The other one was about the same. I originally speculated that it was a bluetooth connectivity issue, but I think I may have been wrong, and it is actually a key sensitivity one. The keys respond well to a deliberate touch directly on the center of each one, but the lighter your touch, and the closer to the edge of the key you get, the less likely it is to recognize the input.Why three stars?----------I can imagine this keyboard working for someone who hunts and pecks, or who types maybe 20 to 30 words a minute. They are more likely to be pressing down firmly on each key. I think the faster you type, the more likely you are to run into unrecognized keys. At 50 or 60 words a minute, a sentence is typically missing all of its punctuation (the question mark is the most difficult to have recognized) and a few letters (it varies, but I'd say anything off the center row away from the middle is probably going to go missing at some point -- I have a lot of missing ""t,"" ""a,"" and ""n"" characters. Typing at faster speeds ends up as gibberish, in my experience.Why should you trust me?----------Maybe you shouldn't! I don't see other reviewers commenting on this, people have marked my review as ""unhelpful,"" and with four keyboards in front of me at the moment, you might start to think I am the problem here. I did, so I handed a few keyboards over to a friend and asked him to give it a try. Like me, he loved the look of the keyboard, and thought it seemed well-designed.1. He tried the best one of the bunch (one of the four seems more sensitive than the others) and had the same experience I did. In fact, he compared it to the old manual typewriters that required you to press firmly down from directly above each key. Of course, this is much more difficult on this relatively cramped keyboard (a necessary tradeoff for the size).2. I gave him one of the other three and he immediately noticed the difference, and declared that there wasn't much point in using the keyboard if you have to press the backspace key all of the time to correct errors.3. I gave him the Apple bluetooth keyboard (larger, and more expensive, to be sure, but also more sensitive and accurate) and his fingers danced happily across the keyboard without any errors. He also liked the angle of the keyboard, something that you have to produce manually with the Kensington by sticking a book or something underneath.Summary----------It's not a ""bad"" keyboard. Rather, I think it is a keyboard that is designed for a particular kind of typist that I am not. I grew up with manual typewriters, and I have taken typing classes. I think I was one of the only boys in class back then, but for some reason I really wanted to learn how to type--I even asked for a typewriter for my birthday. I know my way around a keyboard, so I could modify my typing to go back to the manual style, but why? I much prefer to type quickly, comfortably, and with a light touch. I think the keyboard has great potential (it certainly seems well-designed otherwise), and I will keep my eye on future iterations, but this generation is not quite ready for daily use, in my opinion.----------------------------------------[ Original review]I rarely give one-star reviews, but the Kensington KeyFolio Pro with Bluetooth Keyboard and Google Drive Offer for iPad Air (iPad 5) (K97008US) has earned it. I wanted to like it, and was excited to try it out with my iPad Air today, but I simply cannot recommend this to anyone.The case looks to be of high quality, though a little too bulky for my taste. Inserting the iPad Air was easy, and it fit relatively well. I'd prefer a tighter fit myself, but I can live with it. Pairing the keyboard worked fine. I think a dedicated button for connecting is unnecessary, and the spacing / sizing of the keys isn't ideal, but overall I really like the look of the keyboard -- it's thin and rechargeable, which is something I cannot say about Apple's bluetooth keyboard.Why the one-star review?1. The keyboard appears to have a poor bluetooth connection with the iPad. I tested it with my iPad Air and my iPad 3 with the same results. It misses characters. Every few words a character goes missing, and if you are reasonably fast, then expect to have several words each sentence garbled. I am reviewing another Kensington keyboard, and it has the same problem, so I don't think it is simply a dud. It appears to be a systemic problem, and I am surprised not to see more complaints from others. In my opinion, this alone makes it a one-star product, because the selling point here is that you'll have a keyboard and a case all in one. I really wanted this to work, but I am afraid it was a failure, so I am back to the Apple keyboard + Incase Origami, which is now looking very large next to the iPad Air!2. The metal clasp on the case hit my screen! I couldn't believe it, but they made the case with a floppy metal clasp. I should have been much more careful using it, and I deeply regret not reading the other reviews first, because they would have given me the warning I needed. I simply cannot fathom how this part of the case made it through the testing process. The iPad screen is the most delicate part of the device, and to have this flopping around next to it is a recipe for disaster. I'll probably cut mine off just to be on the safe side. The rest of the case is acceptable, in my opinion, but this part of it really needs more thought. If it was the clasp alone I wouldn't think so badly about the product, but in combination with the keyboard problem, I think it makes the product unusable.I am sure there will be users who enjoy the case, and I guess others aren't seeing the bluetooth connectivity problems, so if you want to take a chance with it, go ahead, but I'd suggest keeping a hold of the receipt (so-to-speak) just in case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPGH82581VAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMHVVNM#wasThisHelpful","R2QPGH82581VAC","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the Mr. Clean 240279 Magic Eraser Toilet Scrubber Kit takes a lot of the annoyance out of having to clean the toilet.To prepare it, you first need to load the cleaning pads into the container with the blue side facing up (the blue side will connect to the handle, and the white side will clean the toilet bowl). The directions aren't entirely clear about this, so you can look at the photo on the box if it seems confusing.To use it: 1) flush the toilet, 2) pick up a cleaning disk with the handle, 3) clean the toilet, 4) throw the cleaning disk away (into the trash), 5) replace the handle into the assembly. The cleaning disk works well, and the small size makes it easier to clean everything. It smells good, too.Weirdly, though, the cleaning disk wouldn't come off at the end of the process. It's no big deal, I guess. Stick it in the trash and use the trash bag to pull it off. This seems to ruin the whole flow -- what's the point, after all, if you have to touch it to remove the disk? Still, if it would work, it would be a good idea! It gets three stars for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQ7JBWWP4SWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY0CSR6#wasThisHelpful","R2TQ7JBWWP4SWF","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Black & Decker Flash Thermal Laminator 9.5-Inch (LAM95) works well with heated lamination. It warms up quickly and performs exactly as expected. I do not know if the cold setting works, because the manufacturer did not include a self-adhesive pouch.

I cannot imagine how this product made it out the door with a highlighted feature that doesn't work! Other reviewers had the same problem, so I am glad to see that I am not the only one who couldn't figure it out.Fortunately, the laminator appears to be solidly built and affordably priced.

"I've had several air purifiers over the years, but the Airocide Air Purifier is easily one of my favorites. I am a sucker for beautifully designed products, and this one is industrial design at its finest.PERFORMANCE---------Does it work?  I have no idea. Unlike conventional filters that need to be regularly cleaned and replaced, it uses some kind of NASA technology involving reaction chambers and so forth. The explanation in the manual is vague and not terribly convincing. Honestly, I do wonder if it works, and I guess only time will tell.SETTINGS---------There are no settings to speak of -- you plug it in and you can choose automatic, low, and high for the fan speeds. I say ""fan,"" but I don't really understand how this air moves out without blades that you would need to clean every once in a while. It is a mystery to me at the moment. Again, I would have appreciated more detailed explanations in the manual.GUARANTEE---------Airocide promises that I will ""feel better"" after using this for a while. I am not exactly sure what that means, or how they can even make that promise, but if it is true, and they really will stand by their 60-day return policy, I don't think you have anything to lose by giving it a try.VERTICAL?---------One thing to note is that the photos often show the air purifier in a vertical position. As far as I can tell, this is not possible to achieve in real life. You may notice that the only time it happens in the literature or on the Amazon page is when the product has been photoshopped or placed on a special stand. In fact, there is a slight angle to the sides, so I think you will probably need to imagine it in a horizontal position, unless you mount it on a wall or put it on the stand that can be purchased separately.MAINTENANCE---------Finally, a word about the reactors. You have to replace them every year, and they do cost about $100, but this is definitely not out of line with the price of filters that you would have to replace with other high-end air purifiers. It is interesting that ""reactors"" have to be replaced about the same interval as ""filters"", but because I have no idea how this thing actually works, I have to take their word for it that I need to change the parts regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPTI19S8GN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKXVHNO#wasThisHelpful","R2TPTI19S8GN4","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:A year and a half later and these are still some of the best headphones I have ever owned. I took an international flight yesterday and these made it considerably more pleasant than it would have been otherwise. One minor thing that annoys me is the square sound processing / battery thingy that is placed inconveniently near to the headphone jack. It tries to bang against the iPad / iPod / iPhone screens when using it, and it seems to get in the way a lot more than I would like. Still, it is better than any competing noise-cancelling headphones I have tried and definitely an improvement over the QC15.Comparing the Bose QuietComfort 20i Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones to the Bose® QuietComfortÂ® 15 Acoustic Noise CancellingÂ® Headphones, I was surprised to find that I prefer the 20i.The QC15----------I've used the QC15 headphones for several years now on a daily basis to the point that I have even had to replace the leather cups on them because they completely wore out. I cannot say enough good things about the QC15's excellent ability to filter out noise (compared to other leading brands I have owned and tried). They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and deliver excellent battery life.Yet, the QC15 has its drawbacks.- You cannot use them in a moderately warm room or your head will overheat. I've seen people work out in them, and I honestly cannot comprehend how they endure the heat.- The QC15 also has pretty unimpressive sound if you are an audiophile.- Finally, they are extremely bulky and inconvenient to take anywhere with you.The 20i----------Basically, the i20 has all the benefits of the QC15 in a tiny, portable size. I value the noise cancellation function myself, and I cannot distinguish between the two headphones, even though you would expect the QC15 to do better because it completely covers your ears. It is amazing how well the i20 cancels out the sound, and I could not believe that the uniquely shaped earbuds fit comfortably into my ears. There is no more overheating, and they are much more convenient to carry with me all of the time. I really do not know how they managed to do it, but this is the first in-ear noise canceling that actually works. For iOS users, I can confirm that it works perfectly with Apple devices.Yet, there are some drawbacks.- Just like the QC15, the i20 still does a relatively poor job with sound quality.- Additionally, I find them a little less comfortable for wearing hours on end.Recommendation----------If you are choosing between the 20i and the QC15, you may not be able to distinguish between the two in terms of sound quality or noise cancellation, but when you are wanting to carry the headphones around with you wherever you go, then the 20i is going to be a better choice. In fact, the only situation in which I would recommend the QC15 over the 20i is if you plan to be in one air-conditioned place using the headphones for extended periods (maybe a researcher trying to concentrate in the library for 8+ hours).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OR18MRGV1RDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D429Y12#wasThisHelpful","R1OR18MRGV1RDI","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't anything especially unique about the Belkin F5L097btGRN Universal Tablet Stylus - Retail Packaging - Green that would distinguish it from a stylus by Targus or any number of other similar models. In fact, I have a Griffin stylus out next to it , and the only differences I can determine are:1. The Griffin is perhaps a centimeter longer.2. The metal cap at the top of the Griffin is larger (this is where that centimeter comes from) and less decorative.3. The clip is much fatter on the Griffin and connects to the metal cap, so it appears more sturdy to me.4. The Griffin has a slightly more textured barrel and is easier to hold.5. The Griffin is black. I like the green Belkin better, I suppose, because it is different. However, the color isn't really a big deal to me.I like how it writes, but at twice the price of competing products, and with slightly less desirable features (shorter with smooth barrel and a clip design that easily breaks in my experience), I am not sure that I could recommend it over others.

"The Westcott TrimAir Guillotine Wood Trimmer with Microban Protection is an economical way to trim paper, and is well-suited to light tasks. The construction seems quite sturdy, and the blade is effective with a small number of paper items. Twenty pages of paper, for example, is a little too much, but it works just fine with about ten to fifteen.I think the lightweight construction probably works in its favor, but the blade is so tightly attached that you really have to use one hand to hold down the cutting board, because it jumps around a lot. It's not a big deal, but if you are planning to trim a few hundred pieces of paper, it is probably not the most appropriate tool. For large projects, you'll want something like the Professional Guillotine Desktop Stack Paper Cutter, which is a little more than twice the price, but can easily work through 250 to 300 pages in a single pass, and is very heavy, so it does not move around on your desk.The Westcott trimmer excels with small projects, and I'd definitely recommend it for such cases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZI4VWGAQW3LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058TW286#wasThisHelpful","R1ZI4VWGAQW3LP","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[EDIT September 17]: As expected, the handle has split apart. It's still functional, but I don't think they put enough thought into the materials used for manufacturing it.

I'd recommend staying away from this unless you intend to wrap that handle in plastic or something.----- Original Review -----The Full Circle Grunge Buster Grout and Tile Brush, FC11125 has an interesting shape, and the designers should be commended on giving us something new here. I like how it reaches into corners well, how it fits in my hand, and how it sits up nicely (like an iron). However, a bamboo handle? This doesn't make much sense to me, and though it hasn't become grungy yet, I don't expect it will fare well in my shower. More importantly, though, is the fact that it cleans no better than any of the other brushes I have used.

"The Marantz NR1504 Slim Line 5.1 Network Receiver with AirPlay is gorgeous and designed with an eye for small details.SETUP----------If you are familiar with receivers, then you'll have no problem integrating this into your home theatre system. On the other hand, if you need instructions, it might be a little more difficult. The guides are in large PDFs contained on a CD that is accessed from a silly, clunky menu. Go into the CD files and drag out the PDFs ending in ""ENG"" (if you want English) and load them onto your iPad if you want to have the manuals accessible.HARDWARE----------Slim, sturdy, and clearly labeled. This is a model of straightforward and user-friendly design. I kind of feel like large knobs are a throwback to the past, but I realize that these are de rigueur for receiver enthusiasts.USE----------It does everything you would expect, and does it really well. That is, unless you expect ""Airplay"" to mean that you can use the device to play videos transmitted from your iPad, iPhone, or computer. As far as I can tell, the only thing that Airplay does on this device is audio. That's fine, of course, but I was really hoping for the video capability so that I would have an alternative to my Apple TV. To be fair, the manufacturer only claims audio capability.SUMMARY----------The Marantz NR1504 demonstrates that a great receiver can be relatively small, inexpensive, and easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7C1ZVWV8C0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLZDKX2#wasThisHelpful","R2N7C1ZVWV8C0J","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had pretty high expectations for the  Kodak i2900 Scanner, and though I wasn't impressed with it at first (this review has been edited to reflect my thoughts after scanning several tens of thousands of pages), once I figured out the settings, I developed a more favorable impression of it.HARDWARE---------------------Kodak has built what looks to be a pretty solid piece of equipment. I expect that it will hold up pretty well through a lot of scanning, and the fact that it can handle as many as 250 sheets at a time is pretty impressive. In my experience, it works exactly as advertised, and it is very easy to load paper.One problem I have found is that the wheels sometimes begin squeaking and it can be quite annoying. The problem seems to occur because even when paper is not running through the device and it is pausing before feeding the next paper, everything continues spinning along. The worst offenders seem to be two white plastic rollers in the top of the back section of the device where the paper comes out at the top, and one at the bottom of the front loading area. I have tried cleaning the wheels in the front loading area, with some success in reducing the squeaking. The rollers in the back stopped their incessant squeaking when I shifted them around with my fingers, but they still occasionally scream out at me in protest.Surprisingly, the scanner is missing some functionality you can find in other scanners. For example, it doesn't have the capability to detect double feeds like the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Scanner for PC and Mac (PA03656-B005). It doesn't handle paper misfeeds well unless they are quite nasty, in contrast to the ix500, which is pretty sensitive. These aren't major omissions, but on an otherwise high quality scanner, these kinds of details would be nice to have.SOFTWARE---------------------It was time consuming to install the software, and quite difficult for me to get started. Once I did get it set up, it worked well enough, but it might take me weeks to figure out what all these options do. The most important thing that I realized is that you can go into the File > Page Setup part of the interface to adjust the resolution if you need higher resolution, grayscale, etc. I did not find the interface intuitive at all, and I think the software is not doing Kodak any favors here. It would have been nice if Kodak had included support for Mac users too. If you don't have a Windows computer, then this isn't the device for you.Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 v Kodak i2900---------------------These two scanners are not even supposed to be in the same league (in price or specs), but in day-to-day use, the ScanSnap comes out ahead in some ways. Despite being a fraction of the size and cost, the ScanSnap is much faster than the Kodak if you go above 300 dpi. I usually scan at 600 dpi black and white, and at these settings, I go roughly twice as fast with the ScanSnap. There is one caveat, though. The ScanSnap has more hiccups (misfeeds, multiple page feeds, paper jams, and problems grabbing onto pages). After 30,000+ pages with the Kodak, I think I may have only had 5 or 6 feed problems. Perhaps one of the reasons it doesn't detect double feeds is because the design of the device makes the problem much more uncommon.There is one point where the Kodak blows the ScanSnap out of the water: capacity. The ScanSnap gets quite testy when you load in more than a few dozen pages at once, so you have to position yourself close to the device and keep feeding it. The Kodak churns through its pages slower, but at a steady pace without the need to constantly feed it. This can be a huge advantage when you get up to several thousand pages, and there have been several times when I give a scanning batch to the Kodak instead of the ScanSnap because I don't want to hassle with the feeding.SUMMARY---------------------I think if you are a regular consumer who doesn't scan more than a couple hundred pages a day, then the Fujitsu ScanSnap is more than sufficient for your needs. If you are running a small business, and you, or your employees don't want to have to station yourself next to the scanner all day, then the Kodak is very appealing. The only stumbling block with Kodak is the software, but be patient with it, and you ought to be able to get it to do what you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILLD6LUGEWUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBLF49Y#wasThisHelpful","R2ILLD6LUGEWUM","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the Runtastic Speed and Cadence Bike Sensor with Bluetooth Smart Technology easy to install and set up. Everything is straightforward, though the guide that comes with it isn't entirely clear in places (I'd say this isn't one of the better manuals out there). Fortunately, there isn't much to mess up with only a handful of items to attach. Do not, by the way, purchase the Runtastic Bike Case for iPhone 4, 4S, 5 (Black). It is a piece of junk, and really shouldn't cost anything at all. This review is about the sensor, though, so let's get on with it.Why is it worrisome? Like another reviewer who kindly posted a video (SMXSteve), this device doesn't look like a good idea to me. I've had things get caught in my spokes and taken a spill before, so I am quite leery of putting something like this on my bike. I worry that this won't end well, and watching the video only made me more concerned that this (unfortunately) might not be for me. It's too bad, really, because it is otherwise a great device. Please note that other products I have seen have similar construction, and I haven't actually experienced this horror, so maybe my fears are unfounded, and we'll all be safe with this. I'll keep an eye on it over the summer and see if it moves. I wonder why this wasn't designed to be bottom mounted?What's good about the app? Unlike others, I had no problem syncing with my iPhone 4S or Samsung Galaxy SIII. Maybe I just got lucky. The app works great, has all kinds of settings, and does a great job of giving me more information than I've ever had before on my ride. My only wish is that this well-designed app could have been paired with an equally well designed sensor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXKDA9MFJVRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVY4HCG#wasThisHelpful","R1BXKDA9MFJVRG","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is pretty rare that I give a one-star review, but the Runtastic Bike Case for iPhone 4, 4S, 5 (White) has managed to earn it. There really isn't much to say about this poorly designed device except to ask how a company that makes a nice product like the Runtastic Speed and Cadence Bike Sensor with Bluetooth Smart Technology could churn out this junk. I'll just rattle off the problems here, but read the other reviews for details about each point:- You have to remove your own cover to put it in this cheap one, and you know that this transfer process (on a bike ride!?) is bound to be the time you drop your phone onto concrete without a case.- Mounting this on my handlebars was difficult and ultimately a waste of time.- A waste of time because the screen is unresponsive under the cheap plastic. I couldn't get anything to register correctly standing still, and it was even more impossible while riding.Personally, I consider this product to be a safety hazard, I recommend no one put it on their bikes (you can bet the people at Runtastic don't actually use this), and I strongly urge you not to try and operate it while riding. Fortunately, the app to track your ride works fine if you leave the phone in your bag, so just do that, and forget about having the display in front of you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TL4OQJVF6MX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYNAT80#wasThisHelpful","R3TL4OQJVF6MX6","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I moved from a 2012 11"" Macbook Air to the Apple MacBook Air MD711LL/A 11.6-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION) and I don't notice any difference at all in performance. However, I think it is the best one I've ever used because of the battery life. I easily get roughly double what I used to with the 2012 Macbook Air. I have the base model with the i5 processor, 128 GB of storage, and 4 GB of memory. [REVIEW EDITED JULY 10]Battery Life---------If you change the brightness to about 75% (this is the level at which Apple did their testing) you ought to easily get 8-10 hours of use out of the computer. From online comments, it looks like other people are getting better results from their batteries after the first charge cycle, so if you are having problems, discharge it once (I went down to 7%), charge it, and see if that doesn't help.Should you Upgrade?----------You ought to see a huge performance boost upgrading from a 2011 or earlier Macbook Air, but is it worth it to upgrade from the 2012 Macbook Air to this one? Probably not for most people, unless battery life is a critical factor for you (it is for me). Some of you might notice a small performance bump, but most (including me) won't. Physically, with the exception of a tiny hole on the side for the mic, it is also indistinguishable from last year's model.11"" or 13"" ?----------I wrote a review of last year's model here (http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCO4ZC1NVQMD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), where I extolled the virtues of the computer. Everything I said there applies to this year's model as well, and my only complaint (the battery life) has been addressed. I also still think the 13"" base model is a better buy for the money, but because I value portability, I stuck with the 11"".If you are a student or teacher, you can get an academic discount ordering through Apple instead of Amazon.

"The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups, Stainless Steel, Updated Design look great, they're sturdy, and they're dishwasher safe. What's not to like? Well, if you look closely, you can see in the image that the large is not flat, but angles upward. I am sure there is some kind of brilliant design idea behind this, but in practice what you have is a measuring cup that is inexact. It works OK for powders (assuming that the angled area is part of the 1 Cup), but for liquids it is not so great, and obviously one of these has to be incorrect. Either the angled section is or is not included in the 1 Cup.In addition, I cannot figure out how they got the cups to stack so well in the photo. In our drawer, they don't fit together terribly well, and the handles stick up to catch whenever we try to open it. Frankly speaking, I have some cheap plastic ones from many years ago that are made better than this. Sure, I'd like metal ones with the great handles, but it isn't worth giving up the ability to actually use them.The low rating on this review might seem a bit harsh, but after all, it is a measuring cup that cannot possibly measure correctly.

"The Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer, Black is a great product for people who are into quantifying their lives and lifelogging, but may be too much if you just want to know how much you weigh!HARDWARE- It is nicely made overall, but it is a little larger than I would like, and the feet are terribly slippery. The cheap 3M adhesive isn't firmly affixed to the feet, so I wouldn't be surprised if they fall off in the future when picking up the scale. It isn't a big deal, because I don't plan to move the scale much, but I don't know why they cut corners there. At this price point, I think it is fair to expect it to do better than my previous scale at 1/3 the price. It is actually very dangerous in our tiled bathroom, like standing on a skateboard, and I plan to put some kind of rubberized surface under it. I wouldn't call this a deal breaker, but I wouldn't get it for a parent or grandparent who has a tile floor unless I could set it up for them with some kind of grippy material under it.SETUP- A little time consuming. It showed kilograms only when I got it, and the scale has no adjustments to make on its own. To get the most out of this scale, you have to install the app, which I did (iPhone), and everything went smoothly from there.APP- It's OK, but doesn't handle two users very well. For some reason, it gets me right every time, but my wife's data has to get assigned to her manually. It is a little annoying, and I cannot see any way to adjust the settings to recognize that the data as hers.ACCURACY- As far as I can tell, it is pretty accurate, though I seem to weigh more than I should! I have no idea if the CO2 readings are accurate, and I really don't know what I am supposed to get from these numbers. Otherwise, it feeds me a good deal of useful information.SUMMARY- As someone who likes to track things like my weight, this scale is perfectly suited for me. It certainly does make it easier to have everything sent immediately to my phone, and I like that it does it automatically. If you are just looking for your weight, and don't plan on syncing with another device, then it is probably overkill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWT9QD1QGH0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKRQ4E8#wasThisHelpful","R3VWT9QD1QGH0G","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time I am writing this, Office 365 Home Premium 1yr Subscription Key Card only gives Mac users Office 2011, and this is not written anywhere on their Amazon product page. Not only that, but if you get this you will be on a subscription model, and you'll have to pay to keep using it. If you are only using Macs, there is almost no benefit that I can see to getting this product. However, people using multiple operating systems will gain the ability to download versions for whatever operating system you are using (up to 5 computers). You will also have 27GB of SkyDrive usage.SUPPORTI already had a 1 month trial version. The instructions on the activation card I received, and on the website were a little confusing, because they seemed to assume that I did not have an account already. I thought I would take this opportunity to call support and make sure I was doing it correctly. Thirty minutes, and three transfers to different people later, we got to the bottom of the problem. I just needed to follow the instructions I was given on the card!I did learn that the support staff is friendly and helpful; I suppose they don't often get people calling with trial subscriptions, ignoring instructions they have in front of them, and trying to upgrade with one of these activation codes. The last time I tried to contact Microsoft support, I think they tried to charge me nearly $200 to talk with them about an ""incident"" through their ""professional support,"" so it is good to know that you can easily contact Microsoft for free as well.OFFICEWhat can I say? This is not a very good deal for Mac users, especially if you already have a 2011 version of Office on your computer. I knew I would only be getting Office 2011, because I have been keeping up with the tech news, but because I could receive it through the Vine program as a reviewer, and I run Parallels on my Mac, I thought this might be a convenient way to install two versions for the price of one. Eventually, Mac folks will probably see an upgrade, but it looks like they will continue to lag behind the Windows people.SUMMARYAs a Mac user, would I have gone out and bought it? No. It is the same software I already had, but costs about $100 more to use it, and puts me on a subscription model that will suck $10 out of my bank account every month for the rest of my life. I don't relish the thought of paying thousands of dollars over my lifetime to use a word processor, and I think Microsoft is on the wrong path with this model.My guess is that when my subscription runs out next year, I will uninstall this, install my old copy of 2011, and only use Word when someone sends me a document in that format. Otherwise, I'll stick to Word's inexpensive competitors like Pages, Google Docs, Open Office, etc. Don't get me wrong -- Word is undoubtedly the best program out there, but I don't think it is worth it for the subscription model.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0DAS05IBLNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPTUW2#wasThisHelpful","RO0DAS05IBLNF","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed Lonely Planet books for years, and Lonely Planet Paris (City Guide) is another great guidebook in the series. It is full of historical background as well as practical tips. I have never been to the city, but I am planning a trip now, and I have been going through this book to prepare. The Arc de Triomphe, for example,  starts out with a brief history of the monument, explains some of the plaques, describes some of the sculptures, and concludes with the viewing platform.WIKIPEDIA VS LONELY PLANETIt's all clear and well-written, but in this age of Wikipedia, how necessary is it? If you visit the Wikipedia page for the Arc de Triomphe, you'll find much more historical detail, many photographs of the plaques and so forth that are only briefly described in the guidebook, and better directions about how to gain access to the arch.I've gathered a lot of Wikipedia entries for the trip and put them into my Evernote account, so I'll have them easily accessible. I also plan to have wireless access, so I doubt I will be consulting this guidebook as much as I would have ten or twenty years ago. Wikipedia is sometimes inaccurate when it comes to history (so is Lonely Planet), but it is usually on target when it comes to more practical matters like gaining access to a site like the Arc de Triomphe, and it has photographs galore.If you have wireless access, should you bother bringing it along on your trip? I still think so, because it offers a handy way to find quick synopses of sites, and it still contains great tips on food (though Yelp!, like Wikipedia, is also a potentially more useful alternative).

"This is my first time using Dragon Dictate, Version 3.0 (Mac), but I've used the software on Windows for many years now.

I recommend you take the time to correct it in the early days for each and every word it gets wrong, because the time you spend doing this will pay off later when you can run through your work just as fast, if not faster than you would typing.I've seen the poor reviews that the software has gotten, and I am a little concerned about that. It looks like it is working well for some people, and not working at all for others. In my experience, it has been accurate and reliable, but that could change. I will be sure to update this review in the future if I run across any problems. For now, though, I'd say this is a great product and definitely deserves five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IJWRKJ2UXFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009348X7Q#wasThisHelpful","R11IJWRKJ2UXFT","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HOMEDICS UHE-OC1 COOL MIST ULTRASONIC HUMIDFIER (UHE-OC1) - is one of my favorite humidifiers. I've had quite a few over the years, but there is almost always something missing.Some of them have annoying blue lights that cannot be turned off. Some have a small tank that runs out too quickly. Others are noisy and keep me awake all night.I won't say that this one is quiet, by any means, because it does make a little noise in order to produce the mist and to turn the oscillating head. However, it isn't as bad as I've had with others, and the trade-off (the oscillation and generous amount of mist) is well worth it.One of my favorite features is the ability to turn off the annoying blue light. Thank you! So many manufacturers of so many devices think that just because you can light a product up means that you ought to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4MH6CDMN76P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008P8EV40#wasThisHelpful","R3S4MH6CDMN76P","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive STBU1000100  (Black) is an excellent product that works much as you would expect, but with one clever addition.The case is solidly constructed, lightweight, and quite slim. In addition to this, it has the ability to work with a Thunderbolt adapter. I don't know if the Thunderbolt adapter is something that people will be interested in using, but it is really nice to have the option!The drive also happens to be pretty inexpensive. I typically purchase either Seagate or Western Digital Drives for my backups, depending on which one has the lowest price at the time I buy. Prices have been falling pretty steadily over the last few years. Although this is a review of the black one, if you click on the white one you'll see that it is $10 less. It is probably the cheapest I have ever seen a drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274ZIV784ZU8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00829THO6#wasThisHelpful","R274ZIV784ZU8K","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Seagate Backup Plus Desktop Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE129) is a little pricey (it costs about the same as a few terabytes of storage) and a bit of a pain to setup, but with patience, it might be worth it for you.HARDWARE-------------Like its smaller cousin for the portable drives, it's easy to install. You pop off the USB adapter on the drive and then put this Thunderbolt one on it. The hardware is nice looking, and it adds a bit of stability to a drive that otherwise has a tendency to topple over (Seagate staff have said that it is fine to use the drive on its side).SOFTWARE-------------It's an adapter, so you might think you don't need software. You'd be wrong. Hooking up the Thunderbolt drive, my computer couldn't even tell that it was connected to the device, even though it was fine a few seconds before with the USB connection.In the box is a thumb drive with about 1GB of data on it. This is supposed to be a driver you need for drives larger than 2TB. I plugged it into my Mac and it also was not recognized. Maybe they sent a thumb drive with the adapter that is formatted for Windows, and they forgot about their Mac users. Or, maybe I was just unlucky with a dud. Fortunately, there is a website where you can go to download the drivers [...].It is a rather confusing site with lots of bold red and warnings. It seems to be telling me that I only need the driver if I intend to use both the USB and Thunderbolt adapters. If I am only using the Thunderbolt adapter, I can reformat my drive and be fine without the driver. What is this about reformatting!? First of all, I have data on the drive. Second of all, my computer cannot even see the drive with the Thunderbolt adapter, so I don't even know how I would get this to work.Fortunately, the driver is easy to install on the drive, and once I did that, everything worked fine. The data transfer is speedy, as expected, though limited somewhat by the speed of the non-SSD external drive itself. I really wish they had thought this through more, though, and didn't force me to jump through hoops to access the drive. The portable adapter works much more easily (just clip it on).DO YOU NEED THIS?-------------Probably not if you are just looking for speed, because I don't even think it will be faster than the USB 3.0 adapter. The platters on the external drive don't spin fast enough to take advantage of the Thunderbolt. In addition, it doesn't come with a cable. This means you will spend much more for the adapter than you will for an entirely new USB 3.0 drive.If you are looking to take advantage of Thunderbolt's ability to ""daisy chain"" (using one port on your computer, you can connect to more than one drive, because the drives connect to one another), though, then this is a great addition to your gadget toolbox. I'm afraid this product may not have a huge audience, but I can at least say that it appears well-made and well-integrated into the Seagate product line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBES8HNXTM90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HQCAPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NBES8HNXTM90","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Scanner for PC and Mac (PA03656-B005) is a major investment, but I think it will pay off for you over time if you have a lot of paper to scan. In my case, I am looking to digitize everything from store receipts to my rather large library of dead tree books.GOING PAPERLESS: TWO KEY FEATURES---I've already gone paperless and managed to put all of the loose paper I have accumulated over the years into my computer using the ScanSnap S300. This has been a trusted companion, and is still going strong, so why upgrade? Speed and multi-page detection.1. The ix500 chews through paper at phenomenal speeds, and it even manages to do it much more quietly than my S300. It is beautiful to watch, and even a 500-page book can be finished at B/W 600 dpi in about 15 minutes.2. The multi-page detection will stop whenever it detects that more than one sheet has been fed through the scanner at once. This occasionally happens, and on the S300 I have always had to keep an eye on things to make sure that I didn't miss any pages. The ix500 is very accurate, and so far it hasn't let a single misfeed go through.OTHER FEATURES---I've heard people speak about how wonderful the wireless sync, and the integration with iOS is, but for me, this isn't a big deal. I go through hundreds of pages a day (sometimes even thousands), and there is no way that I would be able to do this from another room (how do you load the scanner?). I also don't want to have all of this appear on my iPad. I am sure there are plenty of use cases for this technology, and I am glad that it is there, but it isn't something I have found useful yet.SUMMARY---If you have a lot of paper to scan, I think this is the device to get, because it is the best one on the market. The price may seem steep at first, but if you consider the time, effort, and money spent filing, moving around bookcases and file cabinets, or storing boxes of books / paper, then it begins to look a lot more reasonable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ANROJDJLW7T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATZ9QMO#wasThisHelpful","R2ANROJDJLW7T7","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have a Seagate Backup Plus drive that only works with USB 3.0, and you'd prefer to have Thunderbolt, but don't want to spend money on a new drive? If so, then the Seagate Backup Plus Portable Thunderbolt Adapter (STAE128) is perfect for you.HARDWARE---Not much. It doesn't even come with a cable, and if you are like me, then you probably don't have a whole lot of Thunderbolt cables sitting around yet. However, it is exactly as advertised, and is clearly well-built.USE CASE = DAISY CHAINING---If you have a Seagate Backup Plus drive, you just pop off the adapter end, and slip the drive into the Thunderbolt Adapter. Now you are ready to go. Why would you want this, though, because your drive cannot possibly spin fast enough to actually make use of the additional capability that the Thunderbolt offers?The answer: daisy chaining. I hook a Seagate 3 TB Thunderbolt backup that I use to store all of my files (a couple of TB total) into my Macbook Air (only one Thunderbolt slot), and then hook the Seagate Backup Plus into that (the 3 TB drive) for my Time Machine. This frees up all of the other ports on my device, and makes the process of hooking and unhooking drives a lot nicer.SUMMARY---I gave it five stars, because it does what it does well. It is well-designed, and I like the concept, but you probably don't need this unless you have an extremely narrow use case in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQELUG7KVDHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HQCARY#wasThisHelpful","RWQELUG7KVDHZ","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive for Mac (STBW1000900) is a great deal on a lot of memory. It's difficult to believe how much external drives have dropped in price over the last few years, and this one provides you with USB 3.0 as well.SOFTWARE---It comes with software that you can install, and I think Seagate is ahead of the curve with some of this. You start out with product registration, but Seagate fills in all the fields for you with ""fake name"" and ""fake@email.com."" It saves you the time of making up stuff on your own! The Seagate Dashboard software itself, though, is disappointing, because it is so simple, and such a step backwards from the software in years past that I cannot ever see myself using it.I don't really think the uninteresting software matters, though. Fortunately, as a Mac user, you have easy access to Time Machine right in your Menu bar. I cannot recommend Time Machine enough, and this hard drive is perfect for it.HARDWARE---In addition to coming with a stylish, but mainly plastic body, you also have the option to use a Thunderbolt adapter. I don't know how many people will actually do this, especially when the drive is not fast enough to take advantage of the additional speed, but it is a more convenient option for connecting a backup to your Mac.SUMMARY---This would be a great drive at twice the price, and I strongly recommend considering it if you are looking for something trustworthy to store your files.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VVP17GQFQP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HQHPB0#wasThisHelpful","R38VVP17GQFQP7","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB Thunderbolt Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000400) might not be kind to your pocketbook, but it is definitely worth considering if you are looking for a solid, fast, and beautifully designed external hard drive.DESIGNFirst, the design really stands out. It is similar to its svelte, glossy, and much less expensive cousin (Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101)), and clearly they share some of the same design elements. This one, though, is covered in a nice rubberized coating, and sits in a kind of stand, which contains the Thunderbolt slots. Both of them look great, but I feel like this one has a bit more sophistication to it.PERFORMANCEIt is blazing fast (as you would expect with any Thunderbolt device), and works flawlessly. What I love about it is that I can daisy chain devices so that using one slot on my Macbook Air for this drive also allows me to plug in my Time Machine backup. I can't think of a thing I would improve with this setup, and it is so much more elegant than using up all of my USB slots for these drives.SOFTWAREDisappointing. I have to admit I rarely install software, because I am really looking for either a Time Machine backup or I want to save files onto the drive, and I don't want to go through the hassle of software. In this case, the software seems tailored for social media. The thing is, I don't imagine many people out there have 3TB of photos on Facebook! I couldn't really see how I would use it to save regular files. It did not seem set up for doing this, which is kind of odd.SUMMARYThis drive is a premium device (in my opinion) for people who have a lot of data, and really care about their backups. I haven't reduced my five-star rating for the software, because I don't put a whole lot of weight on the bundled software in the first place. What I am looking for is speed, design, and reliability. This drive has all of these qualities, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OWWNJPOOSUS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HPGBNY#wasThisHelpful","R1OWWNJPOOSUS9","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101) is a beautiful drive that stands up on your desk with an unobtrusive light and low volume of noise emitting from it. Overall, I am pleased with the device and its performance. I am also surprised at how inexpensive such a great product has become, because only a year or two ago 3 TB cost so much I did not even think to look at it. As you can see in the comments section for this review, the Seagate staff are knowledgable and helpful as well.EDITED:(1) My only complaint is that it is not especially stable, so you will want to put it in a place where it cannot get knocked over.- A Seagate representative kindly wrote a comment to this review explaining that it can be placed on its side as well. That is good to know, though it is definitely not apparent that this is possible (or recommended) from the design along, which has no ""feet"" anywhere on the ""sides,"" and all of the illustrations show it vertical.EDITED:(2) Please note that this drive appears to be listed on Amazon less expensive than the ""Mac"" version, and it comes formatted for Windows NTFS (read only for Macs), but it apparently has a Mac version of the Seagate software on the drive (I did not install it), and it is easily re-formatted (I recommend Ex-Fat) for your Mac. Personally, I have nothing against the software provided by Seagate (or any other company), but I am looking for a drive to hold my data, and do not need (or want) to go through someone's interface. My rating reflects my experience with the drive, not the software.- The Seagate representative recommended that we do not use ExFat with this drive, as it has certain limitations (I assume these refer to OS restrictions, possible problems with inadvertent disconnections, etc.).

I might have expected too much, though, because the soap scum and mildew-stained caulking in the bathtub are still there. I will say that the chrome looked really clean afterwards, and it at least seemed to do a lot better than the regular stuff we buy in the store. Some of those brands truly do nothing more than put on a sudsy show. At least this appears to be making a good faith effort at removing krud. Perhaps, as another reviewer noted, I didn't have the right kind of krud.The krud in my kitchen had the right stuff, and so I think the kitchen is probably a better location to try out krud kutter. It is much more effective there against grease.Overall, even though it didn't perform miracles in the bathroom, I'd still recommend the product as an all-in-one, effective cleaner.

"The VSonic GR07 headphones are quite impressive, and I recommend them for anyone looking to move up from regular earbuds to something lightweight, well-built, and customizable. I'll be comparing these to the the far less expensive Apple In-ear Headphones for iPod (White) and the far more expensive Bose® QuietComfortÂ® 15 Acoustic Noise CancellingÂ® Headphones. These are early impressions, and I plan to update this more in the future if anything changes.SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality is good, but it took several days for it to get there, because there is apparently a ""burn-in"" period. There was a noticeable improvement when going from the Bose to the VSonic, but not such a big difference when going from Apple to it. The Apple sound feels a little dead to me in comparison, but not terribly bad.BUILD QUALITYI wish there was not quite so much plastic, and that the individual pieces were sturdier looking. One thing that stood out to me was the ability to change the direction of the speakers -- it is a tiny thing, but something missing on similar over-the-ears headphones. The Bose (considering its high price) has a shockingly large amount of plastic, and I was concerned about its durability, but three or four years later (with the same price, strangely), they are doing just fine, so my concerns about the plastic may be unfounded. The Apple headphones feel very well-built, and I have had them for several years without any issues, and even though they have just as much plastic, if not more than the VSonic ones, the Apple headphones appear more solid to me.ACCESSORIESThe VSonic wins hands down. It has a wide array of silicone tips and two cases (clamshell and pouch). The Bose headphones came with their big case, but that was about it. The Apple ones came with three silicone tips, but these things are always falling off, none of them quite fit right in my ears. One thing that I really appreciate about the Apple headphones, though, is the voume adjustment on the headphone cables and the microphone. Neither Bose nor VSonic offer this feature.FITWithout the ear guides, I think they will fit in anyone's ears. With the ear guides, though, this is hit or miss. They work fine for me, but I asked someone with different ears to give them a try, and they didn't fit well at all with the plastic ear guides. These headphones are a lot better than with the Apple ones, which love to pop out all of the time, occasionally throw a silicon tip across the floor, or leave the silicon tip behind in my ear when the speaker decides to go somewhere else. The VSonic headphones are very nice in this regard, and there is no hint of the rubber ear pieces coming loose. The Bose headphones definitely fit the best of the three, because they completely encase the ear. Of course, they are also much more bulky than earbuds, and not nearly as portable.NOISE ISOLATIONNo apparent difference between these and the Apple headphones. I was a little disappointed in this respect, because I would like to use them for blocking out surrounding noises as well as listening to music. The Bose headphones are still the best ones I have ever used for noise canceling (active, as opposed to passive noise isolation), but the sound quality is not too great with Bose. You gain quiet in order to hear the music better, but you lose sound quality, so the music doesn't sound as good! I value its noise canceling over the music any day, but if you are an audiophile, then something like the VSonic that doesn't get in the way of the music would be better.SUMMARYI strongly recommend these headphones if you are looking for something lightweight and portable. You'll spend a little on these than you would with Apple, but a little less than you would with Bose, and you'll have the ability to customize them to fit just right in your ears.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7N4MGADQM1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I061DO#wasThisHelpful","R2O7N4MGADQM1B","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised that the RCA HP818 Noise-Isolating Earphones (Black and white) have a different texture to the earbuds that makes them a little more rigid than the typical silicon ones.

"The SanDisk Extreme 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive SDCZ80-032G-X46 is a solid flash drive that works well with the Macintosh. I am using it on my 2012 Macbook Air (USB 3.0) and have not experienced any problems. I have reformatted it a couple of times, but could not reproduce any of the problems seen in other reviews. The sliding connector is not uncommon on flash drives these days, and it works smoothly. I would have given it five stars, but I think the plastic casing really ought to have been a more sturdy metal one that you can find even with less expensive competitors.

"I wonder if the designers of the RCA USB A to Micro B Cable (AH732R) tested this on actual devices, because it doesn't work properly on anything for me. - I tried it with my Seagate hard drive. The design of the plug made it so that the metal end was too short to seat properly. The drive connected intermittently, but I couldn't manage to keep it working for long. - I tried it with my Google Nexus 7. It charges, but that is the best I could do. The regular cord for the Nexus 7 works fine, so it isn't my device, or my technical incompetence that is to blame here.I want to like this cord, because it seems quite sturdy, but otherwise there is nothing to recommend here.

"The Seagate Expansion 500 GB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive works well, just as you'd expect for any Seagate product. I've used their portable hard drives for years without any problems, and while there is no doubt that this USB 3.0 drive is the fastest one I've ever used, it won't win any beauty contests. It's a little shorter in length and lighter than previous models, but the enclosure is a bit more boxy. I've used it on both Windows and Mac machines without any problem (with the proper formatting, fo course).

"[EDIT:] The BUFFALO MiniStation 500 GB Thunderbolt/USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive has failed. I have adjusted the review rating to reflect my poor experience with the defective product, and the lack of an acceptable avenue for resolving problems.I have bought and used dozens of drives over the years, and I know failures occur with every manufacturer (I have never come across a total failure myself), so maybe I just got a dud. I've checked with technicians, and they have confirmed that the data cannot be accessed because a failure somewhere in the device (perhaps the connectors), and not because of my computers or anything on my end. I have enjoyed other Buffalo products in the past, so I do not think my one anecdote here should be taken as representative of the quality of their products.My problem is with Buffalo's policies. I contacted Buffalo and the representative told me I can: (a) send in the device (with my data stuck on it) for a refund, (b) use an affiliated data recovery service for a fee, or (c) void the warranty by opening it myself. None of these seem particularly palatable to me, and the representative was unwilling or unable to be flexible (strikingly different than my experience with other companies like Amazon). I don't know if these policies are standard for the industry, but at least with Buffalo, you should know what will happen if you encounter issues.By the way, as with any backup device, it is worth investing in other backup solutions for your backups. Redundancy is extremely important in a digitized world, and fortunately, my ""just in case"" drives (by other manufacturers) have my data stored safe and sound. Again, I want to stress that failures happen, and this may have just been bad luck. I accept that. However, I am uncomfortable with the company's policies to resolve problems.----------------------[Original Five-Star Review]The BUFFALO MiniStation 500 GB Thunderbolt/USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive impressed me right out of the box with its attention to detail, and it delivered with high speed performance as well.--- DESIGN ---- Silver and white with thin black rubber strips on the bottom to keep it firmly in place -- a perfect match for a Mac.- A cleverly placed white light on the bottom that glows softly when it is plugged in.- It feels quite sturdy.--- USAGE ---- The Thunderbolt connection makes a huge difference. This is my first Thunderbolt device, and I was blown away by the speed.- The USB connector appears to be 3.0, and this is what it says in the product description for what I ordered, but the box and literature makes no mention of it being USB 3.0. In fact, it has a strange chart on the back comparing USB 2.0, FireWire 800, and Thunderbolt speeds.--- RECOMMENDATION ---- I highly recommend the drive for its design and speed, but in terms of capacity, you could probably find a portable one with twice as much storage for half as much money. Of course, the cheaper alternatives won't be as nice-looking, and won't have Thunderbolt.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FICUE596EXIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D4X9VC#wasThisHelpful","R1FICUE596EXIC","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Belkin Micro (1.1 Amp) USB wall Charger with 4ft Sync / Charge Cable impressed me with its sturdiness. There isn't much to say about it, because it is basically the same kind of charger you can get from Apple for your iPod Touch or iPhone. It works as expected. The difference, though, is in the cable.As everyone knows, the Apple cables are prone to falling apart at either end, and at some point you have probably thought about going out and getting another cable. I know I have bought a couple already!Well, the next time you need to do that, instead of getting the standard Apple one, which you know will break, look into this one. It is quite thick and seems like it will last a long time.  I have only had it for about a month, so I cannot say for certain what will happen, but I have a very good feeling about it! I will update this review in the future to tell you how it goes.[EDIT:} I've edited this review to reflect my experience with it over time. The cable remains in excellent condition, and I quite like that aspect of it, but the connector that is supposed to slip into the iPhone and gently latch itself to the device, only works on the iPhone this way, and not on the iPad. Even a light bump will disconnect the iPad from the cable, which means that if you are going on a trip, you have to bring two cables instead of one. It's no big deal if you only have an iPhone, because that is what the cable is designed for, but if you have multiple devices and plan to use the cable with them, then you are probably not going to be as satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UG69KB388H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CLYIZG#wasThisHelpful","R21UG69KB388H4","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[EDIT:]  The drive has stopped working for me on my Mac. It is no longer recognized. Could it be my upgrade to Mountain Lion that did it? Every other drive works fine, though. I am happy to say that I can still read it on my Windows machine (I formatted it this way). I've lowered my rating, because I do not think this behavior (losing the ability to access a drive) is expected. I'll keep working with it to see if I can improve the performance, but I have a feeling I may have to reformat the disk and start again.----------The Seagate Expansion 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive isn't the best-looking device I've ever had, but I like how smoothly it runs.QUIETI've had other ones in the past (even ones by Seagate) that make a bunch of noise while running, but this one seems to be pretty quiet. The fan  kicked in after a few hours of transferring files. It isn't too bad at all, and that is the only noise coming from it. It is a little warm to the touch, but not hot at all, and I expect it will do fine.FASTThe USB 3.0 tranfer is what you would expect: fast.SPACEIt had 1.81 GB on it. I suppose it is standard for these things to come with a little bit less space than advertised, so no big deal, but something to know.SOFTWARENone. I thought there was some inside (I actually like the Seagate backup manager software I have used in the past), but the only thing I found was a way to register the device. Delete that file and you are ready to go.MAC OR PC?I ran it first on my PC, because that is the model I ordered, but I ended up reformatting it for a Mac. If you do this, I recommend using a PC to reformat the drive as ""ExFat"". Doing so supposedly makes it possible to use the drive on both Mac and Windows. Apparently, reformatting as ""ExFat"" with the Mac will not give you this capability.ACCESSORIESA power cord and the USB connection. As this is a desktop version, you have to have it plugged in to use it, and you cannot run it off of the USB connection alone.SUMMARYAll in all, it is a great product, and just what I have come to expect from Seagate. I think the designers could have done a little more with the outside (why do my other Seagate drives from the past look so much better?), but it is a backup drive after all, so as long as it does what it is supposed to do, I can't complain!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYORJQX95ZMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SJS0#wasThisHelpful","RZYORJQX95ZMF","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Apple MacBook Air MD224LL/A 11.6-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION) to replace my 2011 Macbook Pro 13"". I am a lecturer / graduate student, and this is now my main computer.BUILD QUALITYIt is surprisingly sturdy. Although I plan to purchase a clear case for it (probably from iPearl), I think you could probably get away with using nothing at all. This ruggedness is an amazing feat, considering its light weight. Owners of previous Macbook Airs will enjoy more of the same.DISPLAYThe Macbook Air has a beautiful display that is quite bright, crisp, and clear. The automatic dimmer function adjusts the brightness level according to the ambient light, and I have found that this works really well. Personally, I think the colors on the Macbook Pro 13"" display ""popped"" a little bit more, and I liked the bezel-less solid piece of glass on it better. However, there is no denying that the resolution on this machine is far superior. I have seen the resolutions on some of the other ultrabooks (Windows), and I think this looks better (the ppi is actually about the same). [EDIT:] The soon-to-be-released Zenbook and others are supposed to have better displays this year, though, so this may change in the future.KEYBOARDIt is full-sized and typing on it feels good. The backlit keys are great. The keys don't travel enough for my taste, and it feels a little less solid than the Macbook Pro, but this is a minor complaint. I write for a living, and I am looking forward to writing on this!TRACKPADThe glass trackpad probably does not get much mention in most reviews, but it is one of the best features of a Macbook, and it sets Apple computers apart from competitors. I retired my mouse a long time ago because of it. If you take the time to master the gestures (see your preferences), and you give full-screen views on applications a try, you can enjoy an incredible experience on this machine. The slightest touch whisks you from screen to screen.BATTERYFar too short. Really, 5 hours is not very much, and it looks like I am only getting about that much with regular use on half brightness [EDITED: after testing a couple of times -- just short of five hours]. I wish they could have bumped this up an hour or two more, and I will miss the long life on my Macbook Pro. I guess battery life is one of the trade-offs for this form factor.SPEEDIt is lightning fast. To be honest, I cannot tell a difference yet between it and last year's model. They tell me it is faster, though, so I guess I will have to believe them. Perhaps a few months of usage will give me more perspective. At any rate, it is noticeably faster than the Macbook Pro.ACCESSORIES / STUFF / PORTSThe cord is a good length, and the power brick is quite small. It is somewhere between the size of my iPad power brick and the Macbook Pro power brick. From what I can tell, it looks considerably smaller than the 13"" Macbook Air one. I am thinking that I might not mind carrying it around in my man bag with the Macbook Air. The ports on the machine are very conveniently placed, with one USB port on each side. This is so much better than the Macbook Pro, which had all of the ports on the left, where they would inevitably cause problems. Fat thumb-drives sometimes took up so much space I couldn't get another USB cable into the slot next to it. There is no Ethernet port. No Firewire port either. Be forewarned. It doesn't matter to me, but it might to you.COMPARISONS- 64GBI purchased the 128GB model. With judicious use of cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox, and perhaps the purchase of a 32GB thumb drive to carry around files in case you are not connected, I think 64GB is also doable. One of the great things about this year's 64GB model is that you get the same 4GB of RAM. I consider that model to be the best value, and I would have gotten it if I didn't have a large number of files in one application that, because of the application's design, I cannot put on the cloud.- 13"" Macbook AirThe base model 13"" Macbook air is a better buy if you want the extra battery life and screen size. I value portability over those things (I can carry this in a small man bag, but if I got the 13"" I would have to move up to a mail bag or backback).- 13"" Macbook ProThe Macbook Pro 13"" was an OK computer last year, and before the Macbook Air's Sandy Bridge refresh, was definitely the best entry-level product. However, they did not update the resolution this year, it is rather pokey compared to the Macbook Air, and it is much heavier. Unless you just simply refuse to use the cloud and have an obscene amount of files to carry around every day, I see no point in getting it.- UltrabooksAs for Windows ultrabooks, I might actually consider them if there was a significant price difference, but most that I have seen are just about the same price as the Macbook Air. They also have inferior build quality (in my opinion) and no support (all of the good stuff you have heard about Apple's phenomenal support is true). I am excited about Windows 8 (sorry Apple fanboys!) and I like where ultrabooks are headed. [EDIT:] It looks like the soon-to-be-released Zenbook will likely be better in terms of specs and price, so if you are wavering between Apple and Windows, you may want to wait a bit longer.- Upgrade from 2011 modelI don't think I would do it if I had the 128GB / 4GB RAM version. The form factor is pretty much the same, and so is the speed. There are some minor improvements like USB 3.0, but otherwise, it probably isn't worth it. If you have the 64GB /2GB RAM version from last year, you could probably benefit from the extra RAM.SUMMARYBecause of the high resolution display, and the ability to view applications in full-screen mode, I think this computer is portability perfected. It could definitely serve as your main machine, and I think many people will find that it is a better experience than the Pro models from just a year before. If you are a student, this is probably one of the best computers available on the market, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCO4ZC1NVQMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CWJABQ#wasThisHelpful","RLCO4ZC1NVQMD","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iHome 2-In-1 Pen Stylus is a thin, well-designed stylus that feels like an adult's pen instead of a child's crayon. I like the thin body of the pen, the smaller size of the nub, and I think it is a great idea to have a ballpoint pen built into it as well. There are still moments when I need a pen (usually lending it to friends and colleagues who are stuck in the middle ages with dead tree paper and no writing implements). What I don't like is the metal (the ring between the nub and the pen body) so close to the screen -- just like the Targus and Griffin styluses (styli).By the way, this stylus works great with the iPad 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RDOHFK9WIH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YIZWYI#wasThisHelpful","R24RDOHFK9WIH0","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Speck Products See Thru Satin Case replaced a clear plastic case I originally bought with my Macbook Pro last year.

"The Targus Slim Case for the new iPad (3rd Generation) is an excellent case for the new iPad, and in some ways superior to the smart cover + hard case (Belkin) solution I used for the iPad 2. This is a very well-built item, and it looks to me like they have thought of almost everything, but there are some problems.PROS- The magnets wake it up and put it to sleep. It appears that there may have been a problem with this before (see other reviews), but at least with the item I received, it worked flawlessly if you are carrying it around in your hands. If you put it into a bag, that is another matter (see below).- All of the openings (for volume and so forth) line up perfectly.- The surface provides a nice grip and the stitching is high quality.- The back case is lined with a felt-like material that protects the back of the iPad. I am not sure how necessary this is, because my Belkin hard case never caused any damage, but it looks nice! The plastic seems like it is higher quality than the Belkin one, and more likely to last without cracking.- The front cover is a little bit thicker and sturdier than the smart cover, so it actually might provide a little bit of real protection. It also seems less prone to causing those annoying dust lines, so you only get one instead of three.CONS- My one complaint is that the stylus holder (also doubles as a catch for the cover so that you can lay the iPad down on a table at an angle) is invonveniently located so that the case does not lay flat. It is surprisingly problematic when using the case (for example) with the Incase Origami Workstation. And, if you put a stylus into it (as you are supposed to), then it becomes unusable with the workstation. I really wish they would have found a way to make the back flat, because as much as I love pretty much everything about this case (these are difficult to design well), and I also happen to like the Targus stylus, this is a vexing problem.- If you carry it around in a bag, even if it is the only item in there, the cover will move and your iPad will wake up. No matter how gently I moved, I could not keep the iPad asleep. So, I have reduced the number of stars from four to three and added this criticism here. It is really too bad, because this is a really nice case otherwise.SUMMARYI highly recommend this case for someone who does not need to lay it down flat on any surface or carry it around in a bag, because this is a really high quality case that offers stylish, lightweight protection. However, if you plan to use it with the Incase Origami Workstation, or flat on a table top, you might want to be aware of its limitations. It is certainly not unusable (at least, without the stylus in the holder), but it may not be ideal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P3DBW5GBLYJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076POB8O#wasThisHelpful","R1P3DBW5GBLYJ9","A1GW7V6S6XSXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GW7V6S6XSXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this author's The Testing trilogy.  When I heard the synopsis for Need, I was definitely interested in it.  A social website that pitted people against each other to have their wants fulfilled?  Sounds good.  The book was good.  It just wasn't great.  I think for me that was because of the book's 'reveal'...or rather the explanation of why the site was being run and how the site seemed to know everything about the kids from this one high school.  It was just a very flimsy explanation.  I did like all the different view points, although I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers who say that some of the many characters aren't very fleshed out.  Well, that is necessary because there are so many of them.  But they work for this kind of story.  The plot is there, the characters are there, and the eerie writing style is there.

"This filter is among a few I have in my household. Being given this is larger than my others, which are counter top /dresser top models, i keep this in my living room which is approximately 150 square feet. The various fan speeds and settings built into this unit along with the remote are very useful. I have the allergy air filter installed in this unit currently and seems to filter very effectively.I have 2 dogs and 3 cats in my home so it is getting its use. The negative I have about this filter is the replacement filters. The price of them are $100 and as of this review are out of stock. For that price i hope that it lasts awhile. I do like that they offer several types of filters depending on what you're wanting out of the air. This air filter is capable of just sitting on floor or being hung on a wall, which i may end up doing to save on floor space. this also has a spot to add fragrance oils into which I have not taken advantage of yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMS23ORBA750/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WVVZK0#wasThisHelpful","R3UMS23ORBA750","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality of this speaker is beyond incredible. I love it so much, and it has very nice support for bass. It also can reach a significantly loud volume, while maintaining a very nice support with no feedback.The speaker can be used through Bluetooth, however, it also comes with a red aux wire which allows use without Bluetooth connection. My only issue with this product has to do with this wire. When plugged into the speaker, it makes a quiet buzzing sound. It isn't anything too noticeable, and does not take away much from the experience. When using Bluetooth, the buzzing noise is not present.I highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a nice quality speaker with nice bass support. I love it very much and will be using it for quite a while!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPL5N59UCO0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R2HPL5N59UCO0I","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dumplin was one of my most highly anticipated reads for the year.  I couldn't wait to see how Julie Murphy pulled off a realistic story about teenage, fat girl joining a beauty pageant.  Willowdean is a heavy girl who lives with her mom, a former Beauty Queen who runs the local pageant.  She struggles with her relationship with her mom and being a possible disappointment to her.  Willowdean works at a fast food restaurant where she has a summer relationship with a hot boy named Bo who pretty much keeps Willowdean a secret.  When he shows up at her school the next fall, she is miserable.  She decides it will show her confidence and bring her closer to her recently deceased obese aunt Lucy if she does the pageant.  That starts a whole other plot line where she and her best friend break up.  Things get pretty confusing and bleak for Willowdean as she is forced to discover who she really is and what she really wants.I like Willowdean just fine.  I think she had a pretty authentic voice for a 'fat girl'.  Yes, she is kind of judgemental of others.  She is a teenager.  Despite her confidence, she still has many insecurities.  I loved the three other misfits who join up with Willowdean and thought the growing friendship between them the best part of the entire book.  There were a couple of things I didn't care for.  First I just can't buy Bo, the hot guy from the restaurant.  I can't figure out what either of them see in each other.  And I don't know that I can buy the super hot jock guy falling for Willowdean.  I mean, it is a fat girl's dream and I know that many good looking men end up with heavier woman later in life  (I have one I call Husband) but in high school?  Does that happen?  Also, the boy that she dated to distract her from Bo seemed more genuine and kind than Bo did.  I feel like that would have been more realistic (and he was still a jock) and more fulfilling had that been the case.  I am also one of the readers who felt like the pageant didnt' get enough focus in the book.  It really did feel like it was tacked on at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXD0E2TCC14Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062327186#wasThisHelpful","RIXD0E2TCC14Z","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband loves this watch.  It is very large but looks great on him.  Our watch DOES seem like a very different one than the one pictured however.  Looks like a bunch of reviewers received a watch other than what was pictures.  Ours has a metal bank and a large crystal face.  We are happy with the watch by Invicta which was received in error but I'm sure many were disappointed that they got something other than they expected.

"3 1/2 stars...I loved the plot of this book and I loved the author's writing.  Erin Bowman is a talented writer for sure.  The book is about a teenage girl who lives out on the west and comes home to find her father murdered and hanging from a tree.  She immediately embarks on a quest to find the killers, a pack of bandits called the Rose Riders.  There is more than she bargained for when she learns her father has long since kept secrets from her.The book had a twist at the end which I never saw coming so it deserves a bonus for that.  I read so much YA fiction that I can usually call a twist a mile away.  My only real problem with the book was the love interest.  He was damaged goods for sure and I am not really sure that he ever  was good enough for Kate.  I wanted to like him but he was a character with deep tragedies scarring him and deep prejudices that he needed to overcome.  I didn't really feel like he overcame those.Still this historical or 'western' genre is certainly one I'd like to see more of in YA.  This is unique and fast paced book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R279UGEEMO40A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544466381#wasThisHelpful","R279UGEEMO40A4","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have three cats who let us live with them.  We don't normally feed our cats wet cat food and when we do we use it as a treat.  We normally feed them Friskies cat food, which all three cats enjoy regardless of the flavor.  The Nutro is supposed to be healthier and appears to be based on the ingredients. Two of our cats thoroughly enjoy  the Nutro, however, our older cat, for some reason, does not.  He literally runs away from it.  He prefers his dry food or the Friskies wet food.  One side effect that we noticed is that it gives our cats a horribly smelling poo. (Not that it ever smells good, but this is really BAD).  This is a nice 24 pack of Salmon & Tuna, Salmon & Duck, and Chicken.

"This was the perfect toy/blanket for the baby in our family.  She loves laying on it and trying to grab at the different animals.  The colors are charming, the animals are delightful.  The sounds it makes pique baby's curiosity.  I love the crinkly sound of the blanket and that it remains soft and cuddly for baby fingers.  It is also small and lightweight so it is easy to carry around on the fly, especially on car trips.

"I am not familiar at all with the original tale of the Arabian Nights that this story is based off of so I can't give any compare an contrast there.  However I did like ""The Wrath and The Dawn"" enough to read the sequel.  Its the story of the 'evil' caliph who takes a new bride each day and then kills them at dawn.  Shazi has volunteered to be his bride because her friend was recently one of Khalid's victims. She wants explanations and revenge.The plot was pretty easy to figure out early on.  Khalid isn't really evil and the two have mad attraction between them.  Khalid, being our narrator is the 'special' wife of Khalid's hundreds who he actually falls for.  So basically readers keep reading to find out why Khalid is killing these woman and if the two in fact get together.  Now there was a ton of external drama happening throughout the book to add conflict.  There is Khalid's childhood boyfriend and his best friend trying to save her life.  Her own father is a shady character who is most certain up to no good.  But the sections with these characters slowed the book down and they were by far the least interesting aspects of the book.I wish there was more actual danger and conflict from inside Khalid's home/manor/whatever it is called here.  I liked these supporting characters much better.  They include Khalid's best frenemy and Shazi's servant girl.  And the scenes actually featuring both Shazi and Khalid were too few and far between.  I loved their chemistry!The author has done a great job with this novel and as I said, I look forward to a sequel. Some of the plot threads could have been tightened up but there was well done tension and intrigue to keep me flying through the pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9W4QNWWWOYXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171614#wasThisHelpful","R9W4QNWWWOYXT","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book should be mandatory reading for every middle school or high school student.  ""Life Unaware"" is not a perfect book, but it is close to being so.  Let me back up for a moment.  ""Life Unaware"" is about bullying...both the bullied and the bullies.  Regan Flay is a mean girl.  She is one of the most popular girls in school.  Her mom is a politician who holds Regan to the highest standards.  Regan will do anything to stay on top of the school food chain.The first few chapters really let us know how cruel Regan is and that she doesn't much think about the consequences of her hurtful words and actions. Readers will likely hate Regan at this point.  However, I bet more than a few teenage readers will see something of themselves in her as well.  Then Regan's world is flipped upside down.  Her private text messages and emails have been leaked.  They are all over the school.  Everyone knows exactly what Regan has said about them.  Her friends turn on her as well.  Everyone looks down on her.  Now Regan is the one being bullied.The is a very hard-core and realistic novel.  It doesn't sugar-coat the hurt that bullying causes.  It deals with suicide, anxiety and depression. Yet, there is such a sense of hope and redemption.  We have a different Regan, a REAL Regan by the end of the story.  And I am so happy to say that the change in her attitude feels like a natural consequence to her actions.  It doesn't feel convenient for the sake of the novel.  There are some bad words in the book and some references to sex.  All of those things are done to capture the realistic feel of the high school environment.Now for one little complaint which still can't make me detract stars:  When Regan is shunned at school and bullied relentlessly she almost immediately has Nolan at her side.  Nolan is another 'freak' at school, but he defends her and is there for her.  Many kids being bullied do not have anyone on their side.  They don't have a ""Nolan"" to support them or pull their attention away during confrontations.  While Nolan is ultimately necessary for this novel to succeed in telling this particular story, all I could think about is a bullied teen reading this novel and feeling like they have no one for them.  Regan is never truly alone in this book.Still ""Life Unaware"" is the best story I have read that deals with bullying.  Not to sound trite, but it would be a great movie and I think that would be a great way to get this important story to the non-readers out there.  I will look for more to come from Cole Gibsen.  I am very impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQJ1J2UOQZS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622663969#wasThisHelpful","R2UQJ1J2UOQZS9","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't overly impressed at the beginning of ""You and Me and Him"".  I thought it was trying to hard to be another ""Eleanor and Park"" mixed with some of the gay-centered themes taken from a lot of popular contemporary YA novels that are so in right now. I thought the 'dibs' thing might be shallow and I really worried that Maggie's weight problems would magically be fixed by the end of the book.Then somewhere in the middle of the book I found myself completely absorbed into the story and really connected with the teenage characters.  I'm an adult and my high school days are behind me, however, this book manages to authentical capture exactly what it feels to be a teenager facing challenges in high school.  The basic idea of the story is that overweight Maggie and her BFF Nash fall for the same new guy the minute they see him on the bus.  Nash calls 'dibs' which means he gets to pursue and/or crush over the new guy and it's Maggie's job to support that in any way she can as his friend.  However the new guy Tom seems to have other plans.  However, Tom is such a flirt that everyone thinks Tom could be interested in them.The story truly ends up being about two things: Friendship and forgiveness.  Maggie needs to both forgive and be forgiven. I will say that I really enjoyed Maggie as a character.  She makes some honest mistakes but never means to hurt anyone especially Nash.  There is a scene between Maggie and her PE Teacher that made me so angry.  And I know that there are indeed people just like this teacher in real life.  I also appreciated that Tom isn't all of what he seems to be and neither are some of the other characters.  Teenagers will likely see themselves in the main characters and while the book gets a little bit heave at times, it remains an entertaining book.  Oh and when I got to the part about geoducks I had to look them up online.  Wow, I may never be the same.  I never knew such a thing existed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1CX4BW9644X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544301129#wasThisHelpful","R1S1CX4BW9644X","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A reader can't possibly love every book they read.  And a book can't possibly be loved by every person who reads it.  I did not love ""Charlie, Presumed Dead"".  I loved the general plot:  Charlie dies under questionable or at least odd circumstances.  At his funeral his girlfriend meets his other girlfriend.  Together they decide to find out if Charlie really is dead and if not they hope to confront him.Anne Heltzel is a good author.  The story was well-written but not always engaging.  There were many times that the novel stalled which really should not happen since the girls jump from one crazy escapade into another.  I did like both girls and my favorite part of the novel was seeing their friendship develop.  I thought the author did a fantastic job of making sure both girls had distinct voices since they take turns narrating the chapters.  I started the novel not liking Charlie and I ended it the same.  However I did not feel like I learned anything real about Charlie.  He told a lot of lies and kept two girlfriends but we don't ever understand what made him tick.  I could never determine who I could trust in the book and while that should have been a good plot device, ultimately it just became sad and disappointing.  I also did not find it believable that the girls were teenagers, one just finishing high school.  They were running all around poverty stricken countries and their parent's did nothing more than demand they come home.  Weird.  When I was reading the book I felt like they behaved like women in their mid twenties.  It may have helped make this book more believable.But that ending was just not right!  It was the worst kind of cliffhanger where absolutely nothing is resolved and you know that you will need to read another book in a year to find out what happens.  Unfortunately, I am not entertained or invested enough to read a sequel.  Many people loved this book and I can see why.  It just was not a good fit for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37O6L0E0107E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544388496#wasThisHelpful","R37O6L0E0107E6","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I love fairytale retellings and I love everything else I've read by Sarah J Maas so it seemed logical that I would love ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"".  However, I was bummed when I realized this book was marketed as NA-New Adult which in my personal interpretation means ""Lots more sex, less story"".  I like some romance in my stories, but I am not big on romance without a big and exciting plot.  So I put off reading this book which prior to realizing its genre, I wanted at the top of my TBR pile.  That is very unfortunate because I loved this book.  I was engrossed from the very beginning when I didn't have any idea of what was going on.The basic story is this:  Feyre and her father and two sisters live in a falling apart cottage after the sister's mother passes away and her father loses their fortune.  The entire town is financially devastated and the family is in real danger of starving to death.  In necessity, Feyre learns to hunt.  But life it very hard.  One day on a hunt in the nearby woods, Feyre kills an unusual wolf.  But the wolf is no ordinary wolf and this act causes serious repercussions. A Fae beast comes to take Feyre away to his castle in exchange for the life of the wolf.Thus begins some of the Beauty and The Beast themes.  Tamlin is the gruff Lord of the Fae whose kingdom is under a spell from an evil enchantress.  Feyre wants to get away from the castle at first but soon grows to love Tamlin.  Instead of a library, he gives her art supplies.  There are many, many other things that reminded me of the Beauty and Beast story in general and even at times of things from the Disney cartoon.  The New Adult aspect does come into play in the book as there is a lot of sexual tensions and eventually sex, although it is not overly explicit in nature.I felt like the possibility of rape or torture always hung as a potential threat over Feyre's head.  Some of the fae seemed ok, but some from other lands were legitimately scary and dangerous.I really did enjoy this book, but parts of it are slow moving.  Yet I would have enjoyed more time in the Castle with Tamlin and Feyre as they were some of the most entertaining parts.  Through the course of the book, Feyre grows.  She realizes the strength she has had all along inside of her.  She confronts her feelings of hurt and betrayal at the hands of her family members.  She sees that there is a world out there worth living to see.  The last quarter of the book is fast paced and thrilling.  Feyre makes shocking choices and will have to live with the fallout from them for the rest of her life.  If this was to be a stand alone novel, readers would be satisfied by the ending.  However, there is more than enough threads left dangling for this to be a series.  I will be glad to read any future books set in this world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOIDE7UJ6XVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619634449#wasThisHelpful","R1HOIDE7UJ6XVH","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really beautiful and high quality watch.  However I was very surprised by how wide the band was.  It overpowered my thin friend's wrist when she tried it on and emphasized by thicker wrist when I had it on.  It is also as heavy as my husband's watches.  I work at a computer all day and I couldn't possibly wear the heavy watch for day to day use.  The design is beautiful, and the black accent on the gold band is very nice.  Its a no frills analog watch.  A good design feature on this is that the clasp is hidden.  The watch has some definite good and bad features.

"4.5 Stars.  I'm deducting 1/2 star because I found the book a little confusing at the start when the chapters flipped back between before and after.  This refers to parts of the two sisterâs story that happened before or after a horrible accident leaves Dara disfigured and lame and her older sister Nick dealing with the consequences of causing the accident.  Now Dara wonât talk to Nick and the story is told in the sisterâs alternating perspectives.The before part is standard YA fare.  The sisterâs seem to both be involved with the same boy, Parker.  This causes a wedge between the girls who are already in family crisis after their parentâs divorce and their father falling for a new woman.  Then we get to the After.  The âafterâ story is quite strong, as we try to unravel the mystery of the disappearance of a young local girl as well as start working our way backwards to find out the cause of the accident. The two sisters don't talk to each other much as Dara who was always the popular sister holds Nick responsible for her injuries. But Nick wants to make things right between them again.The story felt like a jumble of disconnected thread but I should have trusted the author all along. The ending comes together in a way that wraps up even the most insignificant thread. And there is a shocking twist that I never saw coming.  It made me go back and reread certain scenes from my new and more informed point of view.  The story is and emotionally charged story where the focus is more on family the many contemporary young adult novels are. Of course there are boys and other commonplace young adult themes but this one digs in deeper than most. One quick warning: teenagers in ""vanishing girls"" casually drink, do drugs, have sex, and use profanity. Overall this isn't done gratuitously but adds to the realistic feel of the novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0TTTKZI5TB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062224107#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0TTTKZI5TB3","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really waffled back and forth on what to rate this novel.  The storyline, characters and world make it an easy five star book so I shouldn't have had any question what I would rate it.  However I found out that this book is currently a stand alone book.  The author is not against creating a sequel and it is up in the air now with the publisher.  This amazing, engrossing, beautiful novel ends on what I would consider a cliffhanger.  Most of the threads in the book were not resolved although the story ends on a hopeful note.  Yet, the idea that this is the end of the story leaves a huge emptiness that will cause me to be very dissatisfied and I don't know if I can recommend a book with no true ending.For the sake of this review, I am going to respond as though there will be at least one other installment to wrap up the storylines presented in ""An Ember In The Ashes"".Last year fantasy, both adult and YA, made up the majority of my favorite novels.  I couldn't get enough.  However in the past few months all the stories started sounding similar.  I decided maybe I would stop reading newly released fantasy books while I just finished out series I had already started.  I also debated moving on and trying some other genres.  Then I had the opportunity to read ""An Ember In The Ashes"".  The early reviews all gushed over it.  Movie rights were already sold.  I decided to try it and I procrastinated a little bit getting to it.  However I was hooked almost immediately.  The writing is gorgeous and the world is alive.  It also had a unique world and characters which is all I hoped for.  The story is told from two perspectives.  The first is Laia whose family has been killed and her world destroyed by the martials, the ruling class who have oppressed and used the Scholars.  The martials, including their most elite class of soldier the Masks, are scary as anything out there.  They are trained soldiers whose only loyalty is to their commandant.  They are trained to fight and kill.  Eventually the masks they wear form to their faces and can't be removed. And they have arrested Laia's brother, her only living family member.  Elias is the second narrator.  He is also a Mask.Their worlds intersect when Laia comes to work in the training school where she is a servant to the commandant, who happens to be Elias's very unloving mother.I won't go too much more into the plot because I don't want to give anything away.  It is also a truly complex story and every thought I think to write about in my review leads to ten other thoughts.  This book is violent.  More so than most YA books.  There is a serious threat of life and limb at any moment.  There are a few moments of fun and joy and lightheartedness sprinkled through the book but it is really dark.  Yet that makes the goodness in Laia, Elias, and a few other supporting characters really stand out.  It makes you root for them.  And I for one really want to see a change in the rulers of this world.  Again, this was just a phenomenal, engrossing and unique story and I really have to hope for a sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZEDCC9R4505/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148035#wasThisHelpful","R3JZEDCC9R4505","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This keyboard is amazing.  It has so many features I doubt we will ever use them all.  I love the way the keyboard feels.  It is almost an old fashioned feel to the keys, like my old Commodore 64 or older typewriter.  My wife doesn't care as much for the taller keys because she is used to the more flat keyboard.

"I really wanted to like this toy...but the cats don't like it.  Cat 1 wouldn't even approach it after having it lay out for a couple days.  Cat 2 is our more adventurous cat and he approached and batted at it a few times.  Then I swear he yawned and walked away, never to return.  Cat 3 is my sweet boy who also likes to play yet this thing scared the fooey out of him.  He jumped straight up in the air and ran away.  He usually sleeps with us all night, in bed every night and he never came back the rest of the night.  Even now, he walks around this one very carefully.  I can't say what they don't like about it... Just that the mice action wasn't enough to entice them to play.  If I had to guess, I'd say the chirping of the mice was just too much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVANKBN2XKL2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQYXAXC#wasThisHelpful","RVANKBN2XKL2W","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I currently own a Rockwell Sonicrafter X2 and have loved it ever since I bought it. One downfall of any of these types of tools are the blades.  The teeth on the blades wear down quickly or even break off easily.  So far, I have had no problems with the Imperial Blade but it hasn't been run through the full gauntlet of possibilities I encounter in my line of work.  I anticipate that this blade will wear down as would any blade but I have a feeling it is going to wear down less quickly than the other standards.

"I loved this book.  You will love this book too if you can just ignore from the start any and all scientific background given to explain how science can determine your deathdate (And I didn't see anywhere in this book that the success rate isn't 100% although it mentions a few people out there with undetermined dates).  Then after you suspend your disbelief on the science of it, you need to suspend your disbelief on the governments involvement in which they mandate that every citizen must be tested.  Good with doing all that?Yes?  Ok, read this book.Denton has known since he was five years old that he would die when he was seventeen years old.  Anyone who is sch eduled to die when they are under eighteen is known as an 'early'.  When he is in elementary school he meets Paolo, who becomes his lifelong best friend when they bond over the fact that they are both earlies.  In fact, Paolo will die a month after Denton.  As the book opens Denton is waking up on the day of his Funeral.  In this world, its a huge celebration of life where the deceased isn't actually deceased yet.  In fact, Denton gives his own Eulogy.  But even as the clock on Denton's life is winding down, he still has a heck of a lot of living to do.  For starters, he awoke this morning in Paolo's sister Veronica's bed.  Did they DO it?  Also, did his girlfriend Taryn break up with him last night?  Can he get his dad to tell him more about his deceased mother before he dies?  Why has his mother's life always been such a secret?  Who is this policeman that keeps stalking Denton?  What is this growing purple bruise on his leg?  Is this going to be his cause of death?  Or is he going to die at the hands of the school bully?I can't even believe how many times I laughed out loud while reading this book. But Denton's voice as a teenage facing his death just felt so natural and realistic. Yes, there are some unbelievable threads in the story but when you put those beside charming and relateable characters, suspension of belief becomes much easier.All of that said, I felt like this book ended with many unresolved plot points and I haven't seen where there is a sequel planned but there really needs to be one.  I will definitely pre-order a book with more Denton and company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HPHEO5QRLPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553496964#wasThisHelpful","R21HPHEO5QRLPD","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed ""The Witch Hunter"".  It was similar to a lot of current YA fantasy novels, yet different enough to make it stand out.  Elizabeth is a witch hunter along with her best friend Caleb.  The world forbids magic and magic users (witches) are burned at the stake or beheaded.  Even being caught with herbs used by witches can be cause for immediate incarceration and ultimately death.  Elizabeth truly believes, although her job is an ugly one, that it is the right path that she is on.  She is just upholding the law after all.  But then Elizabeth herself is caught with witches herbs and is jailed.  Even though she is one of the greatest Witch Hunters the world has ever seen, her pleas are met on deaf ears.  She is rescued by Nicholas, the greatest sorcerer the world has ever seen and the world's most wanted man.  Surely they are evil and want her for some nefarious purpose, right?From this point of the novel on, Elizabeth must face the truth about her mentors and her witch hunting.  Who truly is evil?  Is magic all bad?  Is everything Elizabeth ever known to be true just an elaborate lie?I loved this world and I loved the side characters in this book tremendously.  There is a little, sweet romantic side plot between Elizabeth and one of Nicholas's men, a healer.  Its not intense, and the book is not a romance novel.  But it is a nice addition and I like that John doesn't fit the normal mold of most YA leading men.  He is shy and a healer.  He is kind of geeky and that makes him adorable and somewhat unique.  I also really, really like Fifer.  She could star in her own book, seriously.  There are so many layers to her that are intriguing.  George is another fun side character.  This group is so unusual and gripping.  The specifics to the magical abilities are also fun and entertaining.I wouldn't say there is anything groundbreaking or shocking about ""The Witch Hunter"" but it a well written, fast paced and entertaining book.  This author is one to watch for sure.  I have been in a pretty big dry spell especially regarding fantasy novels, but this one still had the ability to stand out and entertain me.  I will eagerly be on the lookout for a sequel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHQRKUMPPEJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031632700X#wasThisHelpful","R1LHQRKUMPPEJY","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have wanted a Dyson for ten years; ever since I bought my home.  We are also a pet friendly home that has two dogs (one a super hairy golden retriever) and three cats.  I won't even deny it:  We have to buy a new vacuum every single year. Why?  All that darn pet hair!  It will kill a regular vacuum unbelievably fast.  This Dyson has made my year!  I have been able to get rid of my current funky half working vacuum.  I have been able to get rid of the car vacuum because this Dyson does a beautiful job with our car upholstery as well.  I was told Dyson's have suction like no other and I want to assure you that is true.  You have to see this to believe it. It is also not only bagless, but filterless!  Which means it is truly a clean vacuum.  There is nothing worse than vacuuming your carpets, and then realizing how gross and disgusting your actual  vacuum has become in the process.  Or even worse, having to dump out the full bag.  You get all those dust flybacks no matter how careful you try to be.  Ever since I was a young girl, first taking on chores, I hated having to wind up the cord. This wonder eliminates that too.  You click a button and the cord folds up by itself.  The true star of this particular machine is that Tangle Free Turbine tool for pet hair/dander.  Holy cow, this price is worth this little tool alone.  Nothing has controlled the pet hair in my house like this tool.  I am 100% satisfied with this vacuum.

"As a fan of fairy tales and their retellings, I was very excited to read the newest re-telling of Sleeping Beauty, âA Wicked Thingâ.  Within the first chapter, Aurora awakes to her âtrue loveâsâ kiss.  But realistically she is very confused and freaked out by this strange young man kissing her awake.  When she finds out she has slept for a hundred years, she is heartbroken.  Her family has long since passed away but Aurora remembers the night she fell under the curse like it was just yesterday.  And she herself remains un-aged.  The prince and his family, the new King and Queen just expect her to wake right up and adjust to her new life.  She is going to marry her prince right away and they canât wait to announce it to the Kingdom.  But Aurora is grieving and not one person takes time to look at her and acknowledge that.  It is quite evident right away that everyone wants to use Aurora for their own gain.  After all she is the famous sleeping princess of legends and she will raise magic in the kingdom again.  But Aurora doesnât hold magic, right?  And she canât magically make the kingdom love the new King or make their lives any better.The opening is fantastic.  The middle drags a bit and I became weary of the story.  Aurora seems like a doormat for quite some time, just going along with whatever anyone says to do and questioning very little.  I can excuse quite a lot of this because she truly is shocked and in mourning without one person who really cares about her.  I did really like that there were three potential love interests for Aurora but she ended the book without a single one being an actual romantic interest (at least as of the end of this story).  The middle really did meander along.  But then the end became quite exciting again and was actually what the book should have been like all along.  Aurora is a good person and yet everything feels stacked against her.  She finally gets up the nerve to take matters into her own hands and force a change and it is great.  I am on board for the sequel for sure however I feel like this book could have been stronger than it was.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9KVEZIGWGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062303538#wasThisHelpful","R1T9KVEZIGWGF","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Winner's Curse was my favorite book released in 2014.  This is early so far in 2015 but ""Winner's Crime"" has a fair shot of holding that title this year.  The world Kestrel finds herself in starting this novel is very dangerous.  She has jumped from the frying pan into the fire with her alliance made at the end of book one...the alliance she made to help Arin.  Reading this book is like watching a chess match with bated breath.  There are so many moves being made by players in the story and it is hard to know who to trust.  This one is stressful.  I took my time reading it because I loved it, but also I just knew bad things were happening and I couldn't stop them.  That says a lot actually, for a book to impact its reader so strongly.  But I Iove Kestrel and Arin.  Unfortunately there is not a ton of time showing the two of them together.  While necessary for the plot, it was disappointing because those few scenes are amazing.  There is so much tension, passion, and love between them.  Talk about forbidden love and insurmountably high obstacles. Romeo and Juliet had nothing on this couple.  This book is packed with so much drama and intrigue that I don't want to give anything away.  Just read it...read the first one first, of course. But read it and enjoy one of the best fantasy series around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20U3J2S3BMNCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374384703#wasThisHelpful","R20U3J2S3BMNCB","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute, fun, Playhouse Castle.  It is made out of cardboard so it comes with all the expected drawbacks of that.  Don't expect something that will last for a super long time, because this is just like letting your kids play with a giant box your hot water heater or your refrigerator came in. (if it was pure white and they could decorate it).  When unpackaging in, we almost threw it out right then and there because there were no directions and the creases from packing were different than the corners of the castle and I got a paper cut.  We then referred to the picture on Amazon and was able to put it up by using that as a guideline.  The doors are perforated not only down the middle but all the way around and they have already fallen off.Now all of that said, the three and four years old have fallen madly in love with this castle  They have played in it for hours now.  They love the window cutouts and the castle shape. Once they seemed to tire of just the white cardboard castle, we introduced the paint and decorating aspects and that was a blast.  It took well over an hour for two kids to decorate the castle.This really is a fun toy/activity.  Just be aware that you are spending money for what is literally is a cardboard cutout.  In my opinion it has a lot of entertainment value and memory making time spent with this toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR6LDJ8XHZW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZPO5AK#wasThisHelpful","R2FR6LDJ8XHZW2","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in a reading slump.  I needed something different and what is more different that a cult?  The book is told from the point of view of 17 year old Jacob ...or Brother Jacob.  He was very young when his parents left their successful lives in the 'real' world and relocated to the Nodd religious compound.  The Grace cult believes in keeping away from the outside world to keep out the sin and temptation that runs rampant there.  They believe their way is the only way to Heaven and that their little compound is another Eden.  Father Grace (naturally) has multiple wives and when he takes a very young member as his newest wife, things begin to crumble for Jacob and all of Nodd.Jacob had planned to take Father Grace's newest wife as his own. Then he meets a young cowgirl who lives on the ranch next door.  Secretly they begin to visit and talk with each other.  Around this time some new members arrive from the outside.  The young boy with them also begins to change how Jacob sees the only world he has ever known.  I don't want to give much away, but the book is obviously about Jacob's life in Nodd and how he learns to open his eyes and see the downside (and downfall) of the lifestyle he has always known.I really did enjoy this book.  It was a quick, fascinating read.  The only negative is that I knew all along how things would end and there wasn't a lot of surprises along the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WE5ORYPVSJYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763674184#wasThisHelpful","R2WE5ORYPVSJYQ","A17U562HOY2OQV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17U562HOY2OQV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always liked this lotion because it spreads quickly and smoothly over the skin, and because it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel.It also imparts a pretty, moist-looking glow on the skin. Also great is the scent, which is very light, fresh, and clean. The scent does not linger, and does not smell like perfume in any way, so it can be used by both men and women.The ingredients of 15% Shea Butter, glycerin, sunflower seed oil, sweet almond fruit extract are especially soothing to the skin.  NOTE: the cream does contain alcohol, and other less-pronouncable ingredients.All in all, I think this is a light-yet-rich lotion that both you and your ""significant-other"" will enjoy using.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGDSSA5YGCKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052H2JXW#wasThisHelpful","R3AGDSSA5YGCKO","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No scratches or ""dings"" despite almost-daily wear.--Decent price for a charm-bracelet of this type.But I had to rate it four-stars rather than five, because:--The importance of the Medical ID is what made me purchase the bracelet in the first place.--The Medical ID is so tiny as to be almost unreadable.--The pink breast cancer and medical symbols are also very tiny.--Therefore, the bracelet might be mistaken (by medical personnel) as JUST an ordinary bracelet.Still, it is a good personal reminder to protect your left arm when you go to doctor's appointments, etc. I'd say combine it with a more prominent medical ID bracelet for extra security.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35K4AXWXGN6Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LP9IW2#wasThisHelpful","R35K4AXWXGN6Y5","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thick, rich cream is made with a combination of ingredients, including the Immortelle flower from Corsica. L'Occitane tells us that the flower has ""exceptional longevity"" and ""never fades, even after it has been picked.""Their use of the flower (and other ingredients including daisy flower extract, sunflower extract, honey, etc.) produces a cream which is velvety in feel, delightfully fresh in scent, and works wonders on mature, dry skin.(I will add here that the cream also contains some harder-to-pronounce ingredients such as sodium benzoate, zinc gluconate, etc.)The cream absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel, but it does leave a dewy moisturized look to the skin. In addition to the dewy look it imparts, it beautifully smooths out fine lines and adds firmness.Pricey? Oh, yes. But a little goes a long way.

"Actually, Keaton's ""Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty"" is a combination of beauty musings, and selected parts of her life story. The life-snippets that she writes about relate to beauty topics, but mostly in a way that reveal her personal insecurities regarding her looks. (By this I mean, she doesn't tell you which anti-aging creams to use, etc.)Keaton writes that insecurity about her looks began early, and continue to the present day. She tells us that she was always uncomfortable with (most) aspects of her looks (and even her personality/speech patterns), and admits that hasn't changed much.She also shares the fact that she is uncomfortable about her insecurity, and realizes that it borders on obsession. For example, in the chapter called ""BAD HAIR DAYS"", she writes: ""Diane, you're not allowed to wear the hat today, and here's why: at this point in your highly privileged life, your hair doesn't matter to anyone but you.""However in earlier (and later) chapters of the book, Keaton has some insightful (and even poetic) takes on what makes real beauty in truly authentic women and men. The chapter ""PRISONERS ON MY WALL"" is a good example of this, as is the chapter called ""THE EYES HAVE IT.""Though she rambles a bit throughout the book, I found myself enjoying her stream-of-consciousness style, and even agreeing with some of the tidbits about personal growth, and aging.Four stars instead of five, because some readers might prefer a book that is more straight-on beauty book OR autobiography. As for me, I enjoyed the combination of the two genres.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFTMKWDOLM1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994264#wasThisHelpful","R1SFTMKWDOLM1P","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried lots of 5 blade razors. Some gave a smooth shave, some didn't. The ones that didn't had moisture strips that prevented the razor from giving a close shave.While the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care has moisturizing serum (delivered on little dots on each side of the razor), the blades themselves are ""curve sensing"" and somehow deliver the close shave everyone everyone wants.After shaving, legs are noticeably smooth and yes, silky.The handle of the razor is comfortable to use, and has a rubbery texture, which is better than any hard-plastic types I've tried, because it is less likely to slip in your hand. It's the right size as well, and easy to grip.Great little razor that comes with one handle and 2 cartridges.

"Have a new little fur-baby in your home? Well, we don't,  but  as ""veteran"" cat owners, I can tell you, this potty starter kit is a great, state of the art way to help your cat of any age (and yourself) to a cleaner, better-smelling, NEATER ""potty"" experience. We wanted to try it, especially, because we travel, and wanted to have an ""extra"", and longer-lasting box in the house as a stand by for when we are away for a couple of days. (We just set it up next to the regular litter box.)Though not inexpensive, the kit is complete, and even comes with instructions for BEYOND THE BOX--as in: how to help train your new kitten/cat to use the box and avoid accidents (clear, helpful instructions for humans include how to avoid over-reacting to any accidents that may occur--and how to switch to this type of litter--just great!)But back to the kit, which includes: a small-ish sized (kitten size for sure) plastic litter box, with a removable strainer-tray, plus a pooper-scooper (These are all all in heavy-duty washable plastic).Also included are 2 deodorizing litter pads, which fold up, for easy disposal, plus a bag of small pellets, which substitute for the usual clay-type litter. (These are also deodorizing.) Both of these items are sold separately from the kit and box as refills, but come with your first kit.Everything in the kit is a little different from what you may be used to seeing/using for a litter box. For example, the litter pellets resemble something you might think belong in a gerbil cage! BUT, here's the good news: they cover P&P (pee & poop) completely, and with virtually NO odor.We found the easiest way to help old Tom adjust was to follow the kit directions, which said to spread some of our old, regular litter on top of the new pellets. Puddy didn't even seem to notice the pellets below, and within half a day, was using the box as usual.Supposedly, you can leave the box alone for a WEEK without changing the litter pellets, but we didn't go there, since our cat is older. Two days, and we changed the contents. I'm pretty sure a longer time would work for a kitten, but if you are switching to this type of litter for a mature cat, I'd still change the pads/pellets more often.All in all, this is a neat, compact, little ""system"" that will keep your cat's potty area fresh, and better-smelling-than-usual.Four stars instead of five, simply because of the higher cost, and also because you will have to order the refill pads and pellets instead of just picking them up at retail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWHK7905XGVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5VQSXI#wasThisHelpful","R2BWHK7905XGVN","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Jouer Mineral Powder Blush comes in different colors, but the one I am reviewing here is ""Blossom.""  This particular color is a soft, peachy-pink ""goes-with-everything"" shade. (Think of it as a sort of coral, leaning just a touch more toward peach.)It also does contain the tiniest amount of sparkle, but it is not in any way ""glittery"". (Glitter isn't something I want on my 60+ skin.) It applies smoothly and evenly. (Note: it doesn't come with a brush, so use a nice, big fluffy blush-brush of your own for best results.) The color also stays true throughout the day, and doesn't morph into something different than what you first applied.The narrow compact opens easily, and has a mirror which, despite its small-ish size, allows a good view of the entire face. (The compact can also be attached to other Jouer products, via a ""snap-together"" system.)Despite all the things I liked about this blush, I'm rating four stars instead of five, because a couple of the ingredients might not be what every consumer wants. Those ingredients are: Talc (1st ingredient--some women just don't like talc in any face product), and Mica (2nd ingredient--some women might not want ANY sparkle at all, not even a tiny amount).But if talc and mica are okay with you, I think you'll be pleased with this blush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IB61DXQ09UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXW58NU#wasThisHelpful","R16IB61DXQ09UL","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a person with ""mature"" skin that is somewhat on the dry side, I found the jouer anti-aging moisture primer lacking in the moisture department.First I applied an spf 15 for sensitive skin (Olay), and then I applied the primer as directed, except I used a bit more than the recommended ""pearl-size"" amount since that wasn't enough to completely cover my face. I followed this with a few small dots of foundation which I blended in.I expected that the primer would really make the foundation spread and slip more easily, but it did just a fair job of that, despite the fact that it contains Argan Oil and Shea Butter.I also did not notice (even as the day wore on) any noticeable diminishment of fine lines/wrinkles, nor did I see any evident ""lifting"".As for improvement in skin texture, there was a slight smoothing of the skin surface, but slight is the key word.Now, having said all this, there ARE some good things about this primer, including what it LACKS, namely: it is free of silicone, parabens, and fragrance.And good things also in what it CONTAINS, namely: Argan oil, shea butter, vitamin E and peptides.Still, overall, I think this is best for women who don't need much moisture on their skin, and for those who don't have many (or any) fine lines and wrinkles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC1FJLTMF92S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG9MSAM#wasThisHelpful","R2QC1FJLTMF92S","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Besides the pleasant scent, and the noticeable shine, this product does a good job of subtly toning down yellow/brassy/orange tones.I recently switched from a more golden blonde color to champagne blonde. Even with the cooler tones of champagne, after a few shampoos, I noticed the gradual creeping in of the dreaded brassy areas. I used this a little differently than called for on the directions (more on that in a minute), and the results were: cooler and somewhat darker tones that disguised the brass.Here's how I used it: after shampoo and conditioner were rinsed out (per directions), I applied (approx.) a half-palm-sized amount, and worked in in well from roots to ends (my hair is short). Finished up my shower, and rinsed well.Four stars instead of five simply because some ladies may not like using an extra step like this after shampooing, and they also may not care for the fact that you are supposed to use it 3-5 TIMES AT ONCE. That's a long time in the shower!  Results (as written above) were good enough for me, but I was fine with a subtle improvement. Also, because this is applied and rinsed AFTER conditioner, you may not retain the moisture you like in your hair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76K8RN1L0C5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLS58SO#wasThisHelpful","R76K8RN1L0C5F","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay. Here's the facts about me:I'm over sixty, and I still like to experiment with hair color, because I DON'T like white/grey.So, for the past year, I'v been using L'Oreal  91/2B Lightest Natural Blonde (Natural tones). Right after coloring, the result has been good. BUT...2 weeks (or so) after color, I had brassy, yellow/orange/reddish tones. AND...the grey on the sides and along the lower hairline was showing though, big time!  So I resorted to using color more often than the directions advise (which is every 4-6 weeks). This resulted in very dried-out, bleached-out looking strands. With the white/grey still visible.After trying the John Freida Colour Refreshing Gloss here's what  I saw:--Shiny, softer hair--Golden tone renewed--Brassiness reduced (less yellow/orange look)--Worked better than the ""purple shampoo"" I was using to combat brassiness.--Helped to ""blend in"" the white/grey at my temples.Overall, good results!Honestly, I think this is a great product for younger women, who use light(er) golden blonde shades, who may want to ""rev up"" their golden tones. (That part worked for me!)Does what it says, which is: ""Adds golden tones"".  Also adds shine, and softness.How to use it:: Shampoo, condition, then put a palm-size amount in you hair, finish your shower, and rinse the product out, (The directions say a ""quarter-size"" amount, but, trust me, fill your palm. and work it in to your strands completely).You'll notice enhanced golden tone, shine, and softness of your hair.As a P.S.--As I said, I""m over sixty, and question my choice of golden tones, so I think I'll soon be trying this product in the ""cool blondes"" range. Updated review to follow when that happens... most likely in a few days...I'm due!:>)BTW: Came back to edit this review, and explain the 4 strs, instead of 5. That's because, the product says ""Salon Fresh Color"". Well, yes, sort of. As in, your overall result will be shiny, soft, and ""brightened."" But the product does NOT (nor is it meant to) completely cover roots or grays. So, 'Salon Fresh"" should not be taken literally. Also, though easy to use, it does add an extra step to the shampoo and condition process. Plus, the color does transfer to the skin of your hands, so be sure to wash them thoroughly with soap right after you use the glosser.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9UALPDXHEY1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLS593S#wasThisHelpful","R9UALPDXHEY1T","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the introduction to this book, author David Acord asks: ""Why would anyone want to model his or her life after someone who never existed?""Good question, and here are some possible answers:1) They are fans or admirers of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.2) They have read and loved every Sherlock short story and novel Doyle wrote.3) They are new to Sherlock literature, but are avid fans of the TV show versions of the Great Detective.OR...4) They realize that Sherlock, though fictional, was, as David Acord puts it: ""Genius. Renaissance Man. Iconoclast.Master of Detection.""  And they want some of that for themselves.For example, readers may want to know how focusing on the little things, the details, can help them succeed.Or how having fun with their work can help them rise to the top of their field.With this little book, readers can examine and learn from a fictional man who did exactly those things I just mentioned, and more, much more. Also, readers will learn a good deal about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself, and they will re-visit some of their favorite Sherlock tales. TV fans will perhaps gain insight into why they've fallen so hard for Sherlock.Here's the best part of this book: all of the ""success secrets"" it contains are practical, applicable methods that anyone can use to increase their chances of success in their career, or in their life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30J5TGJGLI6EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SM0M3M#wasThisHelpful","R30J5TGJGLI6EG","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a long time, I've been curious about gummy vitamins. Not because I have trouble swallowing pills, but because they seemed like a FUN way to get the extra nutrients that I usually get in a pill form multivitamin. So I gave these a try.For starters, I'll say that the amount of vitamins and minerals they contain are not as high, nor as complete, as my Centrum Silver.  That's the reason for the 4 stars.However, they taste GREAT, and they are FUN to take. Like chewing 2 pieces of not-too-sweet candy.In order to make up for the less than perfect vitamin/mineral content, I alternate them with my pills. (One day a pill, next day 2 gummies.) And I actually look forward to the ""treat"" days when I get to use the gummies.For anyone who has trouble swallowing pills, or who is just lax about taking regular multi-vitamins, you might find, as I did, that these make ""taking your medicine"" a treat instead of a chore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELCM9A1NBMXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKN6KD0#wasThisHelpful","R2ELCM9A1NBMXU","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then, you just ""act out"" the stuff on your card. You get votes. You get awards. Easy!BUT you can also abandon the rules (we did), if you wish, and encourage your fellow players to GUESS what you are acting out.

"I've tried other texturising sprays (Garnier Wonder Waves, for example), hoping to get some ""beachy waves"" into my SLIGHTLY wavy, layered hair. What I got was ""crunch.""With this Toni & Guy version, I didn't get ""crunch"", which was good, but I did get a little bit of ""stiffness"". (Think hairspray without the stickiness.) I was able to release the stiffness by continued finger styling after the product dried. Still, there wasn't much movement to my hair.As for creating waves, no, I can't say this did it. But it DID give loads of ""texture"" (defined my layers) and tons of ""volume"" (my hair was puffed up and BIGGER).The scent was mild (""parfum"" is a listed ingredient), and faded quickly.The above points were the good qualities of the product.The not so good qualities: It's drying to the hair (at least to mine), despite the fact that ""castor oil"" is a listed ingredient, it left my hair with NO shine (""sodium chloride"" and ""alcohol"" are ingredients, and I'm sure they don't do much for moisture and shine).It left me feeling like I needed to shampoo, simply because my hair was so dull-looking, and as I've already mentioned, slightly stiff.Those aside, I can still give it three stars, because I think if you have natural waves, or curls you want to control, this may be the right product for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD950VUBBZSE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006L6A9NK#wasThisHelpful","RD950VUBBZSE0","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked several things about this oil, including:The scent, which is slightly musky/nutty sweet, but not overpowering. In short, it's a lovely aroma. (Contains coconut oil and sweet almond oil, plus ""fragrance"", which explains the scent combo, I think.)It can be used on damp or dry skin. I prefer it on damp skin. Used this way, you can massage the oil in, then pat dry, and your skin will feel hydrated for most of the day.(On dry skin the oil ""sits"" too long, not absorbing quickly enough.)A little goes a long way. (I pour a small --quarter size) amount in my hand, and spread it over damp skin. This covers entire torso. Use less for your arms if you try this.)BUT...There were a couple of things I didn't care for, including:The spray applicator releases in more of a STREAM than a fine spray. So you get a ""blob"" of oil if you use it with the spray. (As I mentioned, I'm a ""pour and massage"" type, but I tried the spray.)Mineral oil is the first ingredient. And it DOES feel sort of like baby oil. In other words, it feels ""heavy"" and slightly oily. (Unlike, say, Neutrogena body oil, Light Sesame Formula, unscented, which I've also used, and which feels light on the skin.)Those two things were enough to remove two stars, especially because I think some users will object to the scent,  the mineral oil, the heavy feel, and the fact that it is not truly a ""dry"" oil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNASWR1K53PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYB13OQ#wasThisHelpful","R2RNASWR1K53PC","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great little brow trimmer, that operates on a single AA battery. What I especially liked: The head of the brow trimmer is just slightly angled, which makes it easer to control shaping on the brows.For ladies, here's how I recommend using it: comb your brow hair upward; cover the hair you do NOT want to trim with your finger. Then, trim just the TIP of the brow hair (above your finger). I recommend this method because there's very little chance that you'll trim off too much hair if you do it this way.Also, this model is superior to an older Remington trimmer I have (silver color), which has a flat, not angled head.I had to take off one star simply because I can't speak to the effectiveness of the nose/ear trimming use of the product, since I use it only for brow trimming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPYOI4LXDGIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2B2RJM#wasThisHelpful","RWPYOI4LXDGIF","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Again, simple.What wasn't so simple: installation.  I needed help from a friend who is pretty savvy about installing ANYTHING, and even he had difficulty with the wiring on this unit.Why? Because the original wiring from the furnace to our old thermostat is not labelled. Therefore the labelling/identifying of connections which come on the unit itself, don't help much. And again, that is because it's difficult to match it up with the original wiring.We took our time, read all the instructions (which are many) and got it done, but it was tricky.In a nutshell, there are things to like about this unit, thus the three stars.

(I suspect this is because some of the gel just gets washed away (by saliva) as it sits on your teeth.However, on the plus side, the pens were also easier to use than strips.

Also, if you object to products made in China, be aware that these are produced there.As for me, I liked the job these did cleaning and softening the skin, and the fact that they have a mild, pleasant fragrance made them even nicer to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15P9RZNXNVU8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA4MQ72#wasThisHelpful","R15P9RZNXNVU8B","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, packaging details: Age Perfect Day Cream is packaged in a neat little white pot, that comes with a plastic ""protective"" cover over the cream. This cover has a small handle on top which makes it easy to remove and replace.The cream itself is ultra-thick, and ultra moisturizing. It spreads smoothly onto the skin, and leaves a dewy look. It does, however, take some time to ""sink-in"" (probably because it is so thick. And the sunscreen (SPF 15) usually plays a role in how fast a moisturizer is taken in by the skin (many sunscreens just sit on top of the skin as a barrier).The scent is not unpleasant (as in not a strong, chemical smell, as some sunscreens have), and fades fairly quickly.Because the cream is so rich, I found it uncomfortable to wear under liquid or cream makeup. However, with a light dusting of powder foundation, it was comfortable enough.I also used the cream on my neck, and liked the smooth look it provided there.  I don't have any issues with sagging or age-spots, so I can't speak to the cream's effectiveness in those areas.My rating of four stars instead of five, is because of the richness and heaviness under makeup that I noted above. If you like a ""light"" feel on your face, this might not be for you. But if you use powder foundation, or no makeup, or have dry, mature skin, you may find this your go-to day/sunscreen.Notes: The SPF is only 15, so this would not be for prolonged (day at the beach) sun protection, unless you re-apply. Also: be careful around the eye area! the instructions clearly state ""keep out of eyes.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MUS59Z3L7EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DO1KRY#wasThisHelpful","R26MUS59Z3L7EU","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(That's self-explanatory, I think :>)--it's bulky. As in, the handle isn't slim like all the other Sonicare models.

"I've tried many brands of nasal spray over the years, and always found Afrin to work the best.  Some of the generic, or ""no-name"" brands, either didn't clear my congestion at all, or they cleared it only briefly. So I always returned to Afrin.This Good Sense Sinus brand, gave the same 12-hour relief as Afrin.  (It has the same active ingredient, in the same amount as Afrin --Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride 0.05%.)The squeeze-to-spray-it bottle gives a good, powerful spray, which you can feel working. Some generic brands I've tried had a weak, drippy spray.Like Afrin Sinus, this brand has a sort of ""mentholated"" smell to it, which also feels cooling and soothing as it hits the nasal passages.

"Jennifer L. Scott is decades younger than I, but as I read her charming book, I found myself nodding in agreement, and sometimes saying ""YES!"" out loud.As an exchange student, American-born Scott lived in Paris with a French family. While there, she observed important cultural differences that seemed to endow her French hosts (and all of the French) with a more pleasureable and more elegant lifestyle than Americans.She began to incorporate these ""secrets"" into her own life, and later, brought them back with her to the states. (She lives in California now, and has a popular blog and facebook page where she also writes about the ""secrets"".)Her book contains 20 chapters which cover topics such as: Part I--Diet and Exercise. Part II--Style and Beauty.Part III--How to Live Well. Each of the chapters ends with a recap that gives short little reminders to readers for how they can make each secret part of their daily life.For me, the essence of the book is this advice:--Simplify your life (de-clutter, etc.).--Slow Down (be mindful and take time to fully enjoy small daily ""rituals"" that you create.)--Savor (listen to music, read, buy flowers.)This is about enjoying life, and it is good advice for women of all ages.Best of all, Scott's advice doesn't seem like another ""to-do-list"" that will drive you crazier. Instead, you can take your time and create a better life that YOU define. (And it doesn't have to cost a lot of money, either!)It's a calming read, and a good reminder that no matter your age, you can design a life of pleasure and beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5XGPQ35TNA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451699379#wasThisHelpful","R2L5XGPQ35TNA9","A1JAPP1CXRG57A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JAPP1CXRG57A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, the good.  The story did expand a tad on the background and culture of the Solar Clippers.  We also learned more about the other characters, how they handle problems and trouble makers on ship.Now the bad.  Ish is Jesus and Superman and perfect in every way.  Women want him, men want to be him, he is super smart and makes Joxer the Mighty look realistic.Yeah, I loved the first book.  It felt real and gritty and I enjoyed the Free Spirit of the culture of the spacers.Then the second book started having...bumps in the road.  The famous shopping spree and the feeling that people were more interested in sex than finding a partner started to spoil it for me - but it was still good and it did bring up the point of how romance on a ship MIGHT have issues.  Therefore looking for fun with people you will not be seeing in a long time, or ever again, may have advantages.  Reminded me a tad of 1970s science fiction that questioned mainstream culture by placing the reader in scenes that challenged what he or she thought was normal. Or made them uncomfortable.  But a lot of those authors sometimes just showed the sex without understanding the logic behind it or strength behind those freedom-loving characters.This book made me start to feel uncomfortable with where it was going.  The female spacers come across as 2-D characters who, when not on duty, are starved for sex.  The male characters are not as sex starved but they're just as underdeveloped in most cases.  Let me make this clear - there are not any real sex scenes - what the problem is was that many of the female characters were acting like cats in heat when not in uniform.The characters of Sarah is the only one who does not end up rubbing up against somebody.  Robert Heinlein can write such scenes and such stories - but he understood why it worked.  The impression I have here is somebody trying to copy the style without understanding the foundation of how it works.  Like when people copy Lovecraft.The setting is no longer interesting or gritty, many of the characters were ALSO no longer interesting and the character of Ish is a joke.  At least Joxer The Mighty started out as a joke and became something more. This is what bad fan fiction is like.  I should know, I wrote some fan fiction - good and bad.I fear this is where I am getting off this train wreck.  I don't plan to read the next three book in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351160YRMQ076/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982918011#wasThisHelpful","R351160YRMQ076","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, let me point out, before using any guide you should always read the book.  Guides like this one will not help you write a detailed report or even pass a test on the subjects.  They are meant to work along side the novel or movie or whatnot, to help you understand certain themes, help you view characters in a different light, and so on.I buy such guides to help me better understand some books I have.  Or at least see if anybody has anything NEW to add to my knowledge.  Out of all my guides I think this was the least interesting.  Many of the review questions fail, to me, to bring up anything new to the table (as it were).  There is also one chapter about how to write a literary analysis. Now while this would be interesting if I was writing an essay on The Hobbit this isn't what I want in a study guide.

"In almost every history class I have every taken that dealt with 20th century European history or World War Two the teachers always talked about how the Spanish Civil War was the proving ground for World War Two and the German Blitzkrieg.  First, the German idea of a breakthrough was developed during World War One, so even before reading this book I knew the latter statement was wrong.  What I did not realize was just how few Tank vs. Tank battles there were in the war till I finished reading this book - and I have a few books on the Spanish Civil War in my library.  But it takes a book like this one - which focuses solely on the tanks - to help you understand just how little there was for anybody to learn.  True, the Soviets learned enough to develop the T-34, but outside of that it seems that the Europeans (at best) learned to replace machine guns with heavier weapons.  The importance of proper training and maintenance was also something the Soviet's picked up on by the end of the war.  So, if anything, it was the Russians who learned about how to build a proper tank and the Germans, and other nations, either dismissed the war or used it to support their own ideas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSW4C6XXZ6H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846035120#wasThisHelpful","R3BSW4C6XXZ6H8","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of the chapters in this book are the essays presented at a conference on George Orwell's book held at the University of Michigan in March 1983.  The authors are across the board, from Professors of History to Professors of Psychology.  So we get a very interesting mixture of essays.  One chapter talks about Orwell's view on women, and the family, while another chapter deals with the Self and how memory works.  Much of the works are, to be honest, same old same old.  There are a few gems, like the chapter that examines the consequences of George Orwell and his books existing and it's not pretty, while other chapters examine the well worn topics of the English language, privacy, and sadism.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BH9GHONWQJVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0472080474#wasThisHelpful","R1BH9GHONWQJVJ","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kind of grew use to Matt Smith.  Like all Doctors I started out a little worried about him - could he handle the great weight of the part, could he be serious and yet funny when needed?  But I came to embrace him in the part and thought he worked well across from Jenna Coleman who plays Clara.  The actress is pretty, funny, strong, and a great foil for Matt Smith's Doctor.So this story, which brings their time together to a end, had to be great.  It had to be wonderful and joyful and painful.  It was the passing on of the name of the Doctor from Smith to the new Doctor, played by Peter Capadli, AND it was also a Christmas Special.For me it failed.  Why?  Well, it had a interesting setting - outside of the town being called Christmas which seemed a tad silly to me - and some interesting characters.  True - all the alien races in the universe where there yet we saw only a few.  I mean, don't tell, show.  You have the money to show so show.  SHOW!  I don't want hundreds of alien ships.  I want aliens.Oh yes, narration.  We get told much of the story.  This could have been a audio book or a radio book.But in the end it had, and this is my own honest opinion, no story.  I am not even sure I need to explain this.  The idea is that the Time Lords are trying to break back into our universe.  But they need to find the right one so are asking the Doctor to reply with his correct name.  Why?  Why not just invade any universe they can break into.  And when they are notified of the fact that they have the right universe - Clara gives that away - they help him.  Why?  They hate him.  They were trying to trick him into answering with a truth field.  Why didn't they just invade and why didn't we get a great scene of the renewed Time War?  Daleks vs. Time Lords!  Buy I guess that's kind of overdone also, now isn't it?It isn't a flawed story.  The fact is that it isn't a story at all.  More of a half-formed idea, a rough draft written on a napkin during a dinner at a friend's place, with some wine spilled on it.  With recycled ideas tossed in out of laziness.  Silence Has Fallen.  Crack in the walls.They wanted to make a EPIC STORY to say good bye to one Doctor and hello to another.  I think they may have done better to focus on a STORY and interesting CHARACTERS.  A NEW STORY.  Not a lame monster of old pieces and aging parts glued together with duct tape and chewing gum.The worst part is the lack of a hook to make me WATCH the new Doctor.  That's a sin.Rent or get it from a friend or watch it on the net.  Don't waste money.  Like I did.

"First, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD.  Second, I have been told that there were some changes to the story in making the film.  The Barretts of Wimpole Street is a movie based on a stage play based on a novel based on real events - the romance and marriage of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett.  The story is simple but the actors and actresses really bring it to life.  Charles Laughton playing the father, Edward Barrett, was so good that just his appearance on the screen made ME feel uncomfortable and ashamed!  And I'm not one of his kids!  The fact that his acting skills still can pour out of the film, a film released in 1934, just goes to show how powerful he is.Norma Shearer who played Elizabeth seemed to hit the character on the head.  I was not that impressed by Fredric March's version of Robert Browning - he seemed a tad over the top.  On the other hand, his bright, cheerful character does counteract the dark, depressing atmosphere of the rest of the piece.And it is depressing.  All the more so when you realize is was based on true events.  The father has crushed his children - he controls all parts of their lives, in the name of his love and that of God's.  This is a time when the father was truly the master of the house - if you lived under his roof you lived by his rules.  In real life her father would disinherit any of his children who married and he did disown her after the secret marriage.  Sadly her brothers also rejected her as they felt Robert Browning was a gold digger - but that piece of fact does not come up in the film.It is a dark story with a mixed ending - one of happiness but also some sadness.  This film is not for kids - some of the scenes are disturbing.  Running time is around 110 and while not rated I would suggest it only for 18 and older.  Funny enough the stage play has also been made into a musical and a TV series by the BBC.A little spoiler.  In the film the father is so upset by Elizabeth leaving he orders her pet dog killed.  But she took the dog with her so his order can not be carried out.  One of the changes was that in real life the father did KILL the dog.  I may be misinformed.  The story is already so dark I assume they changed that little detail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NOEEHM7B9YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9BU49Y#wasThisHelpful","R23NOEEHM7B9YH","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD.  Second, I have never red the book, so I can't compare it against the original story.The film is about a girl who is handed over to her grandfather after her parents are dead.  He is a grumpy old man but Heidi soon bonds with him, softening his heart towards her and others.  But then she is taken away and sold to a rich family to keep their sick girl company.  I would call it an overused trope but this is a movie from the 30s and it likely started the trope to begin with.The grandfather goes searching for Heidi, finds her, and kidnaps her to take her back home.  One horse chase later that makes you think of a bad action episode from ""Chips"" (a gun is USED) and all the loose ends are tied up.

"I have never red this as a child and, having enjoyed the first (older) movie after so many decades I decided to read the book.  I am glade I did but....it wasn't as interesting or as humorous as I thought it would be.  Maybe you have to be a kid to enjoy it?  Charlie Bucket and his family come across as a tad too silly or too extreme - they are a poor starving family, the basic plot of a lot of books - and Willy Wonka comes across as just plain weird.  And not in a good weird, that guy you invite to parties because he makes everybody laugh weird, oh no.  He is that bad weird, the guy next door who you don't let the kids make eye contact with, that kind of weird.He has a factory that has underground chambers where tiny people, called Oompa-Loompas, who slave away in his work shops, being paid only cacao beans.  The logic kind of reminds me of Alice in Wonderland but for the fact it isn't very logically and Alice in Wonderland was interesting.

"A reprint (and I think rewrite) of the 2008 edition, this is a detailed account of the making of, and final movie, Blade Runner and its history after release.  Many of the stories are well known and, to be honest, at just over a hundred pages there seems to be very little here that you could not find in a ten minute internet search.  Blade Runner is one of those films that developed a cult following well after its release and many facts have become well known.  A lot of the book seems to deal with the city and its place in the future, the ethics of androids, and the landscape of science fiction in the 20th century.  Which, while interesting, is not THAT interesting to a person who is already well versed in such things.  This is for a person who is totally new to the film or sci-fi films in general.

"The book covers eight wars, starting with World War One, which heads into World War Two, Korea and Vietnam, the clashes between India and Pakistan, the wars in the Holy Land, Saddam Hussein's Two Wars in the Gulf, and finally ending in Bosnia.  The author was not happy with the old answers and theories on why nations went to war and decided to focus on the leaders for the answers.  It is very eye opening, very revealing, and somewhat scary some of the conclusions the author arrived at in the end of each chapter and in the end of the book.  While the book is already in the 11th edition, making my copy outdated, I found myself comparing what was happening in Eastern Europe with many of the events in Bosnia and other conflicts mentioned inside the book.

"One of the reasons I love Steven Saylor's books is not just the fact that they are based on real events from Roman history but the amount of detail he dives into dealing with Roman thought, society, culture, and ideas without drowning the reader in too much information.  We don't get a data dump.  We also get wonderful characters, some fictional, some real based on what we know of their historical real lives.  Cicero, Marc Antony, Clodius, and Milo are all real people from Roman history and here they are given human, as well as humane, traits and flaws.  Once I pick up one of his mystery novels set in Ancient Rome I have a hard time putting it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MF8T6EV9A7P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312961731#wasThisHelpful","R2MF8T6EV9A7P7","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There us A LOT of Amish Romance novels out there but those I have found are not written by the Amish till I found Linda Byler's books.  Why is that important?  Because a lot of them don't get the Amish way of life or their way of thinking right.  Oh, they do a good job in general, but there is always something off.  they get the way the Amish think about God, the Church, and the individual's place within society off.I liked this novel.  It was a solid plot, based on the real life of the author, with colorful characters, real emotions, and include, like all good Amish books, RECIPES.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10G7Q7ZM7OX6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561486884#wasThisHelpful","R10G7Q7ZM7OX6N","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very detailed book that deals with the history of the Amish and the Mennonites, the main focus on how they deal with and adapt to changes in the world around them as well as changes within their own society.  From wars to questioning their own traditions, we get the ups and down of their history.  Somewhat dry, it is a very good overview and I would suggest it as a good beginning point for anybody who wants to really understand the Amish - or at least start the journey to understanding.Heavy use of primary source material and a large bibliography, it is the perfect starting point, and I think would make a good college text book.  I hope that it is updated and revised for future generations interested in the Amish.I enjoyed it but for people who don't love history as much as I do it will seem, as I said, a tad dry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTFVS1LAOVQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561483931#wasThisHelpful","R1PTFVS1LAOVQU","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book holds many stories, all enjoyable and interesting in their own ways.  The Legacy of Erich Zann is a mixture of the world of Lovecraft and Poe, with the character of Dupin from The Murders in the Rye Morgue set into the world of The Music of Erich Zann.  It is a wonderful, if sometimes confusing, ride and is worth the price of the book all by itself.But we get more than just that story. We also get The Truth About Pickman which is a story that suggests that curiosity can be a bad thing.We get The Holocaust of Ecstasy where we get to see the end of the world.  Cthulhu style.Than we get to enjoy the last story called The Seeds from the Mountains of Madness and we learn that the Elder Race is still trying their best to take over the world.  One greenhouse at a time.  Kind of reminded me of a Tom Baker Doctor Who story.The overall feel of the book is dark but not always hopeless like many of Lovecraft's tales.  We are not defeated.

"The Duchess of Duke Street is a book, let us say a novelization, of a good chunk of the first part of the television, The Duchess of Duke Street.  Now, that's kind of funny, from what I understand the series is based on the real life of a real person, Rose Lewis.  In fact I found a book, The Duchess of Jermyn Street: The Life and Good Times of Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish Hotel, a bio on Rosa Lewis.  There is not much to say about this book - it follows the events in the TV story up to a certain point and it well written.  The authors are known from writing Victorian historical pieces, so they know their locations, history, and how to create a proper atmosphere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19INQEULBBOL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553113607#wasThisHelpful","R19INQEULBBOL8","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, we found out just what happened in the end of the Time War.  We kind of knew it already, from the last episodes of David Tennant's time as the Doctor.  But in The Day of the Doctor we learn about just how guilty he felt about it.  To the point where he refused to even allow himself to even hold the title of Doctor.  It makes more sense when you watch the special.I am not a big fan of Rose but, funny enough, Billie Piper played Bad Wolf, so that's okay.  We get to see the Daleks and even see the Zygons back in action.  And we get to visit the Time Lords again.Now, we get to see two new Time Lords.  John Hurt, a favorite actor of mine, who has brought many wonderful and horrible parts to life.  He played Smith in my favorite version of Nineteen Eighty-Four, so I don't mean he was horrible at it, it is just a dark piece.He plays a wonderful Doctor, old and tired and bitter and making a decision that will change the very universe itself.We also get a glimpse of the future, and last, Doctor.  Well, his eyes and eyebrows.There is a lot of humor and the interaction between Hurt, Smith, and Tennant is wonderful.  It is always nice to see scenes where the Doctors get together.The Zygon sub-plot isn't that bad either and they do a good job of keeping the whole story moving without any bumps in the road and without over using special effects. And there is a surprise guest at the ending, which was very nice if not explained.  So, in fact we get five Doctors.

"But I felt the ending was slightly weak.  Maybe because it wasn't a true ending but a cliffhanger for the special?  Anyway, I truly hated to see the Ponds leave the series.  And I have to be honest, I was never a fan of Amy Pond, she always seem to rub me the wrong way. But The Angels Take Manhattan was a very powerfully emotional and amazingly interesting episode.Clara was a interesting mystery which lost some of her charm by the last episode The Name of the Doctor.  They kind of solved the mystery there in a way which I felt was a tad underwhelming.Still, I enjoyed seeing the Daleks back in Asylum, the Cybermen back in Nightmare in Silver, even if both of this enemies acted a tad off.  I would think the Daleks would see the Doctor as a greater threat than some music being played on a planet by an unknown human.  But that's just me.The Snowmen was interesting in how it brought back a old enemy for those of us who watched the original series and Cold War was wonderful for one who grew up in the Cold War and also liked the Ice Warriors.A Town Called Mercy I enjoyed very much.  It had a few plot twists, was set in an old Western town (which in fact is one in Spain where many of the great Westerns have been filmed), and starred Ben Browder as Isaac.  He happens to be one of my favorite stars from Farscape (and later Star Gate), so I was very happy to see him.overall I would say a Doctor Who fan would enjoy this season and should watch it to the end for to be prepared for the 50th anniversary special.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F336KM9NIZDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6ACVD6#wasThisHelpful","R3F336KM9NIZDM","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Which sometimes is good.  In this case...no.  Still a complex story but mostly about trade, coins, the Church, with some action in the form of a kidnapping.  I like the artwork but the economy heavy plot makes for a good business class 101 but makes for a somewhat bad second book in a series.  Even with the action near the end of the volume it still feels very slow and even a tad confusing to me.  I have decided, if I am going to enjoy this story, it will be via the text novels.  So I will likely read them - in fact already have the first book in that series, which the manga and anime are based on.  In the end, if I wanted a lesson on currency and early trade I could just go to one of my history books on the Middle Ages in Europe.  At least THAT I would enjoy and be able to get into.  Trying to make a realistic system of trade interesting, in a fantasy setting, may help fill out your world during the creation process.  But is a detail that should stay in the background.  You don't build your whole series around it.  Maybe one story, yes, but not the whole series.I plan to drop the manga and just, as I said, continue with the text novel and see if I enjoy that.In the end, the second volume is okay but is not as good as the first, suggesting that the series will, from my point of view, just become more and more uninteresting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HCP37WMSAJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316102326#wasThisHelpful","R8HCP37WMSAJK","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love world building and this setting is a strange yet familiar place that draws me in with every page.  The view point, at first, is from a traveling trader, a young merchant called Kraft Lawrence.  One night when he is about to go to bed he encounters the harvest goddess, a wolf, in the form of a young girl - Holo.  The history of this world, and the background of both characters, slowly unfold as we absorb the manga, enjoying each detail as it is given to us.  Sometimes it DOES feel like a data dump.  We get a lot of information about the Church, the economy, even coinage.  Yet the story was interesting enough for me to buy the first text volume.  This is one of those reviews in which I don't wish to say much - I don't want to spoil it for you.  But on the other hand I don't wish to give the wrong impression.  It's good but I don't think it's great.  In some ways I feel the text novel is a tad better at delivering the story.  Holo is a wisewolf but also kind of a flirt with Kraft, which seems to happen a lot in manga and anime.  I think I would have found it more interesting if they were not at all interested in each other.  I mean, she has ears and a tail!  Looks cute but in real life he should find that a tad off putting.  In the text novel he wonders if she is some kind of demon.  He believes that in the manga at first.  I would think it would be more realistic to keep that thought in the back of his mind - poking him like a thorn.  It seems fun and mature but sometimes just a tad too fantasy for me.  Even the map in the front of the book seems a tad too simple.  Is this our Earth?  A different Earth?  A alien planet?  Middle-Earth?  Quarter-Earth?I would suggest reading it but maybe getting it used or out of the library - if any library would have it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ETQ46Z4PBD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316073393#wasThisHelpful","R2ETQ46Z4PBD4","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is more drama than action.  We learn more about Giuseppe and Jean, and their dead sister.But the book mainly focuses on Petrushka the first of a new generation of cyborgs.  Not as strong as the first girls, the second generation, will live longer, but cheaper to make, easier to maintain, and their conditioning will be changed to make them more flexible.  The Agency feels is an improvement and a Russian girl is the first of the new cyborgs.  Yu Aida changes his style a tad in this volume.  The story is on the girl, showing us before her change, allowing us to see her background story and allowing us to have some emotional reaction to the events that change her life, forever.  Also, she looks older than the other girls, which makes sense as the Agency wishes to start using the technology on adults.  Her handler, Alessandro is somewhat of a jerk, a reaction you may find in other reviews, but is interesting in his own right - being of a different background as the other handlers.  While many of the handlers are ex military or police he use to be in operations against the Padania.  He feels the other handlers have too many...morals?It does make for some new interesting characters while the old ones, just as amazing, are also kept in the story.  There is also some debate about souls and fate, but they don't pound that in with page after page of lectures or anything like that.  They keep a lot of the exchange between characters real, which is always refreshing, and allow the reader to decide on their own about such things as souls, fate, and salvation.  Is it cruel to save this girls only to make them into killers?  To help a girl to walk again so she can run into battle?  To extend a life just to take others?  And why does that remind me a tad of Red Garden?

"There was Kull.  Kull was created before the wandering Conan and well before the doomed Bran Mak Morn.  Think of him as a foundation and setting for Mr. Howard's future stories and characters.  Not really good enough to build a whole world on but too good not to use.  One of his stories was recycled as a Conan story and he even time traveled to help Bran Mak Morn against the Romans.  His stories will feel somewhat familiar to those of us who are fans of Conan but once again, that is because Kull came first and was made by the same writer.  Yet he is really a character to enjoy.  By This Axe I Rule! is somewhat famous now, and the setting of the Kull novels is, when you think about it, the history and past of the Hyborian Age.  He is a man who truly started out as nothing but a naked man, a wild ape, who was educated and made into a brooding, thinking, barbarian.  The world of Kull is, in some ways, more beautiful but also more dangerous than those of latter ages.  Kull and his axe are more than just the early shadow of Conan.  Kull is a man who finds out what price he must pay for the prize he wishes.  A crown is sometimes heavier than one thinks.With wonderful drawings, unpublished fragments and drafts, this is a great book for any collection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VU43OZQCYPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JM8NO6#wasThisHelpful","R21VU43OZQCYPG","A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The beginning of a second series is not the best place to start.  The idea is a simple one - Wuntvor must help his Master and the other Wizards to cure themselves of a interesting malady.  Magic makes them sick.  So the apprentice must journey to the Eastern Kingdoms.  To get the help from Mother Duck.The humor was just not my type of humor and fell flat.  A lot.  Also I picked up this book, and An Excess of Enchantments, without realizing they were part of the second trilogy in the series.  Now, I picked up a lot of what was happening, so I don't really think it hurts it THAT much, but I seem to be very picky about humor in my fiction, be it fantasy, science fiction, or humor.  For me, this was more miss than hit and while I finished it and have started on the other book, I can't say I will continue with the third book.  Just not interested.  Also, I can't say it feels original.  I have never heard of Craig Shaw Gardner and, to be honest, I will unlikely pick up any more books by this author.I'm not saying I don't like humor.  I would always suggest for example Xanth: The Quest for Magic (A Spell for Chameleon; The Source of Magic; Castle Roogna) or M.Y.T.H. Inc.

Until now, I had been using antibacterial wipes and sprays to clean my equipment and yoga mat. It actually became discolored and started wearing out due to the harsh cleaners I was using. I had to buy a new yoga mat. I even made my own cleaner to use on it. I was so excited to get this Nama Sudz premium yoga mat cleaner. Now that I'm pregnant, I'm extra diligent about using all natural and organic cleaning products. Shipping was fast, I received a 4 fl oz spray bottle of 100% natural yoga mat wash. I love this stuff, it works great. Just a couple sprays and my yoga mat is like new. It doesn't just clean, it conditions the material, making it look new and shiny, it even smells clean. I use it on my waist belt too because it has similar material. It works awesome on all my exercise equipment. I highly recommend this product, it's essential if you own and use a yoga mat.

"I'm an advocate for using products containing all natural and organic ingredients, after all, the best remedies can all be found in nature. I've used quite a few different cellulite creams and I've even made my own. Different brands have their pros and cons but the same objective.

Shipping was fast and I received a nice sized jar of cellulite reducing cream. This stuff is pretty versatile. You can easily apply a thin layer or a generous amount, either way, the consistency is nice. Not too thick, not too thin. Has a wonderful feeling after applying it to my skin. I feel it working immediately. It's packed full of amazing ingredients such as caffeine, retinol, citric acid, organic aloe, green tea, and other vitamins, just to name a few. This formula is wonderful, it works deep into the skin minimizing the appearance of cellulite. It makes my skin more firm, heals stretch marks, lightens old scars, and smooths the lumps. I use it all over. My tummy, thighs, butt, arms, even my chest. I've noticed significant improvement. After 3 weeks of using this cream I've noticed a big difference. It has a tingling feeling that takes some getting used to, that's because the ingredients are working deep into the layers of skin. I highly recommend this cream, it really works.

I was excited to try this Aspen Naturals cocoa butter. Shipping was fast and I received a 1 lb solid bar of raw, unrefined, pure, food grade cocoa butter in a resealable bag. It's super easy to measure and use. I warm a knife using hot water, it makes it easier to shave pieces off, and I don't have to use very much for my homemade lotion bars and soaps. This cocoa butter should last me a long time. I'm very satisfied with it. It works fantastic in my DIY products and I highly recommend it. I've used other cocoa butter and I think this is the best quality I've tried.

"We cook every day and having all the most convenient utensils in our kitchen is important. I was excited to try this can opener. All the past can openers I've purchased, even the expensive ones, have broken. It's pretty disappointing to spend $15 on a can opener just to have it last a month. Thankfully I still had my manual opener, hard to use but reliable. I'd pretty much given up on buying can openers until I got the opportunity to get this Vanika brushed stainless steel can opener with can strainer. Shipping was fast and I received a beautiful, well made can opener and can strainer. I really like how comfortable this can opener is. It has ergonomic handles, they're nice and long too. And I love that it takes very little effort to use. The couldn't believe how easy it opens. I don't have to bare down to puncture a lid and put a lot of strength into turning the handle. I barely have to use any strength at all using it. It's very smooth and opens consistently. No stopping and starting again. I've had the can opener for a while now and I hand wash it then air dry, no rust has appeared on the gears like other can openers I've had. Not only is it good looking, shiny, and sleek, but it makes can opening easier than ever and it's very durable. I'm very happy with this can opener. And the can strainer is awesome. I use it all the time, you really can't beat this duo. The strainer fits all my cans and it's super easy to clean. I highly recommend this can opener.

"I love making my own fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice. Like everyone else, I've jumped on the all natural and organic diet. I was excited to try this 6peas fruit squeezer. Shipping was fast and I received a very nice, well made handheld juicer. It's made of food safe stainless steel, has very comfortable handles with great grip and easy to use. This lemon squeezer makes homemade juices in just a couple minutes. I'm able to apply consistent pressure to squeeze all the juice from my fruit and it's easy to clean which I love.

"I'm in my 30's and going through some hormonal changes. I never had acne as a teen but not I'm getting little pimples and zits all the time. I've taken steps to prevent it but a good, safe, gentle acne wash was definitely needed so I'm glad I ordered this Humane acne wash. Shipping was fast and I received a big 8 fl oz bottle of Humane. It has an easy to use pump, it's fragrance free and paraben free. It contains 10% benzoyl peroxide, which is amazing for a number of things but really seems to work wonders on my stubborn adult acne. It's very gentle and I haven't experienced any dryness or irritation. I absolutely love this product. It's also cruelty free and even the bottle is recyclable. Very impressed with this. In the past I purchased proactive for my teenage son because he has bad acne and this stuff works just as well as the proactive and it's more gentle. I highly recommend this product.

"I have random hairs that grow on my chin and they are pretty tough to pull. Sometimes they become ingrown and I have to dig it out. Even though I only get a few here and there, I really wanted to try a different method besides tweezing. Shipping was fast and I received this very interesting hair removal tool by XISS. It's an epilator, very simple design, and easy to use. I've seen other cultures use string to pull hairs but that's a learned technique. Using this epilator is a surefire and painless way to get rid of those unwanted hairs. I just followed the instructions. I simply hold the spring by its handles and make it a U shape. It's pretty self explanatory and works great. No slipping off the hair or breaking it. It pulls the hair out from the root. Doing it this way makes the hair less coarse when and if it grows back. Your skin is nice and smooth after too. It can be used on upper lip, chin, cheeks, jawline, really anywhere sensitive. It's not intended for bikini area, underarms, or legs. Really great product. I highly recommend it.

"I have naturally long lashes but they're so puny. I end up spending so much time applying mascara. My lashes will stick together or have gaps so I'll have to brush them then reapply. I was excited to try this Pretty Lash 3D fiber mascara. Shipping was fast and I received a box containing two tubes, one transplant gel and the other natural fibers. It also came with a lash comb/brush. Using this 3D fiber mascara has cut my lash ritual in half. It's very easy to use. I make sure my eyes and lashes are clean, run the lash comb through my lashes, apply a quick, even coat of gel from root to tip and immediately apply the fibers. I usually start with my bottom lashes. Applying the fibers are very easy. I gently brush the fibers onto the wet gel and it sticks evenly. Then I apply the gel again, just as if I was applying normal mascara. You don't need to use mascara with this. The gel is black and very natural looking so unless you're going for a different color lash, you won't need to add additional mascara. My lashes look amazing after using this. The fibers do very well to stay put. They don't fall in my eyes or end up on my cheeks. They look fuller, thicker, and it's long lasting. I can't believe how great my lashes look. I'll never use normal mascara again. And it washes off easily in the shower with my facial wash. I highly recommend this fiber mascara. I've used other fiber mascaras and this brand is high quality and works great.

It lubricates nicely, doesn't gunk up or leave a sticky residue. It cleans well and works nicely to repel dirt and moisture. He had some of his guns taken apart and showed me how nicely it cleaned.

"I've always had dry skin and sensitive skin, especially in the colder months. I get these patches of dry skin that will crack and bleed, even my clothing rubbing against my skin irritates it. My hubby also has severe dry skin caused by glue he uses at work, so we both need a more intensive, healing moisturizer. I was excited to try this Sweet Spot sensitive skin relief. I've tried their shampoo and conditioner and fell in love so I had high hopes for this product. Shipping was fast and I received a 2oz jar of Sweet Spot sensitive skin relief. I love this stuff. It's 100% natural, paraben and sulfate free. It contains manuka honey, organic aloe, cocoa butter, shea, coconut, olive oil, and blue green algae just to name a few. It's unscented which is great for those who are sensitive to fragrance. This moisturizer has a great consistency and absorbs really well and it's long lasting. I love how soothing it is. It's wonderful for even the most severe skin conditions because not only does it soften, it heals naturally due to its antiseptic properties. I feel instant relief when I use this on my dry skin and it's helped immensely. I highly recommend it. I will absolutely reorder and recommend to others.

"I've always been an artsy craftsy type person. When I was younger I was always drawing, sewing, and making stuff. But after I had my son and joined the work force I didn't have much time for it anymore. Besides the occasional project, hobbies took a back seat to life and my son isn't the artsy type. But now that he's older and graduated from school, soon to join the military, I've picked up some new and exciting hobbies. Now, I make my own skin care products, shampoos, soaps, lotion bars, even cleaning products, and home remedies. I've gotten on the all natural and organic band wagon. I was excited to get this 96 pack of chalkboard labels. I have used them before but these are a bit bigger and come in fun shapes. Shipping was fast and they're great quality labels. I'm able to use my big liquid chalk markers on these and put them on my larger containers for laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, fabric different, carpet freshener, you name it, I use these things all over. I have recently started organizing my closets and spare room, storing clothes and supplies in totes and I've found these very handy. Next I'm starting a project for the holidays. I'm making my friends and family gift bags with soaps, lotions, shave creams, etc..., and plan on using these as labels. I won't have to worry about using them all because I already labeled all my containers and I can just wipe off the label and write on it again if I need to change the contents.

"I'm a tea lover. I grew up drinking tea. My mother always had a variety of teas in the house and she taught me that there's a tea for everything. I love drinking hot and cold tea. Recently I got a couple bags of detox teas, one for energy and the other for sleep. They're loose leaf tea and before now I was using my french press or coffee filters. I was so excited to get this Teablee tea infuser and try it out. Shipping was fast and I received a very nice, simply designed tea infuser. It's perfect. It fits in my coffee mugs nicely and it's so easy to use. I just put some water on to heat, put my infuser in my empty cup, add 1 tsp of my loose leaf tea directly into the infuser then right before the water boils I pour it into my cup. I love it. Takes no time, much easier than dealing with filters. It comes with a handy lid too. I place the lid on the infuser and let it sit for 3-5 min. Then I pull out the infuser, dump the used tea and rinse it out. Simple. The filtration on this infuser is great. It's filled with tiny holes to allow your tea to infuse the water but not allow big pieces through. And you still get all your spices and flavor. I absolutely love this thing. I even take it to work with me. It's easy to clean too. You do have to watch the temperature, of course, when your pour or submerge hot water over something steel it will be hot to the touch. But it does cool down quickly. So besides common sense, this infuser is a no brainer. I highly recommend it. I believe it will last a long time.

"My son's friends are having their first baby and I've been getting little things here and there to help them get prepared. I was excited to get this 2 pack baby manicure set. I have a few friends that are expecting and figured these would make great gifts. Shipping was fast and I received a package of 2 Spartly baby nail clippers sets. Both sets contain a pair of safety scissors, baby nail clippers, and baby nail file with protective cover. And they work great. I know I was very nervous the first time I trimmed my son's finger and toe nails. I actually clipped a finger nail too short and made it bleed a little. Scared me to death. Baby's nails are so soft and very easy to trim too short or clip their skin. The nail trimmers and scissors in this kit are specially designed for baby manicures. They have safety guards and it makes the process quick and easy. I love this set. My boyfriend's cousin just had her second child and I gave her the other set. She says it's the best she's ever used and she used them as soon as I gave them to her. It's important to keep your baby's nails short because they can easily scratch themselves. I highly recommend this Spartly baby manicure set.

I have a dishwasher but prefer hand washing a lot of my dishes, especially some of my nicer pans. I use a brush to wash dishes, it's easy for glasses, water bottles, and not too abrasive on my pans. But I was excited to try these Peachy Clean silicone dish sponges. I like sponges but they tend to wear out quickly. Shipping was fast and I received a box of 3 silicone peachy clean dish sponges.

"I ordered a couple toddler pillows as a gift for my friend who's expecting. After ordering the first one, my hubby fell in love with it so I ordered another for him. I was excited to try this satin pillow case since we didn't have one that fit the pillow well. This pillow case fits 12"" and 13"" x 18"" pillows.

"I've always liked jewelry but I don't really wear it that often because I'm always cleaning or doing stuff with my hands that end up causing me to damage or lose nice rings.

"My hubby suffers from muscle and joint pain nearly every day. He has a very physically demanding job, works long hours on his feet, he is constantly moving and putting his body in awkward positions. Sometimes he wakes up with his hands and knuckles swollen, his wrists stiff, and his back aches in several places. Not to mention he has had leg pains and shin splits since childhood. He takes OTC pain relievers and even arthritis supplements but I thought he could benefit from this topical pain relief. Shipping was fast and I received a 3 oz jar of Activene pain relief. It contains natural ingredients such as trees tree oil, aloe, and proven ingredients to help arthritis, muscle, and joint pain like MSM, ilex, and menthol, just to name a few. I like how fast absorbing this cream is. And it's not greasy. It won't stain your clothes or cause them to stick to your skin. It absorbs quickly and penetrates deep into sore muscles and joints. It even helps with nerve and bone pain as well as inflammation. He uses this on his back, hands, wrists, knees, and his legs. We've tried other topical pain relief, I've even made some, and they do help to an extent but this cream is long lasting and it's not uncomfortable. It's not so warm or cold that it tenses you and it's not so strong of a smell either. The ingredients work quickly and really do help tremendously with all different kinds of body pain. I used this on my neck, shoulders, and forehead when I couldn't get rid of a tension headache and I felt relief in minutes. It really is a great formula and I highly recommend it.

"My hubby has a very physically demanding job where he sweats a lot and often gets dehydrated. He will have leg cramps and headaches too. I thought this Toniiq Electrolyte concentrate would be great for him instead of drinking sports drinks loaded with sugar and sodium. Shipping was fast and I received a 4 fl oz bottle of Toniiq premium hydration concentrate. Simply mix .6 tsp (3ml) of Toniiq with 32oz of water for premium hydration. It contains potassium, magnesium, low sodium sea mineral concentrate, and zinc sulfate to name a few. If you want a more concentrated shot of electrolytes and need to really replenish, mix 3ml of Toniiq with 8oz of water. It really works great. It does hydrate, replenish, and it helps prevent leg cramps. My hubby uses this every day and it's worked wonders. I make a large pitcher and keep it in the fridge for after working out, doing yoga, and jogging. I highly recommend it, especially if you sweat a lot.

"My parents collect drink glasses, they have for nearly 20 years now. My mom once worked as a manager at a liquor store where she aquired some unique, interesting, and beautiful glassware and collectibles. I really wanted to get them something to add to their collection and they don't have any copper moscow mule mugs so I was excited to get this mug. Shipping was fast and I received a beautifully crafted, pristine solid copper mug. I also received a recipe guide from the seller which is much appreciated. This mug is great. Not only is it gorgeous but it keeps your drinks ice cold. My parents absolutely love it and plan on ordering a few more. I highly recommend this mug for your alcoholic beverages. And you don't have to use it for alcoholic drinks only, sweet tea, coffee, anything you want tastes great and keeps temperature in this mug. It's a great size and has a nice sturdy handle. The mug can only be hand washed since it is copper.

"I am a huge advocate of aromatherapy and essential oils for various uses. Especially peppermint, it's very beneficial for many things and a healthier alternative to chemicals, not to mention it smells great. I was excited to try this peppermint oil by Art Naturals. Shipping was fast and I received a large, 4fl oz bottle of 100% pure peppermint essential oil in a beautiful amber glass bottle and glass dripper dispenser. I've used this peppermint for several things so far and I love it. I make my own tea tree oil all purpose cleaner using this peppermint to fragrance. It helps keep bugs and pests away as well as smelling great. I made antibacterial handsoap using this peppermint and I made an amazing mouthwash where this peppermint worked perfect. It's great, high quality, pure, and potent essential oil. It works great in my diffuser for aromatherapy. The scent is fantastic, calming, and I use to help relieve migraines. I would love to try their other essential oils. I use an anti aging serum by Art Naturals and I love it so I trust their products and ingredients.

"My hubby and I lead pretty active lifestyles. He has a physically demanding job where he's constantly moving and sweating. And I like to work out, walk, and jog. On weekends we enjoy the outdoors, go fishing, swimming, and hiking. We have a couple great yoga towels but also wanted something we could use as cool down towels so I was excited to get these Your Choice microfiber 12""x24"" quick dry towels. Shipping was fast and I received a pair of microfiber towels in gray and pink. They're very good quality, strong seams, and have a soft texture. They're all also super absorbent and quick drying. We use our towels for everything. My hubby uses his at work everyday to keep cool. He saturates it in ice cold water and lays it on the back of his neck, face, wrists, and chest. It's great for that because it's fast drying you can repeatedly cool yourself all day. I love using mine to dry my hair after a shower, it works much better than a regular towel. And we take them hiking with us. They have loops so you can hang them, I put mine on the cabinet knob in the bathroom. Washing them is easy too. I throw them in with my delicates and I don't use fabric softener because it can clog the fibers. Then I dry on delicate for a little bit then air dry. They come out good as new. I believe these towels will last us a long time. I've tried other chill towels and super absorbent towels but these work wonderful. I highly recommend this product. Ideal for athletes or really anyone.

"I love to swim and it's great exercise. I do prefer using goggles and I have never owned a truly good pair so I was excited to try these. I like veluxio's products a lot, they're always high quality and made of durable materials. Shipping was fast and I received a very nice pair of adult swim goggles with a case and ear plugs included. The case is pretty neat. You just twist the end and it opens. It's made of plastic and it's transparent. The goggles are very nice. They're made of high quality durable material with a comfortable and strong adjustable strap. The goggles have an air tight seal and do not allow water in, very nice. The lenses are clear and not too close to my eyes so they don't rub my lashes. They have good padding all the way around too. I highly recommend these swim goggles.

"I have long hair and it's always falling out. Every time I turn around I have stray hair on my clothes, in the shower it comes out like crazy, and I'm always cleaning out my hairbrush. But lately I've been losing hair my the handfuls. I don't know if it's stress or what, but I really want to strengthen my hair, grow more hair, and have more body. My hubby has thinning hair and a receding hairline. I thought we could both stand to benefit from this hair growth solution by Genetic Solutions. Shipping was fast and I received an 8 fl oz bottle of formula 500 hair regeneration system shampoo + conditioner. It smells really good. I started using it and noticed it wasn't too great for my color treated hair but I need to dye it again anyway so I continued using it. After using this shampoo for a couple of weeks I noticed not as much hair falling out. I take an oral biotin supplement as well so I'm sure that helps. But my hair does appear thicker and new hair is growing at the nap of my neck and hairline. My hubby says he's noticing hair growth too but hasn't noticed if he's still losing hair or not. I understand it takes time but the ingredients in this shampoo contain essential oils and plant extracts which prove to be a great combination. However, I do wish this shampoo was sulfate and paraben free. But my hair does feel soft and frizz free after using and it does seem to be healthier so all in all I believe it to be a great shampoo. I highly recommend it to those who do not color their hair. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I'm in my 30's and I smoked for over 15 years. I've since quit smoking but I have some premature aging, especially on my forehead, around my eyes and mouth. I've also noticed my jawline and neck are sagging a little. It doesn't help that I'm not getting near enough sleep. I do drink plenty of water and try to eat healthy but I could use a little anti aging help. I have a skin care regiment of all natural and organic products. I love vitamin C facial wash and scrubs, tea tree oil, lavendar, and rose water toner, vitamin C, retinol serums, you name it I use it. And I often rotate my products to see what works best. I know all of this is great for my skin and I'm improving the overall health of my skin. I do notice improvement and the elasticity of my skin is a lot better. But I was intrigued by this product. I've heard if similar products and I've heard mixed reviews on them but wanted to try for myself. Shipping was fast and I received 5 little tubes of premiere facelift by Ageless Instantly. Each tube lasts 2-3 days. You don't need to use much, just spread a thin layer over the area. This serum has a nice, soft consistent making it easy to apply. I use it under my eyes, on crow's feet, on forehead, and on my jawline. It takes a few minutes to dry and it's recommended to keep your face still so it absorbs properly. I watched the puffy bags under my eyes disappear the first time I used this. I couldn't believe it. The areas where I applied this cream were suddenly and dramatically lifted, tightened and smooth. I use my mineral makeup over this product and it looks amazing. Usually makeup causes my wrinkles and fine lines to be more noticeable and looks worse as the day goes by. But this cream lasts for up to 8 hrs. There's no flaking or residue, no redness or irritation. I'm impressed. The active ingredient is Argeline, it's an FDA approved product that is also an effective, healthier alternative to botox and cosmetic surgery. It gives instant results. So when you want to look your best, this is the stuff to use. It's a temporary facelift. It washes away easily with warm water and no scrubbing. I highly recommend this product to anyone if any age, men and women.

"I love drinking all kinds of tea and I was excited to try this Baetea Energy Detox tea. It contains all kinds of wonderful ingredients. I've never been a big fan of roobios tea but in combination with the other ingredients like honeybush, cinnamon, clove, and a ton of other stuff, I thought I'd give it a try. This tea gives you energy naturally, no artificial stimulants, all natural, clean energy and focus all day. You only need 1 teaspoon for a cup of tea. I drink 1 cup in the morning and another cup in the evening around 6pm when I'm starting to get tired. Shipping was fast and I received a 3.17 oz resealable bag of Baetea energy tea. It smells amazing. When I first made a cup I realized I should have filtered it some how. I would love if this tea were in trees bags. So I poured it through a coffee filter after I let it set for about 4 min or so. This tea is delicious. It has a really great earthy flavor to it. Now when I make it, I use my french press and it works great. A much better option than coffee, soda, or energy drinks. It works great. I feel energized and focused all day. No jittery feeling, no sweating or any other unpleasant effects. I highly recommend this tea. I would love to try their other teas after trying this one.

"I love Zhou Nutrition's supplements. Their products contain high quality and potent ingredients. I have never used a water retention supplement before but I've known of the benefits. Especially when trying to lose weight. I recently quit drinking soda and I've been trying to eat healthy, stopped junk foods and started exercising.

I experience bloating too so I thought this water away supplement would be beneficial. Shipping was fast, I received a large bottle of 60 capsules. These supplements are made in the USA, contain natural ingredients like dandelion and potassium. Since I've been taking these I've noticed a huge difference. My stomach isn't nearly as bloated, it looks like I've lost weight. I haven't noticed actual lbs come off but I know it takes time. But my rings and bracelets are feel more loose. My jeans aren't as tight and I've even had to tie my shoes tighter. This supplement combined with a healthy diet and exercise will help me get to my goal. I'm only wanting to lose 15-20 lbs.

"I am a huge advocate for all things healthy. Drinking plenty of water and eating fresh fruits and veggies is essential to a healthy life style. I make a fruit infused water every day for work. Using washable and reusable bottles is great for the environment, reduces waste and litter. I really wanted this bottle because my other bottles are kind of tall and don't really fit into my lunch box. I really like this bottle. It's BPA free, eco-friendly, and made of recyclable plastic. It's easy to use, has a great seal, and easy to wash. It fits perfectly into my lunch box too which I love. I like putting fresh strawberries and blueberries into the infuser, sometimes I add paprika, ginger, chia seeds, and some stevia to sweeten. I fill it with water and use my spherical ice molds to make big round ice that fits into my bottle and keeps my water cold all day. I also love using lemon, limes, oranges, really anything I can use. It's great for just water and health smoothies too. My hubby takes a protein shake to work every day and I will be reording one of these bottles for him. To use, you fill your infuser with desired fruits and veggies, fill your bottle with water, then the infuser screws into the seal, push the infuser and seal down into the bottle until it stops. It will make a great seal. Then you put on you lid. When you're ready to take it apart, there is a fold down pull tab on the seal/mouthpiece that is easy to grab with your fingers, just pull straight up to remove your entire infuser. And you don't have to pull it out to add more water. You just remove the lid and pour your water in. I highly recommend this bottle. It's great for a bike ride, taking to the gym, out hiking or even just sitting around the house. Whatever helps to reduce the waste of plastic bottles and helps you drink more water.

"I love using all natural and organic products. We are exposed to so many chemicals every day in everything we use and it's nice to have the option to choose a natural body sponge over the cheap loofahs you get at the store. I love  purSol's sponges. I've used their bamboo charcoal face sponge and loved it. It lasted forever so I was excited to try this body sponge. Shipping was really fast and I received an all natural, wavy konjac body sponge. It came with a suction cup too so you have something to hang it on. The sponge is sealed and it's completely dry and hard when you first receive it. After you saturate it in warm water it becomes very soft. It's completely amazing. I love this body sponge. It exfoliates well and it's gentle to use every day on any skin type. It's great size too. And when you're done using just rinse and press the sponge in your palms and hang so it goes back to being dry again. This sponge will stay soft no matter how often you use it and it will last for a long time, 2-3 months. To clean it, I boil water then let it sit for a couple minutes, place my sponge in the water for a few minutes and take it out to dry again. I highly recommend this sponge, the purSol products are some of the best I've used. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I love my all natural skin care products. I use vitamin C cleanser and serum every day. I made a tea tree oil toner and I've used Foxbrim's orange blossom water toner, which I love so I trust the brand. I was really excited to try this lavendar toner by Foxbrim, lavendar is very beneficial for your skin and it's one of my favorite essential oils. Shipping was fast and I received a 4oz bottle of lavendar toner spray mist with vitamin C, MSM, plant extracts, aloe, and neroli. I use this after I cleanse and exfoliate, then I follow with serum and moisturizer. I spray it directly on my face and chest then gently massage into my skin. This toner is very light weight, absorbs quickly and dries quickly. My skin immediately feels soft after using this. It instantly smooths out my fine lines and wrinkles and brightens my skin tone. After using this toner for 2 weeks I've seen a dramatic difference in my skin. It's more supple and hydrated and has a much more youthful apperance. I use mineral makeup concealer and it looks amazing. Makeup can dramatize blemishes but since using this toner my skin looks great. My pores are much smaller and even the puffiness around my eyes has decreased. I highly recommend this toner. I love how it makes my skin feel after I spray it on. It smells wonderful and after it dries it feels like powder.

"I love using essential oils for my DIY products, home remedies, household products, and aromatherapy. I was excited to get this Earth essential 100% pure therapeutic grade essential oil set by Healing Solutions. Shipping was fast and I received a beautiful set of 6 oils in wonderful earthy scents. I really love the mediation blend and the patchchouli. There's a nice variety in this set, frankincense, cypress, fir needle, pine, and the meditation blend and patchouli. These scents are perfect for the fall season and holidays. I've seen some bad reviews on these oils stating that they are not pure, however, they work great in my diffuser and I haven't noticed any residue inside it nor have I noticed it not wanting to work well. Any time I've ever used a low grade essential oil in my diffuser I have to clean it out so I try to use quality oils. A lot of people seem to really like this oil and I love it, I recommend trying it for yourself. Each bottle is 10ml and you only need a couple drops for a diffuser so it will last a long time. This essential oil set would make a great gift. My hubby even likes the earthy scents more than the orange, lemongrass, lavendar, and peppermint that I usually use. I highly recommend these oils.

Shipping was fast, really great and friendly seller. I received a nice universal mount, great quality materials, very durable. It's pretty awesome. You can mount it anywhere, and it will hold just about anything. I take it with me everywhere. I love using it to hold my vape mod in the car. And I use it on my desk to hold my phone. It's great for a bike or stroller, really anywhere you need to mount a device or even a drink. It can sit free standing too. It has 360 degree rotation so you can adjust it where you need it.

I was excited to get these splash bomb balls. We have a bunch of older children in our neighborhood and everyone loves to gather in our yard to play because it's the biggest. Shipping was fast and I received a pack of 12 splash balls in different colors and graphics. They're so much fun. All you need is a container of water to soak the balls in for a few seconds. Once they're saturated they are ready to go. You can seriously soak somebody with one throw. Kids and adults can play with these. They're great quality and when you're done just collect them, squeeze out any excesses water and let them dry. They don't take long to dry and you can use them over and over again. The kids love them. My first victim was our dog then my 17 yr old son. I like the sneak attack. Get them when they least expect it.

"My hubby has been wanting a good bath brush so I got a long handled and this short handle brush. He works with glue and wood every day and gets it all over him. He needs a little better exfoliation then a loofah. Shipping was fast and I received a very nice, great quality wooden bath brush with all natural bristles. The bristles are perfect, they're soft and also rough at the same time, but not too rough. I like that the head of this brush is curved a little. It's easy to get your back and legs and hard to reach spots. It also has a cloth loop to hang it. It lathers really well, you can use any wash on this brush, even bar soap. It rinses out thoroughly and dries pretty quickly too. I highly recommend this bath brush. Especially if you have a small stand-up shower, a long handle may not be the best option.

"My skin has been going through a lot of changes lately. I'm in my 30's and my life is pretty hectic. I've been trying to live a healthier lifestyle, drinking more water, getting more sleep, exercising, and aromatherapy. I have a bunch of skin care products and I follow a regiment every day. I love products with all natural and organic ingredients. I cleanse with vitamin C face wash, exfoliant, alcohol free toner, serum, and I use mineral makeup. I try to use a lightweight night cream too. My skin gets dry throughout the day. It's crazy. I've always had a great complexion but lately I'm having little breakouts, oily skin, and dark puffy circles around my eyes. Then it'll be dry. I love Foxbrim's products, I use their orange blossom water toner, and their serum. It's really helped with wrinkles, firmness, and brightening my skin. I was so excited to try this ocean minerals lotion. It's packed with minerals, microminerals, seaweed complex, and a ton of organic and natural ingredients. It's made in the USA in an FDA certified facility, and it's paraben free. Shipping was fast, I received a 3.4 fl oz bottle of ocean mineral lotion with hyaluronic acid, Irish moss, blue green algae and yarrow, just to name a few. This lotion has a very nice, creamy smooth, lightweight consistency. It absorbs beautifully without leaving an oily or sticky residue. My skin feels so smooth and supple after using this lotion. I apply it after my cleansing, exfoliating, toner and serum and I'm able to apply makeup after it absorbs and dries. I use it all over my face, on crow's feet, under eye, my neck, and my chest. I've been using it for over a week, nearly 2, I've noticed a dramatic difference in how hydrated my skin is. It's so soft, and it's great for wrinkles, it firms your skin, boosts collagen production, great for all skin types, and gentle for every day use. This lotion offers great protection against free radicals and radiation from harmful sun rays. I love this lotion. My hubby even uses it. He works with glue and wood every day. His face gets so dry and flacky, he's been applying it every day after his shower and it's made a big difference. No redness, dryness, or chaffing. I highly recommend this lotion.

I don't have any storage area. I was so excited to get this bag. Shipping was fast and I received a very nice, great quality bag. It's roughly 12"" high, 3.7 gallon storage, it's leak proof, has mesh pockets on side, secure velcro closure, velcro on the bottom to keep it sitting secure, an adjustable strap/handle with a plastic clasp, and it's leak proof. I use this bag for all kinds of stuff. I use it for trash and I use it for my drinks. It's like a cooler, the inside keeps my bottles cold and out of the way. I didn't want the bag up front in the passenger area like I'd always had my trash bags. I actually hooked it up around my console facing the back seat. It stays in place and it's easy to reach.

"Immaculate Blue is about nothing and yet about everything, particularly if you are gay and your ""wonder years"" were in the late 80's and early 90's. If you read Russell's The Salt Point from 1990, this book follows the same group of friends now twenty years later as their paths cross again in Poughkeepsie for a wedding. No worries if you haven't read The Salt Point though; you won't be lost.The story unfolds in three long chapters in which Russell weaves back and forth between the different characters' point of view. In the first chapter, Chris returns to Poughkeepsie to reunite with friends Anatole and Lydia for Anatole's wedding. Much of the story explores what has happened to each of the three friends over the last twenty years. Chris moved away while Anatole and Lydia stayed in Poughkeepsie. Chapter two is the wedding. Chapter three follows Chris after the wedding as he reconnects with another friend before leaving Poughkeepsie.If you aren't familiar with some of Russell's other work, like The Coming Storm or War Against the Animals, you might find yourself bored at first. Russell likes to explore the human condition and gives the reader a well-rounded look into each of his main characters, so the story tends to move at a slow pace with not a lot of drama happening on the page. You really feel like you know these people by the time you finish the book. Or you at least connect with the way they are feeling and where they are in life. Immaculate Blue is no different. while I haven't lived such an intense life as Chris, I still connected with how lost he felt.Having had a close group of friends during my glory days that I sadly abandoned when I moved away, I related very well to Chris's re-connection with his friends. We like to say that today we could pick up right where we left off, but there are always questions unanswered and things that we don't know about each other that have happened since then. The last chapter definitely explores those ""what if's"" that we fantasize about coming true.Having read The Salt Point many years ago when I was younger and at a different place in life, it was nice to catch up with these characters much like old friends and see how much we've all changed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XB7IMAL3AIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8MJLC#wasThisHelpful","R8XB7IMAL3AIG","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saw this one on Shark Tank and immediately wanted to give it a try. Mixed it with some vodka and seltzer and it was okay, but I love it with rum and lemon lime soda. It's not the typical vinegar taste you might be thinking of, the sort of vinegar you use for canning pickles or to clean your kitchen. It's very refreshing and I could even drink it just with lemon lime soda over ice and no spirits. It's also not a sweet flavor. It definitely has the tangy bitter of true vinegar.

"The new Flynn is a tiny dose but I wet myself a little when I saw her mention it on her Facebook page.  I immediately downloaded it and finished it in one day! Like her other books, all of which I've read and loved, we have a strong female character that you find yourself hating at times and liking at others.She's a white trash gal who left home early and found work giving hand jobs in the back room of a fortune tellerâs business. She eventually moves up front to read auras and soon finds her first client is in need of a house cleansing. What follows is a roller coaster ride of plot twists and turns that has kept Flynn on the bestsellerâs lists since day one.My only qualm about the story is the fact that itâs a short one.  I wanted more and was well prepared to stay up late on this joy ride.  If you havenât read Gillian Flynn before, this is a good taste and a good place to start.

"There's always an intriguing story and interesting characters to look forward to when reading something new from Gabriella West. Her latest, Elsie Street, is no different. In it we meet Dave, a young Bostonian who is now enjoying California with his girlfriend Janine.But when Dave loses his bar tending job, his entire world changes. Dave meets a young man named Aaron and his sexual identity is reawakened, stemming from a brief affair he had with his college roommate long ago. What follows is the tensions that sexuality often causes when we are young and figuring out our place in this world, often riddled with guilt while figuring out what our true heart desires.West embraces location. You'll find yourself loving San Francisco just as much as her characters and wanting to visit there if you haven't already. This being an M/M romance, she also writes romantic scenes quite beautifully and leaves just enough of the detail's up to the reader's imagination.Most of the conflict plays out within her characters, especially as Dave questions his happiness with Janine and longs to be with Aaron. Ultimately, she pushes her story forward by giving her characters what they want, and what the reader wants them to have, often avoiding those real-life consequences that we face.And that's the beauty of a great story. We can separate ourselves from woes of the real world and just get lost in the world the author has given us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BQIEVFPG4WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EBO5R6#wasThisHelpful","R5BQIEVFPG4WI","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spiralizers are becoming very popular now that people are seeking new ways to make healthy and fun meals at home. It's perfect for turning vegetables like zucchini, yellow squash, cucumbers, and carrots into long spirals that resemble pasta. They cook quicker than pasta too!  Add sauce or pesto and you've got a healthy dinner in under 15 minutes.  Instead of a pasta meal, you can also turn your vegetables into a fun salad with vinegar or dressing.

"During business trips I take each year, I have previously carried a backpack that holds a laptop. The long security lines at the airport make the backpack a pain for my shoulder so I decided to switch to a rolling back this year. I searched stores and couldn't find them anywhere except at Office Max. There, they didn't have the size I wanted and I felt they were a bit overpriced. But I copied down a particular name brand I liked and came home to search for the size I wanted and found it on Amazon at a cheaper price too.  I'll never switch back to a backpack again!It has 4 zippered compartments: one main one for the laptop with another pocket, another for folders, another with lots of little pockets for wallets or business cards and other items, and then a small pocket in the front that I use for receipts. The retractable handle also has a zippered compartment to conceal it away and the handles that you can use for carrying the case are very sturdy.

"I picked up this spiral slicer after reading Amelia Freer's book, ""Eat. Nourish. Glow.""  In it, she suggests replacing your pasta with vegetable noodles that you make using a spiral slicer. The slicer is definitely easy to use.  It works better on softer vegetables like yellow squash, zucchini, and cucumbers. I couldn't get carrots to go through it long enough to make a decent noodle. And quickly discovered carrots stain the plastic and make it a bit hard to clean. Speaking of cleaning, bits of veggies get stuck in the teeth which are a pain to pick out but this slicer is dishwasher safe on the top rack. This slicer comes with a simple instruction guide that includes some easy recipes as well. I'll definitely continue to use mine and would suggest it to friends who enjoy pasta or veggies and want to try something new.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SCMY5VXR529/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIVRB3W#wasThisHelpful","R30SCMY5VXR529","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should point out that I don't normally read self-help or dieting books. About the only non-fiction stuff I read is memoirs. As far as nutrition goes, I do love the occasional cook book from time to time but never use or read them cover to cover.Amelia Freer's book is not a cook book or dieting book, but I would call it a bit of a self-help book. And I read it cover to cover in just under a week! That being said, it's not one of those books that is going to beat you up for what you do or do not do.

I've been a crash dieter, starving myself and counting calories. I've been a binge eater, gorging on sugary foods that I knew weren't good for me.  I've been an addictive snacker, unable to put the chips or candies down until they were gone.Amelia doesn't beat you up for being any of these types of eaters. She does point out the medical issues you could face, but also offers advice on how to change those unhealthy food habits.  First, she tells you to convince yourself you are not on a diet. You can eat anything you want (in moderation). But you should change what you eat, how much, and how often.Now, due to her own health issues, Amelia does not eat any processed foods, sugar, gluten, or dairy. She is a very organic eater and relies on fresh ingredients. Throughout the book, she reminds you that you do not have to give up gluten or dairy if your system is okay with it, and my system is actually okay with dairy and I enjoy it in moderation.She also discusses another battle of mine which is time. Like many, I work all day and come home and don't want to cook. I want something fast and easy. And it usually leaves me feeling sick or bloated and even more tired. And unfortunately, a quick meal like this is usually full of sugar and unhealthy cancer-causing preservatives also responsible for obesity and other problems. But Amelia encourages you to identify your problems, like time, and address them slowly.  You don't have to change your entire life all at once. That can be overwhelming. But small changes over time can make a big difference. Amelia has convinced me to try!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEGDS24LCHX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKWWFAU#wasThisHelpful","R3KEGDS24LCHX9","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider myself a student and fan of Emily Dickinson.  I first discovered her when I was in college and only recently wrote a book about her myself. So, once I came across Amherst by William Nicholson I immediately wanted to read it. Nicholson focuses primarily on the affair that Emily's brother had with Mabel Todd, a friend of the family.  He parallels this love affair with a present story about a woman named Alice who goes to Amherst with intentions to write a screenplay about the Dickinson affair while having an affair of her own with a local teacher named Nick.Since I was very familiar with Austin and Mabel's story, I was anxious to see how Nicholson would treat it or add his own flare. There is one scene in the book where Mabel comes to the Dickinson home to play the piano while the reclusive Emily listens from the hall (Mabel and Emily never met face to face.).  I had included this scene in my book as well so it was fun to read Nicholson's interpretation.The present story of Alice and Nick helps to move the story forward as Alice reads over Mabel's diary and Emily's poems and we see her conflicted on how to portray Mabel in her screenplay. Emily is also handled well in the story and there are some brief chapters from her told in first person.  I love the way Nicholson eventually pays homage to Mabel in the end, despite the affair, for she is the one who edited Emily's poems and was ultimately responsible for getting her work published. Nicholson points to Polly Longsworth's book ""Austin and Mabel"" for his inspiration. Though I have not read it, I will soon because I was intrigued by how Mabel's own husband seemed to approve of their affair and may have participated.There's a bizarre twist revealed in the end with Nick that I did not see coming and I must admit it was a pleasant one. I really feared we were going to be left with the predictable ending between Alice and Nick, but it takes a turn that I did not see coming. Nicholson researched his real-life characters very well and his respect for them shows.  He even references several of Emily's poems throughout. The story of the American family who gave us Emily Dickinson is a bizarre one indeed, and I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholson's interpretation of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPJNKW0VXFYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476740402#wasThisHelpful","R2BPJNKW0VXFYW","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hope that the marketing ""genius"" at Axe makes a lot of money, and I'm sure they do.  I still have to laugh at whoever comes up with these names, and what's worse is the lab rat who came up with the scent!Slap a peace sign on the label of anything these days and we're sure to appeal to the ""old"" generation or the rebellious one.  And believe me, this smells old.  It's an okay scent, but not at all pleasant.  Doesn't leave you smelling fresh smelling at all once you step out. It might as well be non-scented. It's like some sort of man candle you'd find at Yankee.  Or motor oil if it smelled good. I definitely wouldn't buy it again based on scent alone.What's worse is the back label pomotes that by using this product you might ""get some.""  The label says something like, ""The cleaner you are, the dirtier you get,"" complete with graphics of a nude man in silhouette showering and then talking to a ahem...lady...and is it just me or is the man still nude? Seriously, Axe folks?  What a joke!  What does that have to do with peace?  If anything, you should have spelled it ""piece.""  It even says UNLIMITED FEMALE ATTENTION underneath the graphics on the back. Again, what does that have to do with peace?  I know it's all a gimmick to promote the product to strapping young men full of hormones (unless they are gay), but if they all smelled like this, they are in trouble.Save your money.  There's better smelling stuff on the market.  Even Axe has made better products than this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHB58SJG6P2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTC1JHQ#wasThisHelpful","RSHB58SJG6P2A","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up Love Letters after receiving a marketing email about it from Goodreads.  In the email, Stephen Chbosky, author of Perks of Being a Wallflower, sings its praises.  I lover Perks and after reading about Love Letters, I decided to give it a try. I learned in the Acknowledgements that Chbosky and the author are acquaintances and it is very easy to see how Ava Dellaira was inspired by Perks to write Love Letters.  They are actually a bit too similar if you want to go there.Love Letters to the Dead is a collection of letters that a young girl named Laurel writes to famous dead people: Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, E.E. Cummings, Amy Winehouse, Amelia Earhart, River Phoenix, and more.  She particularly favors Kurt. Through the letters, we experience Laurel's teenage life - making friends, going to parties, skipping class, dating boys, etc. But Laurel is also dealing with something much greater. Layer by layer, we learn what happened to Laurel as she spills it in the letters and overall ends up facing her demons.Now, notice I did rate it four stars and I read it cover-to-cover and thoroughly enjoyed it. But again, the praise from Chbosky stuck out in my head as it probably has for many other readers.  In Perks, we also have a lead character who is writing letters to someone and slowing spilling his story about something bad that happened to him, he's in high school, making friends, connecting with girls, and throughout the book there is a huge connection to popular genre music, just like there is in Letters.Despite these obvious similarities, I still enjoyed Love Letters.  I wouldn't say it's better than Perks, by all means. Once you experience something so great the first time, a copy cat just won't do, right?  Read it for yourself and decide.  I'd still recommend it to anyone who liked Perks or anyone else who I think might enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ZF8RBSRW3XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCR3M2O#wasThisHelpful","R29ZF8RBSRW3XP","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've known about Peter Straub since my Stephen King days in high school, though I never read ""Talisman"" which he cowrote with King. When a recent bookstore was going out of business, I snatched up most of Straub's work in paperback and finally decided to give him a try. I started with Lost Boy Lost Girl.I thought this was a decent read and it reminded me a lot of King's writing, where we are given a horrific story line but the author chooses to avoid the graphic scenarios and instead dwells inside the minds of all his characters, which is often a much more dangerous place to be. Here, we have a serial killer, a suicide, a missing child, and a ghost girl, but Straub doesn't spoon feed you the details of any of these conflicts. Instead, he flushes them out as his here and now characters must explore the situations and find the facts as to what is really going on.That being said, sometimes this doesn't work. Sometimes you much prefer the details over the fodder. But Straub somehow makes it work. I didn't find myself bored or skimming through conversations between characters.  I was invested in the story just as he hoped I would be.Timothy Underhill, the lead character in the book, is Straub's alter ego and apparently makes appearances in some of Straub's other writings. He's a likable character here which made me turn to Google to research him, and also made me eager to immediately pick up another one of Straub's books.  This is a great ""different"" type of horror book which I certainly appreciate.  I can't believe I haven't read Straub until now, but I will certainly again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNYFJODPB7XJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBJAJG#wasThisHelpful","RNYFJODPB7XJM","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a huge Emily Dickinson enthusiast, I was so pleased to receive The Gorgeous Nothings for Christmas without even having to ask for it. I was familiar with Dickinson's envelope poems after researching her extensively for a historical fiction book I wrote about her in 2012 which was published last year. Imagine my surprise when I discovered this coffee table book of her envelope poems was about to be published!  I was so tempted to order it for myself, but in the end I didn't have to!Since receiving it for Christmas, I've picked it up several times and just thumbed through it, picking a poem at random to read and think about. I finally made myself sit down and read the book in its entirety. Emily was bizarre enough as we know, but seeing her own handwriting on scraps of paper just adds to the admiration I have for her.I love how she even wrote on both sides of some pieces - one side is featured in the book on one page, and when you turn the page you find the opposite side lined up perfectly.  And the images are so real.  I found myself rubbing my fingers across them, wishing I could pick them up. No joke!  They look that real!  Don't worry about not being able to decipher her handwriting - there is an illustrated/typed graphic on the opposite page in the same shape as the envelope so that you can read it with ease.What's more important is that these pieces are preserved and everyone can enjoy them in this collection.  After reading it, I wanted to sit down and hand write a letter to someone.  Forget email. Forget Facebook. Computers have given us such ease and speed when it comes to communication, and while I'm guilty of taking advantage of that just as much as anyone else, I wish it wasn't so. I miss handwritten letters. I miss journal writing. I still get an occasional Christmas or birthday card from relatives, but with nothing more than a quick I love you and signature. Perhaps I'll find something to write my own thoughts on, like Emily, and not care what anyone thinks or who sees. And maybe one day, you'll be reading and reviewing it here.Yeah, I know, wishful thinking, right?  It's nothing. Or is it?  Who cares? For now, enjoy Emily's words in their originality.  This is a volume of hers I know I will cherish and pick up again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17H0MZ3YKL6UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081122175X#wasThisHelpful","R17H0MZ3YKL6UD","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Miri receives a strange cat amulet from her dying grandmother, her past and present converge and her life is forever changed. Young Miri discovers she is a shape shifter who can turn into a cat. Abandoned by her snooty Aunt and Uncle at a boarding school, Miri is soon led to join a secret underground society in Forest Park in St. Louis. There, she makes new friends like herself who are also shape shifters and learns to tape into her inner feline.But where there are shape shifters and mysterious pasts, there is always conflict. Allistair, a sinister werewolf, is forming a pack to track down Miri while making plans to steal her amulet and take down the secret society. A plethora of questions are soon raised as the intensity builds: Where is Miri's mother? Why does Allistair want Miri's amulet? Are their young wolves in the society who are actually on Allistair's side? And who is Miri's father?Kupfer introduces a whole world of both good and bad characters, each with their own story lines that revolve around Miri. She does a fantastic job of characterization, building each personality and explaining their powers. There's even a gentle love story. But more importantly for me was the historical aspect of the story.I had the pleasure of hearing, in person, Mrs. Kupfer read the first chapter of her book before it was published. I was immediately drawn into the story due to its Nazi Germany setting in the introduction. And hearing the author read it, it's easy to see the passion she put into the book. I heard her voice in my head as I read the book which made it even more lively.Being an animal lover, and living in St. Louis made the book even more enjoyable.  It's always fun to read a story that takes place in locales that you are familiar with.  Here we have Forest Park, the Jewel Box, the St. Louis Zoo, and Turtle Park, all places I know well and have visited so I always knew where the action was taking place.I could have used a bit more resolution in the end, but it is my understanding there is a sequel to come. I have no doubt Kupfer will pick up where she left off, my questions will be answered, and there will be more adventures waiting for Miri and her friends. I highly recommend this book to the young fantasy readers, Harry Potter enthusiasts, animal lovers, or other St. Louisians. It's a book to be enjoyed by all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBI0FTJ30QDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNJP4UG#wasThisHelpful","R2PBI0FTJ30QDA","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always fun to get a new toothbrush, even when you are an adult. It's one of those things we don't part with as much as we probably should because we like the one we have and they are so pricey sometimes. Sure, they wear out but we keep using the same old one.  And then we finally break down and buy a new one and find we are glad we did!  It's like trying out a new cologne or shower gel. It's the little things that make us happy.And the Colgate Max White Full Head Toothbrush made me happy when I first tried it!  My previous toothbrush had a clunkier handle and was a bit wider around the top. I like the Colgate Max mainly because it is much thinner just below the head of the bristles.  It makes a huge difference when moving it back and forth in your mouth, and getting between your teeth and mouth.In the end, yeah, it's just another toothbrush. Not something for which we find ourselves tied to a certain style or brand, but I'd buy this one again and suggest it to others.

It's the same format - quick chapters with full page black and white photos, quotes from famous folks that you will be pinning to your studio walls,lots of his newspaper blackout phrases, and the same simple noteworthy advice that Kleon is so good at!Building off of his first book, Kleon encourages the artist, writer, or anyone creative to dig a bit deeper to reach their audience. He teaches you how to introduce yourself at a party, how not to be human spam, to tell good stories, to share something small everyday, to build a mailing list. But then there are good life lessons like stepping away from what you are doing, or starting over, teach what you know, think process not product, and so much more.If you are looking for a step-by-step how-to guide to getting rich and famous at novel writing or art selling, this isn't it.  But if you want a fun cheerleader-type book chocked full of good advice that's to the point and easy to follow, Kleon is your man.  This book would make a great gift for the artist in your life, if you aren't one yourself.But as an artist or writer, you have to follow through!  Follow him on Twitter, do the little things he suggests, scratch each others' backs, and show your work!  It really works - removing the stress from your creativity and helping you to step back and see the bigger picture! I always feel energized and ready to dive in after reading his books.And I will definitely be buying extra copies to share with my artist friends, and am already anxiously waiting for the next one!

Their livelihood is completely ruined. Spouses pack up and leave. Children disown their parents. They lose their jobs.But unlike typical apocalyptic stories where we are trying to figure out what happened or we are trying to survive, Hunt's characters accept their fate and OPS becomes a slice-of-life story about a bunch of clowns. Yep, it's pretty disturbing.So what is a surplus of clowns supposed to do to make a living? They become public custodians. Yep, they get to clean up other people's...ahem...just as the title suggests. Let's face it. ""It's"" funny!And Hunt does not hold back. She paints a (brown) picture of a bunch of clowns cleaning up a public toilet. Dirty humor abounds! But the author doesn't stop there with just toilet humor... Clown bars. Drag queens. Toy vomit. Cyclists lit up like Christmas trees. Even Fred Savage. Yep, that Fred Savage.I got completely wrapped up in the ""silly"" story line and kept reading because I wanted to see where this was going. As I said, Hunt doesn't disappoint. Yeah, OPS is somewhat dark and dirty, but you have to respect a book about a clown epidemic that isn't only disturbing, but says a lot about the way we treat people in general based on who they are or what they do.At some point in our life, we all have to clean up other people's...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7S907V4GIIT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUC4TB8#wasThisHelpful","R7S907V4GIIT5","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unless they are on sale or you have a coupon, their price is unattractive when there's other cheaper stuff on the market.  But you definitely get what you pay for.First, let's talk about the scent.

It makes it feel new or unique every time.Living in the Midwest and being a dude, I'm quick to use my usual body gel for my face and I pay for it in the winter.

"Besides watching The Walking Dead, I tend to avoid all of the  ""end of the world"" hype on TV and in literature these days. Most of this was brought about by the failed predictions of the world ending in 2012, right?  And here we are, but the craze goes on. For me, what even makes The Walking Dead enjoyable is that it's not about the zombies; it's about the people.  The zombies are just a gory distraction that keeps things interesting, but the strong characterization and story lines are much more important.  We don't even know what caused the zombie outbreak, which also keeps things interesting.  And I have to say the same goes for Josh Malerman's first novel, Bird Box.Wow!  I was intrigued right from the start.  The questions I wanted answered quickly piled up and the pages kept turning!  We meet Malorie and her two children, only known as Boy and Girl, who are preparing to leave their house and go to a better place in a world that has suffered some kind of apocalyptic end. Malerman feeds us bits and pieces of the story, but leaves us as blind as his characters when it comes to knowing what has really happened.  And I mean ""blind"" quite literally. This outbreak is caused by ""seeing something"" outside, possibly a creature of some kind, that causes you to go insane and do harm to yourself and others just by looking at it.Imagine having to put on a blindfold and leave your house to go to the grocery store, or to work, or just to the neighbor's house.  Could you do it?  And you can't peek or you might see something that could kill you. Imagine never getting to look outside again.  Imagine children born in this world and not getting to play outside, or see a tree, or see an animal even. Malerman challenges his characters and builds an exciting story line simply by removing sight. And it works!  Remember every scene in an old horror movie where the girl is feeling around in the dark and we know the killer is right there beside her?  Or that scene at the end of Silence of the Lambs where Agent Starling is in the dark and Bill is watching her through his night vision goggles?  This is it, only just like the characters, the reader doesn't know what is out there either!The story is divided into two parts that are four years apart.  We have Malorie and her four year old children, who she has trained to be good listeners, having to traverse a river in a boat (while blindfolded!) to get to a safe haven. Back up four years when Malorie is pregnant and the outbreak has just started, and we follow her trying to get to a house where others have gathered for safety. Much of the book takes place in this house where Malorie interacts with a group of survivors and various everyday story lines and conflicts play out as they try to gather food and resources and make contact with others. The two story lines converge with a maddening climax at the time Malorie is giving birth!The writing is solid and believable.  While some questions are still left unanswered in the end, I was okay with that and felt the book and a satisfactory conclusion at least, and there's definitely room for a sequel. The title of the book becomes a metaphor for the situation the world is in, and Malerman gives the reader a lot to think about and digest. Like I said, I've avoided apocalyptic books for a long time, but this one intrigued me and I'm so glad I read it. I'll definitely be looking for more from this new author, and keeping my ""eyes"" crossed for a sequel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPF7DKW7N6CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062259652#wasThisHelpful","RUPF7DKW7N6CK","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having read all of the Tales series, I was very excited to dive into what is to be the last book in the series, which as the title suggests,  catches us up on the beloved Anna Madrigal. We find Anna in her 90s, aging gracefully and still with all her wit and charm. Her storyline shines here through flashbacks to when she was ""Andy"" and living at the Blue Moon, a whorehouse run by his mother. We see Andy's interest in a local town boy named Lasko, and a horrible misunderstanding that Anna regrets later in life and wishes to apologize for.It's a wonderful plot line that at least keeps the book a bit interesting because the rest of the storylines are sadly not interesting at all. There's Jake, Anna's caretaker, and his boyfriend Amos. Jake is also a transexual. They want to pay homage to Anna with a giant bike at the Burning Man festival. There's Brian and Wren, who take Anna home to make amends. There's Shawna, who wants to get pregnant through insemination at the festival. And of course, there's Michael and his Beau who are off to Burning Man too. Mary Ann even pops up and makes a brief and boring appearance at the festival.One would hope that all of our favorite characters would celebrate their lives together at the festival for what could have been a wonderful reunion. Sadly, most of them don't even cross paths. While the attention is put back on Anna in the end as it should be, I still had hoped she would have at least had a last scene with Michael. Instead, it's as if Maupin forgot about them and never got around to writing that scene, or didn't know how to.There's just no drive to the story lines that keep them interesting or even suspenseful other than Anna's, which means you could skip about every two chapters and still come away satisfied knowing what happens to her. Maupin also uses crutches like Facebook, Twitter, and Craigslist sprinkled throughout to put the reader and his characters into a certain present day time. Though humorous, they stuck out like obvious cliches that everyone uses time and time again.  I've seen Maupin's pics on FB of him attending Burning Man, so it's easy to see where he drew his inspiration for that setting, but even it wasn't as interesting as it could have been.Eh, it's an okay book. I am not mad at having read it and would suggest any other Tales fan to go ahead and read it too.  It's just not the ending to the series I think most of us wanted.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKSHUQK3N9GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062196243#wasThisHelpful","R2CKSHUQK3N9GS","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Boyle is back again this year with another Christmas album that at first will probably sound like her previous Christmas album, The Gift, to you. When I first listened to it, nothing stood out to me other than the duets with Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis which are both splendid! Surprisingly, there's only one song that shows up on both albums.And that's my biggest (and only) complaint, not just with this album, but with any ""classic"" Christmas album like it. I want to be blown away with an original Christmas song that I know I'll be hearing each and every year on the radio at this time of year. (Remember Mariah Carey's Christmas album?) While I appreciate the classics, I'd love for someone to write an original song just for Susan.Like so many others, I have followed Susan's path to fame since day one and I love a good story like hers where we are quick to judge someone by looks and they completely prove us wrong!  To me, she completely deserves all the fame and fortune.  I will continue to buy her albums, original or not, as long as she continues to record. And yeah, I'm happy to add this one to my classic collection and will pull it out again next year and enjoy it just the same.

"Kim Fu's short novella, For Today I Am Boy, explores one Chinese boy's struggle with gender and his place in society.  Peter is the only son of a Chinese family living in Canada, though he wishes he was a girl. Fu has a talent for painting interesting pictures  and scenes with very few words and I was immediately drawn into Peter's story and wanted to know more.We see Peter in the shadow of his domineering father, or as a young boy amongst his other male school mates. When he becomes a young man, we are with him at his first job as he faces a very sincere but tough boss in a restaurant kitchen, and later as he moves away from home to be on his own, keeping very little contact with anyone other than his sisters as he forms intimate relationships with the opposite sex while exploring his own identity.Fu gives colorful detail into her canvas of secondary characters, making them almost more interesting than Peter. There is a strange neighbor who shares a secret with Peter's dad.  There is Ollie, Peter's classmate who takes Peter to the gym- we get to see a very heartfelt scene between them when Ollie questions Peter's sexuality at school! Or Peter's boss, Chef, who proudly had sex with a transgendered man once!  And Margie, Peter's older sadist lover who treats Peter like a toy. And then there are Peter's sisters, who all accept and protect Peter for who he is early on while they live at home.The book is only ten chapters long at 289 pages and sadly, it is a bit disjointed.  Each chapter reads like a wonderful piece of memoir, but there are holes in between and parts of Peter's story that go unexplored until the very end. I found myself more interested in learning about the other people in Peter's lives, or what his sisters were doing, because Peter's story wasn't revealing what I really wanted to know. My heart went out to his mother in one late chapter where she is facing prejudice at the border for trying to come into the U.S. to visit her daughter, though she'd lived in Canada for 40 years. Scenes like this gave the book so much depth!Notice I'm still giving the book a 4 star rating though. It captivated me, and though it wasn't a very satisfying read when it came to Peter, it was enough to keep me reading.  This might be a respectful book to give to someone young who might be facing a sexual identity crisis of their own. I certainly appreciated it for a look into a Chinese family's life, ruled by a traditional father, but with children eager to explore what's out there for them in today's world. It made me think about prejudice in this world, racial or sexual, and any book that makes me think is worth my time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6D2OO1FG2XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544034724#wasThisHelpful","R1X6D2OO1FG2XP","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a Capote fan since high school, have read almost all of his work (including In Cold Blood), and have seen both recent films based on his time spent in Kansas (Capote in 2005 and Infamous in 2006).  While researching a project of my own, I decided it was time to read Ralph F. Voss's book also devoted to Capote and his time spent in Kansas.While it is a well researched book (30% of the text is Voss's notes and bibliography), there is nothing new here for readers like me who are already well versed in the topic of Capote's real-time research of the Clutter murders, the capture and trial of the killers, their execution, all culminating with the publication of In Cold Blood.I would highly recommend this book to a new person who has just become interested in the topic, perhaps someone who has just finished reading In Cold Blood, but has not seen any of the movies or read anything else; someone who is intrigued and now wants to dive a bit deeper into it. If that's you, then this book is a gold mine.For the others out there like me who are a bit more familiar with all of it, you might find yourself bored. Voss's style of writing reads more like an essay or public speech: ""In the next chapter, I will argue this"" or ""As I stated in chapter 6â³ and""I will now discuss this.""  You are constantly reminded of the author's presence and opinion, which gave the book a rough edge for me.Another problem is that after Voss pinpoints his lead sources of inspiration (movies and books), he spends quite a bit of time just regurgitating their plot lines and discussing their elements like a book reviewer or movie critic would. Obviously, he discusses In Cold Blood in detail, along with its 1960s movie, the 1990s television remake, the film Capote of 2005, Infamous of 2006, Gerald Clarke's Capote biography, George Plimpton's book on Capote; and for some odd reason Kim Powers' fictional book Capote in Kansas of 2008, and even the comic book version of 2006 - spelling out every detail of how they are different and giving his opinion of how they relate to the real life facts, even though the latter two are complete fiction!  Again, this made for quite a tedious read, filling up pages with information that interested readers might want to find out on their own, if they haven't already.Am I glad I read this book?  Yes.  There are several pictures sprinkled throughout the text, some taken by Voss in Kansas which I had not seen before. And, being a diehard Capote fan, I always appreciate hearing someone else's thoughts on Capote and his ""infamous"" work. Is there anything new here for fans like me? Not really, but you might want to take a stab at it anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABZC7SBTRDK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MKPB42#wasThisHelpful","R3ABZC7SBTRDK7","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not much of a biography reader but having grown up watching Sesame Street and The Muppets back when we only had 3 or 4 channels on a bunny-earred TV (and PBS was fortunately one of them), I have always had a soft spot in my heart for Henson's work. So I knew I wanted to read this bio!Due out this year on what would be his 77th birthday, this book is definitely for the serious bio reader. There are not a ton of pictures (an insert and a picture at the beginning of each chapter), but you do get a well-rounded, well-researched look at who this man was.  The author had complete cooperation from Henson's family and friends, and had access to many of his personal effects and papers.The book starts with how Henson's parents met and settled in Mississippi, tracing Henson's creativity back to a relative in the Civil War, and shows how Henson was raised a kind and patient man with Christian Scientist roots. There was always laughter in their house. His parents were hard workers too so it's easy to see where Henson got his determination. You also learn where he got his creativity from - he was a very imaginative child and was encouraged by his grandmother.This book is pretty much a linear timeline of Henson's life, which chapters devoted to Sesame Street, Sam and Friends, The Muppet Show, each Muppet movie, The Dark Crystal, etc. It definitely takes patience to read it. But there are some real gems sprinkled throughout the text. In the first chapter, we learn The Wizard of Oz was his favorite movie (it came out when he was just three), but he was more afraid of the MGM lion roaring at the start of the movie. We also get behind-the-scene glimpses of the Muppets and Sesame Street that are noteworthy, like reading how all the sets were elevated six feet off the ground so the puppeteers could stand up while operating the Muppets. Or how the director would yell ""Blue Sky!"" when a child came on the set to alert adults to watch their language (though Henson hardly ever said a cuss word). We learn how Kermit was born and got his name. Or that the Muppets partly got their name from a TV listing that was badly copy-edited. I loved the personal glimpse into his early professional relationship with Jane when they were doing ""Sam and Friends.""I especially liked the chapter about how young Jim loved TV and just wanted to work in television back in the early 1950s.  He was more interested in being artistic and working on set design or publicity.  He excelled in college in theater doing set design and doing publicity artwork. He learned puppetry by checking two books out at the library in order to audition for a TV show looking to hire a puppeteer, and of course the rest is history though Jim kept trying to get out of puppets and into show design.And of course, there's a personal glimpse into Henson's life. We learn about the creation of our beloved Muppet characters. We find out Henson loved women, and loved to collect art and fast cars. You'll learn about his early work with the Muppets on SNL and how he strived to get his characters their own show, and obviously succeeded.  And then of course there's quite a bit about the eventual sale of the franchise to Disney and also Henson's untimely death which happened on the day the sale was to be final. The man really was a creative genius who worked very hard for his small company, and in the end, that's all he wanted to do was be creative, be an artist.Henson is very much the man I expected he was. My one problem with reading bios is whether or not I trust the author, and I must say I completely have faith in Brian Jay Jones' work here.  It is well written, entertaining, and thorough. I also love a book that has me researching things on my own - I went to YouTube numerous times to watch old Muppet segments that are mentioned in the book and even bought the first Muppet movie on BluRay. For those expecting more pictures or more concise background information related to the Muppet characters themselves, there are other better books on the market. For those who want to get to know the man behind them, this bio is for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34A6U86CRIK35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345526112#wasThisHelpful","R34A6U86CRIK35","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love blackberry anything and love blackberry sage tea even more. I've been drinking Republic for at least thirteen years now, first introduced to it when we sold it and served it in a bookstore where I worked. Republic of Tea is the best brand by far, and worth the price. Yes, it is a bit higher than some basic teas on the market but you get what you pay for. I enjoy it hot or cold.One single bag will do for a single cup to sip. If you are going to make a larger batch of cold tea, I suggest boiling about 5 bags together in a few cups of water, or add them to a gallon to sit out for sun tea. I enjoy it with sugar or honey.I love keeping the tin afterwords to store buttons or coins in. My favorites are Ginger Peach, Mango Ceylon, and of course, the Blackberry Sage. I can honestly say I don't care for anything else that is mango flavored other than Republic. And their Blackberry is one of the best!If you are new to tea or a loyal tea sipper, I highly recommend Republic of Tea if you haven't tried it already. I have never been dissatisfied by any of their products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EP1Z4ROVSQD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OI7UY8#wasThisHelpful","R1EP1Z4ROVSQD7","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never knew Stephenie Meyer wrote anything besides Twilight until I saw a coworker reading The Host one day. She told me it was Meyer's attempt at writing something for a more mature audience. I knew I wasn't going to read it, but I did want to see the movie when it hit DVD.The concept is that aliens have taken over most of earth. They are a peaceful race and humans serve as hosts for the alien souls. The conflict arises from a group of humans who live in hiding who are confronted by one of their own who was recently captured, all while the alien seekers are trying to find them. Could an alien switch sides?  Is it possible for the human soul to still be alive inside their body? If so, can the human soul interact with the alien now living in its body?Saoirse Ronan does a great job in the lead as Melanie (the human) and Wanda (the alien). Her voice is in a slightly different register to help you determine which is speaking, though only the alien as function of her mouth when she takes over, and Melanie is an interval voice. She is surrounded by a young cast of mostly unknowns - but that's pretty much how the cast of Twilight started out too. I did recognize Boyd Holbrook only because I'd watched him on The Big C and recently in Behind the Candelabra.For those who prefer their alien fiction a little more fast paced, blow-them-up, giant space craft, war-type films, you'll hate The Host. There is nothing more than a bit of blood shed. The aliens themselves are even tiny, white, sea urchin-looking things. If you are looking for a different and interesting teenage romance, Meyer has served you that dish again just as she did with her previous books.  And there are some new and interesting concepts here when it comes to the whole romance thing: Melanie's lover, Jared, is there in the group. And another member of the group falls in love with Wanda. How does Melanie get Jared, her young brother, and the group to realize that she's still alive in there? Can they save her? What will happen to the alien?There are also a lot of underlying themes about the soul and reincarnation to explore here, which really makes this a serious and phenomenal film. Look past the young inexperienced cast and the fumbling romance stuff, and you will be rewarded with a film that is worth the watch. There's a great line in the film where the humans have been experimenting violently with extracting the aliens from the humans.  Wanda tells them it will come out peacefully if they just basically ask it to. It's very true of the way humans look upon those who are different or those who could be a threat. We act out in anger.Like everyone else, I loved making fun of Twilight even though I watched all four films.  The Host has given me a new respect for Meyer if she continues to write stuff like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y66ZVEZRXLII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SI4LU#wasThisHelpful","R2Y66ZVEZRXLII","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a wonderful treat this short book was! I have to admit I almost abandoned it early on.  It's the slow detailed account of two estranged sisters who haven't seen each other in over fifty years. Over a period of four days, the story of their earlier lives together unfolds against a backdrop of lepidopterology (the study of moths) which was the family namesake.We meet Virginia, the lepidopterist of the family and the narrator, who took over in her father's footsteps while sister Vivian moved away and married. Virginia remained in the family's aging mansion, and now Vivian has chose to return after all these years. Through Virginia's eyes, we slowly learn of their mother's alcoholism and other dark matters in the family that led to Vivian staying away all this time.While Virginia prattles on in long bouts about moths and bugs, she suddenly throws in shocking hints as to what happened between her and her loved ones, all while obsessing over why her sister has come back.  And that's what kept me reading!  I wanted answers.Like others here, I was a bit let down by the ending - right up to that last chapter was fine. And that's the only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five. For those who love dark secretive family drama, complete with decrepit old houses crawling with bugs, this book is for you.  I couldn't put it down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YYWEGXBIYHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030738831X#wasThisHelpful","R23YYWEGXBIYHV","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dabbled in tarot years ago and had the plain Rider-Waite set that at the time came with two guide books in a nice box set. I lost interest in the cards, and apparently lost the cards too, until recently when a tarot reading (using the Rider-Waite) revealed I was a bit intuitive and that I should consider reading the tarot. I thought that was odd because it was the second time in my life that a reading had revealed that. I already had several books on the shelf and picked up another the day of that reading.  So, now it was time to buy a new set of cards.I chose this deck mainly just to have something a bit different from the regular set without straying completely from it. The ""Radiant"" part of their title really just refers to enhanced color. All of the cards are still based on the original version as far as the pictures go. So, I would definitely suggest this deck to anyone who is looking to buy the basic deck, or someone who might want something a bit ""prettier"" to look at. As you have probably heard before, it needs to be the deck that speaks to you.However, the tiny guidebook including won't be enough if you are serious about learning the tarot like I am.  Pick up two or three basic instruction books - there are several on the market.  Thumb through them and try to stick with the ones that show the Rider-Waite pictured inside. Most of your basic starter books do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HSJSURXA1IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572814136#wasThisHelpful","R19HSJSURXA1IY","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit I found this app on my cell phone minutes before I turned my phone off to go into an actual tarot reading. It was the first reading I'd had done in at least thirteen years or so. During the reading, the psychic told me I was intuitive and that I should explore that.  That's the second time a tarot reader had told me that. I dabbled with the tarot back in high school and enjoyed doing spreads for friends, but I always had to consult the book as I was learning, and I eventually abandoned the cards as I became interested in other things. But I've always believed in the power of tarot and remained interested in it, wishing I had kept it up.I'd forgotten about the app until I got home and turned my phone back on and it had finished downloading. So, I began to explore it. It uses the traditional Rider-Waite tarot cards as a reference. You can pick the cards and study the meaning of each one using the tarot encyclopedia, or you can actually do spreads and pick cards at random. The cards actually turn over as you tap them. Tap them again and they fill the screen so you can examine them up close. Tap them again and the meaning of each card pops up. It also teaches you what the placement in the spread means. You can also draw one single random card at a time to study or learn about.  And there's a galaxy profile where you can view the card of the day, upgrade to save spreads, change card themes and more.The set up of this app is magnificent.  It's easy to use and you can even begin using it right away with no instruction. For someone like me who wants to learn the tarot more thoroughly, it's the perfect way to study the cards on the go. I downloaded the app on my phone and on my Kindle Fire and I've used it almost every day since. It even inspired me to buy a new deck of cards. For those who want to stay plugged in and might not have time to read an actual book about tarot, this is the perfect app to get started.Definitely one of the best apps I've downloaded as far as simplicity, set-up, color, art, graphics, information, and use go!  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE78CSBJQ17TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ID7U4C#wasThisHelpful","RE78CSBJQ17TN","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most of the recent reviews, I recently read this book because of the HBO movie based on it which was released this year. For what it's worth, I knew the story from the headlines having grown up reading about Liberace in the National Enquirer of all things.I became even more fascinated by him after watching Liberace: Behind The Music when it came on TV many years ago when I was very young.  I've since gone back and watched some of it again and discovered how horrible that version of the story was. Scott Thorson was barely mentioned in it, but again, that was more of Liberace's side of the story and we now know he lived a double life.I can honestly say I wasn't all that thrilled with the HBO version either, though it follows Scott's book practically verbatim. Even some of the dialogue was right from the book!  But, I still wanted to read the book itself and I'm glad I did. Scott's writing comes off as a bit glittery and gossipy at times, but that was definitely the world of Liberace!  Otherwise, he's very candid and I feel he's being honest.I felt so sorry for him. Being a foster kid, he had a rough life before he met Lee, so suddenly having a companion and father figure in his life who gave him everything seemed like he'd had the world literally handed to him. Unfortunately, it was Lee's perversion and materialism, tempered with Scott's own drug addiction, that tore the relationship apart. Scott accepts just as much blame here and it's so sad to read how alone he felt when Lee cheated on him and then kicked him out.The story also serves as a historical reminder of how different our world was back then when it came to AIDS and homosexuality. Lee publicly lived a lie his whole life and would stop at nothing to make sure his sexuality was kept a secret. His materialistic greed and ""showmanship"" was to be expected - look at the costumes and oddball things Elvis and Michael Jackson wore and bought.  I was also surprised to see Lee's true thoughts about his mother - I'd previously believed he was very close to his Mom, but that too was a sad facade. He felt very free after she passed.What's even sadder is the new afterword written by Scott where he briefly tells you what has happened to him since then. He's battled drugs, cancer, crime, and desperately needed money; he admits to writing the book for a paycheck. And he also still feels the pain of Liberace's rejection to this day. Overall, this is a very private and honest look at one of the world's most bizarre and popular entertainers - well worth the read if you have interest in Lee and Scott's story or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHDOQAYBSU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPURWCW#wasThisHelpful","RLHDOQAYBSU4","A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a bird-themed office with cork boards on the wall, so these pins were a perfect accent to pinning pictures and keepsakes up on the wall. My only complaint, which is very very minor, is that the pins are so small (under an inch). But the size listed in the description is accurate so I knew that before I bought them. It's just the nice picture of them here really shows the detail up close and larger than the actual pins. But, I'm still very happy with them and would even buy another set for myself or for a friend.

"Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller team up again, but Harry is clearly in the lead. They don't see eye to eye on the case either. A mismatch of brothers.Crossing: retired detective Bosch crosses over from the cop camp to become a defense investigator in a murder case, working for lawyer Haller. Defense, in Harry's view, is the dark side. Gross. His old world of righteous defenders of the law will ostracize him. Innocence of the accused is irrelevant.That's not the only line Harry crosses. His methods don't always stay this side of legal. That accounts for a share of the suspense and causes its own legal complications, though in the end it is the goal that counts, not the way there, right?He also tends to cross the boundaries of his teen daughter's sensitivities. Daughters are foreign territory. Harry can't figure out her thinking. One sympathizes.Crossing is also an issue in the case(s): where and when did the alleged killer's path ever cross the victim's? Is there a motive? Was there even opportunity?Why does the surveillance car cross the highway lane to cut the biker's ride and push him out?Has the murdered cross-dressing prostitute double-crossed his client? Are we supposed to believe that was the cause of his death? Did he know too much?That the cosmetic surgeon crossed his line and had sex with a much worked on patient is not particularly surprising, apart from esthetic aspects.All in all, Harry and Mickey are an appealing team. Connelly has produced a strong procedural detective story, again.I am not particularly keen on the narrative method that injects the odd chapter where action is seen from the opposition's view. That has become rather common in many crime novels, but I don't like it much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DF98YG7T6I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URUOJZK#wasThisHelpful","R5DF98YG7T6I5","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Booker winner is another big disappointment. Centerpiece of the story is the 1976 assassination attempt against Bob Marley in Jamaica, in the middle of a civil war in the middle of Cold War. We hear from slum bosses, gangsters, reporters, CIA operatives, groupies.... It is a cacophony of voices that doesn't really come together to form an interesting plot.

"A new contribution to the biographical exploration of Vladimir Nabokov.The groundbreaking Nabokov bio was the two volume work by Newzealander Brian Boyd. Volume 2 was called, somewhat misleadingly, The American Years, though Nabokov spent his final nearly two decades in Switzerland.This new book is an update on the American Years. That's legitimate. New details will usually come to light while time goes by, and that may justify new biographies. This book begins in Europe, tracing the attempts of the family to escape from Hitler to America. We get there by chapter 3.A core theme of VN's American years was his lepidoptera addiction. We get a lot of that, combined with road trip research. It gives me ideas for my own road trips.Main subject though is the writing of Lolita and the related travelsThe author seems to like wandering off on tangents. Example: the Nabokovs join another couple for a vacation... And now we are given a biographical summary of the other man, for no obvious reason. The man has no particular importance for the life of the Nabokovs and never shows up again.The important question, whether the preoccupation with young girls, that can be found in more than one of VN's fictional piece, not just in Lolita, is based on real life inclinations or experiences, is relegated to the end notes. The answer is 'no, but'. Not quite satisfactory.Another core subject: the rise and fall of the Wilson friendship. Nabokov's interaction with literary czar Edmund Wilson was a highly entertaining soap opera. It gives a lively touch to the narration.Another important subject: family issues - the affair in France in the 30s that nearly broke the marriage with Vera; the role of magnificent Vera in VN's career;  the growing up of son Dimitri; the relationship with parents and siblings. Was Dimitri a CIA agent? No conclusive evidence.I am always happy to read about Nabokov, and therefore this wasn't boring for me, but did I learn new things? Not so much, I think. Some additional details, sure. Like: VN had a 'true crime' case as a model for Lolita. Around 1950 a man had abducted an 11 years old girl and travelled the country with her, including sending her to school during the trip, until he was caught. VN took some aspects of that sad story and grafted them on his Enchanter tale from the 1930s.Also: interesting comparisons of Lolita with The Catcher in the Rye, as well as with Eugen Onegin, as well as with Moby Dick. Less convincing ones to Hamsun and Faulkner.Less enticing: a little too much on contents and interpretation of Lolita, Pnin, and Pale Fire, the three main pieces of fiction written by VN in America. I didn't need that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQOXBX3SKHRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802743633#wasThisHelpful","R2UQOXBX3SKHRO","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pramoedya Ananta Toer was an outstanding phenomenon in Indonesian literature. No other writer came close to his epic force, social awareness, plotting skill, and psychological realism. That the Nobel committee by-passed him, often for second rate writers, is a shame.This novel is the first volume in the Buru quartet, which was conceived on Indonesia's prison island in the 1970s. It is set in Surabaya in the early years of Queen Wilhelmina' s reign on the Dutch throne, the late 19th century.The world is on the threshold of modern times. Science, technology, industry are entering even Indonesia, then called Dutch East India, a colonial backwater. The native Javanese society stews in its own world, oblivious of modern times. This colonial society is a layer cake, similar to a caste system.The narrator Minke is a young man, the only native student at a Dutch high school. He observes the world of the Dutch and of the 'intermediate' stratum of the 'Indos', the Eurasian mixed population. He comes from a family with 'royalty roots'.He falls in love with Annelies, an Indo girl, daughter of a Dutch agro-industrialist and his native concubine. The girl's mother is an outstanding personality; she is the manager of the business. Mother and daughter are endlessly puzzling to Minke, who marvels at their lack of conventionality. The father of the family is dysfunctional, sidelined in the business by Ann's mother. There is a mystery here.Despite his feelings for the girl, Minke has doubts about his relationship with that family, due to the mother's dubious social standing. Her life story is a major part of the plot. She is a victim of conventions and circumstances. As a concubine, her legal status is nil. She sees herself as a slave, having been sold by her parents as a teenager.Minke's name is another mystery. He doesn't disclose his real name, and he doesn't know what 'Minke' means. The name was given him by a Dutch teacher. The vicinity to 'monkey' is mentioned, with a hint at colonial racism.Minke's time with Ann's family is interrupted by demands from his own parents. His father has been promoted to a senior administration position and summons his son away from his shady friends. Minke is caught in a conflict between tradition and his modernist ideals.The temporary separation has dramatic impact on the young girl, which increases the pressure on poor Minke. The final plot twists in this first of four volumes involve a case of murder and a clash of colonial law with native law and with common sense.Pramoedya first told the story while in prison, with no writing material. Later, in house arrest, he wrote it down. The English translation was done by an attachÃ© at the Australian Embassy. The man lost his job over it. At second reading, after 30 years, I am even more impressed than I was then, possibly because this stands out so high above other Indonesian writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F87H9K50W22N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140256350#wasThisHelpful","R3F87H9K50W22N","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During WW2, China and the US were allies. When the war was over, friendship ended. That's a short summary of a complex and complicated piece of history. This book is a good, solid attempt at cutting through the maze towards a fair assessment of the problems and the mistakes made.Hindsight still debates a few crucial questions. How bad a leader was Chiang Kai-shek  really? Could he have won the civil war if the Americans had supported him properly? Did American disaffection with CKS make the US 'lose China'? Or was it a communist conspiracy that operated from inside the USA? Could America have handled Mao & Co better and avoided the conflicts that resulted in the Korea and Vietnam Wars?Bernstein's book is an interesting treatise on the subject. Some of his convictions:CKS wasn't all bad. His strategy to beat the communists before committing to a full fight against the Japanese invasion was right in view of resources and outlook. He could have made it, had he not been forced into a pseudo cooperation with Mao against the Japanese. That allowed the communists to survive and wrestle national power from the KMT after the war.It is unjust to claim, as Vinegar Joe Stilwell did, that CKS did not let his army fight against Japan. In fact, serious battles were fought in earnest, with many losses. After all, China was never fully occupied, but held out in large parts, tying down Japanese armies.Stilwell lacked insight into the Chinese power struggle and he lacked diplomatic skills.Without doubt, this negative attitude towards CKS at the end of the war led to reduced support and thus to the communist victory. Explaining this by a communist conspiracy inside the American camp is however not justified. There was much honest misjudgment. Stilwell was not the only wrong appointment.American attitudes towards 'Chiang vs Mao' were based on wishful thinking and produced a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Chinese communists were not the reasonable bunch that a half informed comparison to the ineffective, corrupt and vicious Nationalist rule had suggested. Expecting the Communists to win the civil war facilitated just that.Anyway, the claim that the USA 'lost China' is based on illusions over the American influence in the world.Anyway, the key pre-condition for the communist victory in China had been the Japanese invasion.  The KMT would otherwise very likely have crushed the communists.Anyway, the fate of Sino-American friendship was ultimately decided elsewhere. The war in Europe came to an end. The Soviets invaded Manchuria and made the communist victory practically unavoidable, unless the USA was prepared to provide massive military and manpower support to the KMT. Truman's priority was different: get American soldiers out of this war. Demobilization. Not another big war.The American alliance with Uncle Joe, in which FDR had believed fervently and naively, came unstuck and turned into its opposite. Cold War started. Riens ne va plus between China and the USA, for a while.George Marshall's last ditch effort to avoid civil war by negotiating a compromise was based on wrong understandings of the relations between the antagonists and therefore hopelessly stillborn, though false hopes had flared up briefly.(One serious error needs correction: on page 349 it is said that the May Fourth Movement preceded World War 1. Absolutely not.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0SEWXKXD135/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAFVOVY#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0SEWXKXD135","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Any man who would change the World in a significant way must have showmanship, a genial willingness to shed other people's blood, and a plausible new religion....'A spaceship called Whale takes Jonah (a temporary name of its billionaire owner) to Mars. Later, under other names, he will travel onwards to Mercury, and finally to Titan, where three impressive beauties, the sirens of the title, are waiting and have been promised to our hero, who is a womanizer.This is prophesied by another rich man, who furthermore predicts that our hero will become a father on Mars, with the role of mother allocated to Mrs. Prophet, who is quite reluctant about the whole thing. The prophet turns out to be he who would change the world in a significant way, the founder of the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. His prophecies never fail.Sounds like science fiction to you? One could classify it like that, but there is really not much 'science' here, though some of the phantastic devices in the story look remarkably real.Anyway, mostly satire, or silliness. Vonnegut's view of business, politics, religion, and all that. As per 1969. I think I was a little childish myself, then.Coming back to the space trip. What on earth is its purpose? Quoting Monty Python: what does it mean? Exactly. Right answer. The meaning of life. You will like the book if you don't need answers. Does that make it nonsense? Probably, but let us leave that question open.The story belongs vaguely in the category of fiction like the magnificent Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and has elements of the Matrix film plot. Consider it an imperfect precursor to greater things.I am glad that I finally learned the meaning of Stonehenge.

"Magical realism, rather surprisingly, isn't dead yet. Here we have a specimen from Indonesia, and it is quite alive. Kurniawan's  Macondo is called Halimunda and is located on the South Coast of Java.Author Eka Kurniawan has been touted by some international observers as the first worthy successor of Pramoedya Ananta Toer. Well, I don't know, really. Granted, there is not that much serious competition. Indonesia is not a reading country.After giving birth to her fourth daughter, at the ripe age of 50, the heroine Dewi Ayu, a prostitute with an attitude, decides to die. She lies down and it takes her 12 days to get it done. 21 years later, she changes her mind and rises from the grave. Sort of a zombie, not the only one here.The baby had been unusually ugly, which must have been caused by her mother 's curses at her pregnancy. Javanese voodoo.Beauty is a wound? Women, especially beautiful ones like Dewi Ayu and her first 3 daughters, get raped with shocking frequency in this novel. It is a message, but hard to put up with.Dewi Ayu's and her daughters' life stories are placed in historical context: Dutch colonialism (Dewi is an Indo, a mix of Dutch and Malay), World War 2 and the Japanese (Dewi spends years in a Japanese pow camp, becomes a comfort woman), independence struggles of the new nation Indonesia, political troubles in the framework of the global Cold War, the Suharto dictatorship, the Timor war....But don't expect an historical treatise. Flights of fantasy and hyperbole run wild, putting Kurniawan in the world of Rushdie and GarcÃ­a Marquez. Dewi is a fearless, practical and shameless woman. We find reason to admire her courage, but most of her person remains outside the realm of realism and plausibility. Much of the fantasy elements of the story is on loan from traditional Indonesian sagas and fairy tales. It is a bit as if Grass had told the story of German division and re-unification using characters shaped on Schneewittchen and Hans im GlÃ¼ck.The NYT reviewer compared the Dewi Ayu character to Pippi Longstocking. Great idea!I must admit, though, that all these magical happenings stretch out a bit too much for my taste, at nearly 400 pages. Fascination sags by half way through.Also: all these miraculously unusual people don't really have much in terms of individual personality.The translation seems to be quite good, one rarely stumbles over oddities in the flow of the narration, but what is a square hectare?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DDNFSGKZEV8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H3IAQW#wasThisHelpful","R3DDNFSGKZEV8K","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the not so distant future, after the 2022 presidential elections, the Muslim Brotherhood will take the leadership role in France's government, in a coalition with Socialists and Conservatives. Those two parties cooperate with the Brotherhood in order to prevent a victory by the right wing National Front.We are told this by a narrator with a rather passive nature and attitude, a literature professor in his 40s, with a talent for apathy. He has no convictions and no 'life'. His love life consists of affairs with his students. After the new government takes over, all professors at public universities must convert. Initially, our hero refuses and gets terminated. Later he sees the light, in his own opportunistic way, and submits. His pension and savings would have permitted some access to high class escort services, but the prospects were dim. Submission to new political needs has clear advantages.One of his exes ascribes 'abnormal honesty' to his character. We can safely assume that to be a coquettish self description of M. Wellbeck. The man is a phenomenon, literally and literarily. Politically too. The book arrived in the market during the days of the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Houellebecq is a clear sighted political analyst, in addition to everything else that is also true about him.I enjoy the author's provocative stance and language. His dystopian view of Europe's future is hard to argue with.There are other aspects that I appreciate less.One complaint is of a technical nature: to make the plot work narratively, the author invents a secret service man, a husband of another professor, who explains backgrounds to the hero and provides him with conspiracy theories. I find that an overly contrived approach.Another issue: in his generally provocative way, the author tends to produce nonsensical generalizations, that irritate me. Example: he claims that all prostitutes dream secretly, and by their nature, of becoming 'cooking pot women'.Or silly quips like: civil war and duck confit are incompatible.Such nonsense reduces the fun for me.My conclusion: provocative, entertaining, informative, but also annoying.In a way, Houellebecq squandered his subject. The book is not funny enough for full- blown satire, nor serious enough for political analysis. Still, as far as social dystopia is concerned, I see this novel in a class with Dave Eggers' Circle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNERQJBWO8KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XGX9IAG#wasThisHelpful","R1XNERQJBWO8KJ","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice opening: writer Roth writes a letter to his fictional creature, writer Zuckerman, whom we have previously met in various Roth novels, asking him if the following (allegedly) factual autobiography should be published. After so many counter factual ones from Roth, who is going to believe a word that he says? Obviously, this is not just an issue of deliberate lies. Rather, as Roth admits, how do we know that our memories are facts?  We don't. Great opening. Not entirely honest though.From the novel's fairly small size, we can conclude early on, that this is not a full autobiography of a 55 year old. We realize soon enough, that the purpose of this attempted selfie is quite sharply focused on Roth's first marriage, on life and death of Mrs.Roth, on the farcical relationship between two social illiterates.We start rather blissfully. The protected childhood in Jewish Newark. Safely American during WW2. Much baseball. Some anti semitism, but not all that much.Small town college, Jewish fraternity, literary magazine editor. Testing his exuberance.Teaching in Chicago. Anthropological experiments with gentile women. So far, this is all just the opening.Then he meets his nemesis. He meets a disaster case of a woman, and finally gets tricked, literally, into a hellish marriage with an 'extremist creative fiction teacher', a crazy she-devil. Years wasted over regaining freedom. When freedom comes, it comes out of the blue, and he doesn't even have to kill her.In other words: mostly the same story as in his novels. What's the difference? Did this need to be written? Maybe yes, but maybe it didn't need to be published.Zuckerman, in his response to the opening, agrees with that. Quote: 'Don't publish - you are far better off writing about me than 'accurately' reporting your own life'. Wise man.Actually, Zuckerman's letter to Roth is the best part of this 'non-fiction'. A thoughtful essay on fiction, truth, omission, delusion, dissimulation, within the framework of the Rothian universe. The 'autobiography' is critically shredded. Anything is better than 'My Ex-Wife the Bitch'.In his final P.S., Zuckerman worries that his attack on the boss may lead to him having to shave off his beard, next morning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JMK5MOM2OH60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679749055#wasThisHelpful","R1JMK5MOM2OH60","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is the worst over? Are there no more terrible mistakes to make? You wish.David Kepesh was the hero of Roth's idiotic sexual satire The Breast. Now he gets reactivated as 'professor of desire', presumably as an act of rehabilitation. I admit, it worked for me. I liked this Kepesh. This is a smart and funny novel, far from the provocations of Portnoy, or the absurdity of the Breast. It is a Bildungsroman in the Roth manner.Kepesh grows up in a family of Jewish hotel owners, at the Hungarian Royale in the Catskills. His artsy interests take him to literature studies, and from upstate New York to England. David tries many things. His sexual adventures overwhelm his literary expeditions. Icelandic sagas? Sidelined by a Swedish mÃ©nage Ã  trois, dabbling in mild SM games.Back on his professional track, now at college in California, he meets and marries a great beauty, though their prior three year relationship should have taught him otherwise. This bad decision leads David into the middle of a trashy Grade B thriller, which costs him dearly. He drops into depression and impotence, and the required shrink sessions. Until he meets a fabulous and normal woman.... Back to square one? If only our Professor of Desire didn't know himself so well. Poor man!The literary interests of Professor Kepesh are worth taking into account.

"It wasn't all salad days. More like courting disaster. Underneath that scrupulousness and fairness and reasonableness, he was a madman! Or just the Malinowski of Manhattan? The anthropologist in search of understanding women?This was P. Roth's first book about Nathan Zuckerman. Nate, in this over-constructed novel, is the brainchild of another writer, Peter Tarnopol, who in turn got himself invented by Philip Roth. A double alter ego.We find it very hard to like any of them. An unappealing trio, but an entertaining  trio.(By the way, Nate does a Humbert stunt for us. After his hated wife kills herself, he has an affair with her illiterate 16 year old daughter from an earlier marriage. He denies that he married the mother to get at the daughter.) (There is a second reference to Poe and/or Nabokov, when Peter tells us of his childhood love in his Kingdom by the Sea, in Atlantic City.)We are never quite sure who is who. There is an abundance of impersonation here. Nate is quite an idiot. Let's not go into details, they would just annoy me even more. His biographies don't necessarily tally between the stories in which he appears. His life comes to us in 'useful fictions'. Roth kept it that way in many later variations.The 'unfictional' hero of the 'real life' story has his life full with one hellish woman, clearly the original for Nate's wife, and apparently based on the first Mrs. Roth.  Fire and brimstone are not required, they would be excessive.The stories inside the novel, about the good and bad lives of Nate Zuckerman, give us more of those inadequate creatures. I think a feminist reader will find ample reason to see all these men as enemies, whether Philip, Peter, or Nathan.Does so much male misery provide a good novel? Actually, yes, it does. This is highly entertaining, in a perverse kind of way.  Makes you so glad you escaped unhurt. If you did escape, you can sit back with glee. Or are we subject to self deception?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NFTCXSOSYZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GKMUV2#wasThisHelpful","R8NFTCXSOSYZW","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Library of America has selected another 20th century crime writer, after Chandler, Hammett, and Goodis, for a selected works publication: Elmore Leonard has joined the club. An acceptable choice.All 4 novels in this 1970s volume are set in Detroit. The volume begins with '52 Pickup', from 1974. Main character is an entrepreneur in car part fabrication, a solid family man in his forties. Business is a struggle. At home things seem to be ok. The marriage is doing fine, but still... He cheats. He gets blackmailed. He tries to be smart, but the bad boys up the ante... So does their victim. A power game begins. Violence occurs.The story has been filmed with Roy Scheider, not too successfully.Next comes 'Swag', 1976. A car salesman and a car thief get together for a start up venture in armed robbery. They succeed, for a while. They are tempted by hubris and want to upgrade their enterprise for higher harvests. They team up with others, and things go down the drain. They learn to their disadvantage that one should always listen to instincts which tell you to get out of there, and that it is better to stick to one's personal Ten Commandments.Then 'Unknown Man No.89', 1977. A professional process server gets hired by a shady character to find an even shadier one, allegedly for the purpose of good news. The case stinks, but our man is tempted by the promise of high reward. One search leads to another, and the man finds himself, a bit unexpectedly, concerned on a personal basis. He shows human feelings. The story is a little slow in building up, but reaches moments of high suspense.Then 'The Switch', 1978. Rich man's wife gets kidnapped for ransom. Things don't go as planned. The goons hadn't done their market research and misunderstood the lay of the land. The marriage was on the rocks from page 1 onwards. A film was made with Jennifer Aniston and Tim Robbins, called Life of Crime, not a great success. Frankly, that is not surprising. The novel doesn't make good use of a good idea, so why should the movie?Leonard developed a dry, sarcastic, but moderate tone for his crime tales. No hilarious rambunctiousness, no madhouse fun. Just relaxed, matter of fact understatement, using short, precise language. There is no flourishing description. Things are done or said. Things happen. Brilliant economy of words. People are not described much, except through the eyes of others. Leonard had a peculiar way of shifting the perspective from one person to the other. A key word for Leonard's moral stance: ambiguity. His protagonists are rarely quite sure about their values and preferences. That adds a nice touch of unpredictability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32LZ9P3ICXWYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598533053#wasThisHelpful","R32LZ9P3ICXWYO","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A tale of Peanut and Moose Dung.This is not a historian's view of mid century China, but a surprisingly readable and fresh  contemporary (1946) look by two American journalists. The authors worked for Time in China. (White would later become very successful with a series of books about American elections.) Though Time was strongly supporting Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, the book criticizes the nationalist government strongly.The advantage of contemporary perspective, ie the freshness and the first hand views, outweighs the problems of contemporary shortsightedness, ie the lack of access to knowledge that was discovered later. The book mentions no sources, but the story is told well. Most books of that kind lose their luster within a few years, they become dated. Apart from the aging problem of subject matter, few journalists can really write good prose. These could.The structure combines chapters on special subjects with a chronological narration of the war. It starts with a superb essay on Chongqing, the war time capital. Much of that is the authors' own observation, or fresh second hand information. We get a chapter on China's peasants, a key subject for the understanding of the country. It tells a consistent story, but is it true, or is it just conventional knowledge? A skeptical attitude might be justified.The KMT is characterized as an alliance of coastal business people with rural landed gentry. A mini biography of CKS shows him as a highly incompetent military leader and administrator, but a skillful political manipulator. His government was inefficient, corrupt and tyrannical.A chapter on the communists and their headquarters in Yenan is, regrettably, a little romantic, and rather mistaken in its confidence that moderation in land right questions could be expected in future.The most relevant subject for American readers: the role of Americans in China, the relation between the two countries. Was America 'allied to a corpse', as Ludendorff had said about Germany and Austria in WW1? As weak as the Chinese military machine was, it did manage to keep substantial Japanese resources tied down. The American commander, Vinegar Joe Stilwell, was expected to perform miracles on a shoestring. Priority on China was low in terms of resources. On the other hand, the Chinese were hoping for a Japanese defeat at the hand of the Americans. Hence, no whole hearted commitment by either side.The authors agree with Stilwell's acidic view of the Chinese army and leadership. After CKS succeeded in getting Stilwell replaced, American policies in China changed towards taking clear sides in the internal Chinese confrontations. Unfortunately, Peanut (Stilwell's 'code name' for Chiang) was about to lose against Moose Dung (Ambassador Hurley's pronunciation of Mao's name). Americans were blind arbiters, meaning that neither ambassador nor new military chief had a clue what was happening.Would the confrontation between the USA and China have been avoidable with a more intelligent and more diplomatic approach?  Pure speculation.The following quote strikes me as an insight that is as true today, under party rule, as it was then, under the various previous rulers: (Page 29)'Appeal by the peasant against the oligarchy that rules him is useless. The local government to which he must appeal against iniquitous taxes, usurious interest, common police brutality, is by its very constitution the guardian of the groups that crush him.'We can read the book as a study of the trouble that is caused by the absence of the rule of law.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PA4KZSV3LVC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306801280#wasThisHelpful","R1PA4KZSV3LVC2","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very interesting British TV series. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives us a recently elevated British baroness from a Jewish family with a business in Israel. Her English accent and her voice are a thing of beauty.She is a do-gooder, who wants to promote peace, and who supports Palestinian development and state hood. This is partly on atonement for her father's work. He had been an arms dealer.Naturally, the good woman runs into conflict with everybody on the planet. Israeli government and spies, Palestinian factions, British and American secret services, her own brother, her best friend...The story has much drama. MG tends to live out the drama excessively. One could call it over-acting, but the over-acting rather fits the story and the character.The series has also been criticized for its slow pace, but I don't agree on that. The time taken to spread out the tale is the time needed to make it work.By coincidence, I watched this during the unfolding of the Charlie Hebdo terror events, and the early aftermath. From an article in my German daily newspaper, I gather that many Muslims, sampled in Berlin, refuse to believe that the attack was carried out by Muslims. No, the act must have been the work of Mossad or European right wing provocateurs. The same idiocy cropped up globally after 9/11.Honestly, this series, as much as I liked its artful narration, is part of an entertainment industry, that nourishes conspiracy theories.Then again, as we know, the fact that you are paranoid doesn't mean they are not after you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1BQC3EXIOSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6PANMW#wasThisHelpful","R1P1BQC3EXIOSY","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'The more responsible posts in the army are largely filled by certifiable lunatics. They don't cause any more trouble than the sane ones.' Quote from volume 3 of the trilogy.I know few good British works of fiction on WW2. This trilogy of novels by E. Waugh is one of the best, a modern classic. Actually, not all that much war happens in it. The hero, Guy Crouchback, spends more time trying to get into the action, than in actual action.  Most of the time he is in training, or waiting for orders, or withdrawing. Fate didn't mean him to be an action hero.He is involved in an unauthorized, failed landing on the shore of French West Africa. Then in the debacle of Crete, where his unit arrives in time for evacuation or surrender. After that, he spends years in administrative limbo, or inertia, before he gets posted to Yugoslavia near the end of the whole affair.Parallel to the military farce, we observe Guy' s private life. He is a devout catholic from a less than prospering old family. His wife has left him, but he tries to win her back, because he can't divorce as a church member. She is a bit of a tramp. When his financial situation improves, and when she has been dropped by her third husband and expects a child from an unloved lover, she agrees to come back to Guy. We don't like her better for it. Guy has no choice, he is a good man, and feels morally obliged to save a soul. It is his only way out of the somber 'end of the line' fate, that had previously seemed unavoidable.Waugh was a right-winger. He is among the few conservative writers that I enjoy and respect. His attitude about the war is probably identical with Guy's: a distaste for the alliance with the Soviet Union, and for the veneration of Stalin as Uncle Joe. The alliance dampens Guy's enthusiasm quite a bit, as does his observation of leftist propaganda in Britain and in the army.Next to the political disgust, the dominating theme about war is inefficiency, bureaucracy, idiocy. The trilogy has a strongly satirical tone besides the political and personal bitterness. Waugh was not a screwball comedian, but a master of understated absurdity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHF78T8E2B9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316216690#wasThisHelpful","R1NHF78T8E2B9S","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scenes from organized crime.'You baked Iraq like a cake and gave it to Iran to eat.'That's what the Sunni interpreter says to the narrator, an American civilian looking after development projects in Iraq. Such as finding kids who want to wear the baseball uniforms that were donated by the American politician. Institution building. Teaching baseball as basis for democracy, that's the concept. Hilarious in a sadly desperate way.This collection of stories about the American Iraq experience earned the National Book Award recently. The stories are about fighting scenarios, about soldiers talking in camp, about things at home on return, about political screw ups on lower levels. Some satirical components come into that. All are first person narratives from various angles. Apart from 'normal' soldiers, we get to meet some special cases. The man from the mortuary detail. The chaplain. The civilian. The PsyOps specialist with the Christian Arab background. And more.We might not remember this book for a long time. It may not become a modern classic. It doesn't stand out all that much. It is reasonably well written, and suitably sarcastic, considering the terribly ill advised adventure that it covers.Some reviewers have pointed out, that these soldiers were not draftees, like they would have been in Vietnam. I think  that shouldn't be forgotten. It is an aspect that the stories don't openly address. Why would volunteers not be guilty of conspiracy in crime? Is ignorance a mitigating circumstance? Can every one hide behind Bush's lies? 'There were whores in Vietnam' is a story about a very personal problem of many soldiers in this campaign. Was that the only difference between Vietnam and Iraq?Other reviewers complain that the tone is not heroic enough. Some people never want to exit their dream worlds. Morality doesn't come into their play. Serving is a value in itself, regardless of the who and what for.In conclusion: the book is realistic and critical, but shortsighted. It doesn't go out of the box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUM2LR92LLJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCW14G#wasThisHelpful","RCUM2LR92LLJK","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Aussi horror flick is probably unbeatable in terms of cost effectiveness. With minimal budget, we are given a satisfactory level of 'horror'.Horror can take roots in real life... Here the horribly hyper active, talkative, precocious, unlikable little boy of the story. It works best with the horribly overstressed, sleep deprived, burnt out mother, who moves in and out of sheer madness.

"This bio pic about Alan Turing has a message. It is: outsiders are the main source of, and society's best hope for creativity.Turing was a homosexual at a time, when 'indecency' could still be punishable by prison time. In Turing's case, chemical 'castration' was imposed by the court as the way to avoid prison. The man committed suicide.Turing is also seen as afflicted with Asperger symptoms. Unfortunately, the film uses some odd behavior to give itself a touch of comedy.I assume that the biographic elements in the film script are correct, because I know no better. We see Turing as the leader, in his anti-social way, of a team that successfully cracked the German Enigma code and thus contributed strongly to the Allied victory in WW2. We also see him as inventor of a thing that we now call 'computer'.A side effect of watching the film is this: you become aware of the strange fact, that most of the above has been an official secret for half a century, until declassification of the Enigma story.The outsider theory is emotionally pleasing and works well for movies like this. In real life it clashes with ideologies of team work for success of an organization or company, or for the common good. Most people are perfectly able to believe in the strength of the team and in the importance of eccentric genius at the same time. The problem lies in knowing the difference between destructive egotism and creative outsiderdom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DI6JGZMWK04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FZ074#wasThisHelpful","R17DI6JGZMWK04","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Texas family saga stretched over nearly 200 years and several generations. I don't much like 'historical' fiction, so this is not the kind of book that I normally read nowadays, though I did enjoy Michener, long ago. There is a line to Meyer, who had some support from the Michener Foundation.The novel alternates among three narrative threads, some first person, some third person, some diaries. The title is 'The Son' though, which indicates that the key character is 'Colonel Eli', the surviving son of the family founder.Eli had a remarkable life. Kidnapped and raised by Comanches, he survives, finds his way back into 'white' society, where he reaches the age of a Methuselah. Due to his long life span, he overlaps with several following generations.The main focus for the later years is on a woman in this man's world.Between the strong man and the strong woman, there is a loser: an intellectual, an honest man, a failure, the colonel's son and the strong woman's grandfather.Large swaths of the story are pure 'Western', with cowboys and Indians and rangers. I liked these parts best. The oil tales are a little boring, though there is some appeal in large scale corruption, and LBJ shows up, which is always entertaining.History is dirty business, and historiography is sometimes a form of prostitution. Texas has much dirt to offer in its history. We are told of the white expansionism against the aboriginal owners of the land, and against the Mexicans who had been there earlier too.Ownership, says the colonel, is never acquired by honest means.Something is missing in this book. It has history, it has a plot, it has strong episodes, at times even suspense, but its people are stereotypes. Nobody has  individuality. There is no tragedy nor comedy. For lack of complications, the world stays flat.Another gripe: the first person narrative by the colonel, who tells us of his life, is entirely implausible in its language. It would work better as a third person story. There is no authentic voice here.The cover blurbs of my pocket book have some respectable writers talk about the Great American Novel. Another case of corruption?","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65CWFXRP7JMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062120409#wasThisHelpful","R65CWFXRP7JMX","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume of Roth novels from 1967 to 1972 opens with 'When She was Good'.It is a realistic, but extreme story set mostly around 1950 in small town Midwest.Lucy Nelson is an ambiguous heroine. We can sympathize with her problems, but she doesn't make it easy on us. She is contrarian and unreasonable. She is angry, which is understandable in her situation as a teenage mum, but rarely likable. She is brutally honest and consistent, but self-righteous and unpleasant.She hates her father, the drinker and wife beater, and despises her husband, the lazy weakling, as well as everybody else. Not just men, as some reviewers have written.  We are not comfortable with her frustrated sense of entitlement. She lives and fails with her rigid way of being 'good'. A strong portrait of the obsessions of an 'enemy ridden' personality. Among the 4 texts in this volume, I find it the most interesting and the one that survived time best.Next is 'Portnoy's Complaints', which brought Roth a commercial breakthrough. He had been appreciated and awarded for a dozen years already, but now came the big bucks. Portnoy has a mother issue and a sex obsession. The narration is the adult man's monologue to a shrink, about Jewish childhood, masturbation habits since boyhood, his fixation on 'goy' women, his lack of commitment to anybody. The novel is funny and provocative, but slightly dated (its offensiveness has become common place) and it derails towards the end in a tasteless and offensive climax. I don't see it as a major master piece.Then comes a short satirical novel on Richard Nixon, 'Our Gang'. It is unfortunately quite dated. Reality exceeded Roth's polite expectations. When this was published, Watergate hadn't happened yet, and the Nixon tapes with all their vulgarity were still unheard of and unlistened to. I am sure he book was great fun at its time.Finally the short novella 'The Breast'. A talkative hypochondriac turns into a female breast, a baggy thing of 155 pounds, shaped like a watermelon, with a nipple at one end. Of course we are expected to think of Gogol and Kafka, but the hoax is too wordy to keep me interested. I think I rather read Metamorphosis again. I find no value in this text.My summary on this volume: the least known of the 4 texts, the first one, has survived the time best. I do not think that Roth belongs to the top of the class with this collection. I thought the previous volume with older texts was stronger. Those of his later novels that I know definitely are stronger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6EW6D8UK243/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931082804#wasThisHelpful","RS6EW6D8UK243","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill Bryson was a very funny travel writer before he took up the more sedentary habit of writing trivial, amusing, informative non fiction.For not entirely clear reasons he picked a few summer months of the year 1927 as a subject for an entertaining and indispensable walk through American history. I guess any period can serve for a book like this. What was special about the chosen period?The big event was Lindbergh's solo flight to Paris. I was quite impressed how big a deal that really was. I hadn't realized the difficulties and the personal achievement of the man.Of course it is practically impossible to talk exclusively about such an event itself. The moment needs its own build up, which requires going back to the state of flying and the aviation industry , as well as some biographical info on the man.Similarly we learn about Babe Ruth's impressive career with its high points in 1927. Bryson makes baseball almost interesting.We learn much about various presidents... Harding, Coolidge, Hoover for obvious reasons. Also about other leaders like Henry Ford or Al Capone.Much attention is paid to murder and trials. We follow the Ruth Snyder case in its sordid details, as well as the tail end of the tragic Sacco and Vanzetti story, the aftermath of the Red Scare.I was surprised by the number of domestic terror attacks in the USA during the 20s. Not just 'anarchists', but also the shocking and quickly forgotten case from Michigan, where a man bombed a school in protest against taxes and foreclosure, and killed 38 children plus several adults and himself. Since there was no trial, attention was directed elsewhere fast.It is better to read this while alone. Otherwise you might make yourself unpopular by  the urge to share some highly relevant trivia that you just picked up.Did you know that President Coolidge worked only about 4 hours per day, refused to attend all kinds of events, refused even to make a speech at the occasion of the Great Flood of 1927... Or that Henry Ford had the harebrained idea to build a mid western town in the Amazon region, for the purpose of growing rubber for the US market; the project flopped on a grandiose scale...That kind of thing.

A portrait of a totalitarian society in an early stage of power.Science fiction looking at next year, or is it next week. What can be done, will be done. Then let's ask: what are the political implications of total control? Whatever happens, will be known...The story begins in full sunshine at the super company The Circle. The guru of the Circle has come up with the Columbus Egg. Doing away with multiple identities and the related pw troubles, with identity theft and personal secrecies, he gave the world a solution: all is done via the one identity TruYou. Who needs dissemination? All will be open and clear. Life will be simple. Crime impossible.From here to SeeChange is a small step: whatever happens will be known. Total control costs 59$ per single unit of surveying camera. Covering the world is a piece of cake.Central heroine is a good American girl looking for a career and a life. The latter is normally ruled out by the procedures of the workplace. The former requires submission and adaptation. Not much different from the Red Guards or a Jesuit Seminary. Whatever happens will be known. Constant justification and supervision. Constant brown-nosing and attention-grabbing.We recognize some of this in our daily lives. Led to the extreme, we see a behavior that is both a horror and a farce.The plot is spiced up by some mysteries, some promising adolescent sex scenes, and some kayaking adventures.The strength of the novel lies in its vision of society, not in wordsmithing. It lays down its plot with the tools of any contemporary, ordinary and even pulpy piece of writing, and the result, this promise of total transparency, is a nightmare.If this had been published in 1970, it would have been pure science fiction and quite possibly we wouldn't have thought it possible.

"A gutsy and witty travel book written by an English woman, a former journalist and public health worker.She travels through the backwoods and centers of Indonesia. Years of inside knowledge, personal contacts, language skills, historical, social, and political insights go into the narrative. Memories from earlier trips add a time axis to the trip.I recommend the book. The agenda is determined by a healthy skepticism against religions and politicians,  by a commitment to conservation causes, and by sympathies for the underdogs. I assume the book is most valuable to people who have some knowledge of Indonesia. It is not an introduction for novices.For the question that moves most people (which role will political Islam play in the future of the country?), the book gives information that can improve our understanding. The author is not an alarmist, but she is not crazy enough to deal in prophecies. On key environmental issues like deforestation, she is not optimistic.Many chapters about different parts of the country touch the subject of past outbreaks of violence, be it between religious or ethnic groups, or the big outbreak of murder lust in the 1960s. A subject with many explanations, but beyond comprehension.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUTT1M58IO52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783780142#wasThisHelpful","R3RUTT1M58IO52","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enter and Exit Philip Seymour Hoffman. Alas, this is the last film of the best actor of the last decade.PSH is GÃ¼nter Bachmann, German anti terror spy with smoking, drinking, and weight problems.On his job, in Hamburg, where 9-11 had been prepared. He is doing reasonably well. His team has found the whereabouts of a suspicious Chechen illegal. They have also made progress in their quest of discovering how a famous liberal Muslim intellectual, a Hamburg resident, manages to channel funds into terror networks...Where GÃ¼nter Bachmann doesn't do so well is cooperation and coordination with other German law enforcement agencies. Even worse is alignment with CIA policies. Enough said.Brilliant PSH in a typical low key, dark Le CarrÃ© story. The whole cast is outstanding., with some German stars in small roles.Some reviewers have complained that the actors speak with artificial German accents. It is not really a big issue though.An appropriate special effect: Robin Wright's CIA agent never learns how to pronounce GÃ¼nter Bachmann's name. That fits their level of mutual trust.On the other hand, Dafoe, who plays a banker, should have tried harder to pronounce the name of Rachel McAdams' character Annabel Richter, a lawyer.And in case that you wondered about my headline: yes, it is irony. Taken from the film. It is said twice, first by the CIA woman, later by Bachmann, shortly before the big betrayal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LVMN2ZI1RJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LP7LU#wasThisHelpful","R33LVMN2ZI1RJX","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bellow's hero Charlie Citrine, the first person narrator, is a formerly successful writer with much need of a career boost. He lives in Chicago. He has been friends with poets, crooks and gangsters, keeps himself fit by push-ups and playing racquetball, and is popular with the ladies. Up to a point. He once was wealthy, now he battles his ex wife for the dwindling funds, and his current playmate shows shaky loyalty. His friends give him trouble. He has esoteric inclinations (dabbling in anthroposophical gibberish), but is not outright nuts. As an everyday philosopher, he tends to platitudes. Bellow is quoted somewhere as having called this novel a comedy about death.The story spans several decades, from the 1930s, when young Charlie first meets famed poet Humboldt Fleisher, to the 70s.It was the first Bellow novel that I ever read, when it was new. Now I revisited it after 40 years and still enjoyed it. It is for sure the most entertaining among those of his books that I know.Charlie is a talented, but weak and vain man. His purpose in life is making an impression. He even feels the need to apologize to us readers for his choice of Chicago over New York, as city of residence. The place has no culture, but one can't say it is stupid. Just not intellectual.Humboldt Fleisher had been a famous poet, then a failing poet and a social wreck. He had been Charlie's friend and mentor, then his enemy. When he died he left Charlie a 'gift'. Charlie finds it only years later. Will it turn out to provide the needed booster opportunity?The novel has structural similarities with Herzog, but has a different, more satirical  tone. Charlie is a much more ridiculous character than Herzog. If he is a partial selfie of the author, one must admit that Bellow had a good sense of humor and didn't take himself too seriously.One of Bellow's main strengths in his big novels (Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, but not in Augie March) is the ease of his narrative juggling of story threads and time  levels. Charlie will tell us what he remembers, jumping from this to that. While waiting in divorce court for his turn, or while sitting in the car of his mob 'friend' on a wild goose chase through Chicago, he will follow his random thoughts. This is all nicely and amusingly woven together. Such ease must be the product of hard work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QUFJSJ6GSDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143105477#wasThisHelpful","R27QUFJSJ6GSDN","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an admirer of Ted's superb obscenity, I couldn't stay away from McFarlane's next thing. I was not disappointed, despite a certain portion of true schmaltz, which may have been nearly unavoidable. Somehow, the minor sentimentality between Theron's and McFarlane's characters seemed needed to tie up the end. Well, strictly speaking, not really, but happy ends grow on us with age.The hero is a cowardly nerd in a Wild West environment. The heroine is the oppressed wife of a gunslinger. The process of linking up the couple is plastered with vulgarity, obscenity, incorrectness, and fake violence, to your heart's delight.While the film could have been improved towards the wild side, it is entertaining enough for a dirty evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TIM4U62CSZI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9LY3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3TIM4U62CSZI7","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of Max Frisch's most successful works, a play about cowardice and appeasement in the face of violence and open threats. It was published and staged in the late 50s in Switzerland. It was generally understood as a parable on the rise of fascism.The play was standard high school fare at my time. I remember it as a Brechtian farce with an all too obvious message. The original title would translate literally as 'Biedermann and the Arsonists'.Biedermann, the less than heroic hero, is a wealthy home owner, whose house gets invaded by two farcical characters who spread an anticipation of violence and openly declare themselves as arsonists. Biedermann makes an ass of himself by trying to be friends with the goons.The name is a message in itself. The word 'bieder' has no full translation in English. It has connotations of 'proper, honest, simple, conventional'.The play is currently staged again in Frankfurt, where its German premiere happened over 50 years ago. I was curious if it can still tell us something. It is still in high school curricula, apparently. Much of the audience consisted of students.The production was properly modernized, the farcical aspects strengthened over the moralizing level. However, it left a bit of bad taste insofar as the message has become more ambiguous. It is not so clearly an anti fascist play, but can also be seen as a xenophobic rant against immigrants, including the political twist against political Islam, or as a social statement against 'the poor' in the way of Romney's failed presidential campaign. I guess these possible interpretations are implicit In the original text. Thus we have reason to be skeptical. The point becomes too mixed up to be useful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X96WF887KFAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809012480#wasThisHelpful","R1X96WF887KFAT","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philip Roth's satire on Tricky Dick suffers mainly from Roth's shyness. His depiction of El Presidente stayed so far behind the satirical potential and the actual performance of the real life hero, that it leaves us entirely cold today.What's funny about it? We are so used to the shenanigans of the Ku Klux Tea Klan, that we can't really laugh about Roth's polite fun at the expense of a relatively mildly criminal Republican president. After all, a serious war criminal and his buddies have never been prosecuted for what they did thirty years later, and that's not funny at all.Don't bother with poking fun at Nixon. Monty Python would have done it better, by being more out of this world. Roth is lacking in hyperbole.

"This book has so far not been published in English, so you need to read German.It is the 2012 winner of the German Buchpreis, and it is a fictionalized 'real life novel'. One of its strengths lies in its reconstruction of living conditions in post war Germany. Another strength is the plausibility of ambiguities and senseless guilt in the relations between family members. Another one the chapter on refugee life.The hero had lost his position as a judge after the ascent of the Nazis. He emigrated to  Cuba, leaving his goy wife and two children behind in Europe. His citizenship was cancelled. Both kids had been sent to England to save them from worse fates. The wife stayed behind in Germany, for lack of alternative. Refusing to divorce her Jewish husband, she lost the chance for work on her competence level.Early post war times find the wife in clerical work near Lake Constance, both kids still in England and unwilling to return, and the ex judge a returner from exile, without citizenship.He manages to become reinstated as a citizen, and he lands a court position in bombed out Mainz, capital of the newly formed 'Land' Rheinland Pfalz.Living conditions are harsh, and reuniting the family is an elusive dream.He finds that the 'locals' think he had been leading a plush life while in Cuban exile. No war? No political persecution? No jail time? Just eternal sunshine?The returner fails to re-integrate. The family, once broken, can't be put together again, not by all the king's men. The new career frustrates.He rebels against injustices. Much good it does him.The book has been criticized for many 'flaws', such as being too cold, not emotional enough, too documentary. All baloney. I am wondering if the negative reviews, that you find in the German amazon page, are not inspired by neo nazis. Hardly written by them. They are not likely to read at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6CI362OIUXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3990270249#wasThisHelpful","R3O6CI362OIUXY","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why visit Lagos? Maybe there are a million untold stories, but the writer finds it impossible to hear himself think. The noise. The exhaustion.The author is a Nigerian medical doctor, training for shrinkdom in New York.His narrator is seemingly the same man, but there is a trap. We are tricked into believing that this is a travel book. It is, but it is also fiction. Or is it? Hard to say.Narrator travels to Nigeria for the first time since 15 years. We are not immediately told why he makes the trip. We assume curiosity mixed with nostalgia. In fact, we are never given one specific reason, we are left conjecturing.The dominating theme in the first chapters is money and lubrication. We see petty corruption: by diplomats in the Nigerian Consulate in New York, by officials in Lagos airport, by cops and toll booth operators on Lagos streets....the border lines between asking for bribes, or for ransom money, or for tips, or 'simply' begging are hazy. And then the Nigerian  specialty: advance fee fraud, the profession of the yahoo yahoos, a very special class of yuppis.Another dominating theme is violence: armed robberies, muggings, lynchings, road rage, accidents, the permanent noise.... The book is surely not a candidate for Lagos tourism promotion awards.And: lost relationships. Can they be recovered? Should they?We are told in lean, efficient language, how the hero gradually adjusts his memories and perceptions to the new realities. One always needs time to see what is in front of us, rather than what is in our head. A broadening of the concept of optical illusions.Reflections on writing are a part of the journey. Ondaatje, Vikram Seth, GarcÃ­a Marquez are named as potential role models, but Cole is no imitator.I feel that I am a little too generous with five stars, but what the heck. That's what stars are for. I should deduct a star for the slightly devious marketing, which offered this as a new book by the author of Open City, a great New York novel. This Thief is actually an older work, re-published with new photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVLTLPTM2XZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIN2IUY#wasThisHelpful","R3VVLTLPTM2XZ4","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wonderful book on the history of a family, using a glass vitrine, or a suitcase full of tiny artifacts as road map through Europe and Japan.The author inherited those Japanese miniatures from a great uncle, and starts digging into the past of his family, in order to trace the objects.He is a ceramic artist, which explains his tactile way of seeing and describing things. His family is the Ephrussi clan, Jews from Odessa, who started their empire as grain merchants and expanded into Europe and banking.One of the ancestors, a dandy called Charles, began collecting Japanese trinkets when that became a fad in Paris during the 1870s. We move in the world of the flaneurs, of Proust (think of Swann!), the Goncourts, of the Impressionists...The end of the 19th century is heavy on anti-semitism. The Ephrussis are among the targets of attacks during the Dreyfus Scandal.Charles' Japanese collection moves to Vienna, as a wedding gift for the author's great grandfather. The author follows, a century later, on the trail. Vienna overwhelms him. He finds references to his relatives in Josef Roth's work.WW1 sees the dispersed family on both sides of the confrontation.Vienna becomes poor during the war. The empire dies. The Jews find they were the only unconditional Austrians. Austrian defeat is followed by republican mayhem. The Ephrussis have lost big chunks of their wealth.Things go from bad to worse in the 30s. The Anschluss. Expropriation and exile, or worse. A heartbreaking chapter. The trinkets, miraculously, are not lost, but on a larger scale, restitution of lost fortunes is a lost cause. (The Gurlitt case is pertinent, but this is not just about art.)The trinkets join the great uncle on his way to Japan, on a job assignment. We learn about post war Tokyo...This is not for speed readers. Speed would stuff you with information, but lose the flaneurship for you, which is part of the book's charm.If you are familiar with the historical background, the book adds personal color. If you can learn some history from the book, it will be a good, if emotional way to fill gaps.You can see the hare and many of the other 200 tiny things on the author's Web page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68OVQ7E6UKL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R0LC3O#wasThisHelpful","R68OVQ7E6UKL6","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To some people, experience seemed wealth. He never wanted such riches.Mr.Sammler is a cultured, civilized, preoccupied septuagenarian in New York in the 1960s. A Polish Jew, who spent much of his formative time in England. He remembers a friendship with and interest in H.G.Wells, the super-productive optimist. That's an intellectual mismatch.He survived the Holocaust with his daughter; his wife did not. He lives in Manhattan, supported by a wealthy nephew, and has learned to live his life in many new ways. Much of the change comes from reduced circumstances. His daughter might well be crazy. Most of his other relatives are crazy too, one way or the other. Sammler is the lone sane man on his planet. Much of the novel is about family madness and everybody else' s madness.Sammler is familiar with many explanations of things, and is tired with most of them. He is worried about evil. Hannah Arendt's book about the banality of evil is not right, he thinks. Evil is not banal, that was just a trick by the nazis, trying to lead human judgment astray. Man knows evil by nature, thinks Sammler.He has seen the world collapse once. Will it happen again? Sammler is a natural conservative by the instinct of self preservation. Had I met him then, I might have considered him a reactionary. No such thoughts crop up now. I must have aged.The students, whom he meets through his few remaining outside activities, don't inspire confidence. They don't understand him, he doesn't understand them. He experiences the trauma of rejection by the young generation.Some reviewers think that the novel has not aged well. I hadn't read it when it came out. As a newcomer to it, I don't see that as its problem. I see other problems. This is too much of a 'novel of ideas', even for Bellow standard.The problems of the sixties are not entirely similar to our current ones. However, this novel doesn't, in my view, depend on the immediate present tense of its issues.  We can safely assume that our current days are insane enough to serve for substitute. Just differently insane.What I find less than perfect is the focus on the idiocies of the people around Sammler, rather than his problems with time and place. The proportions are not quite right. There is more Dostojevskian idiocy here than I needed.Of course that means that I criticize the book for being different from my expectations. That's a little idiotic itself, and I apologize to Mr. Bellow.I 'like' the novel well enough for 4 stars, but I don't think it will be read in 100 years. It might well be totally incomprehensible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170Y29AOY3GS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142437832#wasThisHelpful","R170Y29AOY3GS8","A3NH7PYU4AD5GA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An essential classic in stage literature... But for all its lasting relevance, the play is in large parts unbearably dated. You have to wade through the 'doll house' phase with endless patience. The kitsch is heaped on mile high... As we know from later, this build-up was needed to prepare us for the epiphany and the show-down.Nora is the good wifey with the secret. The daft hubby knows nothing about her and betrays/ deserts her when the going gets tough. She will not forgive his lapse and leaves him and her 3 children, because she cannot live with a stranger.The play was a scandal in the late 19th century. How can a woman desert her family?It is social history and stage history now. Can it still tell us something?I attended a new stage performance in Frankfurt yesterday. It had premiered in May and got rave reviews in the press. When I watched, the house was packed.For half the show, I hated it. It made fun of the play. The actors were fooling around and made their roles seem parodies. It became serious only towards the crisis. I got the point.

"'Lacking flamboyance, cursed with reserve, I chose fiction.'Patrick White's self-portrait (rather than memoir) was first published in 1981. He is still the only Australian literature Nobelist. (Coetzee doesn't count as an Australian Nobelist, he converted after the award.)White was an outstanding wordsmith, who rarely mis-stepped and is mostly free of platitudes and cheap turns. Mostly, which means: not always. The Greek travel segments of this book have some odd and sinister hints at Slavs; that must refer to looming international conflicts with northern neighbors.The man and his country had no easy relationship. White was an outsider. In his words: he was posing as a member of his own family. Writing was not an honored male profession.His memoirs are no standard delivery either. More association game than chronological discipline. Very harsh with his own self, even his childish self. No love invested on mother, and little on father. The man could be unpleasant. A writer's mission does not involve being a nice person.The man grew up between England and Oz, with some romancing La France. In between he had a few years of infatuation with romantic Germany in the 30s, but the Hitlery drove him off.He doesn't glorify his pre-war years as a struggling writer, nor his North African/'Near Eastern' war experience in 'intelligence'. He doesn't hide his sexual inclination, but he doesn't dwell on it very much either.The center of the tale is PW's relationship with his life long partner, a Greek whom he met during the war. He became a Helenophile. When they decide to stay together, and do this in Australia, they take on a heavy load of social complications. But even those are not spelled out in detail.White mostly stayed away from firm and lengthy convictions of the political or religious kind. Good for him, and also for us. He doesn't preach.The text is a Sammelsurium of narrative stretches, including travel reports, and of aphoristic pieces. He does much name dropping, mostly of little known names. The text is compact and needs slow reading. It doesn't succumb to speed. 260 pages that feel much longer, without being slow or boring. Just compact.Did he show up in Stockholm to collect his award?

"This French film is set in South Africa. All actors seem to be from there, except the two stars: Forest Whitaker in a brilliant role as police captain with a victim past, and Orlando Bloom in an unusually adult role of a womanizing and boozing police lieutenant. The film was shown at last year's Cannes festival, but it had escaped my notice.It is immensely dark and brutal, quite shocking even for a hardened thriller fan. The subject is drugs, of a new, experimental kind. The new molecule blocks inhibitions to violence. Overdoses may lead to unbelievable aggression, possibly suicidal aggression. The lab that developed the product needed test persons... Enough said.The film has similarities to the Latino cartel genre, like Oliver Stone's (Savages) or Ridley Scott's (The Counselor) versions from recent years, but transferred to the rainbow country, under its special social conditions.

"Another dark veteran story, partly reminiscent of the Deer Hunter, the 70s epos about the Vietnam War with Walken, de Niro and Streep.This one is about a later war. Casey Affleck is the ruined Iraq returner who can't find his way back into normal life. Normal life isn't normal anyway. His family background is blue collar, steel factories in Pennsylvania. There is unemployment. The outlook is miserable. The young man gambles and runs into debt. He wants to pull himself out of his deep ditch and becomes a fist fighter for money. This leads him into deadly dealings with an evil rural gangster, played by Woody Harrelson.The hero of the story is Christian Bale's character, the selfless brother, who tries his hardest to keep the young man solid. He fails and goes for revenge. We find ourselves in an industrial kind of Western, with a shoot out in a steel yard railway system.The film has strong scenes and a wonderful cast, but something is lacking. The plot is a little too predictable. Bale's character is a little too heroic and selfless. Harrelson is a little too disgusting and bad. All in all you could do worse than spend the time for this film, but there is more 'like' than 'love' here.Bale is impressive. This film was shot at about the same time as American Hustle, where Bale is a fat greasy con man. Here he is a skinny gritty working class hero.

"Disorderly conduct and feelings of shame. To break the law, all you have to do is go ahead and just break it. That's what Alex Portnoy found out on the day when he ate his first lobster, at age 15. After that transgression, he might just as well proceed to worse deeds. The same night he masturbated on a public bus, while a sleeping girl was sitting next to him.Freud would surely have loved Roth's ode to and persiflage of the Oedipus Complex. As did I, when I first read it, decades ago. Does it still work now at second reading, decades later? Not entirely. It has fallen out of time a little.And one more thing: I had forgotten the last chapter, which I find unfunny and repulsive. No spoilers here though.Alex Portnoy, the narrator, grows up in a Jewish petit bourgeois family in Jersey. Dad works for a Boston based goy company. Mom rules the small family of 4, which includes Alex' big sister. Dad is a little goofy, while mom, with her mothering, is too good for her own good. She is bossy, anxious, protective and adoring. Her little boy is everything to her.Racism is a part of life, both ways. Anti-Semitism is taken for granted, and repaid by anti-goyism. Dad, as a Jew, can never be a boss in his goy company. He understands that. It doesn't keep the family from looking down on somebody. Choice falls on Dad's insurance customers from the lesser parts of towns. Or the cleaning woman, who isn't even considered a shikse, because she is black.The plot gives space to one of Alex's failed affairs, for dramatic purposes: a semi literate fashion model, who fulfills all his sexual fantasies, but is not socially fitting, neither to his Jewish sense of shame, nor to his intellectual pretensions  and political ambitions.Alex' main subject is himself, his rebellions, his masturbations, his obsession with the female organs. Writing this way about such sex addiction is no longer sensational. It can be a big yawn now. The narration is a monologue, addressed to a shrink. Adult Alex is a young star in the political establishment of New York. That type is still around today, we know their names. Alex didn't have the benefit of smart phones and social media.Though the book hasn't aged so well, due to the fact that its provocations have become common place, it is still a sharp portrait of some segments of society at its time.

From English to Plain I think we have all thought about that at one time or another but it seems so hard to give up so much.

"The Bible study in itself is different. It is not a traditional hold your Bible and study the Scripture. The study did quote the story of the prodigal son, However, it did not give you the book of the Bible they were quoting. The prodigal son story is quoted and briefly explained throughout the five week study. There were other scriptures paraphrased but again no books of the Bible, chapter, or verse was mentioned. The only reason I knew it was Bible scripture is because I knew what they were quoting.There are testimonials  from different people in each of the five week study . They talk about how they were living before they came to know Christ. There are other stories  where they share about different things that happen to them and God guiding their way. I would call this Bible study more of a testimonials than a study. With that said I believe it would  help someone you are witnessing to guide them to Jesus or a new convert may find this encouraging. The stories told start out with how bad they were living before Christ and many people need to hear God forgives all people from all walks of life no matter how bad you are.I gave this  Bible study 3 stars for Bible study and 4 stars for testimonies.I was given a copy of this DVD by the publisher for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3CALWIEJZ8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601426755#wasThisHelpful","R3S3CALWIEJZ8Y","A3IPSTD7R03WQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IPSTD7R03WQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She made each lesson fun.Joanna has the scripture in the study guide and it comes across the screen as well but I had my Bible with me and used it also.It is not hard to follow along with, the lessons are about 15 minutes and the homework takes about that long as well. It is so worth the 30 minutes it takes for each lesson you really learn a lot in that short time.Each week there is a verse to memorize and it goes with the next weeks lesson.There is plenty of room to take notes in the study guide as well.I gave this Bible study 4 stars and I HIGHLY recommend it, do it in a small group or just with your best friend.I was given a copy of this study by the publisher for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5LLC2LH7P6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307731634#wasThisHelpful","R1D5LLC2LH7P6K","A3IPSTD7R03WQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IPSTD7R03WQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an achingly beautiful film about an extraordinary artist. I felt completely drawn into the time and place: NYC in the late 70s and on into the 80s when Basquiat was producing his work. I only recently discovered this artist--I don't know how I missed him!!--, and being a huge fan of abstract expressionism, I was instantly drawn to his art. One commentator in the film puts it very well: Basquiat challeneged us to analyse our culture anew through his brilliant and intuitive combination of elements, his use of language and his originality.What most impressed me was Basquiat's authenticity: it seemed impossible for him to put on different social faces. He was sincerely himself at all times--wide open, vulnerable, honest, angelic. I cried at the end of the film because he wasn't able to survive the terrible twenties (he died at age 27) and for all the extraordinary beauty that he created.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIDTYBFAHSHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056QMBX2#wasThisHelpful","R1MIDTYBFAHSHW","A3GKD8MAHURH91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GKD8MAHURH91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Those who take a statin (Lipitor, Crestor and the rest of the statin family,) should know by now that many leading health care experts, physicians and clinical researchers recommend considering supplementation with CoQ10. This is because all statins effect, reduce and compromise the levels of CoQ10 produced by our bodies. CoQ10 is a fat-soluble antioxidant produced naturally and concentrated in the liver, kidneys and heart. As we age, however, levels of this important compound decline significantly.  If you smoke, you are also bound to have even lower levels of this important antioxidant. Therefore, sustaining adequate levels of CoQ10 becomes particularly significant for those who remain on statin medication, are diabetic, pre-diabetic (T2D), have Parkinson's disease or for those who have chronic neuropathy or cardiac pathology.Our typical processed Western American diet generally furnishes only about 10mg of CoQ10 daily so supplementation is usually necessary to reach more optimum levels (Andrew Weil, MD, NP).  Those under 30 may benefit from the less expensive form of CoQ10 (Ubiquinone) while those over 40 should consider this more bio-available and expensive ""reduced"" form of CoQ10 (Ubiquinol).There are two distinct forms of CoQ10:1. Ubiquinone (USP): This is the less expensive and more marketed oxidized or non-reduced form of this antioxidant. (Usually labeled as ""CoQ10"").2. Ubiquinol: This is the more expensive reduced form of CoQ10 claiming higher absorption and bio-availability. This product is UBIQUINOL.It is interesting to note that your body actually converts each form of CoQ10 into the other (Mayo Clinic).  However, some healthcare practitioners, and without question the supplement industry, claim that ubiquinol (expensive form) is more efficient since it has greater antioxidant efficiency, particularly for folks over age 40.  The choice is yours to make in consultation with your healthcare practitioner/physician.PROS1. This product delivers ubiquinol-the oxidized, bio-available and un-reduced form of Co-enzyme Q10.2. Product is GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified.3. Dairy, gluten, GMO-free per manufacturer's product label.4. Clear Date and Lot # stamped on side of product label.5. Excellent, competitive price points for this supplement (100 MG 60 capsules@ $22.67 on Amazon 11.10.2015)CONCERNS:1. Relatively large softgels make this uncomfortable for many folks to swallow as part of a daily regimen. (See Photos).2. Greater labeling transparency necessary for Doctor's Best supplements in my opinion. Doctor's Best outsources manufacture  of their supplements to a 3rd party facility as many other brands do. DB simply markets and distributes their products.  Without a clear sourcing statement, it is difficult to determine where the final product is formulated, encapsulated and finished.3. No desiccants supplied in Doctorâs best supplements to help displace moisture.4. Not Vegan or Kosher-Gelatin Capsules.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. With the above-referenced concerns, this is a good product appropriate for those over 40. Check prices and stay with a reputable  manufacturer  that is c-GMP and NSF compliant.2.  Always consult your health care practitioner before taking this or any supplement for potential adverse interactions with existing Rx meds  you may be taking. Be certain that you have been counseled on all of the potential interactions between Ubiquinol and other  prescription medications. Cancer meds (chemotherapy), warfarin (Coumadin) and high blood pressure (anti-hypertensive) medications can  interact unfavorably with ubiquinol and CoQ10 supplementation.3. If you fall into one of the affected risk groups above for low CoQ10, I recommend you consider a Coenzyme Q10 Reduced & Total Plasma  blood test. This is usually an 8 hour fasting blood test performed by your healthcare practitioner. Your lab results should be a reliable and  valid barometer whether or not you could benefit from supplementation and at what targeted clinically-therapeutic dosage level.  Here are the reference values for this test: (Mayo Clinic)CoQ10 REDUCED:<18 years: 320-1,376 mcg/L> or =18 years: 415-1,480 mcg/LTOTAL CoQ10:<18 years: 320-1,558 mcg/L> or =18 years: 433-1,532 mcg/L% REDUCED CoQ10:<18 years: 93-100%> or =18 years: 92-98%4. If the product label says CoQ10 it is NOT Ubiquinol. Even if it says ""High Absorption CoQ10"", it is NOT Ubiquinol, but standard CoQ10 with ablack pepper extract to help increase its assimilation and absorption. You will pay more than twice the average cost for Ubiquinol but for some, it may be well worth the investment in your health.  You can always identify Ubiquinol by the words ""Kaneka QH"" on the product label. It is made exclusively in Japan by Kaneka  and supplied to other manufacturers who then market their products to consumers, like DB, Jarrow, etc.To Your Good Health My Friends!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZWN01M8WR56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CBXR46#wasThisHelpful","R2YZWN01M8WR56","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have recently purchased a new frig as we have, you will no doubt appreciate many of the new ""bells and whistles"" engineered into today's sophisticated appliances.  To me however, this snap-in activated charcoal air filter is something that should have been designed into these units decades ago. It essentially eliminates the need for auxiliary boxes of baking soda in order to address and neutralize offensive odors from food.Here's what you need to know to be a consumer-savvy smart shopper:PROS:1. Genuine OEM air filter compatible with many Whirpool, Maytag, Amana and Jenn-Air refrigerators. (Check your owner's manual to insure  you are purchasing the correct part number for these filters.2. Extremely easy snap-in installation.3. Filter media impregnated with activated carbon (charcoal).4. Designed to be replaced at 6 month intervals per your appliance manufacturer.5. Supplied with a separate triangular plastic replacement indicator  (""Time Strip"") as a visual reminder when to replace. (See Photos).CONCERNS:1. Cost: Pricey when you factor in the long-term costs of replacement. Depending on your particular model, many refrigerators are designed  with multiple ""peripherals"", requiring replacement at given time intervals-water filters, multiple air filters, etc.  If you have a unit with many  ""bells and whistles"", be prepared to shell out hundreds of dollars over the life of the unit for these ""accessories"".  Think of it like getting  a subsidized computer printer for a great price initially, and then getting screwed on the price of the printer cartridges-sound familiar??2. These filters are not manufactured by Whirpool Corporation but FOR Whirpool, USA by Kemflo International (Taiwan).  My educated guess is that they cost about 0.35 cents each to produce-you can do the math to quickly determine how much profit is generated  on the sale of these filters, even at the ""discounted"" price of $7 per filter.  Here's an interesting  link to a major supplier of Kemflo filters: http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Whirlpool-W10311524-AIR1-Refrigerator-Air-Filter_60345399930/showimage.html3.

I simply inserted the strip into a crevice on the top of my refrigerator ceiling. They are easy to lose without a secure installation.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. A necessary and convenient maintenance item for virtually every refrigerator.  Highly recommended.  Purchase in volume rather than for one filter.  Shop wisely-there are many vendors online offering these exact filters at less than half the  MSRP compared to ordering these filters directly from Whirpool.  You should be able to purchase a set of three of these filters for about  $20.2. Periodically check the filter(s) at 3 month intervals. You may find that you can go 6-9 months or longer depending upon the length of time  and frequency that your compressor runs. If your filter begins to develop mold, wash or replace the filter immediately.3. BEFORE you purchase any appliance, factor-in the annual cost of all of these ""maintenance accessories"".

"Vitamin B-12 is a  water-soluble vitamin necessary for red blood cell formation, nervous system functioning and DNA synthesis. Unfortunately, plants do not produce B12 so we must obtain it from animal sources in our food or produce it synthetically through supplementation.  If like me, you are over 50 and take acid-suppressing meds, your risk for some degree of B12 malabsorption is significant.Because it is water-soluble, B12 has a relatively low toxicity potential as excess B12 is simply excreted in our urine. However, our ability to efficiently and effectively absorb B12 steadily decreases with age. While most B vitamins are readily absorbed,  B12, has more complicated requirements for absorption. As a result, optimal intake of vitamin B12 can sometimes be a challenge for many of us.  Even though U.S. adults average well above the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for B12, (2.4 mcg/day), there are still subgroups that are more commonly at risk of B12 deficiency.  These risk factors include: Long-term regular use of PPIâs (proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole and other acid-suppressing meds), depression, alcohol, pernicious anemia, diabetes drugs (metformin and others), Crohnâs disease, IBS, celiac disease, atrophic gastritis, ulcerative colitis, âleaky-gutâ syndrome, asthma, macular degeneration, MS, shingles, Alzheimer's, migraines, tinnitus, kidney disease, folate deficiency, pregnancy and lactation, H-Pylori, insufficient protein-digesting enzymes (usually as a result of aging) and adhering to a strict vegan diet.The only valid and reliable method for determining whether you indeed may have a B12 deficiency, is to have a B-12 blood plasma test.Here are the Blood Serum Reference Ranges to help you determine if you have clinical B-12 deficiency:Blood plasma reference range for B-12: 180-914 ng/L. (nano grams per liter of blood)< 180 ng/L: May cause anemia and/or peripheral neuropathies<150 ng/L:  Evidence of B12 deficiency150-400 ng/L: Borderline determination requiring a plasma homocysteine test as a follow-up screen.>400 ng/L: ânormalâ-not requiring further testing.If your results are in a ""normal"" range and you are not in any of these risk subgroups, I suggest simply modifying your diet to includesome or all of the following B-12 rich foods: sardines, salmon, tuna, cod, lamb, beef liver, scallops, shrimp, yogurt, cow's milk and eggs.If not, Vitamin Code Raw B-12 is an excellent supplement for the following reasons:PROS:1. This supplement contains a form of B-12 (methylcobalamin) more bio-available and absorbable in our systems compared to cyanocobalamin which requires a two-step process for conversion in order to be readily used by our bodies. Keep in mind however, that BOTH of these B12 forms are synthetically produced rather than naturally synthesized like cobalamin.2. Product is Vegan, non-GMO and gluten-free.3. Produced in NSF & cGMP-compliant manufacturing facilities.4. Medium-sized, easy to swallow capsules (Please see my size photos for comparison).5. Contains a desiccant in the bottle to help displace moisture.6. Bottle is tinted and protected from light penetration.CONCERNS:1. Bottle size of 30 capsules not practical for those on daily regimens. A 60 or 90 day supply would be preferable.2. Garden of Life outsources manufacture of their supplements to a 3rd party facility as many other brands do.  GOL simply markets and distributes their products as indicated on their product.. This is a very common practice.  These third-party facilities usually manufacture supplements for multiple product labels and their identity is proprietary  and not subject to disclosure.  I do not like this practice because it impedes full transparency.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. If you cannot maintain a well-balanced diet rich in B12 sourced ideally from foods, this is an excellent second choice. GOL supplements remain time-tested for brand integrity, quality and reputation.  GOL also has a comprehensive customer support network with specialists available to address product-related issues with accuracy and promptness. Check Consumerâs Digest, Checkbook or Consumer Reports that offer and perform unbiased research and product ratings and assessments on many of these OTC supplements for further ratings. These organizations do their own independent testing without accepting advertisements, kickbacks or compensation from manufacturers for posting favorable reviews.2. Like any supplement or medication, it is wise to first seek medical guidance from your licensed healthcare practitioner BEFORE purchasing any of these supplements based solely on any anecdotal accounts of these working for others. Each of us has different body chemistry and different medical histories and the potential for adverse interactions occurring between your Rx profile and many OTC supplements can be critical.3. Unless you have clinically-demonstrated B-12 deficiency (per blood lab test results reported above), you should always be cautious in purchasing this or any supplement without first discussing this with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner. My preference is to heed thewisdom of our grandparents and try to obtain all of these vitamins and nutrients through a well-balanced diet of naturally-rich sources of B-12.Wishing you all good health my friends!________________________________________","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BFOFH1EILMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00280M12K#wasThisHelpful","R28BFOFH1EILMJ","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have struggled for decades with GI issues, from poor digestion to GERD to IBS.  After embracing all that mainstream medicine has to offer-endoscopy, colonoscopy, proton-pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid, and a constellation of other questionable prescription meds, all with very unpleasant side effects, I decided to re-assess and reformulate my game plan for resurrecting my health.  This included avoiding the foods that trigger my GI symptoms, slowly tiering off of acid-suppressing meds, and taking daily enzymes to help with the digestion of my food.  I assure you, this was NOT an easy task and it took several unsuccessful and painful attempts to discover through trial and error, what guided me to freedom.As we age, our bodies become less efficient and effective at processing nutrients we eat, whether they be fats, proteins, sugars or carbohydrates.In fact, enzymes are responsible for virtually every single chemical reaction that occurs in our bodies. These reactions allow our cells to break down molecules quickly. Without enzymes, vitamins, minerals and hormones cannot function.Digestive enzymes assist in maintaining and sustaining gastrointestinal health.  They are the key substances of the digestive process, working to break down our food for proper absorption. The four primary digestive enzymes are:â¢  Lipase:  Assists in digesting and assimilating fats.â¢  Protease/Peptidase:  Assists in digesting and processing proteins.â¢  Amylase:  Assists in processing carbohydrates or starch.â¢  Cellulase: Assists in  converting cellulose molecules into simple sugars (glucose).Our Western diet of overly processed foods, often devoid of essential nutrients exacerbates the situation worse.  This is because processed foods often do not contain the digestive enzymes required for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients.Enzyme-deficient foods essentially force your body to obtain enzymes from other parts of the body, just to digest, rather than utilizing the enzymes from the food itself to do the job, the way nature intended.  This can also create inflammatory conditions leading to illness.If you are among the millions of us who regularly take GI medications ( antacids, H2-recptor antagonists, PPI's) to address GERD or otherinflammatory gut conditions, you need to pay particular attention to the importance for considering supplementing with wide-spectrum enzymes.These conditions compromise a healthy gut microbiome and can often be helped by such supplements.  This is one of many excellentenzyme supplements to consider for the following reasons:ADVANTAGES:1. A wide-spectrum enzyme supplement consisting of 18 different plant-based enzymes.2. Contains aspergillopepsin to support and enhance gluten digestion.3. ""Inactive"" ingredients contain no controversial substances-no stearates, dioxides, polysorbates.4.  Dosage is only 1-2 capsules at beginning of meals depending on individual needs.5. Made in USA in cGMP-Compliant manufacturing facility.6. Clear, transparent Date of Manufacture and Expiration Date printed on bottle.CONCERNS:1. No statement of non-GMO on product bottle.2. No desiccant included in bottle to help displace moisture  Bottle label: Could benefit from improved graphics and a more user-friendly redesign to increase readability, particularly ingredients list.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  An excellent wide-spectrum enzyme supplement helpful for proper and complete digestion of most foods.2.  Comparing many different enzyme supplements can be a challenge because many use ""proprietary"" formulations which do not require  full transparency, making accurate apple-to-apple product comparisons difficult and frustrating. In addition, not all manufacturers utilize the  same metrics (units of measurement) for each enzyme. This forces you to both interpret and decipher the metric and then do the math.  So, look specifically for top-rated products which identify and list each individual enzyme along with their respective amounts as you  do your product comparisons.3.  Since each of us have different needs, I would trial 3-5 of the top-rated brands and determine which works best for you.  Dr. Tobias is one of my new favorites along with DigestWise, Pure Encapsulations and Garden of Life Raw Enzymes (pricey).

"Middle-age can be a challenging time for our bodies-especially for the lower back. After numerous back injuries and persistent lumbarradiculopathy, I became a candidate for a firm orthopedic seat cushion which would maintain its resilience and integrity, offer solid support and reduce pressure on my spine.  I looked for one for the home/office and one for the car. The Liliyo Coccyx Orthopedic Foam Seat ComfortCushion (""Ultimate 3-in-1 Bundle"") was worth a 3 week test drive and here is my product assessment based on my individual needs and response:ADVANTAGES:1. Extremely comfortable seating cushion ideal for folks with small to medium body frames (not exceeding 200 lbs.).2. Well-designed and engineered to relieve symptoms from tailbone (coccyx) pain, sciatica, sacrum and other lower lumbar-related discomfort.3. Manufacturer-warranted 6 month ""no hassle"" replacement/refund. Outstanding for a product of this type.4. Exceptionally responsive, pleasant and professional customer service.  Extremely customer-centric.5. Supplied with 3 removable machine-washable zippered velour seat covers (Black, Midnight Blue and Gray)6. Cushion is sealed in a white, non-allergenic cotton fabric.7. Zipper extends the entire width of cushion making replacing cushion covers convenient.8. Excellent, reasonable price point for this product in comparison to many other competing orthopedic cushions.CONCERNS:1. I personally found this particular cushion somewhat too soft for my personal preference. Too much compression and insufficient  cushion density for my needs as a 180 lb. male.2. Too soft for support as a car cushion. After reaching out to the seller, however, I was provided with a much firmer version of this cushion  (significantly more dense) for comparison to the one delivered on Amazon.  Both my wife and I trialed both of these cushions for three  weeks. Our results were identical: The firmer version of this cushion was a better choice for a car cushion, providing both proper  support and comfort most likely due to the different seating platforms and infrastructure in vehicles.3. I would not recommended either of these cushions for sharply-contoured (raised or curved) seating surfaces because they alter the  design of the cushion and compromise the integrity of the cushion's ability to address your discomfort.4. No anti-slip cushion bottom to prevent cushion migration from normal daily use.5. ""High-density Rebound Foam"": Like ""memory foam"", the term ""rebound foam"" casts a wide net in the foam arena and is somewhat vague  and generic. The truth is that there many grades and types each based upon a measure of its firmness (The ILD or ""Indentation Load  Deflection Rating) and Density (which generally ranges from 1 lb. per cubic ft. up to 8 lb. per cubic ft.).  I would like to see ALL  ""orthopedic"" cushion and appliance manufacturers supplying both the density grade and ILD rating in addition to type of foam(s) on the  product label in order to become more transparent to consumers. This should be able to be achieved without jeopardizing the  proprietary design or nature of their products while providing consumers with clear, unambiguous metrics for evaluating and assessing  a product of this nature prior to purchase.6. No disclosure for country of manufacture: This can be a critical factor for foams sourced from China and other areas of the globe  whose industry, quality control and health standards are generally not as rigorous as ours in the US.  For example, foams from China  have been known to contain toxic VOC's (volatile organic compounds) such as formaldehyde and PBDE. Experience generally  suggests that a product without any statement of origin usually suggests China or other pacific-rim countries.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  A good choice for small to medium-framed individuals (not exceeding 200 lbs.) for temporary relief from lower lumbar-related discomfort.2.  If you prefer a softer-density foam cushion, this may be a good choice for you.3.  For use as a driver's-side car cushion, I recommend considering the FIRMER version of this product (not currently available for sale on  Amazon).  NOTE: If you purchase the available softer version on Amazon and it does not suit your needs, I was informed by Liliyo that you may  request an exchange for the firmer version of this cushion by reaching out to Liliyo Customer Service through Amazon's ""contact seller"" link.4.  Remember that most of these cushions are designed for 180 degree (flat) seating surfaces. If you use this cushion as a car seat, it may not  perform as well as expected.  I do not recommend this product for use with bucket-type car seats or contoured (angled) seating surfaces.Disclosure: Received in consideration for an unbiased, honest product evaluation and assessment.To Your Good Health!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GN2M97Y60MYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0ZI1YW#wasThisHelpful","R3GN2M97Y60MYC","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, I embraced all of the benefits of using my favorite Glide Floss because nothing seemed to work as well for cleaning my tight, crowded teeth.  It is exceptionally strong and very easy to maneuver around dental work.  The mint flavor also added a nice closure to my daily dental regimen. Throughout all these years of use, I was convinced that I was flossing with the Rolls-Royce of dental floss. I never gave a second thought to the long-term safety of using a Teflon-based material until recently. Companies never mentioned it in their product marketing and promotional literature and my dentists never discussed potential cautions or concerns regarding its use.  Well, times have changed and we need to take responsibility for our own health and educate ourselves.  So....In comes the tide and out goes the Glide!ADVANTAGES:1. Highly Shred-Resistant.2. Fresh mint flavored and light wax coated (petroleum-based wax).3. Easy to access floss and dispense from holder.4. Slides easily in tight dental spaces for those with crowded teeth and challenging dental work.DISADVANTAGES:1. Potential Health Hazards:  Glide, is essentially made from a synthetic polymer called  PTFE. Polytetrafluorethylene floss (PTFE) is the same material used in high-tech Gore-Tex fabric and the same compound that causes frying pans not to stick. Oral-B's Glide Floss is PTFE.  Many consumer, health advocates and environmentalists recommend non-PTFE brands, given the use of Perfluorooctanoic acid, a possible carcinogen, in the making of Teflon (PTFE).  These perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs are not only suspected as carcinogenic, but can compromise your immune system and affect hormone levels because they are endocrine disruptors. The amount you absorb from one flossing most likely is negligible, but because PFCs remain in your system, they can accumulate in your tissues and present a long-term health hazard which is avoidable.  If youâre flossing once or twice a day, you should  consider a PFC-free dental floss. There are currently no federal regulations that manufacturers disclose the ingredients in floss so you will need to be vigilant and voice your concerns directly to the companies.2. Consider water-based appliances designed to clean and floss the gums and interdental areas. For example, Water-Pic, Panasonic  and Phillips all make some excellent flossers. My picks here are the WaterPic WP-440W or the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  For those on a budget who still prefer manual flosses, I like Organix South Neem Mint Dental Floss, Eco-Dent Natural Dental Care  Gentle Floss and Toms of Maine Spearmint Floss-all PFC/PTFE free. They are more expensive but the small price difference is well  worth it to me.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  Avoid PFC/PTFE-based dental flosses altogether.  Consider healthier alternatives available in the market cited above.  When in doubt,  contact the manufacturer directly.  Like the ""Made in the USA"" logo, these manufacturers are eager to boast about their ingredients and  will state this on the packages conspicuously. Remember, the ""devil is always in the details"".2.  Use water-assisted flossing appliances cited above and/or consider manual interdental flossing appliances such as GUM's ""Proxabrush""  Dental Cleaners.3.  Discuss your concerns with a trusted dentist or healthcare professional who does not have a fiduciary interest or relationship with Oral-B  which might pose a conflict of interest to the patient.To Your Good Health!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUIAEIAPDWIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00240UWGG#wasThisHelpful","R3GUIAEIAPDWIH","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Middle-age can be a challenging time for our bodies-especially for the lower back. After numerous back injuries and persistent lumbarradiculopathy, I became a candidate for a firm orthopedic seat cushion which would maintain its resilience and integrity, offer solid support and reduce pressure on my spine. The BackGuard Premium Lower back Pain Cushion was worth a 3 week test drive and here is my product assessment based on my individual needs and response:ADVANTAGES:1. Extremely comfortable for most folks with small and medium frame (not over 200 lbs).2. Removable zippered cushion cover is machine washable.3. Manufacturer-warranted for 90 days-No hassle returns within this return window.4. Assists in proper seating alignment of spine.5. Center cushion is breathable mesh to avoid retention of moisture/odor.6. Excellent, reasonable price point for the delivered product as is.7. Responsive, pleasant and professional customer service.DISADVANTAGES:1.  Not ideal for most auto use, particularly those with bucket or contoured seating surfaces.2.  Not designed for home use with sharply-contoured chair backs. Using it with these back surfaces may compromise the  comfort, usefulness and integrity the cushion was designed to address.3. The Achilles Heel"" of this product is the adjustable strap, which is vulnerable to tearing at the seam when stressed by  repeated on/off uses and/or seats/chairs with thick backs.  The strap is also positioned at the center of the cushion and may be  challenging to attach to some types of office chairs.  One strap limits the degree of tension to keep the cushion stable and in  place without migrating.4.  ""Proprietary Density Memory Foam"":  The term ""memory foam"" casts a very wide net indeed and seems to imply that there is  but one grade/type of memory foam.  The truth is that there many grades and types each based upon a measure of its firmness  (The IFD Rating) and Density (which generally ranges from 1 lb. per cubic ft. up to 8 lb. per cubic ft.).  I would like to see ALL  manufacturers supplying the grade and type of foam on the product itself in order to become more transparent to consumers.5. No disclosure for country of manufacture:  This can be a critical factor for foams sourced from China and other areas of the globe  whose industry, quality controls and health standards may not be as rigorous as ours in the US.  For example, foams from China  have been known to contain toxic VOC's (volatile organic compounds) such as formaldehyde and PBDE. Experience suggests that no  statement of origin usually suggests China or other pacific-rim countries.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  Extremely comfortable material and foam designed for small and medium-framed folks who desire auxiliary lumbar support.  With the exception of the above-cited concerns, definitely worth a try. I do not recommend this particular cushion for larger-framed  individuals over 200 lbs.2.  Strap redesign is necessary to strengthen the integrity of the strap material.  Manufacturer should consider using a clasp-type  mechanism for ease of use.  The two critical seam junctures where the strap joins the cushion back requires strengthening and reinforcing.  I would also like to suggest two straps (located top and bottom of cushion) to prevent the cushion from migrating.3.  Manufacturer might wish to consider designing a few different versions of this comfortable product tiered to small, medium and large body  frames each delivered with a different density of foam (low, medium and high density foam), similar to protocol of most mattress manufacturers.4.

"There are two variables to look for when purchasing a frig/freezer thermometer: temperature accuracy (performance) and design (engineering).My unit provided acceptable overall performance as measured by accuracy to within 2 degrees F but has some design limitations which make the unit inconvenient to mount or position prominently in many refrigerators or freezers not having wire shelf racks.All refrigerators should ideally be engineered with integral and accurate thermometers-one for the freezer and one for the frig. Unfortunately, unless you spend considerable $, you often have to ""pimp"" your appliance out by purchasing thermometers to insure your unit is maintaining safe freezing/refrigeration. I purchased this Rubbermaid ""Commercial"" FGR80DC thermometer along with a DayMark, IT115410 thermometer each with similar $5 price points, and then compared temperature readings of both units to one of the benchmark standard liquid scientific thermometers (The H-B instruments 5/2210 Durac organic liquid-in-glass total immersion thermometer) recommended by another reviewer colleague (Gene P. Louie) to provide a standard for comparing the performance of each.My findings revealed a 2 degree F variation (on the higher end) compared to the H-B standard for this Rubbermaid FGR80DC and a 1.5 degree F variation on the high end compared to the H-B standard for the Day Mark IT115410 Thermometer.PROS:1. Extremely well-manufactured for a $5 thermometer. Heavy-duty stainless steel case and bezel.2. Large, easy to read 2.25"" tempered, shatter-resistant glass dial resists condensation.3. Clear, unobstructed metrics and dial calibrations with red  HACCP ""safe"" range.4. NSF-rated5. Excellent price point given the quality of manufacture.CONS:1. May be challenging to properly mount or hang in many refrigerators and/or freezers with glass shelves. The integral hook is designed to hang  down from wire rack shelves but may not be visible or practical if you have the thermometer obstructed from view due to a full frig or freezer.  Some units do not have proper clearance to permit the thermometer to hang properly and may impede shelf storage.2. The integral stand is inconvenient and easy to knock over without securing the thermometer to the shelf surface with proper mounting  or Velcro tape (See photos). If your objective is to mount the thermometer on the back wall of the frig or freezer as mine was, you can  forget that too. The back of the thermometer is not designed for mounting, limiting its resourcefulness from a design perspective.3. Made in China. I suspect quality-control may not be as rigorous with these low-cost units and there appears to be some variation in  accuracy reported by some users. Bi-metallic thermometers utilize a coil spring as a temperature-sensing element and are considerably  less expensive than other types of thermometers (liquid-in-glass stem, liquid crystal, gas, electronic/digital, infrared, resistance).RECOMMENDATIONS:1. This may be a very good choice if you want a reasonably-accurate well-made bi-metallic budget thermometer for your frig/freezer.  Design limitations however, (which could be easily addressed), make this a 4.0 star product.  For accuracy in a dial-type bi-metallic thermometer, I recommend the Day Mark above for the same price point with a slightly larger  dial; however, the same design limitations apply for both units.2. I suggest using the stand and placing a piece of Velcro or other temperature-stable mounting tape to your frig/freezer shelf if you  are not able to hang the thermometer prominently on your wire refrigerator/freezer shelf.3. Always cross-verify temperature to a reasonable benchmark standard to assess accuracy over time. The relatively inexpensiveH-B Instruments 5/2210 or 5/0220 Durac organic liquid-in-glass total immersion thermometer should provide you with an excellentstandard to verify the accuracy of most dial-type thermometers.Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/Instrument-Organic-Immersion-Thermometer-Accuracy/dp/B00551NSFI/ref=sr_1_5?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1445106988&sr=1-5&keywords=h-b+thermometersTo Your Good Health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKE8SEBZLM1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KDEFNK#wasThisHelpful","R1RKE8SEBZLM1N","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are like me and have been struggling to gradually tier off long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole), in consultation with your gastroenterologist or healthcare practitioner, you are certainly not alone and there is much support for your struggles, frustration, discomfort and trials.PepZinGI is a patented molecule and the result of a proprietary chelation process developed in Japan. Japan, Mongolia and Korea lead the globe in the incidence of gastric-related cancers along with Asia, so there is much incentive there for research, education and development of new therapies to help address this concern. The compound consists of L-carnosine and zinc.  The manufacturers of PepZinGI (Hamari Pharmaceuticals) claim over 100 scientific studies and 38 clinical trials for PepZin GI; however, I found only 2 human clinical trials (http://www.humanclinicals.org/human-clinicals-p/#/pepzin-gi/).Most of the practice of medicine since Hippocrates remains, a process of trial and error. This is certainly true when it comes to choosing dietary supplements. While not all folks may be helped by PepZIn GI, this product helped me successfully eliminate my dependence on PPI's.  I am now PPI-free after a two month regimen of alternating my daily PPI with an H2-antagonist (Zantac 150 MG), while introducing 2x/day dosing of PepZin GI.PROS:1. Developed in Japan, patented in 1991 and in clinical use since 1994.2. An outstanding and safe adjunct therapy for trying to tier off long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI's).3.

Find a good physician (MD/DO) who is licensed in integrative medicine and knowledgeable about nutritional approaches to managing  your healthcare.  Remember that most physicians are not trained in integrative approaches or holistic medicine.  Many (if not most)  physicians may not recognize or understand supplements or their usefulness for your particular condition(s).  Most importantly, they  may not be able to assess their interactions or potential adverse side effects if you are taking Rx meds.  You must be the most  important part of your medical team.

"I have purchased and installed Westek (2x), Intermatic (3x) and Woods (2x) photo sensors to control dusk to dawn operation of my 100 Watt HPS outdoor security fixture throughout the last 15 years. Simply put, they last only about 1-2 years before requiring replacement because the contacts oxidize in the unit and the photo cells go bad. I resolved never to purchase the above three brands again after having been disappointed so many times!The Tork 2021 was discovered by accident. An Amazon search for ""photo cell"" or ""photo sensor"" will not reveal this brand. You must search for ""photo controls"".  This is a winning unit for the following reasons:PROS:1. Manufactured to commercial installation specs. All Lexan enclosure-weather and moisture-resistant.2. Delay of up to 2 minutes to prevent false switching due to artificial light sources such as lightning, vehicles, etc.3. 180 Degree swivel arc4. Cover and Base are ultrasonically welded for unit integrity.5. Reliable metal slide for adjusting on/off light level.6. Excellent price point-$16.50CONS:1. Made in China.2.

"Philips is a major market player in the lighting arena and manufactures lamps for most residential and commercial applications. Based in the Netherlands, they are reliable manufacturers with a very diverse and consumer-friendly infrastructure producing lamps for a global market.As lighting technology has evolved, the company outsourced some lines of older-technology bulbs (such as the HPS line) to other countries (China and eastern Europe) along with several other large competitors such as GE, Westinghouse and Sylvania.PROS:1. Philips generally has good quality control and will offer replacement if their product fails to perform as stated. I have found that their consumer support is accessible and generally friendly.2. Cost: Reasonable at about $20/100 Watt HPS lamp.3. Generally more reliable than many generic brands or Eiko and about equivalent in reliability as GE or Sylvania.CONS:1. Philips outsources manufacturing of some of its lines of lamps. The HPS line is one of these. This particular lamp is produced in China if that  matters to you. Quality control however remains acceptable. The equivalent HPS lamp made by GE is produced in Hungary. I have found that both of these are reliable lamps.2. HPS lamps contain mercury (Hg). These particular lamps contain 22 mg of Hg. and need to be disposed of in accordance with your municipality's/township's regulations governing hazardous waste.3. Specifications for these lamps can be a bit misleading as the devil is always in the details so to speak. For example, this lamp provides only 8550 lumens (approximate mean lumens); however, the manufacturer boasts 9500 lumens (approximate initial lumens).  You do the math but I assure you that you will not achieve anywhere near 9500 lumens if the application requires 9500.4. No where near as efficient or bright as the current LED lamps on the market. Progress and time marches on!RECOMMENDATIONS:1. An acceptable choice where low-level security lighting is necessary for about 25% of the cost of a 100 Watt LED spotlight fixture.  Expect to pay about $20/bulb compared to having to purchase and install a new UL-Rated Outdoor LED Spotlight Fixture at about $80 and up.2. Avoid handling the lamp (bulb) with bare hands as epidermal oils from your skin can cause the bulb to explode. Use a glove or soft cloth.3.

"3M has established a fine reputation for making excellent tapes, abrasives and other flat adhesives. This tape is no exception.PROS:1.  This is an excllent aluminum alloy foil with a pressure-sensitive adhesive and paper liner. Outstanding adherence in metal to metal  joints such as duct work and reducing joint tolerances between sheet metal and steel.  I used this tape as an insulator connecting a 4"" duct hose to a roof vent. The UL 723 rating made it a perfect choice here.2. Still the market leader in technical specs and performance ratings-Better overall performance compared to Frost King, Duck and  other major retail brands.  See the specs below for comparisons.3. Made in USA and support is not outsourced to 3rd party global call centers. A real plus in my opinion.4. Technical Support: Outstanding, 3M-Payrolled employees take your calls and continue to provide outstanding tech support in instances  where customer service support cannot properly address these inquiries.CONS:1. Cost: Value:  Budget-sensitive consumers will not be pleased that 3M products have skyrocketed in price relative to their major market competitors. Competing brands still remain up to 44% cheaper yet provide nearly similar performance metrics depending on the application.2. Customer Service Phone Support: B- as a grade compared to 3M consumer support from just 5 years ago. Phone reps appear to have resorted to the standard script for addressing most consumer inquiries and have become increasingly bureaucratic making for a less than favorable customer experience.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. This remains a 5-star product with 4 star support.2. If the application for your particular project is not critical, check prices from other competitors and use your budget as a guide.  If your project requires the best in materials to prevent water infiltration stick with 3M.3. Support: If your inquiry has merit and/or is complex, avoid the standard ""consumer hotline"" and call the corporate offices directly in St. Paul, MN  Direct Phone: (651) 737-6501.

"I love great snacks and particularly cashews. When it comes to nuts, Planters has been a household and well-trusted name for many decades and synonymous with quality and freshness in its nut products. However, over the years, as our food supply and sourcing has changed, so have many U.S. companies in their efforts to sustain supply to meet both U.S. and global demand and to increase revenue.PROS:1. Planters remains a consumer-responsive brand and continues to diversify its product line to meet consumer preferences.CONS:1. Many ""big box"" mainstream US manufacturers have again put their ahead of providing consumers with product that uses healthy food-based ingredients and oils. This product most likely is roasted in cottonseed oil-classified as a non-foods crop. What many folks may not know is that this oil is not regulated as stringently by the FDA as those oils which are grown as a food source. The concern here is that cottonseeds are cleaned by bathing them in a solution containing hexane among other toxic chemicals-a known toxin and irritant.  Unfortunately, under current FDA regulations, US manufacturers are not required to identify the percentage of each oil used in any particular lot #/batch of their products. This is why you see the statement: ""May contain one or more of the following oils....."", or ""peanut and/or cottonseed oils"".  I choose to not spin the roulette wheel of safety or play the ""Guess That Oil"" game.2. Planter's oil-""roasted"" nuts tend to be excessively oily as other reviewers have suggested. Nuts are by nature, loaded with fat but some manufacturer's use a higher percentage. I much prefer dry-roasted cashews but they are nearly impossible to locate and when you do, they are extremely expensive.BOTTOM LINE:1. Purchase product (whether nuts, other snacks or any food) by reading labels carefully and avoid any that list cottonseed oil. Even if the label states peanut oil among others, you are more likely to receive product with cottonseed oil because cottonseed oil is dirt cheap for manufacturers compared to peanut oil which is expensive. A good example of this is the parallel between the use of cane sugar vs. high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Like peanut oil, cane sugar is expensive and high-fructose corn syrup is cheap, plentiful and subsidized in part by the federal government.. The choice is yours to make.2. For the most part, the U.S. is essentially alone in the world in using oil sourced from non-food crops for their food supply. Even a visit to the dollar stores (that sell products sourced globally and cheap) will reveal that nuts, along with other snacks contain no cottonseed oils. Consider this when making purchases.3. Consider purchasing cashews roasted exclusively in non-hydrogenated peanut or coconut oil. Years ago, most cashews in the U.S. were roasted in coconut oil-they were absolutely delicious-crunchy and crisp.4. Contact Planters (owned by Kraft Food Group) (1-877-677-3268) or your favorite domestic manufacturers and let your voice be heard about the use of these questionable and potentially harmful ingredients. They DO listen to us, especially when it begins to compromise their bottom line.....profits.Happy, safe snacking!

"PROS:1. Rich, creamy flavor that accentuates the taste of any coffee. Tastes better than ANY creamer currently on the market-including soy, rice and coconut-based creamers. Emulsifies completely unlike other types of creamers.2. Portion size is perfectly metered for enjoying your coffee regardless of brewing method.3. Units are well-sealed for delivery into your cup to enjoy.4. UHT stable-Doesn't require any refrigeration.5. Lactose, cholesterol and gluten-free product.4. Nestle is a respected and responsible manufacturer and this product remains the most popular coffee creamer after nearly 50 years.CONS:1. The manufacturer claims this product should be fresh up to 9 months from the expiration date (""Use By"" Date) on your package/box. However,if the product is stored improperly at any point in the distribution process (e.g. excess humidity, freezing), it may result in ""clumping"", resulting in the creamer not emulsifying as expected in your beverage. Unfortunately, I have had this occur on many occasions which compromises the integrity of the product.2. These ""single-serve"" units are considerably more expensive per ounce than the refrigerated liquid Coffee-Mate in your grocer's dairy case.Unfortunately, the ingredients for each of these products differs and tastes different. I prefer the single-serve units because it tastes better and does not contain corn syrup solids as does the refrigerated liquids as well as the powder forms of Coffee-Mate.3. Contains artificial flavor and emulsifying agents that some folks may not want.3. This is NOT a dairy-free product. Coffee-Mate contains sodium caseinate which is simply a milk protein for those on dairy-restricted diets.BOTTOM LINE:1. Coffee-Mate is an excellent adjunct and supplement to light cream or half & half in your morning beverage when used in moderation.2.

"For those of us who prefer to avoid the potentially dangerous side effects of undergoing testosterone replacement/enhancement, these OTC supplements may be helpful for many folks.  I decided to try this supplement due to the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, I am unable to endorse this supplement.  When taken as directed, this product appears to have absolutely no more of a therapeutic or clinical effect as a placebo.Moderate daily exercise seems to be a more prudent strategy. Your own results may be different; however I suggest the following cautions before taking this or any supplement without first consulting your own healthcare practitioner:PROS:1. If you are NOT taking Rx meds, this supplement may be one to consider. (See cautionary note below).2. Made in USA; however, only the supplement distributor is identified on the bottle-NOT the manufacturer because this information is usually considered ""proprietary"".3. If purchased on Amazon, product comes with a $ back guarantee.CONS:1. Unable to contact distributor: The bottle lists a contact number for ""JG Sports""; however, there is absolutely no customer support whatsoever. After 9 calls over a 3-week interval, you continue to speak to an unanswered phone.2. Product expiration date: Completely invisible unless held up to the light. Located on the bottom of the bottle but stamped in light yellow on the surface of a glossy white bottle. I find it a hard sell that anyone truly interested in transparency would think of such inconspicuous labeling.3. Directions for Dosage: Inconvenient. Having to alternate dosage after 5 days and off for two is often inconvenient and resulted in no noticeable therapeutic change after 5 dosage cycles of the supplement.BOTTOM LINE:1. DO NOT take any supplements (particularly herbals) without first contacting your physician. If you are on RX meds, there are many potentially serious adverse interactions between some herbal supplements and conventional prescription medications which may either enhance or compromise the effect of the supplement(s). Unfortunately, even today, many MD and DO's are not adequately schooled in interpreting these critically important interactions.2. Consider consulting a trusted senior RPh.

"The benefits and advantages of Vitamin D continue to accumulate in the research arena, particularly over the past 5 years. We now know how important it is to maintain adequate vitamin D levels for optimal health, since insufficient vitamin D has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, autoimmune disease and cancer.Here is what you need to know about the differences between the two forms of Vitamin D:1. Vitamin D2: (ergocalciferol) This is the synthetic (artificial) form of D produced from fungi and yeast.Recent research has demonstrated that D2 is not as effective in increasing blood (serum) levels of Vitamin D as D-3.2. Vitamin D3: (cholecalciferol): This is the natural form of Vitamin D naturally produced in our skin by sunlight. It is synthesized from lanolin (sheep's wool).** Note: There is now a Vegan D3 available on the market. Here is your link: http://www.amazon.com/Solgar-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol-Vegetable-Capsules/dp/B0019KAS66/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1416178087&sr=1-2&keywords=vegan+vitamin+d3+2000+iuPROS:1. D3 is the clearly preferred form of Vitamin D because it is more effective at increasing blood serum levels of 25 (OH) D-The standard blood test for Vitamin D. (Tripkovich et al, 2012).2. D3 has a significantly longer shelf life compared to D2 supplements.3. These softgels are small and easy to swallow-even for those who have difficulty.4. Product is GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified.5. Contains extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as a natural emulsifier.6. Wheat, yeast, egg, gluten, milk, tree nut, fish, shellfish and soy free.7. Clear ""Best By"" Date stamped on bottle bottom.CONS:1. This softgel capsule contains animal by-products (bovine gelatin) and should be avoided by those with allergies, sensitivities or who are vegan.2. This product is not GMO-free.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. An excellent product for the price, recommended for daily supplementation of D3 but 4 stars for GMO and bovine gelatin.2. I would like to see a 360 count bottle, GMO-free and veg caps available as does Nutrigold for this product.3. Take with a fatty food for best absorption.4. Ask your physician for a ""25-hydroxyl D"" 25 (OH) D blood test if you believe you are at-risk for low D3. This is the standard test to measure blood serum levels of Vitamin D. The optimal range (referred to as ""reference range"") of Vitamin D for us is between 30-40 ng/ml on this blood panel. You can then monitor accurately your levels and make necessary adjustments when appropriate.Wishing You All Good Health!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5SCVUU4ZGFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UZPY1O#wasThisHelpful","R1U5SCVUU4ZGFY","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Broan makes quality ventilation accessories and is a U.S. based manufacturer.  This is a popular and well-rated roof cap with pluses and minuses. If you heed the warnings and make the necessary adjustments relative to installation you should have a roof cap that provides trouble-free performance for years.PROS:1. A reasonably well-manufactured residential low-profile roof cap made from 24 gauge CRCQ  galvanized steel (frame).and aluminum internal sub-parts.2. Black electrically-bonded epoxy finish3. Integral back-draft damper and bird screen4. Clear and relatively straightforward installation instructions.CONS:1. This roof cap is actually an import but cleverly and prominently depicts the politically-correct USA logo on its box. If you have an electron microscope, you will see that the item is actually a hybrid product globally sourced. The manufacturer does not provide details as to which parts are manufactured in the US.2. This item should be supplied with the proprietary 4"" DC4 duct collar necessary for proper installation, but you need to purchase this separately ($6.61) or purchase the RVK1A Roof Ducting ""Kit""  which supplies all you should need for the job-two tie wraps,8' of 4"" diameter flexible foil duct transition hose, the duct collar and a strip of self-sticking compression-type weather-seal.3. The ""bird screen"" is simply a loose-fitting light gauge wire screen which can and will be penetrated by some birds and most definitely by ambitious squirrels searching for safe harbor, moisture and nesting. This screen should have been heavier gauge and screwed into the cap frame on all four sides.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Still one of the better residential roof caps on the market at this time.2. If you purchase the Broan kit (cited above) DO NOT USE the 8' compression duct hose. In most municipalities and townships, this is clearly not compliant with fire codes and regulations and will also trap more lint in the inner lining of the hose restricting air flow and creating a potential hazard. Instead, purchase a semi-rigid 4-8' section of smooth fire-rated aluminum duct available at most big box hardware stores and certainly any roofing supply outlet.3. Skip the cheap tie-wraps furnished in the Broan kit if you purchased this-They are flimsy and do not yield a tight and secure grip on each duct junction. Buy two 4-5"" stainless steel adjustable clamps.3. Prior to installation, be certain to insure that the duct collar is properly installed into the roof cap aperture (opening). To do this, you will need to seat the seal with a good caliber roofing cement and seal all nails with this compound as well to assure water-resistance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36PO6JQLU5JKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQW6LE#wasThisHelpful","R36PO6JQLU5JKV","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These sheet protectors are not suitable for many hobbyists, stamp and coin collectors who demand archiving documents, stamps or coins in completely acid-free and/or oxygen/nitrogen free environments. Stamp collectors who have stamp sheets will not be able to properly archive them using this product if there is selvage to the stamp sheets.2. I would like to see Avery amend their ""print transfer"" claim to:  ""transfer-resistant material"" to be more accurate.  Although Avery claims this product will not lift print from documents, I have found that this will indeed occur if there is adequate compression placed on the documents for a period of time- For example, if you are storing these documents horizontally in a stack.3. It would be helpful to identify the exact ""mil thickness"" as a useful metric to help consumers actually compare competing manufacturer's sheet protectors before purchasing.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  Overall an excellent product and highly recommended for specific applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYOZC39CQKK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HVE34#wasThisHelpful","R3FYOZC39CQKK7","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The benefits and advantages of Vitamin D continue to accumulate in the research arena, particularly over the past 5 years. We now know how important it is to maintain adequate vitamin D levels for optimal health, since insufficient vitamin D has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, autoimmune disease and cancer.Here is what you need to know about the differences between the two forms of Vitamin D:1. Vitamin D2: (ergocalciferol) This is the synthetic (artificial) form of D produced from fungi and yeast.  Recent research has demonstrated that D2 is not as effective in increasing blood (serum) levels of Vitamin D  as D-3.2. Vitamin D3: (cholecalciferol): This is the natural form of Vitamin D naturally produced in our skin by sunlight. It is synthesized from lanolin (sheep's wool).  ** Note: There is now a Vegan D3 available on the market. Here is your link: http://www.amazon.com/Solgar-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol-Vegetable-Capsules/dp/B0019KAS66/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1416178087&sr=1-2&keywords=vegan+vitamin+d3+2000+iuPROS:1. D3 is the clearly preferred form of Vitamin D because it is more effective at increasing blood levels of 25 (OH) D-The standard  blood test for Vitamin D. (Tripkovich et al, 2012).2. D3 has a significantly longer shelf life compared to D2 supplements.3. These softgels are slightly smaller than most other manufacturer's D3 gels and may be easier to swallow for some.4. Product is GMO-free and GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified.5. Contains GMO-free organic olive oil as a natural emulsifier.6. Egg, gluten, milk, tree nut, fish, shellfish and soy free.7. Clear ""Best By"" Date stamped on bottle bottom.8. A full year's supply at an excellent, competitive price point.CONS:1. This softgel capsule contains animal by-products (bovine gelatin) and should be avoided by those with allergies, sensitivities or who are vegan.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. An excellent product highly recommended for daily supplementation of D3.2. Ask your physician for a ""25-hydroxyl D""  25 (OH) D blood test if you believe you are at-risk for low D3. This is the standard test to measure blood serum levels of Vitamin D.  The optimal range (referred to as ""reference range"") of Vitamin D for us is between 30-40 ng/ml on this blood panel. You can then monitor accurately your levels and make necessary adjustments when appropriate.Wishing You All Good Health!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNSS2R7AX79N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G73N3I#wasThisHelpful","R3CNSS2R7AX79N","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who take a statin (Lipitor, Crestor and the rest of the statin family) should know by this point that it is helpful to supplement with CoQ10. This is because all statins reduce and compromise the levels of CoQ10 made by your body. CoQ10 is a fat-soluble antioxidant produced naturally and concentrated in the liver, kidneys and heart.  As we age, levels of this important compound decline significantly. Therefore, sustaining adequate levels of CoQ10 becomes particularly significant for those who remain on statins, are diabetic, pre-diabetic (T2), have Parkinson's disease or for those who have chronic cardiac issues.Our typical American diet generally furnishes only about 10mg of CoQ10 daily so supplementation is usually necessary to reach more optimum levels (Weil).Folks under 30 may benefit from this less expensive form of CoQ10 (Ubiquinone) while those over age 40 may wish to consider the more expensive reduced form of CoQ10 (Ubiquinol).All supplements labeled ""CoQ10"" are clearly not the same.  (At least as far as the marketing goes!)There are two distinct forms of CoQ10:1. Ubiquinone (USP): This is the less expensive and more marketed oxidized or non-reduced form of this antioxidant.2. Ubiquinol:  This is the more expensive reduced form of CoQ10 claiming higher absorption.It is interesting to note that your body actually converts each form of CoQ10 into the other (Mayo Clinic). However, some healthcare practitioners, and without question the supplement industry, suggest that ubiquinol (expensive form) is more efficient  since it has greater antioxidant efficiency, particularly for folks over age 40 (Dr. Weil).  The choice is your to make in consultation with your physician.PROS1. This product delivers ubiquinone-the oxidized or un-reduced form of Co-enzyme Q10.2. These softgels are somewhat smaller than most other manufacturer's CoQ10 gels and may be easier to swallow.3. Contains ""BioPerine"", a patented, standardized extract from black pepper used to enhance bioavailability and absorption.4. Product is GMO-free and GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified.5. Egg, gluten, milk, nut, shellfish and soy free.6. Clear ""Best By"" Date stamped on bottle bottom.7. Excellent, competitive price points for this supplement.CONS:1. Product label introduced as ""High Absorption""  is somewhat misleading to many uninformed folks (See Photo). Although they are technically and legally transparent in the ingredient listing the front label implies ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10 associated with higher absorption.2. The softgel capsule uses animal by-products (bovine gelatin) and should be avoided by those with allergies, sensitivities or who are vegan.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. This is for many an excellent product but those over 40 should consider purchasing ubiquinol which some studies have demonstrated to have higher absorption and higher antioxidant activity. Check prices and stay with a reputable name brand that is GMP certified.2. Take this supplement with foods containing fat e.g peanut butter, cheese for better absorption.In Good Health!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOAR5QN7W1VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SA2EMS#wasThisHelpful","R1DOAR5QN7W1VF","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samsung is a major player in the electronics and HDTV market and there are many excellent in-depth technical reviews on the performance of these Samsung sets. The purpose of this review is to comment on the overall reliability and customer support on Samsung products and to share my experience.PROS:1. Extremely energy efficient- $8/year2. Clear, crisp picture when working3. Excellent price on Amazon4. VESA wall mount5. A best buy compared to the comparable 2013 40"" version.CONS:1. Reliability: If your priority is features then reliability becomes secondary to many.  However, I believe reliability is paramount.  I received a lemon from the outset on this Samsung.  The unit consistently cycled on and off making it impossible to watch. It was subsequently returned to Amazon and I purchased a 40"" Panasonic which performs beautifully. Consumer Reports rates Samsung reliability at 4%. The highest reliability on these sets continues to be Panasonic at 2% with an absolutely stunning picture compared to its Samsung counterpart. The small price differential was more than worth it to me.2. Samsung and many other manufacturers, continue to participate in ""panel roulette"", purchasing other manufacturer's panels to save cost. So, depending on the model and version of your Samsung set, you may actually be purchasing a generic Chinese,  Sharp or Samsung panel...spin the wheel and good luck!  Panasonic now uses LG panels for their sets. However, Samsung has earned a reputation for using low-caliber components, resistors, capacitors and power supply's compared to other manufacturers such as Sony and Panasonic. This also impacts overall brand reliability if this is important to you.3.  Customer Support:  Samsung continues to have one of the worst customer support networks available. Support is globally-outsourced to non-native speaking associates on poor VOIP lines and the company has a long and well-documented history of making it challenging at best to receive manufacturer-supported and sanctioned customer-focused quality and attention. Over the years, I have owned several Samsung appliances only to be disappointed at the lack of their interest in your purchase at having their equipment repaired or replaced under the terms and conditions of their ""warranty"".RECOMMENDATIONS:1. 2 Stars for reliability and consistently unacceptable customer support.2. Consider what is most important to you in choosing a TV then select accordingly. Reliability and quality components are highest for Panasonic, LG, Sharp and Sony and lowest for Westinghouse, Mitsubishi and Sylvania.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPB8UI0U1FNBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CALLZK6#wasThisHelpful","RPB8UI0U1FNBN","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Solgar is a well-recognized player in the supplement market for many years and has established a fine reputation for quality, reliability and customer support. This product's evolution has witnessed some interesting formula/ingredient changes over its product lifetime-some favorable and some unfavorable. Given these considerations, this is clearly a 4-star product at this time for the following reasons:PROS:1. Uses a cross-flow, micro-filtration proprietary extraction process which does not compromise the amino acids.2. Offers the complete amino acid profile and BCAA (branched-chain amino acids) and immunoglobulins.3. 98% lactose free, rBGH (recombinate bovine growth hormone), gluten and artificial flavor free4. Free-form L-glutamine and BCAA's5. 20g protein per 25g serving  (scoop); 90 calories/serving, 5 calories from fat.6. Emulsifies easily even when mixed with cold beverages.7. Good price point compared with similar competitors for a full 2 lb. can.8. Vanilla-neutral flavor acceptable for mixing with almond/coconut milk and fruit.CONS:1. Contains a blend of both whey protein isolate and concentrate vs. the preferred 100% isolate.2. Contains a negligible (< 1%) but nevertheless undesirable amount of soy lecithin for those allergic or intolerant to soy.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Solgar should remove the soy lecithin (which they use to increase emulsification) and switch to sunflower lecithin.2. This product is acceptable for those who have no sensitivity to soy and who use this product as an adjunct to increase dietary protein.  I use this in my Nutri Bullet as a morning superfood ""protein shake"" mixed with fruit, spinach, kale, coconut milk and water.3. I ideally prefer a 100% whey protein isolate like Blue Bonnet but this is acceptable-If you are using this simply to mix with water I would strongly recommend this product in the chocolate flavor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGSGZBN12FHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011FTBMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HGSGZBN12FHL","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried at least 13 different probiotic supplements over the past 20 years including Jarrow Dophilus EPS which used to be very effective.  If you have a sensitive GI system or suffer from any type of chronic digestive/GI issue you no doubt understand how frustrating it can be to find the perfect supplement.  For me, this product has been superb and I recommend it for the following reasons:PROS:1. Without question, one of the finest probiotic supplements on the market for quality, product integrity, price points and support.2. Perfectly balances and regulates the GI system.3. Contains 10 different clinically-validated acid-resistant probiotic strains with added FOS4. Delivers 25 billion organisms through the ""Best Buy"" date stamped on bottle bottom.5. Clear, transparent and generous ""Best By"" dates usually 2 years to expiration.6. GMP Certified. Dairy, wheat, soy and gluten-free veg capsules.7. Light-resistant bottles to help maintain product potency.CONS:1. With much debate and controversy regarding deterioration and reduction of product potency after the product leaves the production facility, Now should use ""At Time of Manufacture"" (ATOM) as a more accurate metric since ALL probiotics begin to lose their potency and become compromised gradually following production.2. Although these probiotic strains claim to be ""acid-resistant"", I would prefer to see enteric-coated capsules as a delivery vehicle.3. Size: Should be supplied as bottles of 60 and 120 instead of 50 since the recommended dosage is 1-2/day. Who ran the numbers on this one?4. I would also like to see included in each bottle ""Tri-Sorb"" cylinder desiccants rather than the current paper sachets.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. This is an outstanding first-rate probiotic. Highly recommended. Remember however, that you may need to adjust your dosage based upon your individual results and body chemistry.  Start with 1/day and titrate to two if necessary.2. Like many supplements and other types of medications, you may find that after time the probiotic becomes somewhat less effective.  If this occurs, simply rotate off to a different probiotic.  Experts recommend rotating your multivitamins for the same reason.3. Refrigerate all of your probiotics upon receipt even if it is not required to do so-you will prolong the product's effectiveness.  If you are traveling and cannot refrigerate, store in a cool, dry and temperature-stable environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJG6KBRAW6V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S1U7RU#wasThisHelpful","R3BJG6KBRAW6V7","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Square Trade has been a major player in the residential warranty arena for many years now. For some time, they have enjoyed a reputation for reasonable and attractive price points for covering your electronics, phones and other equipment as well as for their customer service. I have purchased 6 warranties from ST but there has been a clear and substantial deterioration in the quality and consistency of their repair and customer support ""experience"" which has now altered my assessment of the value of a Square Trade purchase for the following reasons.PROS:1. Market-competitive price points compared with Best Buy's Geek Squad and other competitors for large electronics, HDTV's, android and i Phones and other equipment which draw you in initially on the purchase.2. Customer Support still in the U.S.3. Most customer support associates are friendly and generate the perception of a friendly customer culture but often lack the training, resources or empowerment to address customer concerns.CONS:1. Access ALL of the terms and conditions BEFORE you purchase your warranty. If not, you are likely to be very disappointed if and when your item requires repair.  Unfortunately, Square Trade is not transparent in making this information conspicuous before the purchase. ST strategically places their ""Terms and Conditions"" in text at the very end of the page requiring an electron microscope to read.  Most of us never think of reviewing this prior to purchase but you should ALWAYS do so. Remember that the devil is always in the details and this is especially relevant with Square Trade. Their liability under the terms of the warranty is limited to the actual purchase price of your item. READ IT CAREFULLY.2. Like all warranty companies, they remain excessively bureaucratic.  Expect to spend indefinite periods of time and space waiting on the line as they ""review"" your inquiry or case while you age.  ST thinks nothing of asking their customers to hold for  30 minutes as they educate themselves at your expense. Instead of guaranteeing a time-sensitive call-back for those issues demanding such attention, Square Trade associates challenge your patience while they search for information which should be at their fingertips.3. On many occasions, Square Trade provides inaccurate and/or clearly incomplete information regarding your inquiry. Supervisors are often unavailable or not empowered to resolve customer issues quickly and accurately as used to be the case several years ago. Having had (and have) multiple policies and a repair claim to my credit, my experience suggests that their ""Customer Service"" is extremely porous with little respect for customer's time.4. Claim Processing can be inconsistent and cumbersome and is far from a seamless, coordinated process. My repair claim resulted in having to make over six calls to ST. Not only did ST initially deny a valid laptop claim due to a poorly trained associate, but also failed to send out a shipping box as they had agreed.5. Square Trade's promotional incentives can be misleading and their lack of transparency in honoring them often marginal at best. Keep in mind that to receive ST-sponsored promotions, you must purchase your warranty directly through Square Trade's website and not through Amazon. This can be a clear disadvantage because the best prices on Square Trade warranty products is consistently through Amazon.  For example, ST does not offer a 5 year HDTV warranty on their own website; to get this, you must purchase it from Amazon.6. Communicating with ST through their poor, tinny ""outer-space"" VOIP line contributes to frustration and not an efficient and pleasant customer experience.  The ""experience"" equation becomes even more prominent if you are unlucky enough to get the representative whose native language is clearly not English or who does not articulate clearly.7. In addition to their verbatim phone script, ST addresses each client by their first name which I suspect is intended as a friendly gesture. Many of us may find this practice somewhat juvenile and patronizing, particularly those who of us who graduated from kindergarten-I find that ""sir"" or using a last name seems to work just fine.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Consider if you really need these types of ""warranties"".  Consumer Reports has consistently recommended to avoid these types of warranties because the return on investment is often not worth the price of the warranty product.2. If you do decide to purchase a Square Trade warranty, purchase it directly from Amazon. Here's why: Amazon's partnership with ST is a revenue-enhancing conduit for delivering Square Trade's products.  As such, any grievances become arbitrated and rectified quickly and efficiently by Amazon on behalf of its customers. My 9 calls to ST to try and resolve a recent issue remained unresolved until Amazon intervened to issue the accurate credit.3. Amazon's price points for ST warranties is volatile and changes frequently, often by as much as $10-$15. I suggest placing your chosen plan in your cart and waiting a few days before purchasing since the price fluctuates rapidly. In most cases, you have 30 days from the date of purchase of your equipment to purchase the warranty so you have time to determine the price ceiling and floor for your particular warranty.3. Request a complete copy of the terms and conditions governing your specific warranty and READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QW27JGJ8HOG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005STXNAW#wasThisHelpful","R2QW27JGJ8HOG8","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:1. Exceedingly excellent quality control on all Scotch 3M products making a 3M purchase one you can trust to perform consistently.2. Outstanding performance particularly for sensitive documents and applications or for those projects having little tolerance for error.3. Superior to Elmer's, Avery UHU and Crayola and other generic glue sticks hands-down.4. When 3M initially released their purple glue sticks back in the late 1980's, they were labeled as a ""permanent adhesive"",  manufactured in France and supplied in 0.25 oz. sticks.  Several decades later, the present version is just as good, supplied in 0.28 oz. sticks, manufactured in Korea for 3M, but not specifically labeled as ""a permanent adhesive"".  ""Permanent"" is a relative term and I suspect that this word was omitted in the current generation of this product for risk-management by the Company.5. Although not specifically stated on the blister cards, 3M has a fine reputation for standing behind the integrity and performance of their products. The company will generally replace the product without hassle.6. 3M Support: This is an American company staffed with friendly and responsive customer support, especially their corporate offices in St. Paul, MN.  Their toll-free # is: (800)-328-6276. No difficult to hear VOIP lines outsourced to the Philippines, Panama or India. Just English-speaking, knowledgeable and respectful professionals well-trained in helping you complete your project without keeping you on hold indefinitely or providing you with inaccurate or misleading information as so many other companies do.CONS:1. Price points for 3M continue to be among the highest in its class (along with Avery) and glue sticks are no exception here. Expect comparable products to be $1-2 cheaper on average.2. Avoid using this product on highly-glossy surfaces and materials having textured and/or raised surfaces. This is the Achilles heel for this product yielding only marginal adhesion.BOTTOM LINE:1. You get what you pay for generally speaking.

"To find great items, you truly do need to ""think outside of the bottle"" so to speak.  When one hears of ""Dr. Brown's"", you either think of a vintage cream soda or a line of patented baby bottles.  I was interested in neither of these but was looking for a set of hobby brushes which could be used for a wide variety of applications around the house.PROS:1. These are phenomenal little brushes which have a multitude of resourceful uses......from cleaning piano, phone and PC keyboards to straws, automotive uses (cleaning radiator and HVAC compressor fins), small vented appliances, hairbrushes,  musical instruments, audio equipment and maintaining medical equipment....the uses are really endless and limited only by your imagination.2. Supplied in a blister-carded display of four brushes, each measures: 5.50"" in total length. The actual bristle-portion measures 1.5"" in length and 0.25"" in diameter.  The bristles themselves appear well-attached to their twisted wire shafts and did not pull out throughout intense rotation and cleaning into tight crevices.3. Product is claimed by the manufacturer to be dishwasher-safe (top-rack) and BPA free.4. Extremely versatile product whose uses extend well beyond those conceived by the manufacturer. (see above comments)CONS/CAUTIONS:1. All brushes are the exact same dimensions.  I would like to see a ""set"" of four of these with different diameter bristles and handle lengths.

For $2.16 (Amazon, 7.02.2014) this is a deal you cannot pass on. I paid nearly $7 for these back in January 2014 and they are worth every penny.  Highly recommend!2.

"3M has a fine reputation for manufacturing outstanding adhesives for residential and commercial use.  That is why I decided to try this tape rather than a cheaper line (such as Frost King) to help address a leak in a relatively new vinyl replacement window. Here are my thoughts and observations as a DIY'er:PROS:1.  This 1.5"" wide tape is substantial in terms of thickness; it is smooth and applies easily as per the directions on the outer sleeve.2. For minor to moderate air leaks I have found this tape to be very effective if properly applied prepping the surface with isopropyl alcohol as recommended in order to assure ideal surface adhesion.3. Has not cracked, split or yellowed after 4 months of use.4. 3M customer service is particularly helpful in answering questions regarding application and product availability.  I believe that this is factored into their retail consumer price structures.  When I called on 7.2.2014, I spoke with a 3M rep who spoke English, took the time to answer all of my questions-clearly and thoroughly (""Scott"") and was meticulously professional. You get what you pay for folks!CONS/CAUTIONS:1.  This tape is designed only as a seasonal product; if you intend to use the tape to permanently seal leaks (beyond 4 months), there will most likely be adhesive transference, making it extremely difficult to remove the tape.  However, 3M says that you can use this tape permanently if you choose to do so but it is not recommended.2. This tape is made from polyethylene with a proprietary acrylic adhesive in order to facilitate removal at the end of a season, according to 3M. DO NOT apply firm pressure on the tape, just assure a smooth, bubble-free seal.  When removing tape, remove very slowly and evenly if applied to acrylic latex painted surfaces.  Some reviewers have been disappointed at this process but I did not encounter a problem.3. This is an expensive product compared with the market competition from other vendors. The package supplies 10 yds. of tape-meager in comparison to Duck Brands, Frost King and others.4. This product, which has been in 3M's product line for decades, is unfortunately only supplied in 1.5"" widths x 10 yd. rolls.5. No integral cutter supplied making the process a bit more inconvenient.6. No traditional ""3M roll tab"" for easy starting and peeling as with other 3M products.7. Tape picks up your fingerprints which can compromise adhesion due to your epidermal oils.BOTTOM LINE/SUGGESTIONS:1.  A  3.0 star rating, compromised by a number of inconveniences which should be able to be simply addressed by 3M making this a truly great sealing tape.2.  Tape should be supplied in 1"" rolls as well depending on specific application.3.  Steep price point-Look for off-season sales if available. I would like to see a 15 or 20 yd. roll priced with economy of scale for consumers.4.  Recommended product but with the above-cited caveats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32YVRIX31QWK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CBIFF#wasThisHelpful","R32YVRIX31QWK6","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually love Rubbermaid products. They have had a history of well-designed products with their finger on the pulse of the U.S. consumer market for housewares for many decades.  Not this time though.  This is essentially, a mislabeled toilet brush masquerading as a ""bottle brush"".  As such, it is somewhat misleading to many consumers and the manufacturer should attempt to trash the label or re-design the product properly.PROS:1. Reasonably well-manufactured. Solid, ergonomic, comfortable-rubber grip handle.2. Stiff, coarse 1"" ""flared"" bristles with a 3"" bristle head for maximizing and cleaning many surface areas3. Elliptical handle for hangingCONS/CAUTIONS:1. The versatility of this brush is limited by its restrictive and ""stereotyped"" design.  This is essentially, a Rubbermaid toilet brush, both by appearance and function.  It both looks like and performs as a toilet brush.  From a marketing perspective, it is extremely dated and anachronistic. Rubbermaid....time to come into the 21st century.2. It is not uncommon, when used regularly and vigorously, for bristles to dislodge in use.  This is a potential safety hazard in my opinion, particularly if consumers are using this for baby bottle cleaning.3. This brush does not fit in many applications for which it should have been designed. For example, because it is only 13.5"" in length and has a 2.5"" wide bristle head, it will not fit into many sports water bottles, a quart Thermos with a standard 1.25"" mouth opening and many other types of bottles.  Clearly, this was a clever attempt by Rubbermaid to ""cross label"" their classic toilet brush for use as a ""bottle brush""!  Shame on you Rubbermaid!4. The brush handle is too rigid, too short and lacks the flexibility necessary to thoroughly clean many bottle surfaces.5. Brush bristles are all coarse and uniform in tensile strength-not ideal for cleaning ANY type of infant/baby bottles or supplies where safety is seminal.BOTTOM LINE/SUGGESTIONS:1. Use this to clean your toilets folks....not bottles used to hold potable fluids. I suspect that Rubbermaid decided to axe the product review panel usually comprised of regular folks who actually use this stuff.2. This product requires a more transparent re-labeling initiative to call it what it REALLY is......A Rubbermaid TOILET BRUSH!

"Selecting an appropriate air filter for our Trane XV-95/16i HVAC system has been a challenge, in part due to differences of opinion from each HVAC company.  In fact, even Trane was reluctant to provide specific performance metrics making it easy to select the right filter for our system-even when provided with the ducting specs and sq. footage of our home.  I contacted 6 different HVAC contractors and received five different opinions.  Two suggested purchasing the cheapest .59 cent filter, one an electrostatic filter, another suggested a custom-made electrostatic filter, one said to purchase a Filtrete Ultra (3M) and one contractor recommended experimenting with an assortment of filters-not exactly scientific nor did it engender any degree of confidence or credibility in these folks.After using other brand-name filters and discovering considerable lint and dust in our home, we used the Filtrete 600 MPR filter.Here is my assessment of its performance in our home:PROS:1. 3M manufactures outstanding filter media in a wide variety of performance metrics and applications.  This particular ""Dust and Pollen Filter"" appears to strike the perfect compromise between protecting your HVAC equipment and fan motor by not restricting air flow through the system with doing a reasonably good job of cleaning the air.2. If you do your research, you will find that this particular 3M 600 MPR filter has the lowest pressure drop (at 0.14) of any 3M filter in the Filtrete line. This is an important metric which many other manufacturers do not disclose.3. Approx. 70% efficient compared with other filters in the 3M line but the best cost/benefit price points and bang for your buck.4. Good for a maximum of 90 days depending on usage and home environment. (See comment below)CONS/CAUTIONS:1. Since MERV and MPR are completely different metrics, all manufacturers of filter media should be required to provide equivalent indices TOGETHER on EACH filter to help consumers compare similar-performing filters across brands and manufacturers. For example, it would be useful for some consumers to know that a 600 MPR-rated filter is equivalent to a MERV rating of 8.  The MPR metric was developed by 3M engineers to help demonstrate the advantage of 3M filters in capturing the smallest airborne particles-i.e. those from 0.3 to 1 micron in size.  The MERV standard however, measures the ability of a filter to capture larger particles using a scale from 1-12. TMI !!!! Let's have just ONE valid and reliable standard which everyone can understand and use!2. The 90 day (3 month) replacement window is essentially a marketing strategy to increase sales through customer perception.  The real truth is that filter longevity is affected by many variables including the use of tobacco, fireplace/wood-burning stove smoke, burning candles, construction projects in the home, sanding projects, pets and dirty duct work.  If any of these conditions exist, filters should be replaced MONTHLY.BOTTOM LINE/SUGGESTIONS:1. This is an excellent filter dollar for dollar with acceptable metrics for performance, equipment protection and cost.2.  Even without any of the above-cited ""special conditions"", I replace our filter monthly.  I also leave our fan on ""circulate"", which runs the fan continuously and cleans the indoor air better.  Of course the disadvantage here is that this requires us to swap out the filter more regularly.3. If you are inserting your filter vertically through a drop-down narrow, sheet-metal plenum, it is often difficult to retrieve the filter for replacement without mangling the filter frame. My suggestion is to spray a light film of lubricant (silicone or PAM) along each side of the paper frame. I also use two pieces of duct tape to help retrieve the filter from the narrow cavity.4. To determine when the filter needs to be changed, hold the filter up to an unobstructed light source. If you cannot see light through the filter, it should be changed regardless of time interval.I wish you all a happy and healthy home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CVFI3F2HJFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P75WKQ#wasThisHelpful","R31CVFI3F2HJFV","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good Idea but Energy and HVAC Equipment InefficientThese are essentially, secondary filters designed to contribute to decreasing allergens and dust particles in the house. For the $6.48 I couldn't go wrong, right?  Wrong. Here's why:PROS:1. A good concept. These are white electrostatically-charged filter media that are extremely easy to measure, cut and place into position into your floor registers or inside of your vent plate.2. They appear to be reasonably effective in reducing air-borne dust in the room(s) in which they are placed.3.  They appear on the surface to be cost-effective (i.e. cheap) at .54 each and the manufacturer claims a 90-day replacement period.CONS/CAUTIONS:1.  One of the major disadvantages to these filters is that they clearly compromise and reduce the energy efficiency of your HVAC equipment-especially on residential ducted systems more than 5-6 years of age.  Your equipment (fan motor) needs to perform harder to adequately distribute cooled/heated air through the vents.  This explains why there is a caveat listed on the package discouraging users from installing multiple filters throughout the property for this reason.2. I am using only one of these filters in our small, galley-type kitchen and have discovered that the filters need to be swapped out  EVERY month during active winter and summer seasons to operate efficiently.  At 90 days, as recommended by the manufacturer, this small filter became clogged with debris restricting air flow by approximately 75%.  This is very consistent with advice provided by our HVAC technicians who also do not recommend using these filters due to the potential for air flow restriction and equipment strain.3. If you use these filters, you must insure that your secure the filter snugly into the register opening. If the filter installs too loosely, it can fall into the duct and become useless or block air flow severely.BOTTOM LINE:1. A good concept but flawed implementation and engineering at this point rendering the filter only marginally effective and efficient when both cost and equipment efficiency are taken into consideration in the equation.2. I strongly recommend that you heed the advice of more seasoned HVAC professionals: Consider using inexpensive pleated filter media and change your HVAC primary filter every month.  One of the highest-rated filters for most residential HVAC systems is the 3M Filtrete 600 MPR Cat.# 9831DC .  It is an excellent filter at a modest price point and balances cost-effectiveness with equipment efficiency and performance.  Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P75WKQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=13. Remember that ""dear is cheap and cheap is dear"" as my mother used to always say.  It is wiser to protect expensive components in your system from breakdown by avoiding unnecessary secondary filters if possible.  The exception to this would be households with critically-sensitive or immune-compromised individuals who require higher levels of allergen filtration but that is the subject for another review.Wishing you all good health.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIAERWU4W4PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BWKMI2#wasThisHelpful","R2VIAERWU4W4PS","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Men's fragrances, cologne and eau de toilette (EDT) represents one's personal ""scent signature"".  Since each of us has a different body chemistry which affects scent, it is not unusual that some fragrances might be incompatible or not the right choice for some of us.  I respect the many favorable reviews which have been posted for Thallium but this clearly was not for me.Thallium (For Men) has a cloyingly-sweet, juvenile aroma. The scent reminded me of a budget-line cheap barber-shop unbalanced after shave.  A gray Thallium box arrived wrapped only with a thin polystyrene sleeve over the outer box inviting me to embark on a most unpleasant olfactory journey on the S.S. Skank.  Here are my impressions:PROS1.  Delivered in a gray cardboard box revealing an attractive pseudo-Grecian ""vintage"" apothecary decanter.2.  No cap necessary-The top of the bottle has an integral spray button for your scent experience.3.  If you look carefully, you will find a lot # and production/date of manufacture on the rear outer panel of the box-  (mine was 6.12.2013), which should still be reasonably fresh product.4. Believe it or not....made in France....oui oui oui!!!!!!!!!!CONS/CAUTIONS:1.  There is no indication anywhere on the bottle or box that this is a men's EDT (pour homme).  It is not unreasonable to expect such a transparent label for a product such as this and it leads one to suspect that this may not be a men's EDT.  Tighter labeling is necessary for purchasers of this product.2. Amazon has classified Thallium (and most other EDT's and colognes) as a hazardous (i.e. potentially combustible) item. As such, even given Amazon's generous and liberal return policy, you will be unable to return this item. Please think carefully before purchasing this item if you are unfamiliar with the scent or simply wish to sample it.3. Check ingredients carefully before purchasing if you have a history of skin allergies or other sensitivities: For example, Thallium contains carboxaldehyde (Lyral), which is linked with contact skin dermatitis, butyl metoxydibenzoyl-methane-a free-radical generator when exposed to sunlight,  bht-a suspected carcinogen used as a preservative and several dyes of questionable use (D&C blue 1 and red 33).  Although these substances are used widely and generally safely in the cosmetic arena, those with the above-cited conditions should take this into consideration.4. My box was not sealed like most other brands of EDT's with cellophane wrap-Given the potential for evaporation due to differences in humidity and climate, it is possible that the scent became compromised; however, I understand that this is how Thallium is supplied and packaged.BOTTOM LINE IMPRESSIONS:1. Smells like a raw deal gentlemen!  One whiff should be enough to singe your nasal passages leaving you nauseous and in  need of a respirator. Stale, rancid, repulsive, cloying, annoying aroma reminiscent of revisiting unpleasant childhood memories of your aunt dowsing herself in the skankiest scent possible as she attacks your cheeks with hugs or the smell of your elementary school teachers long past their retirement window.  But then....Allow me to tell you how I REALLY feel!!!2. No need to worry about ""scent disintegration' as others have commented on. Thallium stimulates your gag reflex and attacks your nasal passages like a rabid pit-bull without remorse.  The initial assault (spray) is intense and clings without mercy for some time. My family refused to get within 20 ft. of me until I showered and ""de-Thalliumed""!3. An excellent choice for lighter fluid, mace or insect repellent but NOT for humans.3.  Try a sample if available at Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus or Lord & Taylor.  There are far better choices.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AC0V11RM9V00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XQ1Y86#wasThisHelpful","R2AC0V11RM9V00","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The probiotic market is anticipated to reach 28.8 billion in revenue by 2015 in part due to the increased marketing and health-consciousness of consumers seeking healthy alternatives to traditional healthcare.  Some, but not all probiotic products have been studied and show considerable promise. However, the exponential growth in marketing, consumer interest and use has outpaced our current ability to run valid and reliable scientific research on the safety and efficacy of many probiotics.Jarrow Formulas, has earned an excellent reputation for manufacturing quality products with an outstanding track record for some time and I have tried many of their supplements over the years with some success.  I have no doubt that many consumers and reviewers have found this supplement to be effective for their own ailments-from IBS to hernias, to reflux to ulcerative colitis to diverticulitis and celiac disease among others.  However, I have discovered that the effectiveness of this probiotic tends to decrease the longer it is taken.  Although I do not agree that this supplement works for everyone,  I can say that it can be effective as an adjunct in combination with a good diet, daily exercise and more traditional treatments.PROS:1. Easy to swallow and minimal GI distress when taken as directed for 2X/day on an empty stomach.2. These are enteric-coated capsules which remain shelf-stable with reasonable expiration date cycles (mine is 11/2015).3. This preparation offers 8 different strains of bacteria formulated to deliver ""beneficial"" bacteria to your intestines and gut flora.4. The supplement is wheat, gluten, dairy, fish and tree nut free.CONS/CAUTIONS:1. Relatively expensive compared to other somewhat similar alternatives.  Check Swanson Vitamins for some excellent multi-strain probiotics that can be just as effective. ""Now"" (Now Foods) also makes excellent probiotics at about half the price with 25-50 billion viable cells.2. Do not assume that probiotics work similarly in different folks. Our bodies are different and our body chemistry is different. Whether a particular supplement is effective or not depends upon a constellation of variables, including diet, gender, age, exercise level, medical history and genetic disposition among others.2. One of the potential dangers of probiotics is the risk of transferring antibiotic resistance from probiotics to more deadly microorganisms. All bacteria have the potential for exchanging genetic information. Thus, there is a potential risk of transferring antibiotic resistance to other undesirable strains of bacteria. This explains why scientists have strict rules on which bacteria can qualify as a probiotic.BOTTOM LINE:1. Consider probiotics with at least 3 different strains and no less than 5 billion viable cells at the time of manufacture (ATOM). If this is not identified on the product, don't purchase it!  Jarrow is very transparent here!2. Vary your probiotics the same way you vary your multivitamins. Rotate off to a few different but effective brands each few months or so. Remember, your system learns to adapt to routine and, just like drugs, your body adapts to the supplement and it can become less effective over time.3. Even ""shelf-stable"" probiotics i.e. those not requiring refrigeration, work best when refrigerated so refrigerate them after purchase if possible-they will retain their potency longer according to many manufacturers including Jarrow.4. If you have chronic GI or immune-system disorders, check with your healthcare specialist and PCP BEFORE you decide to put yourself on this regimen. (Check the cons section above) for an explanation of why this is critical.5. .Our current understanding of probiotics continues to evolve and is therefore a work in progress. Although probiotic products are marketed for many different uses, scientific documentation supporting specific uses is still embryonic.  In fact, the FDA has not approved any health claims for probiotics despite product manufacturer claims.  Therefore, before using probiotics, educate yourself thoroughly on their pros, cons, and potential side effects by discussing this with your health care provider in addition to researching some unbiased, reliable sources of information (For example Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Consumer Reports, etc.)I wish you all good health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NG8JLJPBKV2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OUKTS#wasThisHelpful","R3NG8JLJPBKV2F","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maytag has enjoyed an outstanding record for performance and reliability of their appliances and quickly became the gold standard in the washing machine arena for nearly a century. Unfortunately, rapid acquisition of other brands, including Amana, contributed to Maytag introducing many cost-cutting initiatives that in the end, compromised Maytag's ability to remain competitive and the market leader for reliability.  An avalanche of consumer complaints on Maytag's low-end ""Performa"" and ""Legacy Series"" line of washing machines surfaced in combination with Maytag's ""Neptune"" units which were recalled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission due to fire hazard potential and a class-action lawsuit resulting in the company hemorrhaging millions in settlement costs to consumers..  This was, essentially the end of what we used to know as genuine Maytag units.On April 1, 2006, Maytag was acquired by Whirpool Corporation and the original Maytag production plants were subsequently closed.  Whirpool then assumed all brand administration although the Maytag Brand is still used on Whirpool-designed appliances and repair parts.This explains why when you contact Maytag (800) 344-1274, your call is routed to Whirpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, MI. and their call centers.Thank goodness that these relatively-common service parts are still available to DIY consumers like myself.  If you are lucky enough to have an original Maytag (manufactured in Newton, IA) then I strongly suggest you repair the unit if it is cost-effective.  The three most common repairs to these units are the drain hose(s), pump and transmission/drive belts.PROS:1. This is a common replacement part and the genuine OEM replacement curved drain hose for many Maytag washing machines manufactured in the 1980's and 1990's-Back when Maytag meant quality build and performance and the units were built like a Sherman Tank!2. This part is manufactured in the USA and distributed by Whirpool Corporation and supplied in a sealed plastic bag with the Whirpool name.3. Fits properly on both ends for a perfect seal.CONS:1.  None-I would however, like to see the two drain hose brackets supplied with the hose as a kit.  For first time DIY's, it would also be useful to have a brief, clearly labeled diagram and simple instructions.BOTTOM LINE:1. I paid $13.25 for this hose through Amazon. Don't get ripped off by other appliance parts distributors that charge $18-27 for an imported item.There is no question about the fit if you are careful in cross-referencing the correct replacement number for your Maytag appliance.  Part #: 213045 fits the Maytag A-612 and many others seamlessly. Be certain to also have your serial and ""series"" # available if you call and/or order online. You will find these on the riveted metal plate located on the top of your machine for top-loading machines like the A-612.2. This is an extremely simple repair that should save you at least $85-115 on a service call.  Be sure to ask for two new mounting brackets when you purchase your drain hose. These are not included with the hose but often necessary and strongly recommended to replace if they have become rusted or seized.3. I spray the inside of the new drain hose with a light coating of heavy-duty silicone for ease in attaching to the pump assembly.  Be careful not to force the hose onto the plastic pump assembly as it can break. Tighten each clamp gently but firmly, especially on the pump end and run the unit through a cycle or two to insure that there are no residual leaks before you put the front cover back on the machine. That's it and you should be good for another 25 years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NKUMAUYAT84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZUB48O#wasThisHelpful","R9NKUMAUYAT84","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lithium Cells are rapidly becoming the new gold standard for many household uses, from simple flashlights to sophisticated hybrid vehicles. These lithium-ion batteries are now ubiquitous in the retail arena and their popularity has steadily increased because of their power efficiency compared to more traditional delivery technologies far surpassing carbon-zinc, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and alkaline.Here Is my Assessment of The Energizer ""Ultimate"" Lithium AA Cells:PROS:1. Superior in overall power efficiency compared to traditional battery technologies. Lithium cells retain their charge longer and become superior performers in retaining their charge. When stored properly (in a cool, dry and dark environment), these cells self-discharge rates are substantially slower compared with previous generations of batteries.2. Unlike nickel-cadmium cells, lithium-ion batteries have no (or a very negligible) ""memory"" effect.3. Lithium-Ion cells also perform better at lower ambient temperatures than their predecessors.4. Lithium-Ion batteries are noticeably about 33% lighter than previous types of cells making it an additional plus in heavier types of equipment such as larger flashlights, power equipment, etc.5. Energizer lithium cells (and all lithium-ion batteries in general), have expiration dates considerably longer because they discharge much more slowly compared to previous generations of batteries.6. Lithium cells are more environmentally-compliant and friendly compared to previous generations, particularly those cells which contain toxic, heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.CONS:1. My rating on these particular cells is 4.5 stars due to the perceived steep price points of the Energizer brand.  However, if you do the math, as another conscientious reviewer has, you will find that lithium cells are actually a more cost-effective choice when compared to an equivalent-sized alkaline battery. Nevertheless, you are still likely to pay more for a name brand such as Energizer, in order for the company to recoup their research and development costs. By the way, the AAA and 9V platforms still tend to be more expensive compared to their AA, C and D counterparts-This appears to be valid regardless of the type of battery technology (e.g. alkaline, carbon-zinc, NiMh).2. Lithium cells may be a safety hazard, particularly when exposed to high temperatures for sustained periods of time. For this reason, the federal government has imposed transport restrictions on lithium batteries. Although these restrictions have recently been relaxed, lithium cells can and do explode because they contain a pressurized, flammable electrolyte. For this reason, it is advisable to store these cells in a temperature-stable environment.3. Energizer currently has several different ""quality tiers"" of Lithium batteries on the retail market-each with a different price point and different retention claim (i.e. ""Lasts up to....x longer). For example, Energizer currently has three discrete lines within lithium cells: Energizer ""Advanced"" (retention claims ""up to 4X longer"" in selected devices); Energizer ""Max"" (retention claims up to 8X longer"" in selected devices) and Energizer ""Ultimate"" (retention claims up to 9X longer"" in selected devices). For the relatively modest difference in price and at more than twice the retention claim, my choice would be Energizer Ultimate.Be careful to select the latest available expiration date card(s) to avoid purchasing an earlier production lot of the product. Each cell also has a production/ lot code embossed on it; however, they are not at present, user-identifiable without assistance from Energizer.BOTTOM LINE:1. These are excellent batteries when used properly and in the correct equipment. In consideration of the longer storage and discharge interval, my recommendation would be to use lithium cells for those appliances and equipment requiring longer replacement intervals such as fire, smoke and CO2 detectors; water sensors, outdoor sensors, digital cameras and remote controls to name just a few.2. Avoid storing these cells in extreme temperatures-cool, dark and dry is recommended for maximum shelf life and safety. Avoid storing lithium cells in the refrigerator or freezer.3. Energizer's lithiums are, in my opinion, no better than those manufactured by other reputable companies. As such, price shop. If store (generic) lithiums are available, shop prudently with your wallet.

With these kinds of choices in the market, you need to consider factors not often addressed by the manufacturer of many of these seat cushions.  For example, your weight DOES indeed matter in selecting a cushion which will retain its firmness, resiliency and not collapse in a year or so. Another important variable not discussed is the slope and position of your driver's seat and the specific vehicle you are driving in the overall equation for a comfortable and orthopedically-sound seat.  Remember....All cushions are not created equally!Because of these important factors, it is necessary to do your research and not exclusively rely on other customer's reviews since we ARE all created differently-e.g. body mass, weight, size, somatotype, etc.  My suggestion is to use customer reviews as a starting point and then contact a few manufacturers before you make a purchase.  Remember that unless you purchase directly through Amazon (or a similar vendor with a liberal return policy), many manufacturers will not permit returns once you have used the product for reasons of hygiene.  The following product assessment takes into consideration use by an average individual (less than 180 lbs).PROS:1. Polyurethane foam wedge appears to retain its shape and density reasonably well after 6 months of daily use.  This product is a step better than the mass-marketed ""Seat Solution"" which penetrated the tele-ad market a few years ago.2. When properly positioned and used, this product can reduce tailbone and lower back pressure for some.3. Washable, zippered ""velour"" cover is very practical.4. Easy to adjust-Product weighs 15.5 ounces.CONS:1. NOTE: This product was not designed to properly fit many SUV's having bucket seats with slightly raised side panels. (e.g. Toyota RAV4 and many other similar vehicles).  The product measures 15 3/4"" x 13.0"".  If you use this cushion with vehicles having raised side seat panels, it will not fit properly and the cushion will become compromised and not offer the caliber of orthopedic protection claimed by the product manufacturer.  Please take this into consideration before purchasing. You may also want to contact the manufacturer prior to purchasing to insure you receive the correct cushion if applicable. Here is the contact info: Kinetic Diversified Industries, Inc.  1 (800) 451-6206.2. The carrying handle appears to be an unnecessary feature which does not contribute anything substantive to the product.3. When exiting the vehicle, the cushion moves significantly and frequently and does not remain in driving position.  With this in mind, a Velcro strip attaching the seat cushion to the seat material would have been a better feature than the ""carrying handle"" for a cushion weighing only 15.5 ounces!3. Grossly overpriced for a simple 1 1/4"" thick polyurethane wedge (at its smallest point) in my assessment-should not cost more than $24.99 MSRP.  ""Made in the USA"" need not equate with twice the market price!BOTTOM LINE:1. Acceptable product but only marginally better than the old ""Seat Solution"" which I have tried.2. Not worth 2X the price of the Seat Solution at a steep $50.  Note: Tush Cush now offers a more expensive version of this cushion designed for folks weighing over 200 lbs. at $56.3. Check with your medical professional for better alternatives on a true orthopedic seat cushion through your physician.  Some of these medically-necessary designated cushions and other appliances may be covered or subsidized by your health insurance carrier and are top quality.Be safe and comfortable!","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K19CK2RXY44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X2KNUC#wasThisHelpful","R34K19CK2RXY44","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: No...I am not a professional mechanic or a Toyota sales/service rep. However, I am a discriminating consumer who recently purchased a '12 RAV4 V6 and love it.  Understandably then, I was particular when it came to searching for a premium-quality oil filter for my spunky little jack rabbit RAV.PROS:1. A genuine OEM oil filter manufactured specifically to match the performance specs and tolerances for specificToyota vehicles.2. This type of design permits you to inspect the spent/used filter media to assess the overall performance of the filter-A real plus in my opinion compared to sealed, traditional screw-on cartridges.3. Both filter o-rings are supplied pre- lubricated making for a more convenient installation job.4. The yellow filter media provides an excellent contrast to identify the contaminants captured and filtered, providing a good performance-barometer.5. At $6.47, with free S/H, this deal is hard to beat.6. Installation directions are clear, in English and conspicuously appear on both the filter box side panel and end flaps.CONS:1. A bit messy and more time-intensive for DIY's who prefer a more conventional cartridge-type canister that simply screws into the engine flange. Remember, there are no cartridge-type screw-in oil filters available for vehicles requiring this type of oil filter, like most RAV-4's.BOTTOM LINE:1. Nearly 99% of automotive oil filter manufacturers (regardless of brand/make), achieve differences in the thickness of their filter media within a parameter of only 1-2 microns.  This means that unless you intend to race professionally or consistently haul/tow vehicles or heavy payloads, the differences are marginal at best and negligible for most of us who simply drive 12-15K/year.  Therefore, there is no need to consider a more expensive oil filter promising only questionable and exaggerated claims.2. Purchase the least-expensive OEM oil filter for your specific vehicle and be assured that you are complying with your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for properly servicing your vehicle.  The added benefit of this is that you are also insuring that you will not compromise the warranty on your vehicle should any major repairs be necessary by using aftermarket filters/parts that may have slightly different fitment tolerances with your engine block.  Keep all of your service receipts as proof that you purchased OEM Toyota parts.  Now....Don't worry and enjoy your vehicle!3. Change your oil regularly. This is the life-blood of your vehicle.  Change at 3K for your initial oil change and then at 3-5K intervals based upon your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KDZSO71BR2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C65DYQ#wasThisHelpful","R18KDZSO71BR2R","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a very good pair of what I would call ""Hybrid"" sun/safety glasses....look no further.  Actually, I discovered these glasses accidentally through a friend who is an electrician who gave me a pair when I misplaced mine.  Initially, I thought it looked like junk-I was most surprised and here is why:PROS:1.  These glasses are supplied by a company that manufactures safety eyewear for contractors so they tend to be well made especially for the $8 price per pair.2. They meet or exceed the performance standards for ANSI Z87.1+ and provide 99.9% UVA and UVB protection.3. Each pair is supplied with a lanyard for removing the glasses temporarily without losing them-Very convenient.4. The shape of these glasses are contoured and provide side protection.5. Composite rubber nose piece is excellent in preventing slippage if you sweat heavily.6. Very stylish pair of glasses offering good sun protection for an excellent price.CONS:1. These are unpolarized sunglasses, so please take this into consideration if you prefer a polarized lens.  Polarization is a useful feature if you  are especially sensitive to glare. When light reflects off of flat surfaces, such as water, the light waves align in horizontal patterns, creating intense glare. The filters in polarized lenses block these horizontal light waves, substantially reducing blinding glare. However, In some instances, polarized filters react with the tints in windshields, creating blindspots and diminishing the visibility of LCD readouts in your auto equipment, such as GPS navigation systems. If this occurs, you should consider mirrored lenses as a glare-reducing alternative for driving.  Remember...you will spend at least $20-$30 for a cheap drug store pair of polarized lenses.2. Each hinge is secured by a jewel-sized Phillips screw. I have found (after purchasing 6 pairs of these glasses), that these glasses do not adjust well by tightening the screw into the plastic frame. The screws strip easily.  If one of the hinges is looser than the other my advice is simply to leave it alone.  This appears to be a quality control issue but for $8, I'll accept it.3. The Nemesis lenses appear to soil easily from epidermal oil from your skin and especially to sunblock and other types of oil-based preparations.  The blue tint of these lenses seems especially difficult to keep clean.BOTTOM LINE:1. All variables considered, you will not find a better pair of hybrid sunglasses for the money. Remember...these are sold by a company that manufactures and supplies safety glasses to contractors and other industrial and commercial suppliers.  You will not find these glasses at CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens or Wal Mart.  If these were marketed exclusively as a retail package I can assure you that both the quality of the product would likely be compromised and the cost would be doubled or tripled!2. To clean the lenses well, pick up a box of Zeiss Lens Cloths (they are supplied in boxes of 50 disposable wipes) and are specifically designed for properly and safely cleaning lenses.  They do a great job, are made in the U.S. and the wipes are very inexpensive-about $2 a box. Here's the UPC: 0-74887-54410-0.3.  This is essentially a ""hybrid"" product, functioning as both sunglasses and ""safety eyewear"" and the package states so. However, this will not replace the need to wear face shields, mask(s) or other appropriate eyewear if you are doing anything other than driving an auto or using them for casual and non-impact work or walking.4. Grab these while they are still available. They provide the most bang for the buck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"We have enjoyed vanilla wafers for years. Compared to commercial brands of these wafers in the U.S., there is absolutely no comparison whatsoever in terms of both quality of ingredients and taste. For the most part, wafers produced in Europe have always remained superior. This is largely because they have eschewed all or most of the artificial colors, flavors, dyes and preservatives that have been pervasive in the U.S. market for decades, thanks to the large conglomerates that now control most of the U.S. food and snack industry.Loacker has been a standard in these types of snack wafers for decades in Europe and has become more widely distributed and imported in the U.S. within the past 12 years or so. They are now regularly stocked at Whole Foods Markets, Wegmans and many major retail supermarkets throughout the U.S.We have tried nearly all of Loacker's interesting flavors (Tiramisu, Coconut, Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Lemon, Almond and Hazelnut) but continue to return to vanilla for its simplicity and integrity.  My wife adores and devours these 'lil cubes  like a well oiled shredder so I need to buy in bulk.  Here is my review:PROS:1. Good ingredients without unnecessary preservatives, artificial colors or flavors.2. Imported from EU (Either Italy or now Austria)3. Convenient bite sized wafers.4. The smaller 4.4 ounce pouches stay fresher compared to the larger sized retail pouches.5. Proportionately lower in sugar than any competing commercial brands.6. Contains genuine vanilla bean pods.CONS:1. Loacker has been manufacturing these wafers for decades at their plant in Italy.  They are now producing these in Austria and are not quite as tasty or flavorful as those which were produced in Italy.  To a discriminating palate, they are a bit dry and lack the rich vanilla note they were always known for.  My guess is that they have slightly altered and diluted the recipe (taking a ""lesson"" from Nabisco and Keebler's notebook!).2. Cost for these wafers continues to be increasing as import fees rise. The 6 pack of 4.4 oz. wafers appears to be only available through Amazon. The better deal is to purchase the regular retail 8 oz. pouches.BOTTOM LINE:1. Still an excellent choice for the vanilla wafer purist although a bit dry.  Pairs well with good vanilla ice cream or sorbet.2. Try some of the other competing brands of wafers now imported from Italy, Germany (Bahlsen), Belgium and France (Burry Lu line) and shop for price with all other variables being equal-you will not be disappointed!3.

"I have tried diligently to locate the OEM recirculating charcoal filter that originally came with our GE Microwave Oven (Model# JVM-190K). I both found and compared each of these filters and here is my honest assessment of the JX81 filter purchased from Amazon for your consideration: Part#: WB2X4267:PROS:1. This filter installs easily and slides on an angle down into the two metal brackets on each side of the assembly. It measures true to scale at 17.5"" x 6"" x 5/16"" thick.2.  The filter has a light caliber latticed aluminum frame holding a thin charcoal medium.3.  This particular filter is significantly more cost effective compared to purchasing same from other suppliers including GE which sells the OEM for $43.CONS:1. Compared to the OEM filter that came with the microwave, the differences are stark and disappointing. The original recirculating filter was manufactured for GE by: D-Mark, Inc., Mt. Clemens, MI 48045-Phone#: 1-800-343-3610 or 1-586-949-3610. The OEM filter frame is twice as heavy and the charcoal filter medium is also twice as thick as the JX81 Amazon filter just purchased.2. According to GE, (who I contacted), these filters should be swapped out every 6 months and at least every year.  In addition, they are NOT intended to be re-cleaned or re-used per manufacturer's directions. This makes it a relatively expensive proposition with little measurable or observable usefulness in my opinion. Without any specific metric to measure the product's performance at eliminating smoke and odors, it seems to have only marginal usefulness.3. Aftermarket recirculating charcoal filters designed to fit this appliance are without question, of poor quality. My best guess is that if you choose to spend $50-$60, you may indeed locate a better filter but in my opinion it is simply not worth it.BOTTOM LINE:1. Consider converting to a proper vented installation if at all possible-It will be safer and save you $$ over resorting to this type of only marginally-effective filter.2. Save your money and purchase thicker granulated charcoal sheets if available from Home Depot, Lowe's and/or other appliance part distributors if you must use this. Cut to size if needed. You really do not need the tissue-paper thin aluminum frame which will only rattle and resonate if loose.3. Look to purchase this particular filter on Warehouse Deals (An Amazon division). You can save 50% or more on this filter when and if they are available.Hope This Helps.

"PROS:1. Manufactured and supported by a U.S. company: AVS, a division of Lund International in Lawrenceville, GA. (Support#: (800) 241-7219).2. Supposedly custom- made to fit your vehicle. The box I received was clearly marked for my year and make of vehicle. Even comes with a dorky âAVSâ decal to affix to the unit.3. Responsive and accessible customer support is a positive.  Native English-speaking and landline (rather than VOIP-based) phone support was helpful and receptive.CONS:1. Hood shield does NOT extend across the entire front surface of your vehicle-only the 31"" lip of the hood.  I guess the bugs and stones have been read the riot act and instructed to ONLY land on the shield itself rather than the remaining surfaces of the vehicle's front!2. The plastic molly-type fasteners are flimsy, sub-standard and do not install properly on many vehicles for which the fasteners are intended.  Customer support suggested that a redesign of these fasteners is being considered due to complaints from customers. The fasteners are nothing more than cheap plastic toys whose threads strip easily when tightening the plastic Phillips screws into the fasteners as per the directions. These do not make for a permanent, quality install.3.  The instructions accompanying the product are insufficient for proper installation of the fasteners. Only by contacting customer support will you be assisted in making a successful install.  Better and sturdier clips, rather than 1/4"" plastic fasteners will yield a better and more permanent install.  The inadequate hardware renders a quality acrylic hood shield a mediocre product, accounting for my rating of 3 stars.4. The manufacturer claims that the hood shield is âcar wash safeâ; however, cleaning instructions inserted into the box state: âNot for use in brush-type car washesâ-A misleading statement. This statement really means that YOU can hand-wash your vehicle yourself but the shield is not designed to go through automated car washes, since well over 85% of automated car washes use circular brushes.  Not an advantage in my opinion.5. Amazonâs product description for this item indicates that it âInstalls with 3M adhesive foam tapeâ. Two problems here: a. This particular item (#: 24139), is designed to be installed with plastic fasteners (supplied in the box) and; b. There is no 3M adhesive foam tape supplied nor does the installation manual indicate this as an option.BOTTOM LINE:1. A quality U.S. product but supplied with inadequate and substandard plastic fastening hardware which requires a more reliable upgrade.2.  Quick fix for the âfastenersâ: Replace the fragile plastic Phillips screws with identical metal or stainless steel ¼âscrews for a good permanent fix.3.  My advice:  Not worth the $50 price. Pass on this unit and find better and more convenient alternatives like WeatherTech, carid.com, autoanything.com and J.C. Whitney.Hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A4YKW7SSJMU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IEZDZ0#wasThisHelpful","R2A4YKW7SSJMU2","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the outset, I will say that this appears to be a well manufactured wheel cover with the following caveats:PROS:1. Well worth the $18 compared to other cheaper imitations costing about the same.2. Smooth, non-abrasive leather skin bonded to a thick thermoplastic/rubber elastic base.3. Easy, 60 second application requiring no tools.4. No observable toxic chemical odors as with many other synthetic covers, which can linger for months.CONS:1. Caution: This cover is what I would term a ""universal/generic"" product, designed to fit MANY but by no means MOST vehicles.  If you own an SUV, this product will likely cover only HALF of the circumference of your steering wheel and thus explains my rating of 3 stars, because an accurate description of this important product detail is missing.  Great if you want 1/2 of a steering wheel cover....disappointing if you expected to receive a cover that wraps around the entire surface of the wheel handle.2. Despite the manufacturer's claim that it will fit your vehicle's steering wheel tightly, it does not in many vehicles and applications.  Try gently heating the interior rubber surface of the cover prior to installation. (Use a hair dryer).3. This cover is considerably thick and therefore adds substantial bulk to the wheel.  Those individuals with small hands  may not therefore, find this cover comfortable to grip.BOTTOM LINE:1. Before purchasing this item, verify that it will fit at least 3/4ths around the circumference of the wheel.  I would email the manufacturer before considering purchasing this product for your vehicle.2. This is a nicely-textured steering wheel cover which would be appropriate when fitting your vehicle's steering wheel properly.  It is not however, a good value if you do not care for a product that only wraps halfway around your wheel.3.

"Moen is an excellent company that is very customer-focused and sensitive to consumer feedback about their products.  With this being said, If you are seeking the OEM replacement hose for your Moen hand shower, it is available directly through Moen or discounted through Amazon and numerous other suppliers online.  Be warned however, that the price differential is considerable, ranging from approximately $40 to $149.95. You will need to shop around to find the best deal-it will NOT however, be through Moen.I  examined two of these A726 replacement hoses, one which I ordered directly from Moen and one which was ordered through Amazon.  PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ORDERING:PROS:1. Looks nearly identical to the original hose supplied.  Attractive and functional.2. Easy to install without tools; however, you may need to use some Teflon tape to seal the fitting threads.CONS:1. Moen has outsourced many of its replacement parts and this particular hose is manufactured in China.  This would normally not be a problem; however, the quality of the hose is ""tinny"", exceedingly light suggesting that, unlike the original hose (which was heavy and lasted for well over 22 years), the product is not intended to last more than a few years.  I doubt there is even a milliliter of chrome in these units.  My best guess is that the new replacement hoses do not even contain an inner hose but rather a very thin rubber film/coating, if at all.  These hoses are made to be replaced frequently and I do not expect them to withstand leaking for long.  Chalk this up to planned obsolescence!2.  The hose is delivered in a plain white box and supplied with one ""screen washer"" which is used as both a washer and  sediment filter on the spray end of the hose fitting.  These washers are also manufactured overseas and are poorly constructed.  Be careful depressing the screen washer into the hose fitting-they are designed flimsy and the screen will break off from the washer.  See my permanent fix for this issue below.3.  Moen customer service indicated that these washers were not supplied with the hose and recommended purchasing two washers at $5 each plus $8 shipping and handling.BOTTOM LINE:1.  This is an attractive OEM replacement hose but by no means is this a quality hose designed to last.  This, in my assessment, compromises the integrity of the Moen brand, long regarded in the industry as a quality player.2.  My advice for a great install: DO NOT use the ""bloated"" black screen washer supplied with the hose-they are defective.  Instead, call Moen (1-800- 289-6636) and request a domestic-manufactured screen washer for this unit.Ask for Moen Part#: 101199 with UPC Code: 0-26508-06069-8.  This is the quality screen washer made in the U.S.-It will look beige and will fit perfectly into the fitting.  I purchased two and I believe it was worth the small investment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8VNBYTMB9S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013C8M9K#wasThisHelpful","R8VNBYTMB9S3","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a new car owner, I had heard much about the new WeatherTech product line. After hearing the rave reviews of these mats, I decided to jump in and purchase an entire set of mats for my new vehicle-front, rear and cargo liner. Several days and $276.00 later, they arrived in huge boxes and I installed them the following day.Here is my honest and complete assessment of the new WeatherTech ""Custom Fit"" Liners and their Value to the consumer: (My apologies David MacNeil):PROS:1. The liners are intended to fit the contours of your vehicle's floor ""like a glove"". The front floor liners have raised edges to help restrict water and debris from surfacing under the liner. Each liner is allegedly, laser cut and measured to align with the precise contours of your vehicle. For the most part, it does.2. These are essentially semi-rigid thermo-plastic liners that are not designed to be warm or aesthetic but rather functional. If you have a truck or SUV, they are ideal.3. MacNeil Automotive Group manufactures their products in the US with materials that are locally sourced (if that is important to you).4. Materials are non-toxic, manufactured using recycled materials and comply with all federal regulations for safety.5. Customer support appears to be acceptable at this time-As of this writing, WeatherTech has native English-speaking associates to address your questions; however, a poor-caliber VOIP line compromises both ease of communication and the ""customer experience"".6. Product has a 3 year ""limited"" warranty. (See Comment Below)CONS:1. Price: In my opinion, steep with a marginal-to-questionable return-on-investment. Remember, these are simply plastic liners with shallow edges (or lips) to help contain water. As popularity of these products continues to rise and competition ensues, prices should fall. An entire set (including cargo liner) will run you about $300. To date, there are at least 5 other companies that manufacture custom fit car floor liners, including Husky, Nifty, Newark, Highland and Lloyd. In addition to Amazon, check JC Whitney online for a very comprehensive selection.2. Depending on your specific vehicle, your WeatherTech floor liners may not fit as ""seamlessly"" as you might expect: Installed as per the directions (and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to drop these into your vehicle), you may notice a 1/8""-1/2"" gap between the liner's edges and the floor contour. This gap is conspicuous, especially on the side that faces the vehicle's front door's (both driver and passenger) which can and will permit liquid and debris to enter the vehicle below the liners.3. The lips of these liners could easily accommodate another 1/4-1/2"""" as an added measure to help contain liquids. They appear only marginally adequate in my assessment, particularly given the high price.  The rear liner is a thin, one-piece unit that simply installs over the transmission hump.  In my opinion, the quality of the rear liner is below par compared to the thickness of the front and cargo liners and without question, definitely not worth the $70 price tag!!4. Be careful about which product you decide to purchase from WeatherTech. WeatherTech manufactures BOTH custom fit floor LINERS and all-weather floor MATS. Unfortunately, the photos of each product do not represent the actual product that you purchase and can be misleading.5. The floor liners are not as slip resistant as you might be inclined to think, especially in wet weather. My guess is that a second generation of WeatherTech liners will no doubt incorporate such important safety upgrades in these areas.6. These products should have a lifetime warranty, excluding of course, excessive or unreasonable abuse. Instead, the manufacturer chose to only offer a 3 year ""limited warranty"", which essentially permits the manufacturer to exclude and/or deny warranty coverage at their exclusive discretion.  In my opinion, these types of ""warranties"" are useless because they are not consumer-friendly.BOTTOM LINE:1. This product can be particularly useful if you own an SUV or truck because of its functional design.2. Check prices carefully, especially with Amazon marketplace vendors. Including shipping and handling, I saved $12 purchasing just one of these liners from a marketplace seller.3. Consider waiting for the 2nd generation of WeatherTech liners to address a few important upgrades or consider comparable-quality liners from other manufacturers cited above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OHA5QKZN6CN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KL71NI#wasThisHelpful","R1OHA5QKZN6CN3","A39E7WVMQ653YF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39E7WVMQ653YF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd have to say, that out of the three books in this series, I found this one the strongest.  It had plenty of plot twists, the best pacing out of all of them, and complex characters.  And being that it's a trilogy you definitely have to at least read the second book before this one (the first has its own storyline and isn't quite as important).  And that being said, I will be including details from the 2nd book in this review, so if you haven't read it, you're about to find out key plot elements if you continue reading.Lisbeth is in the hospital after being shot in the head and buried alive by her father and brother.  Because she is wanted by the police, she has to remain there even as her health slowly improves because one she leaves, she'll be transferred to prison.  While she heals, Mikael, her journalist friend, is searching desperately for all the key evidence that will prove her innocence, and gearing up for a big expose of his own in which several key government officials will have much to worry about.  The problem is that there's someone trying to shut him down before he can destroy an organization that has long been hidden in the shadows.Lisbeth was more likable this time around.  She's still strange, but she shows a little more humanity in this book and it makes you start to sympathize with her even more.  She also does what she wants though, and is very independent.  Mikael I liked at about the same level, which is to say not much at all.  I find him too ""perfect"" and his ease of getting women into bed unbelievable.  It kind of detracts from the story honestly (not the sex scenes, just the fact that he's in them).  Yes he is a good guy, just not one that I like very much.  Erica featured a little more in this story, and I was glad to have more information on her, because I find her character interesting, albeit a  little strange.The pacing was much better in this book.  Sure there's still more detail than you really need, but its more condensed and the story moves along at a moderate pace.  It wasn't as hard to drag yourself through the first half of the book (like you had to with the others).  I also liked that it tied up the loose ends, yet was still exciting and had you at the edge of your seat for most of it.  I found myself getting frustrated with the bad guys, which is a good emotion to have when you're reading a book, it means it's written well.This was definitely a strong conclusion and my favorite book out of the three.  If you haven't tried this series and like suspenseful books with maybe just a tad too much detail, this is definitely one to check out.The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's NestCopyright 2007658 pagesReview by M.

"I've become a fan of this series since reading them.  Which is why it pains me to give this book only three stars.  But if I'm being honest,  I was utterly bored for the first half of this book.  Which is exactly the same way I felt about the first book as well.  And as good as the 2nd half is, well, if only half a book is riveting...This book is the second in a trilogy, however, I do think it could be read independently of the first book.  They are completely different storylines and you wouldn't lose much detail.  However, the third book you have to read after this one, and it could not be read before.  Lisbeth is in trouble.  Despite her being socially off, she did not commit some murders that the police are pinning on her.  Even though all the evidence points to her.  She has to evade the police while trying to figure out what happened and only has a few friends she can count on.  Namely a journalist who she had helped in the past but decided to cut ties with, and her old employer.  The truth is out there, but Lisbeth has a lot of odds stacked against her and a ton of people looking for her.Lisbeth is an odd character.  She certainly isn't likable, but because of all the injustices against her you can't help but root for her.  She's also incredibly smart, so much so that things that are difficult for most come easy to her.  And it's why she can survive when it seems like everyone is out to get her.  Mikael, the reporter, I find too much of a ladies man.  His relationships never seem authentic.  And while he's a kind person, he just doesn't hold a lot of appeal to me.  It was the side characters that really made the story this time.  Great officers, both good and bad, with detailed personalities.  It was like you were interacting with real people.  And the characters are where the strength of this book is.  Without them, it would simply be an action story.The level of detail in this book is astounding.  And I think that is what made the first half of the book so slow and hard to get through.  I really didn't care about every single piece of furniture that Lisbeth bought for her apartment, down to the exact name from Ikea.  Or what precise shade of clothing everyone was wearing.  I just wanted it to get to the dialogue and the story.  Sometimes too much of a good thing makes it bad.  But that being said, the second half of the book was exceptionally engaging.  I couldn't put it down and stayed up way too late on a work night to find out what happened.  Only to have a surprise at the end that made me want to immiedately start the next book in the series.  Larsson definitely redeemed himself and kept me wanting more.Slow to start but a powerful finish, if you liked the first book or any books about intrigues, this is probably going to be a hit.The Girl Who Played With FireCopyright 2006724 pagesReview by M.

"I would love to tell you that I was going to give you a run down of the different favors in this mixed bag of skittles, but alas, I ate them multiples at a time and mixed flavors up so I have no definite flavor profiles.  Because they were sugary goodness and I just couldn't help myself.This new 9oz bag is a mixture of two different specialty blends of skittles.  Wild Berry, and Tropical flavors.  They were all delicious, although the predominant flavor is sweet.  Do I think it's a good idea to blend these together?  Eh, you could just buy a bag of each for about the same price and get the same effect.  That being said, I like that this bag was large and resealable.  It made it handy for not eating the entire bag at once and I was able to stretch this bag over the course of a week.Sugar is high in this, there are no redeemable ingredients, so I can't say much about the nutritional value, except there really is none.  But it's candy, so I didn't expect there to be.  What is redeemable, is that skittles are vegan and have no animal products so that's kind of a bonus when so many candy products contain gelatin, which is an animal product.Nice big bag of skittles, you can't go too wrong with that.  Resealable bag so  you don't make yourself sick eating them all at once.Review by M.

"My boyfriend says this is the best jump rope he's used yet.  And he's used a couple, including a pricier one he bought at the sport's store a few months back.  In his opinion, this is far superior.  And in my non-expert opinion, I found this one to be far easier to use than his other one so I agree with his assessment.This is a very lightweight rope.  So lightweight I was worried at first, but those worries were unfounded because even outside in the running trail parking lot, there was no problems using this rope in a small breeze and normal weather.  It doesn't take long for it to uncoil and not be stuck in a circle either.  Just a little shaking loose is all that is needed.That being said, I did have a little bit of trouble untangling it, but I imagine that is an issue with most ropes.  It comes in a nice drawstring pouch and you can easily coil it to put it away.  The rope itself is a lightweight wire with protective coating and it has two screw/nut attachments that go at the ends of the rope and can be used to make the length either longer or shorter (it starts at 10ft.).  You simply loosen the screw and move it where you want on the rope itself.  The handles slide anywhere you want them on the rope and are stopped by the screw at the end.  They are a lightweight plastic and have a ball bearing that swivels in the center where the wire goes through.  This works incredibly well for a smooth arc when jumping and is better than other ball bearing setups I've seen.Really, my only complaint is that when you're sweaty it's hard to operate the screws to adjust length.  But this shouldn't be a problem unless you share a rope like we do.  If it's just for you, you can set it where you want it and snip off the excess length (wire cutters will be needed).  I feel like the screws may loosen a little during use, but not enough to be a problem.A nice fast rope with a smooth arc, if you're looking to add jumping to your exercise regime, this one is a good choice.**I received this product as a free reviewer's sample.Review by M.

" 0:43 Mins So for starters, this video is of the initial reaction my cats had to the toy.  As of now they barely glance at it and really only played with it the first week.  But then again, they're cats...The toy itself is larger that I expected.  A big purple plastic ball (4"" diameter) with the yellow feathery bird on a small metal bar inside.  Once activated (pull tab), when moved the bird will make small squeaking noises and bob its head around.  This happens every time it moves (trust me, I made the mistake of taking this in my car after activating it).  It comes with its own battery and that does not need installed beforehand as it is already done for you.  The battery has lasted several weeks, but they only used the toy heavily in the first week so that may not be a good indicator of time.A major plus with this toy is that it is not obtrusive enough to scare the cats to where they don't want to play with it.  The sound is on the lower side and the movement small.  They were more curious than afraid at all points.  I think really that they just enjoy watching it.  They'll bat it lightly, but there is no running around the house with this thing.  The best comparison I can come up with is that it's like watching reality tv for them.  Don't need a lot of brain-power and it's amusing.This was a short-lived toy in our household, but it's cute.  It's held up well to the cats with the exception of losing a tail feather.Review by M.

"Just Desserts is a game put out by the makers of Fluxx and I have to say that I found it very very similar, albeit with a sweet twist.  A card game, it is great for 2-5 players, and the players can probably be 8+ and up.  Game play can be as little as fifteen minutes if you're working with a savvy group.There are two types of beautifully illustrated cards in this set.  The guests, which are different comical characters who want something specific in their dessert (and some have a favorite dessert) and the desserts themselves, which are made up of different flavor components (fruit, chocolate, etc.) and can be used to satisfy a guest.  Game play happens by each player drawing a dessert card and a new guest card going up on the table (there are different ""suits"" of guest cards and only one of each suit can be in play at a time).  With the cards in your hand, you try to satisfy a guest and gain that card.  To win, you must collect the cards of either three guests of one suit, or one guest of five different suits.  If you satisfy a guest with their favorite dessert, you are able to draw an extra dessert card.  There are of course numerous other rules, but for the purpose of brevity, I'm not going to include them here.As said before, the cards are beautifully illustrated.  They have a lot of whimsy and bright colors and are made with thick cardstock.  The box itself is somewhat small and portable so you can easily take it with you to play this game at different locations.  For instance, I took this into work and made my coworkers play with me at lunch.  An average fun time was had by all, but there have been no requests to bring back the game.  I think the main problem with the gameplay is once is enough.  You pretty much see all the cards in one gameplay and so there's nothing new left to see really.  I'm sure other games could use less cards, but our particular first round (with 3 people playing) used up all but 2 or 3 of the cards.A cute game, but one that you can easily tire of.  I'll stick to Fluxx for this type of game.Review by M.

"Disclaimer/Spoiler Alert:  Ok, so I'm not really giving away the story, but my thoughts on some of the characters could give some clues away.  You have been warned.Ok, so in a way this book was almost wildly predictable, but then the author throws a curve that really didn't have any clues leading up to it, probably just to make sure noone could solve the mystery.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Death by Cashmere is the first book in the Seaside Knitters series, which means that even after this book, there will be more mysteries to solve.Izzy, after quitting her job as a lawyer, settles down on the coast to open a knitting shop in her hometown.  Of course this shop is visited by a myriad of characters who are also friends and when the young woman who lives above the shop is murdered, they speculate on the cause and questions while purling and dropping stitches.  But a lot of people are suspect and there's something not quite right about a few of the citizens in the town.  While it's the police's job, the knitters can't help but get in the middle of things.This book is not about Izzy.  I would have suspected it to be, but the main character view is from her aunt Nell.  Nell is the one who can't let things be and is investigating heavily.  And because she has the time and connections it seems like this is the most appropriate for her.  There are a lot of ""dark"" characters in this book and I can't help but think that one was purposely setup to look terrible when they really shouldn't have been.  It was just a ruse to throw off the reader (unfairly) and I think it came across as kind of a cheap shot.  My favorite character was probably Birdie because she just seems like that busybody everyone knows and loves anyway.  She put a little life in the group.The greatest descriptions in this book were of the food, not the knitting surprisingly.  While the yarns were described in glorious detail, the food made me drool and sad that there was only a knitting pattern at the back of the book and not a gathering of recipes mentioned.  I really want that recipe for pineapple fritters.  Knitting jargon was used but it took a backseat to the mystery.  And since this is classified as a cozy mystery, that didn't really bother me.  What did bother me, and as I've said before, was that in general you had a lot of clues in this book, and then the author throws a wildcard that wasn't really in character or believable.  In retrospect I can see where there might have been a few clues, but it still wasn't fitting to the story and how the characters were presented.  And I'll keep repeating that fact until the rest of you believe it.  I just was left dissatisfied with the way it was handled.I certainly am interested in reading the next book in the series, but it won't be one I rush out to get.  There are a lot of cozy mysterious out there of varying qualities and they are nice quick reads that don't demand immediate attention.  This one fits into the middle of the spectrum.Death by CashmereCopyright 2008297 pagesReview by M.

"I'd never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut before and had this recommended to me.  That was over five years ago and I finally picked up a copy at the local book store to give it a try.  The messages were interesting, but because of the book's style, I can't say that I liked it or found it to be an engaging read.Billy Pilgrim can travel in time.  He's also been to war, survived the bombing of Dresden, been abducted by aliens, and survived a plane crash; not necessarily in that order.  But then again, order really isn't important is it?  When he was abducted he was put into a zoo and mated with another female earthling.  Because of his time traveling, he is not always in that place though.  He bounces around from being an optometrist to being a lousy soldier who shouldn't have probably been drafted.  And as such eventually ends up as a Prisoner of War where he has to live through numerous atrocities, the least of which being made to wear a woman's coat.Billy is a strange character.  My take on the book is that he suffers from mental illness (not necessarily a result of the war but certainly amplified by it) and that the course of the book is his head coping with his surroundings.  Because of that I'm never really sure what's ""true"" in Billy's life.  Certainly the alien abduction is suspect, but it seems like the plane crash could be real.  Because Billy is a somewhat unreliable (but reliable to his own thoughts) narrator, I'm not sure we're supposed to know.  I can't really say I felt one way or another about any of the other characters.  They weren't focused on as heavily as Billy and I didn't read about them enough to care.So now that I have read some of the other reviews here, I've learned that this book is anti-war.  Or has a strong theme of it.  I didn't know that going into the book but there are certain parts that would make you suspect it.  The callous ""so it goes"" expression being one of them.  Used at the sign of every death it shows meaning but also a cold voice to the truth of how deaths are calculated in war.  And then there's the bombing of Dresden, which is fractured in this book and you could miss it if you're just skimming through, but still very much an important time in Billy's life.  To me this book was more a look at mental illness and potential PTSD.  Billy's mind is erratic and chaotic and he doesn't always deal with situations in the ways that he should.  If the style jumping around wasn't so aggravating to me (I prefer a linear timeline) I might have appreciated how the book read like a confused mind would, not necessarily staying in any time sequence and only bouncing back and forth like a stream of consciousness thought would.  But that style unfortunately doesn't resonate with me and instead made me want to rush through the book as quickly as I could and get it over with.  Which means that I probably missed some meaning along the way.Would I read it a second time?  It would take a lot for me to.  I'd probably gain some more insight in doing so but weighing the time against reading something new it would be a very hard choice.  I can see why this book is popular, I just unfortunately couldn't connect to it like the majority of the population seems to be able to.  This is a high-star book for a lot of people, but for me personally, it falls among the average as there are several other books with deep meaning out there that I found more readable and engaging.Slaughterhouse-FiveCopyright 1969215 pagesReview by M.

"Rutherfurd has a distinctive style to his writing.  He'll take a setting, then proceed to take you through time and follow a few families through the generations of a place.  This particular time, he chose London.We start at the beginning of time.  And then quickly proceed to where people inhabit London, most noticeably the Ducket family, with their webbed fingers and patch of white hair.  As the generations move, the plight and fortunes of the Ducket family change and intermingle with others (Like the Barnikel family and the Penny family) and they lose and win fortune several times over.  The landscape of London changes as it goes from rural to more urban and the great London Bridge is built.There are a lot of characters and it's hard to keep up as you go along.  But it's almost like a series of short stories so if you don't remember the family lineage, it's really ok, you can still get caught up in another set of characters story.  My favorite is probably the story of Jenny and Percy, the maid and the man who loved her and their difficult relationship.  They were later in the history and more familiar in how they lived, so maybe that's why it was easier to relate to them.  Not that the other characters are uninteresting, there's so many different professions and issues that each story is unique.I really do like the format of how the history is told.  Following the families through generations it makes it easier to understand the history of the area and it definitely isn't as dull as a history textbook would be.  This is a great way to learn history!  Although I can't speak as to how factual everything is.  Obviously the characters aren't real, but the way the landscape and city changed is probably pretty spot on.  There are a few stories that are a little rougher (brothels, kidnapping, etc.)  but the majority are pretty tame and non-violent.Another good one by Rutherfurd.  I look forward to reading more of his books.LondonCopyright 19971124 pagesReview by M.

"3 out of 3 cats approved this food, however, only 2 out of 3 escaped with unscathed tummies.  The Nutro Minced Salmon entrÃ©e was immediately appealing to them, just not necessarily the digestive system.This canned food is of the minced variety, meaning it isn't a pate that's all squished into the can and has to be spooned out.  Nope, this is solid, but once you get it started it will pour out like gravy and has a sauce element to it along with the chopped up meat.  These are the small variety cans, but I found that I could easily split it between my two cats for their Sunday morning breakfast and it was enough to fill them up.  The smell was about as gross as any other wet catfood, so no new news there.The cats appeared to enjoy it.  They tore into it ravenously every time.  Only, this last time, my younger cat came upstairs acting funny.  Quickly realizing that she was about to drag her end quarters on my floor, I grabbed her up and discovered that she REALLY had digestive issues.  Needless to say it was only a hour or so after she had the wet food so I attributed it to that.  One towel and one bathtub full of water later, neither one of us was very happy with the outcome (and the male of the household is traumatized for life).  So that's something to bear in mind when feeding the cats as she handled it ok before but had trouble this time.The cats like it, so I guess that's a win win.  I just wish I hadn't have had the tummy issues with the young cat to contend with.Review by M.

"I really didn't think I was going to make it through this one.  It just started out so slow and lost my attention.  But seeing as how I loathe to never finish a book I kept going, and ended up enjoying ""The Poser"" if only just a little.Giovanni has never known his father but has been especially close with his mother.  So much so, that even into his adult life she runs the show and he returns to her home every night after being a ticket collector.  But Giovanni does have one talent.  Or maybe not a talent but an innate trait that he was born with.  He can imitate anyone.  And he can do it fairly quickly upon meeting them.  He just has to find what he calls, ""their thread"" and that allows him to unravel a whole person, see them for who they are, and do an impression.  So when he's discovered, it's this trait that bursts him into stardom and places not even his mama imagined he would go.I did not like Giovanni's mother.  I thought that in the beginning she was necessary, but that her latter actions in the story were just to help move it along and cause a bit of strife.  Her personality and wants for Giovanni seem to shift and I can't say that I ever really got a definite hold on her motivations.  But she is the one person Giovanni doesn't need to imitate.  I also thought that Lucy was a great character and was swept aside too quickly for playing such a pivotal person in Giovanni's life.  But maybe that's show biz eh?  Giovanni himself is all characters and none.  He wasn't really supposed to have his own personality (although he kind of does) and instead mirrors everything around him (which is insinuated in the book with the usage of mirrors).I'm not sure what I was expecting when I read the description of the book.  I thought it would be about an imitator who is so caught up in other people that he forgets his own personality, but this book has Giovanni have no personality of his own from the beginning, not something that he would lose.  I did think that the initial break into show business and all of the details of the stage and people and really the first half of the book were slow paced and I didn't enjoy it.  But I am glad that I persevered because I did enjoy the second half of the book.  I liked Giovanni's descent into something he didn't fully understand and his exploration of a different set of people.  It seemed more authentic and less gaudy, which may have been the author's intent for all I know.  I do have to warn for the casual reader that the book can get a bit raunchy at times.  And by raunchy I mean there was a sleazier part of Giovanni's life and Rubin describes them fully.  So if you're looking for something light and comedic I would say that this book instead falls into the category of dark and not so much comedic as an exploration of humanness.Hard to start, slow to continue, but by the end it will be hard to put down.  I'd recommend this book and would probably check out other novels that Rubin will write.The PoserCopyright 2015242 pagesReview by M.

"I don't really like coffee, but I love walking into coffee shops just to smell the aroma.  All the different spices and the smell of coffee itself is very comforting and cozy.  It's like sitting inside on a snowy day with a fire in the fireplace and a hot drink while reading a book.  It makes you want to sigh out of happiness.  So a candle set that is inspired by a coffee shop?  Sign me up!Old Factory Coffee Shop set is a set of three candles in the flavors of Coffee, Chai and Hazelnut that are 2oz in size each.  Which is pretty tiny.  These fit into the palm of your hand.  They are little glass jars with a plastic screw-top lid and a large label over the front that has the flavor name and the company name.  The candles themselves are all the same color with no artificial dyes.  The are made out of soy wax.The first thing I'll talk about is the scent.  If you smell the candles unlit, up close and personal, they all smell quite wonderful.  And they smell like the flavors they are named after.  Lit candles however, are a little different.  When lit, I couldn't smell the coffee flavor at all, which was a great disappointment as I expected that to be the strongest candle.  Then there was the chai.  Chai is my very favorite warm drink.  It's spicy, smells great, and warms you right up.  This candle you could smell but there was no impression of a coffee shop when lit, just a few of the spices that hit your senses here and there.  The Hazelnut was the strongest smelling candle in this set and it smelled absolutely wonderful.  This one I burn while taking a bath and it is completely relaxing and does make the room smell like a coffee shop.  It is definitely my favorite out of the three pack.This soy wax burned fairly clean too.  There is soot around the edges of the jars, but I have not had any soot left on my walls or ceilings from these candles (a problem I have had with other soy wax candles).  The wick burns steady and I haven't had to dig it out of the wax to relight it so it seems to be very solid as well.  Although these candles are small, they do seem to be lasting a long time.  I burn them off and on and never at a straight clip, but I can see them reaching the ten hour burn they are supposed to.  The Hazelnut I have burned for five hours and it is a little over the halfway mark in the jar.So, a few problems with a few of these flavors but they do burn a long time for their size and the Hazelnut and Chai smell good.  I am hovering between 3.5 and 4 stars for these candles, mainly because I was disappointed in the lack of smell for the coffee candle.  I do like that these are soy wax, no added dyes, and burn without a lot of soot.**This product was received as a free reviewer's sample**Review by M.

"My office is always freezing cold.  I had borrowed a little heater from someone on the other side of the hall (where it is warmer) but eventually the coldness crept to that side of the hall and I had to return it.  So enter this little heater which seemed like it would be perfect for my little office.  Unfortunately, I'm still freezing and using my blanket even with using it though.This Honeywell heater is marketed as a Personal Heater.  Meaning that it isn't used to heat a room.  Which is fair, not that I'd call my office a room, I think most standard walk in closets are bigger than my office, but I still didn't expect it to heat the whole room.  What I did expect was for it to at least blow hot air on me.  And it doesn't, unless I'm right on top of it.  I have to be within 6 inches of this heater to feel any heat.  And for me at least, that's on both the low and high settings as I didn't notice a difference in temperature between the two.  If I were to use it for my feet I'd be afraid I'd have to have them so close I would keep knocking the unit over.  Well, that and I've had it sitting at my feet and it didn't even warm the material of my shoes up.Although, as part of the design, if you knock the unit over, it will automatically shut itself off.  There is a small button the bottom that must be compressed for the unit to work.  This means sitting it on a hard flat surface (I can't see it working on a thicker carpet).  There is a red indicator light that is on the front grill that shows if the unit is on or not.  And the switch for Off, Low or High is located on the top of the unit.  It is a cute little heater, with its shiny red color and portable size.  And it doesn't get too hot to the touch.  Even after running for hours I can pick it up by the red casing.  The front grill gets a little warmer.  It has a very long cord.  I can plug it in under my desk and sit it on top of it and to the side of me with no issues.But again, unless you're going to sit right on top of this thing it just doesn't put out enough heat.  It might be handy if all you want to do is set it by your keyboard and warm your hands, but even then it's sitting a little too close to electronics for comfort if you want to get the heat from it.Review by M.

"I found this dreadfully dull.  It explored the history of Vlad Tepes, otherwise known as Dracula, but being that it was fiction I didn't expect it to read like a history textbook.  Which sadly it did.The narrator is still under the care of her father when she discovers a mysterious book in his library. Drawn to it, she asks him about it and starts to learn of a terrible history.  One that is dangerous as well as intriguing and one that her father is anxious to be away from.  As a college student, he had come across the book in his stack at the library and upon researching it was thrust into a world where Vlad Tepes still existed and didn't want him delving into his secrets (or so it appeared).  Those researching had found their own books and met with mysterious fates and after the disappearance of a professor at his college, he makes the acquaintance of the man's daughter and they embark on a mission to find him.  But it won't be an easy one, as Vlad Tepes has a confusing history and there are plenty of people who don't want to see him succeed.I can't say I really connected to any of the characters.  The narrator, despite being present a good portion of the time was not fleshed out and I didn't feel as if I knew what she wanted and what she was experiencing.  She more just told her father's story and at least there was a little more character development there, and on the part of her mother, but it still wasn't encompassing.  I found a lot of the side characters a lot more likable.  I also thought her somewhat guardian Barley, was unneeded and a distraction.  I thought he was there to provide a love interest, but it didn't seem like there was any follow through in that regard or deep meaning.The plot itself could have been an interesting one  If it didn't stretch on so long that is.  I really did feel as if I was reading a history book, and I find the majority of those onerous at the best of times.  It's just hard to care when I'd rather know what happened and how the common people felt about something rather than being given endless dates, war strategies and the opinions and recollections of a few.  I also thought the ending was quite anticlimactic and it seemed rushed when the rest of the novel went at a drag.  Better pacing would have greatly improved this novel and helped make it more appealing.  As it stands, it was a book I had to read in many sittings simply because I couldn't get absorbed into it.  And considering it is a hefty book, that makes for a lot of sittings.Not for me.  Maybe if you like dates, names, and other trappings of a history textbook you'll enjoy this piece of fiction.  But for me, unless I'm reading non-fiction, a fiction book should be more approachable.The HistorianCopyright 2005642 pagesReview by M.

"I wavered between being intrigued with this book and not liking it at all.  Having received it as a birthday present, the giver had thought they were giving me a cookbook based on literary dishes.  Well, this is not a cookbook but rather a photography book.  A coffee table book filled with pictures inspired by different dishes from popular novels.Different novels such as Heidi, American Psycho, Madame Bovary and others are represented in this book.  For each novel, there is an excerpt from the book that mentions the meal in question, small footnotes that explain different things from history or the book and different facts on food at times, and then a full page picture of the meal in question that is the author's rendering of what it might have looked like.That being said, while I thought there were some very pretty pictures in this, I wasn't always thrilled with the way it was put together.  For instance, in Catcher in the Rye, it mentions a swiss cheese sandwich.  What's in the picture?  A sandwich with american cheese on it, or at least it looked like shiny yellow american cheese..  I can understand some ingredients being hard to get, but that one seems to be a kind of big oversight.  And then Valley of the Dolls, that was just pills.  Maybe the author was trying to be clever, but I don't consider that a meal at all and would have rather had actual food stuffs.  Especially since the book excerpt didn't really describe it as being a meal either.  Whereas I can understand the picture of dirt for One Hundred Years of Solitude as that was actually described as a meal.I did like the actual writing in the book.  The facts were interesting, most of the excerpts relevant and it just made it more complete, especially since this wasn't a cookbook.  The variety of books chosen were nice too.  There was both classic and modern represented, along with children's novels and adult fiction.An ok book.  I think it felt rushed and that the details could have been a little better.

"Voluntourism is becoming a popular way for people to spend their vacations.  At times it can help lower the financial burden of taking an exotic location, or if it doesn't fill that purpose, it's a good way to feel like you're helping and making a difference with your time.  Any of these reasons are good reasons for participating though, as is all the lessons you'll learn yourself while helping out in a foreign (or even domestic) locale.  Wide-Open World is actually John Marshall's story about how he and his family took six months to volun-tour around the world.Marshall had a solid job, two kids in high school, and a wife that was a little bit of a dreamer.  Sensing his family growing apart, they came up with a plan to travel around the world for six months.  But had to do it on a budget.  Enter the world of voluntourism.  They planned out different locations they would go to volunteer, pay for airflights and boarding there, and that would help them get around the world.  On average they spent about a month at each places with varying degrees of time spent being a tourist in between them.  They volunteered at an animal rescue, WOOFED around at farms in New Zealand, taught English in Thailand and spent some time at an orphanage in India, among other things.  At each they did a different type of volunteering and all had their own tasks.Marshall seems to be pretty honest about his family.  Despite his daughter saying she'd destroy his book if he wrote something unflattering about her, I have to say, he did paint her as being kind of spoiled.  But also learning, she was pretty much a typical American teenager, which can be an unflattering description anymore.  His son was a little more quiet, he didn't seem to have as much of a connection with him as he did his daughter, so while he's present in the book, he's not as much of a standout description.  And his wife.  It's clear that he loved her but that she was a free spirit and maybe they weren't so great of a match when it came down to it.  All the people they met (except the ones that rented their house while they were gone) seemed to be excellent as well and I really enjoyed reading the descriptions of the children in the orphanage, the different families they stayed with in New Zealand, and the spiritual leaders in India.  I was also pretty amused by the actions of the monkeys at the first stop in their trip.The book introduces a pretty neat concept.  How many people would just quit and risk everything to do this with their family?  It took some planning (although not as much as you think), some bravery, and a willingness to try the unknown.  It does help that the kids were mostly grown and they were not in a lot of debt.  But the book makes this traveling seem approachable for most anyone.  The variety of places was nice as well as it showed all different types of volunteering.  The only thing I didn't really like about this book was probably the drama between the author and his wife.  It wasn't blatant, but it was continuous through the book.  But since this was a memoir I can't fault it too hard for that as he was telling about his life and how he and his family fared on the trip.  Another interesting feature about this book was that it featured three epilogues.  Ok, so two were actually just chapters, but they told of what happened after the trip, and then what happened after that, and then finally something actually called the epilogue followed.  It was more that before publication things that were relevant kept happening so the author included them.A very interesting book, especially if you like volunteering or have wanted to find a way to travel around the world.  It introduces a lot of concepts that most won't even know existed let alone thought possible that they could do.Wide-Open WorldCopyright 2015325 pagesReview by M.

"If you have a lot of painting to do, paint sprayers can be your best friend.  They spray quickly and can cover those hard to reach places more smoothly than a brush can.  But there are trade-offs to using them as well.  Such as cleanup, wasted paint, and other such hazards.  I thought I'd compare this Black & Decker sprayer to my Graco 16Y385 TrueCoat 360.  As far as both sprayers go, they have their pro's and con's, but I think in this case, the Black & Decker edged out the Graco a little bit.  And yes I realize I'm comparing an airless Graco to a Black & Decor air sprayer, but when it comes down to it, I really don't care if it's airless or not, they both plug in and they both are relatively the same weight for the handheld part and they both spray paint.I have some dining room chairs that really aren't in the best of shape any more.  The veneer is coming off, other places are chipped and scratched, and they're just aged.  So I decided to use my paint sprayers on a couple chairs each (since I was painting two different colors) to see how they would compare to each other.  The paint was the same brand and same finish, just two different colors.  They were used outdoors with an extension cord (both had short regular cords as this is common) on a day where only a light breeze was present.The Black & Decker was easy to fill.  It comes with a hard plastic canister that you turn on your side, remove the lid, and then pour paint into.  Then you put the lid back on (there is a separate twist lid area that attaches to the sprayer itself).  Unlike the Graco, since you're not squeezing the liner to get the air out, if you don't use all the paint in this sprayer, it's easier to pour back into the paint can itself (although the Graco it's not impossible to do that, just harder).The instructions were easy to read, and although there's a lot of pieces, assembly was not tough. For spraying itself, it sprayed nice and evenly, and came out of the sprayer much more cleanly than did the Graco. I was able to finish a chair with this sprayer in around five minutes.  Because the motor is not part of the handheld, you had to have it nearby, although the air hose was pretty long.  Just be careful not to drag the airhose through what you're painting accidentally!  But it's not that hard to avoid doing so.This sprayer definitely went through less paint to paint a chair than the Graco.  I think I went through about 2/3 cups more paint with the Graco, and that was using every last drop that could be sprayed out.  The Black and Decker, because it does use air, seemed to spread the paint a little more thinly but still a nice steady coat that looked great on the furniture and wasn't too heavy in spots.  I didn't have to touch up too much with a brush.Clean-up, well, the Black & Decker was also easier in this arena, despite having more attachments.  That is, if you decide to keep Graco's liner.  If you just toss the liner, it's going to be easier to clean the Graco just because of it having less parts.  For both you have to run water and an approved cleaner through the unit to flush out any paint, and then you need to scrub down the outside parts the canister the paint was held in.  The Black & Decker could be broken down into a lot of different parts which made cleaning the nooks and crannies of the sprayer easier.Comparative weights, both of these weighed about the same with paint in them.  The Graco, since it is airless, has the entire unit in your hand, but the Black & Decker, since it leaves its motor on the ground, had only the gun and the paint canister.  Regardless, they weighed about the same, probably because the paint container held more on the Black & Decker and was made of more solid material.I favored this sprayer out of the two.  It had a nice even spray, didn't waste as much paint, and was moderately easy to clean (they all kind of suck for cleaning, that's why you don't do small jobs with them).  While the disposable liners on the Graco were nice, as was the less parts and no air hose, I think for the quality of the job, this one had the nicer finish.Review by M.

"If you have a lot of painting to do, paint sprayers can be your best friend.  They spray quickly and can cover those hard to reach places more smoothly than a brush can.  But there are trade-offs to using them as well.  Such as cleanup, wasted paint, and other such hazards.  This Graco was advertised as being easy to clean, so I thought I'd compare it to my Black & Decker BDPH400 SmartSelect HVLP Sprayer.  As far as both sprayers go, they have their pro's and con's, but I think in this case, the Black & Decker edged out the Graco a little bit.  And yes I realize I'm comparing and airless Graco to a Black & Decor air sprayer, but when it comes down to it, I really don't care if it's airless or not, they both plug in and they both are relatively the same weight for the handheld part and they both spray paint.I have some dining room chairs that really aren't in the best of shape any more.  The veneer is coming off, other places are chipped and scratched, and they're just aged.  So I decided to use my paint sprayers on a couple chairs each (since I was painting two different colors) to see how they would compare to each other.  The paint was the same brand and same finish, just two different colors.  They were used outdoors with an extension cord (both had short regular cords as this is common) on a day where only a light breeze was present.The Graco is advertised as being easy to fill.  It comes with reusable (or not) cylindrical shaped liners that go into a plastic housed body on the sprayer itself.  You simply fill this liner with as much paint as you want to use, attach to the unit, and then squeeze to suck all of the air out (there is a bubbler you can monitor to see when you're done).  You have to be somewhat good at aiming, as the liners aren't that wide, but you can use a funnel if you're uncomfortable pouring straight from the can (I was a little sloppy on this one).  The other sprayer has a bit wider mouth for pouring paint in and since it doesn't use a liner, it's not as wobbly.It should be noted that for this Graco the quick start instructions don't mention flushing it out first.  This makes a difference!  I couldn't figure out why it wasn't spraying right until I read that in the regular instructions.  So if you're using this for a first time, I recommend following the regular instructions first.  For spraying itself, it sprayed nice and evenly, albeit a bit thickly.  It came with two nozzle tips so you could change the spray width on the unit.  It did spray quickly though and I finished a chair in less than five minutes, and that's with a lot of little detail areas on it.One of the big things I noticed about this sprayer was that it used more paint per chair than the Black & Decker.  I think I went through about 2/3 cups more paint between the two, and that was using every last drop that could be sprayed out (although there was plenty of paint left in the liner that I used a brush with to touch up a few areas, didn't want to waste even more).  I'm guessing this is because of the thicker spray and the fact that there seemed to be a lot in the system itself when I was done and on the black nozzle guard.Clean-up, well, the Black & Decker was also easier in this arena, despite having more attachments.  That is, if you decide to keep Graco's liner.  If you just toss the liner, it's going to be easier to clean the Graco just because of it having less parts.  For both you have to run water and an approved cleaner through the unit to flush out any paint, and then you need to scrub down the outside parts the canister the paint was held in.  The Graco's nozzle tip didn't really take apart so easy so I just washed it on the unit and was careful not to get water into the sprayer itself.Comparative weights, both of these weighed about the same with paint in them.  The Graco, since it is airless, has the entire unit in your hand, so it does have some heft, but it wasn't overly bad to hold.  I was able to spray two chairs without having too much trouble.  And it's easy to keep track of parts since it is an airless unit and not much detaches.  Liners are moderately priced and you can save money if you reuse them and they add no weight like a normal container would since they are thin plastic.So while I liked the other sprayer better, this one had a few nice features.  Those not a fan of cleanup will like the disposable liners.  There aren't a bunch of parts to lose.  And it gets a job done fast.  That being said, I didn't think cleanup was really that much easier if you decide to keep the liners, it used up and wasted more paint than I'm accustomed to, and it is harder to pour paint into a flexible liner.An ok sprayer, but definitely not my favorite on the market.Review by M.

"Admittedly I thought this was going to be a book about women who were raised in the wild (or raised by wolves, that sort of folklore) as that is what the title and subtitle seemed to indicate. I was wrong. This is more of a psychoanalysis book and self-help than a book on myths.Estes has taken a collection of myths and stories from folklore and dissected them one by one into telling the story of the female subconscious. The motives and actions, the restrictions society has placed on the ""wild woman"" and the way that women can rediscover their wildness. She gives little lessons and advice for those who have been brought down by society and describes the process of suppressing a woman's instincts. The myths themselves are told regularly and then she adds her interpretation to the mix, showing how it relates to female psychology.This book is all about women. Men are mentioned but only in relation to women. And more often than not they are the oppressors. Although there are a few mentions of men who encourage the wildness in women. The books total theme was one of oppression though, and I was a bit surprised that even when she was encouraging wildness and restoring women back to themselves, she kept referring to arts, and childbirth, and barely a mention of science. It almost seemed like her vision of taking the female self back was still pretty traditional. She wanted a stronger woman, but one that could paint or write and take back her creativity. This might not be very empowering for those women who rather than have strong skills in the arts, are good in the sciences or math. It just didn't seem to be all encompassing.I liked the myths in the book but did not enjoy how she dissected one story over and over and over. Once would have been sufficient as I found myself growing bored with the tedium of her repetitiveness. I think at some points it was just an effort to make the book longer. And all of the writing was at that level of descriptiveness. So many words to say the same thing over and over. It made the book a bit of a slog. But, returning back to the myths I think she chose some interesting ones, and there were some that I had never heard before, such as the tale of Baba Yaga and the armless girl. She had a nice variety.I think this book would have been immensely better if it had been edited down. It had interesting concepts but they were lost in the sheer amount of words and the explanations were repetitive. I just can't recommend it based on that.Women Who Run With the WolvesCopyright 1992520 pagesReview by M.

"Ever wonder what it would be like to be a logger in the North?  So do I, however, I don't think I know anymore about what it's like to be an actual logger, just what the journalist's experience was.McEnany moved North and immediately became fascinated with the logging industry.  He tried to make friends with the locals and got himself invited out as free labor a few times.  He covers some of the figures, some of the equipment, and mostly the people in this book.Some of them are characters.  He profiles a few of the loggers, the actor Rusty Dewees, and birlers.  Although the loggers and their activities take up the majority of the book.  He also talks a lot about his experiences personally.  I think the loggers were the most interesting, especially the one that did yoga!I would have liked more actual logging figures.  There wer quite a few already but but I found them very interesting.  More so than his personal foibles with chainsaws.  The stories made this more memoir than non-fiction general.  I'm also not sure where the term brush cat came from.  I think the author made it up as all I could find was an equipment part named that.  I think a more known name for loggers would have been appropriate.A decent book but not as in depth on the logging industry as I expected. Less memoir and more facts would have made it great.Brush CatCopyright 2009226 pagesReview by M.

"I should start off by saying that No River Too Wide is part of a series.  But that doesn't really matter.  I haven't read any of the other books and I didn't really feel like I was missing too much information to really get the full story out of this one.  It was quite wonderful on its own.  There were a few flaws, but nothing that made the book a drag to read through.Jan Stoddard has finally had enough.  Having been abused by her husband for the length of their entire marriage, now that she has a chance to escape she's going to.  She's not sure if he's just messing with her by not coming home, but it's the opportunity she needs to flee the state.  But in the midst of her flight she accidentally burns the house down and knows that she must get word to her daughter that she's fine and got out alive.  But her daughter isn't willing to lose her mother a second time and convinces her to settle down in Ashville nearby so they can finally be together without fear of her father.  But there's a chance he's out there looking, and there's only a few they can really trust.First off, Jan is an excellent character.  She really embodies what an abused woman faces and the thought processes that they have.  But she was still strong and resilient, which proves that anyone can recover from abuse if they get the right kind of help.  Her daughter I didn't like quite as well but that's probably because she waffled from one extreme emotion to another.  Which is perfectly natural, it just didn't endear her to me.  They were the main characters but they were supported by a cast of other characters that were well rounded and added to the story instead of just merely being there as fillers.  Taylor especially helped the story flow and it was kind of her story as well since she interacted with everyone and had her own chapters.  My only complaint about the characters would be the need for the author to have everyone ""paired up"" by the end of the story.  Sometimes that just feels unnecessary and not life-like.This story is about abuse.  And recovery from abuse.  And reactions to abuse.  And it is all pretty accurate.  Granted everyone experiences something a little different, but a lot of the premises are the same.  The honeymoon stage, the whittling away of self, the people believe it should be easy to leave an abuser.  Dead on.  So the author did their research or has experienced it themselves, they just didn't make up situations.  And I think it's great that it came in this type of a book format as it may reach some people who don't know as much about domestic violence.  I do think that the ending happened a little too easy and wasn't as realistic as the rest of the book.  But this is a feel good book, so I can't say it was out of character for the book.This was a hard one to put down.  I definitely lost some sleep while reading it.  And now, having read it, I'm interested in going back and reading others by the author.No River Too WideCopyright 2014485 pagesReview by M.

"What a pretty little gift bag!  I was pleasantly surprised to take it out of the package and see all the different color foils glimmering.  Stacked in a clear bag with a small brown ribbon, it wasn't overdone but looked like a nice gift for someone who is a chocolate lover.There are fourteen different flavors of truffle chocolates in this gift bag.  The San Juan Sea Salt was a nice idea but didn't have nearly enough salt to it.  Coconut Macaroon was good, and you could feel the texture of the coconut in the piece.  Espresso was strong, and had a mildly gritty texture.  Salted Almond was my favorite.  The almond was definitely in there and there was more of a salt flavor than the San Juan Sea Salt had.  Mint and Cool Mint both tasted about the same and you could smell the mint.  Dark Chocolate and Extreme Dark Chocolate were also very similar in flavor.  You could barely tell the difference in grades.  But they tasted good.  There are three different fruit mixes in this pack; blackberry, strawberry and raspberry, they had slightly different tastes but I can't say I could identify the fruit in them if I blind taste tested them.  The fruit flavor was sweet and noticeable over the chocolate though.  Milk Chocolate was probably my least favorite, it was slightly sour and just didn't hold up to the other flavors.  Last of all, there was the Peanut Butter and Peanut Brittles.  One smooth, one crunchy, both good in taste.In general the chocolate seemed of good quality.  It melted in the mouth and with the exception of the brittle and salted almond, you wouldn't even need to chew if you wanted to let it melt.  But I doubt you'd let them last that long.  I can't say all the flavors were a hit, but the majority were.  And while at first I debated the value of this bag at the price, I think in the end that it was worth it as they did a great job integrating all different flavors into the chocolate without making it taste fake or overdone.A cute gift for someone or a special treat for yourself.  This is a bag of chocolates that will last awhile.Review by M.

"Keys are always interesting shapes.  When you think about the old antique cast iron ones they are whorly and swirly and like works of art themselves.  And they're shapes that almost everyone is familiar with, which may be why they are so popular.I was glad to see that this necklace was actually smaller than it appeared to be in the picture.  It's a delicate little piece, barely over an inch tall and a little under half that wide.  But that's a good thing, because any bigger and it would probably look a little gaudy because of the bright colors in the lab created stones.  But as is, it's diminutive and cute.  It comes on an 18 in. chain which for most will suspend it right below the collar bones.  It's a very fine chain as well, which is good because it doesn't look out of place with the small pendant.The materials are nice but definitely don't seem to be of quality.  The stones you can tell are lab created (although the outside ring of cubic zirconia is nice and sparkly) and the metal, while being made of rhodium plated silver, seems very thin and feels almost like plastic.  I would hazard a guess that it wouldn't take much force to snap the filigree key part right off of the pendant.  It needs to be handled with care.  I also don't see the clamps holding in the stones as being super secure either.  It's only a matter of time before one of these stones will fall out probably.It's a cute necklace but I can't say I'd go for the price point on it.  It reminds me of something you could pick up at just barely in the double digits at one of those teenage jewelry stores in the mall.  Pretty, but not quality.Review by M.

"When you read this cover, Curry: The Story of the Nation's Favorite Dish, you expect it to be more about the actual dish curry and its origins.  Not quite, this is actually a book about how the dish impacted Britain, and to a larger extent Europe's food, grocery and restaurant businesses.Basu goes and explores how curry came to be a popular dish in Britain and the different people who brought it to its success.  She tells the history of the people who came up with the packaged dinners, the cold case dinners, the different restaurants, and the different regions of food that are cooked.  The book is more about the people than the food and it shows how they got to Britain and built their respective empires.Since this book is about the people it tells from when they came to Britain (or their parents who started the business), where they came from, and how they built their business from humble beginnings into something larger.  It never really explores the people that eat the curries though, just the people that sell it.  And I'm still not sure I understand why it is such a popular cuisine in Britain even after reading this book.  I think a little more of the story on the other side of the plate would have been very helpful.I also found this book a bit pretentious.  It only showed the empire builders, not the average family owned restaurant (unless it was Michelin starred in most cases).  It also had a disdain for formulaic curries and really ""curried"" favor with those that did something innovative.  I wanted to learn about the cuisine as a whole and it was hard to do that from this book because it just focused on the upper class eateries and the new dishes that were appearing with premium ingredients.  I wanted to know just what a formulaic curry was as it's not a description in my vocabulary and to see instances of it.If you're looking for a restaurant guide to the finest Indian restaurant's in Britain this will be good but I think that there's a limited scope on the audience for this book.  Not enough about the food in my opinion.  When I read a book about food I want to almost taste it from the descriptions.

"Wow, was this ever gross.  In fact, the only reason this product is getting a 2 star from me is because the design worked just fine in the Keurig machine.  Otherwise, I couldn't find any redeeming qualities to this coffee.Coming as a 24 unit K-cup box, this is the Marley Coffee Brand in the Spiced Root Rum flavor.  The taste is reminiscent of scorched, blackened water.  And while brewing I was sure that someone had shattered a bottle of rum on my kitchen floor.  Everything about this coffee was overpowering.  And the downside is, for all that bad tasting, rum smelling liquid, there's no alcohol in it, so you can't even get drunk to make those things fade away.  Out of the four people in the household that tried it (I had guests for Thanksgiving who are huge coffee drinkers) zero people liked it.  None, we all got through a little of it and ended up throwing most of it out.  And also throwing out the rest of the box of K-cups, which I hate to do because it's wasteful, but I couldn't even see using this coffee in baked goods.Not a good one for me.  I might consider other flavors from this brand, as long as the coffee beans don't taste blackened, but this flavor I would definitely never try again.Review by M.

"This cord has become my new charging cord for my phone.  Between the color and the ease of use, I found myself quickly falling in love with it.I'm continually fighting my charging cords for my phone.  I'm either tethered to an outlet because the cord isn't that long (2 ft.) or I'm tethered to my laptop by the same amount of distance if I use the USB port.  Not so with this cord.  I still have to plug it into either an adapter for the wall or the USB port on the computer, but since it is 6 ft. long I have a little autonomy of movement.  It charges just as fast as my normal charger does as well and I actually use it during the day when I'm streaming radio from my phone at work to keep my phone charged as well.But a phone isn't the only thing it fits.  Anything with a Micro port like a camera will hook up to this cord as well.  And the USB is a standard sized USB so it is going to fit most computers.

"The Scavenger's Daughters, the first book in the series of the same name, was engaging and interesting.  Tangled Vines is the next in the series and continues the tale of Benfu and his family.Linnea has just opened her clothing shop and her vintage t-shirts are a smash hit.  She's made a few new friends and her boyfriend is as attentive as ever.  So when she finds out about her adoptive parents missing daughter, she wants to make sure everyone is happy and goes out in search of her.  The missing daughter, Li Jin, has troubles of her own though, in the form of an abusive, manipulative boyfriend who is causing great harm to her and her son.I never really felt as if I was in China with this book.  The characters seemed no different than anyone I would encounter at home.  I would expect that there would be some cultural differences, but there didn't seem to be.  Maybe this is true to life, but I can't imagine there would be some difference.  Everything always went easy for the characters too, they never really had any strife and I felt that this made it harder for their characters to develop.  Linnea, the main character in this book, seemed kind of selfish this time around.  Li Jin, she had a sad story, and I could empathize with her to a point, but I never felt connected to her character.Everything was too easy in this book.  I can't stress that enough.  And it was predictable.  I do like that the tone of the book was older though.  It was much more graphic than the first book and there were details on sex, rape, domestic violence, and a few other adult themes.  Definitely more grown up than the first book.  And I think they were important topics, although I was disappointed to see that some of the plot lines weren't resolved.  By the way the book ended I don't expect to see them resolved in the next book either.  Some history was thrown in.  The Author has definite views on Mao and the cultural revolution, but some details were added in and there were points about female sterilization and other atrocities committed that I had never even heard of before.Not as good as the first but definitely not bad enough to make me stop reading the series.

"I usually don't sleep with a pillow.  If I do it's a thin small one.  I'd heard a lot of good things about memory foam, and thought that this would be a good pillow to switch to as in theory it's supposed to meld itself to what you need.  After sleeping with this pillow twice, I certainly will never use it again though.The pillow came in a nice cylindrical bag that I have no hope of ever stuffing the pillow back in again.  (On a separate note, it must be some machine that can fit those things into a bag without ripping the bag).  The bag had a strap for carrying it.  So great if you're able to stuff it back in and want to take the pillow traveling with you.  The pillow itself was quite heavy, much heavier than I'm used to, and it is solid.  It has a bamboo print on the white cover, and this relates to the pillow cover being partially made from bamboo (and rayon).The pillow was very dense and not yielding to pressure from sleeping on it.  And it held its shape; didn't conform to my head or shoulders very well.  I had such a back and neck ache from using it that I slept worse than I normally do and the ache continued during the rest of the day as a result.  I would imagine that only people who like using a lot of pillows (2-3) and firm ones will appreciate this pillow.  The rest of us are going to hate it and not get a good nights sleep.  I had someone try it out who is used to using a lot of pillows while sleeping and while they liked it at first, it was too much for even them after a few days.  Now it is resting on my guest bed for some unfortunate person who decides to stay with me to use.  Because I will not sleep with it again.  The only thing I can say that was a benefit for this pillow for me was the fact that it was so dense that it stayed cold and didn't heat up in the night.Not for me, but if you like really hard, big, pillows it wouldn't be too bad.

"I found Angels & Demons, the first book in this series, to be much more engrossing than this book.  Which is surprising considering this was the one that had all the hype surrounding it.About a year after he helped save the Vatican, Robert Langdon is embroiled in a mystery and a murder once again.  This time it is in Italy, where the curator of the Louvre has been murdered and strange symbology points to his killer.  The deceased's granddaughter is along for the ride too because clues that he left her say she should stick to Langon to solve his murder.  A strange monk is intent on finding them though and there are other mysterious players that would like to do anything to prevent Langdon from solving the clues left for him.Sophie wasn't nearly as strong of a character as her predecessor.  She needed Langdon for almost everything; except for a few things she conveniently knew.  She didn't offer much in the way of dialogue either.  Langdon was little better.  He seemed less personable this time around and like events were outpacing him.  But at least he wasn't as ""invincible"" as he was in the first book.  I couldn't really care for any of the other characters too.  I predicted the bad guy pretty far in and wasn't surprised to see other characters do some of the actions that they did.  All were pretty predictable.The plot I was pleased to see was done in a twenty-four hour format again.  I think this helps the book pacing, although this one was still a little long.  And I'm not going to comment on how accurate this book is except to say that it is a work of fiction and I read it as such.  If some of the stuff in it is true, that's great, but it has no bearing on my enjoyment of the book as a work of fiction.  I did find the symbology interesting, and liked the references to Da Vinci.  I thought the beginning offered an interesting premise and was a better lead-in than that of the first book, but the ending felt contrived and too easy.  Everything falling into place when life doesn't really work like that.Not great, not terrible, not as special as I had been lead to believe.  It was entertaining, but I think it seems like this was a book that was written for tv.The Da Vinci CodeCopyright 2003454 pagesReview by M.

"Stories about domestic abuse and overcoming obstacles always speak out to me.  You want to know that with all the unfairness in the world that there is a reason for it, that it can be overcome.  Tell Me of Brave Women is all about domestic abuse, and the women who set out to fight it.Tell Me of Brave Women follows three different women and to an extent, one man.  Samara is a storyteller, who has traveled around the world with her husband, and in her travels, helped to found Secret Sisters.  Secret Sisters is an organization that helps battered women around the globe.  Thelma is a bartender in Appalachia who witnesses a brutal domestic attack and despite not liking ""weak women"" finds herself drawn to the victim and willing to help.  Evangeline was taken hostage by a crime lord and forced to become his slave in all ways. While she has freedom sometimes she chafes under his rule and the violence with which he lashes out at her. Hassad is an inspector in a country where women are considered less.  He has to follow his superiors orders, even if they are not always honorable.I can't say that I really liked any of the characters except for Thelma.  They didn't ring as authentic for me.  Samara, while an interesting storyteller, was hard to follow because of the way her timeline and story jumped around.  I could empathize with her to a point, but understanding her motives was difficult at times.  Evangeline was a little better.  She was forced into a situation but still tried to make the best of it and do what she could to help others.  She was the bravest out of all the women by far.  Thelma was a good woman but probably had the simplest storyline of the bunch.  She witnessed something happen, didn't like it, and sought to change it.  Her storyline was much more convincing than all the others and fit with what her actual abilities would have been.  I was glad to see, that although there were some seriously evil men in this book, there were also quite a few that were good and exhibited positive attributes.  Too often books with a women empowerment theme will have every male character as horrible, and that was not the case here.This book jumped around a lot because of all the different point of views. To add into that, one of the characters, Samara, had a storyline that jumped all over in her history and the present, which added another layer of confusion.  The writing was jumpy as well and not quite as polished as I would have expected.  The voice seemed young and while that was appropriate for Evangeline, it didn't fit the rest of the characters.  There were also some action scenes that I had trouble swallowing as well.  I think condensing and restructuring the book would have really benefited it.  That being said I think the theme of domestic abuse is a pertinent one.  It shows a group of characters willing to do something about what they see as an injustice in the world and to help women who need it wherever they may be.  The ""Brave Women"" of the story didn't have to do anything outstanding, just being a voice for the unheard is brave.  So on those merits, this book is important.I like the concept of this book but just couldn't quite get into the execution.  But those who have read about domestic abuse, or gravitate to books that tell a story through different characters will probably be able to sink in quite easily with this book.**This book was received as a free advanced reviewer's copy**Tell Me of Brave WomenCopyright 2013498 pagesReview by M.

"It's been a long time since I've held a control for a Nintendo console.  Since Nintendo 64 actually.  But now that I have a Wii U I decided to give it a try again.  After all, it's become abundantly clear that I suck at using a Wii remote and the game pad, so maybe I need to timewarp back to something I'm used to.This controller is actually more like that for the Gamecube, but it is slightly reminiscent of the controllers that came with the 64.  There are two toggles, an arrow button, and four buttons on the right side that are A, B, and X buttons.  There are also some buttons on the top of the controller and of course the start and select buttons in the middle of the unit.  All are easy to reach and the grip is ergonomic.  I played for a few hours and didn't experience any type of pain in my hands from prolonged use.I used this controller to play Rayman and some Nintendo classic games and it was hard for me to figure out which button did which at first.  Once I got the hang of it though it was easy to use and click the buttons you intended to.  All were easily reachable and while I have small-average size hands for an adult I had plenty of room which makes me think that the average child should be ok to use this controller as well.  I had the buttons set up for the toggles and arrow button to control direction, A and B performed the same function (jump) and the two x buttons were the same function (hit).  The left and right top buttons also performed the same function (run).I was a bit surprised to see a wire on this controller.  I thought they all were wireless anymore.  But this was almost wireless in that it plugged into the Wii remote to use.  So you didn't need to be close to the console, which was a relief as the cord is not that long.  You do however HAVE to have the wii remote to use it.  At least on my Wii U, there is nowhere to plug directly into the console.Bright red and blue, the ability to not have to use the remote or game pad, this definitely made using the Wii U a lot easier for me.  As someone who's stuck in the past, this controller made my playing experience a little more enjoyable.  And now I may have a hope of beating my boyfriend when Smash Brothers is released.Review by M.

"I like the Brainwavz brand.  I've tried some other earbuds from them in the past and ended up using them every day at work.  This set is ok, but I can't say I like them nearly as well.The Brainwavz Delta are the economy style from the company.  They have a cheap price point and are the every day ""throwaway"" type of earbuds that people sometimes buy.  The kind that if you lose, you're not going to be up nights crying about the loss.  These earbuds come in a plastic box with the buds themselves, 4 sets of ear tips, and an instruction manual.  Pretty basic set.  The plug is a 3.5mm L-Plug and it has a y-cable for the cord.  They also come with a warranty.For sound clarity these are good.  I don't ever really hear the difference between expensive end earbuds and regular, unless there's a lot of static so I can't say these sound less than a set of more expensive ones would.  But there's no static and everything seems to come through pretty clear.  I have no complaints on the audio.  The cord is a typical cord and gets tangled occasionally as it isn't really tangle proof.My complaints actually come in the form of these earbuds.  While the tips fit comfortably in my ears, there is a purple cap on the end of them that my hair LOVES to get caught in.  I've ripped out strands more than a few times.  So these are not earbuds that someone with long hair (i.e. past their ears) would probably want to wear.  It gets wrapped in there and then when you try to take them off you get an unpleasant surprise.  People with short hair will probably enjoy these earbuds as they won't have that problem.Not my favorite, anything that pulls my hair out presents an issue to me.  But in terms of audio quality these are first-rate and I like Brainwavz as a company.  I would just recommend their Brainwavz S1 headphones.  More expensive but the same great audio quality and they don't rip your hair out.**This product was received as a free advanced reviewer's sample**Review by M.

"I go through kitchen towels pretty quick.  Having cast iron will do that to a person.  Although I try not to use white colored towels to do any cleaning on those pans.  But I'm sure everyone, regardless of cast iron collection or not, finds themselves going through towels pretty quick if they spend any decent amount of time in the kitchen.So you would think that a pack of four towels would be a decent deal, especially for a price in the mid-teens.  But in my opinion, these towels aren't quite worth it for the price.  Four towels came in this set and right away I thought they had a nice bright color.  The red stood out well and the pattern of boxes is pretty standard for a kitchen.  They are also quite large, which is a boon.Absorbancy was good.  I used the towels to wipe up a variety of spills, dry hands, etc. and have no complaints on that part.  They also tackled grease pretty well.  Any non clear liquid shows up pretty well on these though, due to the white color of the towel, but that's to be expected.  Which brings me to washing the towel.  The stains came out of the towel reasonably well after washing.  The problem with washing these, especially since it says they are machine washable, is that the hem became completely thready after one washing.  It looks like my cat went to town on the towel and pulled out every loose thread she could (which she actually didn't, that's just what it looks like).  I would hazard a guess that some very quick sewing went into these hems.  And it's happened on all of the towels that I've washed, not just one so it wasn't a fluke.These were no better than a set of towels you could get at a big box store.  And considerably more expensive than those same towels would be at that store.  So I can't say that I recommend these.  They absorb ok, but have some other issues that make their value less than their price point.Review by M.

"Maybe if I had read the author's first book I would have been more charmed by this one.  Certainly the author was genuine and had done some off the beaten path type of things with her life.  But I just couldn't find a connection or really appreciate the story she had to tell.Having lived in Afghanistan and then leave abruptly when her son is threatened with kidnapping, Rodriguez finds herself back in the states struggling to make sense of what happened.  She stays for awhile with a friend turned a little more until he decides he's had enough of the relationship.  And then it's off to Mazatlan Mexico where she buys a little house and settles down to try to pull the pieces of her life together.  Here she makes new friends but still feels as if something is missing, and with personal problems, family problems, and other problems, peace sometimes seems unobtainable.Rodriguez can be pretty blunt about herself at times.  Especially when it comes to her choices in men.  She is very frank about all her mistakes there.  And her two sons, while seemingly important to her, actually feature very little in her life.  Yes, one comes and lives with her, but that's when she starts describing him in detail and showing a sense of caring.  She has a lot of drama.  And it gets tiring.  You want to just shake her and say why do you keep doing this to your life?  The other characters she describes nicely though and she usually has something nice to say about almost all of them.This book is drama.  It's disguised by the fact that it's about moving to Mexico and becoming part of the community there.  But really it's about Rodriguez's personal struggles and how she tries to overcome them.  Mexican culture is a second, although through her interactions with her son's married family help bring the culture to the reader.  She also mentions her first book a lot and that gets a little tiring.  After about the fifth mention, it's like, ""ok, you have a book about the beauty school you started in Afghanistan.  That's fantastic, and wonderful for those women, but you've told me this before.""  It's obvious she's very proud of it, but redundant after awhile.This is an ok memoir.  A little too much drama for me and not enough description of everything else.

"I never used to wear aprons when cooking.  But then I discovered I'm somewhat of a klutz and messy in the kitchen, so they're great for protecting my clothes from oil stains, etc.  And this one had such pretty colors that I couldn't resist.  But I can't say I'd ever recommend it to anyone.  Way too many features about this apron that made it not quite as good as it could have been.Let's talk about the fabric on this for one.  It's a beautiful chocolate brown with a light blue sashing, straps and light blue polka dots on it.  No complaint about the colors, I think they go very nicely with each other.  However, the texture of the apron is a little disturbing.  It feels like the stuff you put on picnic tables.  Kind of that waterproofed oil cloth feeling.  Only the fabric is very thin.  I understand that this is to prevent stains, but it feels like you're wearing a paper apron.  It's not a pleasant texture.  And it also means that this apron is supposed to be hand washed only (yeah right, into the washer it went with no issues!).  No apron should be hand-washed.  They get far too dirty for that to be convenient.  In all, I find it kind of hard to believe that it is 100% cotton, because it sure doesn't feel like it.The fit is supposed to be one size fits all.  But I'm not sure what that optimal size would be.  I'm 5'7"" and 130lbs and while I easily could get the strings around to tie a bow in front, it still bulged out in the front and made me look like I was smuggling something inside the apron.  And it bunched on my hips a little strangely as well.  Not a big deal if you're just cooking and staying clean, but since this is advertised as ""flirty"" it definitely didn't make me feel flirty while I was wearing it.  There is a pocket on the apron, but I don't use pockets and it seemed kind of deep for any kind of functional use.I think for the price point this apron is about twice as expensive as it should be.  While it's pretty, I'm not convinced it is functional and I'll probably use my other apron (that has softer fabric and fits nicer) more than I would ever use this one.  This is great if all you're doing is putting it on to host a party, but it has no meaningful utility in the kitchen.Review by M.

"I'm fairly convinced that this book wasn't edited.  Or at least if it was, it was a rush job.  While it was interesting subject matter, the way it was written and the numerous mistakes and spelling errors made it hard reading.Mistresses of Mayhem is a resource book that describes some of the most famous women criminals in history and the present.  In fact, some of the women featured in this book are still alive while others have been dead for hundreds of years.  There are murderers, prostitutes, and even pirates.  Background on each of the women is given, and the events of their crimes are provided.There are some bad ladies in here.  And a good one that had charges against her dropped.  And some who there are doubts about their guilt and undecided charges against them.  Because their backgrounds are provided, there is some speculation into why they did the crimes that they did.  Although their history doesn't always account for the terrible things that they did.  I hadn't heard of the majority of the women in here, and some of their stories definitely came as a shock.  It's enough to make you want to wish it was fiction.This would have been a great reference book, except it didn't really read as a standard non-fiction reference book.  There was tons of personal opinion in it  I'm always a little skeptical if in a book that's supposed to be non-fiction, the term ""white trash"" is used several times along with other non-professional names and descriptors.  It also had numerous spelling errors, places where you can tell a ""find and replace"" feature was used incorrectly, and probably the worst of all, some facts actually weren't recorded correctly (IE: two sisters names are reversed leaving the wrong one dead in the book).  An editing read-through would have caught a lot of these errors, so I'm not sure what happened.  The formatting is a page or two for each woman and it is sorted in alphabetical order.It certainly doesn't seem as if this book was actually ready to be published.  A little cleanup and it would be a good tome on women readers.  In its current condition, I just can't recommend it.Mistresses of MayhemCopyright 2002248 pagesReview by M.

"Never watched the movies, this is my first experience reading any of Brown's books.  I don't understand all the hype or the controversy.  It was mildly entertaining, and the ""clue"" format was interesting, but it was nothing outstanding or deplorable in my eyes.Robert Langdon is minding his own business when he is contacted by an official at CERN to come look at some evidence and a dead man.  Nevermind that Langdon is a professor, not law enforcement, his expertise is needed.  It looks to be the work of the Illuminati, a cult made of scientists who has a very big vendetta against the Catholic church.  Can Langdon solve the Illuminati riddle in time?  The very future of the Vatican depends on it.The characters were mostly unbelievable in this.  They had too many powers, too easily overcame obstacles, and apparently had super-human strength and healing properties.  There is no way, after some of the things that Langdon went through, that he'd want to be walking let alone want to have sex (and that's all I'll say on that).  Vittoria was a shallow character that seemed to be there in an attempt to have a ""strong"" female character.  But she neither added much, nor was very strong on her own.  She relied on Langdon's character quite a bit.  And the character and personality changes in some of the others were hard to follow and made it seem as if they weren't even the same character at all.If you ignored the poorly written characters, the plot was actually fast paced and kept your attention.  There was always some kind of action or gruesome scene to read and the clues and mysteries kept the reader engaged.  I also liked that the entire book took place in the space of a day, but didn't seem too rushed.  It was an impressive way of writing the story.  I can't comment on historical accuracies, etc.  I know nothing about the Illuminati or Catholic church history, etc.  I'm going to assume some is accurate and some is not, as seems to be the case with most fiction works.Certainly entertaining but by no means a work of art.  I'll read the next in the series just because it is a good way to spend a rainy weekend.Angels & DemonsCopyright 2000569 pagesReview by M.

"Bhutan, a country that many have heard about but few have really given in-depth study to.  Which is amazing considering their practices as a country.  Measuring how well they're doing by happiness rather than money.  But it's a country worth getting to know and so this memoir/lessons book is one that opens the door a little wider on Bhutan.A Field Guide to Happiness is part memoir, part lessons in how to live life happier.  That's not to say that you have to move to Bhutan to achieve the things outlined in this book, it just shows how the author learned these lessons in life while living in the country and following their way of life.  Each chapter has a small lesson and ties into an experience or story from the author's personal life.I never really felt as if I actually knew the author or her husband.  Which is strange because she did describe both of them, but it wasn't in-depth and I just didn't feel any kind of connection.  And the people of Bhutan were just described in general ways, there was never much of a chance to get to know any of them in-depth as individuals, just as a collective.  She wasn't mean or unkind in her descriptions, just brief, and you can tell she really does love her adopted country.The whole book can be described as brief.  I get that it was supposed to be in snippets as a lesson format to impart some of the wisdom she learned in Bhutan, but it just felt like large journal entries that were mixed with a self-help book.  The writing was clear, good even, but again, that sense of connection just wasn't there for me.  I don't know if it was the format or the briefness of the chapters, but I just couldn't bury myself into it.  On the positive side though, I like that for her lessons she tried to include snippets of her life in Bhutan.  Especially the descriptions of how the people of Bhutan share and the way they treat property there.  Everyone is striving to be a better person (in general) and that's a commendable way to live.I enjoyed the book mostly but wish it would have been something I could have immersed myself in.  I think anyone who enjoys self-help, discovery memoirs will probably enjoy it though.  I would definitely consider reading the author's other book on Bhutan.A Field Guide to HappinessCopyright 2014232 pagesReview by M.

"I read ""A Mountain of Crumbs"" and really enjoyed it.  So I was interested in seeing where the rest of Gorokhova's life went after she came to the United States on the arm of her new (stranger) husband.  Having studied English for most of the time she was in Russia, it is still quite the transition to a new culture.In her previous memoir, Elena meets a young American man who says he will marry her and have an ""open"" relationship in order to bring her to the United States.  She isn't sure what she's signing up for, but quickly realizes that he is not the man she had thought he might be and that she is lonely and unsure of how to act in this new country.  Eventually they fall apart and she is able to meet another man who will become her husband and the father of her child.  As she transitions into a way of life here, her mother still worries about her though and eventually she has worries of her own as a mother that she must overcome in order to be more at peace with her life.Elena was very much a worrier in this book.  She worried about everything.  And I can't say that I blame her.  She had a lot going on and felt very out of place and didn't have the support she apparently needed when she first moved.  Her first husband seemed distant and cold, but we are just getting her side of the story.  I do wonder if she ever reimbursed him the money he spent in bringing her to the United States, but I suppose at this point it doesn't matter.  Her mother was not as strongly written in this book either.  She was a sideline, a strife that was dealt with sometimes, and an endearing mother in others that the author recalled fondly. The same goes for her sister who is briefly mentioned.  Her husband gets a lot of detail though (the 2nd one) and I felt that he really was a good person.I wasn't as engrossed in this one as I was the first.  It was somehow both lengthy and too short all at once.  The parts I wanted more detail on (transition to life in America, customs, etc.) there just didn't seem to be enough of, and those I didn't really care about (family members Dr. appointments) there was quite a bit of.  I thought her interactions with her family were interesting, but didn't need to know every kind of Dr. her mother had appointments at.  I was also surprised at how little time was spent on her daughter as I expected that to be a larger part of the book.  Really, the best detail though was her description of encountering a hamburger for the first time.  It made an impact and showed just how different life in the Soviet Union is from here.I can't say that it was an exceptionally strong 2nd memoir, but it certainly was expressive writing.  It does what a memoir should; bring you the life of the writer.Russian TattooCopyright 2014315 pagesReview by M.

"Despite being a part of the ""Mists of Avalon"" series, this book was not actually written by Marion Zimmer Bradley.  However, it was written by a woman who did co-author several books with her, and the similarity of their voices make it seem as if they are one and the same.Ravens of Avalon tells the story of Boudica.  Boudica was actually a real life queen who waged war against the Romans.  This fictional telling of her story has her start life as a young royal who is sent to train with the druids and priestesses of Briton.  Instead of choosing a destiny as a Priestess, she decides to return home and serve her family and people best by marrying.  During this time the Romans have forced a truce with the different tribes of Briton and become increasingly antagonistic, which spurns a war that Boudica must lead.Boudica is an interesting woman in history.  Because you don't hear of very many warrior queens (although there are a notable few).  I liked how I got quite a bit of her backstory in this book and what her life could have possibly been like before she was Queen.  But I don't think I got to see enough of her warrior side, and I was slightly disappointed in that.  Lhiannon was also somewhat of a disappointment.  I didn't really like her character in The Forest House (same series) but thought maybe her younger self would be more interesting.  I still saw her lead around by the will of others and of a certain Priest and although she thought she was free, she never really truly seemed to be free.This book had a slow pace.  But not quite as slow as some of the other books in the series.  Both Bradley and Paxson enjoy detail and spend a lot of time building up history and people in the books.  This one in particular covered a lot of people in their younger days and the quarrels, loves, and aspirations that they held.  I did think that the war scenes were well done, although a tad brutal.  Since this was the story of Boudica you'd expect their to be some battles, but more time was given to history and character building than to gory descriptions and bloody scenes.  There was also some magic as well, which, depending on your stance of myth and legend, is what really made this a work of fiction.I don't think it was the best of the series, but it's not a bad prequel.  Just one you'd probably not want to read until after having read all of the others.Ravens of AvalonCopyright 2007394 pagesReview by M.

"Playing with alternative flours can be fun.  Especially when you're baking for someone who is gluten free.  Because let's face it, rice flour is disgusting (at least in my opinion) so it's nice to know there are some other alternatives out there.Viva Labs offers an Organic Coconut flour that is also labeled as Gluten Free, unbleached, Non-GMO, and Vegan.  Which is a pretty impressive lineup.  It comes in a resealable plastic bag that is thick enough to keep odors and other things out.  It does recommend that after opening, it should be stored in the refrigerator.  However, a dark cool place is ok as well.Baking with this flour can be tricky.  You shouldn't substitute it cup for cup with regular flour in a recipe as I discovered.  Because it just doesn't rise.  Instead, had I been reading the label, it says you can use 1/4 to 1/3 cup mixed with other flours to substitute for baking.  You also have to include additional liquid.  That being said, I made a cake and did substitute cup for cup with no added liquid, and while dense, still tasted pretty good.  It definitely has a strong coconut flavor which would probably make it not so good for such things as cheesebread, etc.  But good for things like breading shrimp or making dessert.  So not entirely versatile, but still pretty close.  The texture isn't bad either.  It's very smooth and not a messy powder.  Which means it won't make a mess of your kitchen.I would probably use this flour again for dessert baking, but I don't see myself using it for much else.  Still, it's not a bad product and for those who have to eat gluten-free, a great alternative to regular flour.**I was provided with a free reviewer's sample**Review by M.

"When you have knives leftover from college days, anything is bound to be better than them.  That being said, I was only half-pleased with this Bread Knife from Oxo.  While it had a good grip, it did manage to squish my bread a bit.This knife is about the average length for a bread knife (8 in.) and so it can be used like any other bread knife.  The packaging also says it can be used for melons, however, I have not had the inclination to try that out since I can never seem to eat a whole melon by myself and don't want to waste food.  It also can be used for harder, crustier breads, which is the utilization that I tried.  It cut through the bread mostly ok (just a crusty round loaf from the grocery store) but still had a bit of squishing and flattening out, which kind of defeated the purpose.  It was almost the same result I would have had with a steak knife.  I also tried it on some homemade pepperoni bread, and again there was squishing, but it's a softer bread so that was probably to be expected.I think perhaps that the blade just wasn't sharp enough out of the box, although I sharpened in between and it didn't seem to have much effect.  When slicing too, since you had to press quite firmly (part of the problem with squishing the bread) it also didn't give straight cuts and so my slices weren't as uniform as they like.  In the grand scheme of things, they all tasted good, so not a huge issue, but if someone is worried about presentation they may not enjoy using this knife as much.  At least when you're trying to hold the knife, the no slip handle is soft and easy to hold on to and doesn't hurt your fingers.I've liked my other OXO knives so it seems like just this one isn't the greatest of designs.  But it still does a serviceable job for a cheap knife and is good for your average cook.Review by M.

"Sometimes you read about a character you absolutely can't stand or relate to.  But more on that later.  This book was suggested to me, and as I always like a good conversation about books, I told him I would read it.  Hermann Hesse is a pretty well known author, although I've heard said that this book is one of his more misunderstood ones.Harry Haller is a recluse, a wolf, as he likes to call himself.  He spends his time contemplating poetry, music, books, in the privacy of his own rooms and has never learned to dance nor unleash the more animalistic side of him, despite knowing that it lies dormant within him.  When he meets a woman named Hermine, his world starts to change though.  She introduces him to dancing, pleasures and cheap thrills, and eventually to the magic theatre, where he is taken on a ride so out of the normal that he cannot tell what is real and what is not.It was interesting, when talking with the friend who suggested this book, to discover just how different he and I viewed Harry Haller.  I viewed him as narcissistic and with a superiority complex.  He viewed him as misunderstood and socially awkward.  I guess it really is true that our own life experiences shape how we view things.  My reasoning for finding Haller narcissistic were a result of his constant moaning about how the upper classes of society didn't understand or appreciate his views on art, literature, etc.  And that dancing, etc. that he secretly was interested in was considering lower class by him and more animalistic, a different side to him.  It was as if he felt himself so superior to either group of people, that he couldn't fit in despite trying.  I just found it a real turn-off.  I also didn't like the way he discarded a certain character once finished with his development of his own character.  It's like learning much from a good book and then setting fire to it when you're done reading.  Destruction with no real purpose.That being said, if Hesse's intent was to make me dislike Haller then he did a very good job.  The book is descriptive and evokes emotion, if not necessarily the positive kind.  But the first third of a book was a whiney drag to get through.  I got tired of Haller describing himself and his suffering of being alone and it wasn't until Hermine entered the picture that things actually got interesting.  I still didn't like the social interactions he had, but at least there were new characters that offered different perspectives.  The Magic Theatre was also intriguing and the images evoked from the writing were disturbing yet colorful and varied.  It was like having a very vivid nightmare.  I realize that I may not fully understand the emotions or worldview that Hesse was expressing through Haller, but I just couldn't connect with any part of him which made this a difficult read.  It was like looking at a piece of abstract art; it may appeal to some and I can appreciate that the artist had a lot of thoughts and emotions going into the work, but I certainly don't want to hang it in my house.I think you can be of two minds of this book, you either like it or you don't.  For me, I can't say that I enjoyed it, other than enjoying the debate about the writing and character motivations that came out of it.SteppenwolfCopyright 1927256 pagesReview by M.

"I love knives.  I love cooking.  I hate using my knives at home because let's face it, they're leftover from my college days and not the best quality.  I've used some of the OXO products before, so I was curious to try out their knives.First off, this is a comfortable knife to wield.  It has that no slip grip on the handle which I thought was a gimic at first, but I was slicing sausage and other meats with it and from touching that my hand got slippery with gunk (mmm, appetizing description, I know).  Despite that however, I was still able to hold onto the handle of the knife without any issues or slippage.  It also, despite being large, was relatively light weight and easy to hold.The knife was sharp.  It went right through some mostly frozen meat that I was slicing and also chopped up an onion super quick. And it only minimally had the food stick to it as I was slicing which is a plus.  Nothing drives me nuts more than slicing an onion and you have to stop and slide the pieces off the blade each time.  It still happened with this knife, just not as much and I figure that's pretty good.Cleaning is relatively easy.  You have to be careful of course since the knife is sharp and hot soapy water and a sponge will get everything clean.  Do not put this knife in your dishwasher.  Not only does it dull the blade but I can see it quickly destroying the handle material too because of the high heat.I didn't find any flaws with this knife.  It sliced evenly and quickly and had a sharp blade.  It was easy to hold and easy to clean.  Can't get much better than that.Review by M.

"Travels with Casey; one immediately compares the title to the Travels with Charlie written by Steinbeck.  And that's kind of the point.  The author thought about that classic book and then decided to do his own spin on it.  Take his dog on a trip around the country in an RV, but instead of learning about the people, he wanted to learn about the dogs of the country.Denizet-Lewis never really felt connected to his dog.  Sure he took care of Casey well, made sure he had everything he needed, but he always felt as if maybe Casey didn't want to be his dog.  There just wasn't a connection with him despite several years together.  So on a writing assignment he decides to pack it up and see if being stuck in an RV together will do anything for that connection.  Along the way he'll stop at various points in the US known for Dog Shows, unique dog parks, dog people, and other such things relating to dogs.Despite this being a book about dogs, Denizet-Lewis encounters several different people as well.  From the guy who will stop at nothing to find a lost dog, to the guy who lives with wolf-dogs, people can be just as different as dog breeds.  Some of them he describes as a bit crazy, but he takes care to show the goodness that they all have and the common bond of dog ownership.  These are all people, that for various reasons, are obsessed with their dogs or helping dogs.  And it's nice to read about that sometimes when there's so much on the news that points to the other directions.  For himself, Denizet-Lewis tells you all about his flaws, but he comes across as a genuinely likable guy.I liked the pace of this book.  While there were sections I would have liked to read more on (Best Friends Animal Sanctuary) I think overall the different snippets were enough to keep the book moving along and interesting.  I enjoyed all the different things related to dogs that he found on his travels and didn't know about some of the others (dog shaped hotel, etc.).  The only part I didn't really like was that so much of his personal life and drama invaded the book.  I think it's probably more of a memoir/dog travel book and while there was nothing particularly out there, I guess I just expected it to be more about the dogs and less about his personal anguish.  It was a mix between.  Again, that doesn't mean this book was poorly written, it just wasn't what I expected based on the title.For those that like memoirs and books about dogs this is probably going to be a good read.  It has enough whimsy mixed with enough serious topics to keep it interesting.**This book was won in a Goodreads Giveaway**Travels with CaseyCopyright 2014309 pagesReview by M.

"I usually go for the powder detergents, just because the liquid ones getting all goopy at the nozzle icks me out.  So pods seemed like a good way to go.  Just toss them in, no measuring, and you're set.  Which is great if laundry is not a chore that you enjoy.I frequently have large loads of clothes so I use two of these pods (as recommended) quite a bit.  But it isn't necessary for smaller loads.  Since I had the Free & Gentle type, there are no associated smells.  In fact, my laundry came out smelling like nothing.  Which is perfect because that is what was advertised.  It also came out clean, although I didn't notice my whites being anymore white than normal or my colors being exceptionally bright.  But again, they were still clean, and that's all I go for when I do laundry.I also like that these are in a recyclable plastic container.  While I like my powdered detergent because it is in a cardboard container and eco-friendly, at least this is something I can dispose of responsibly.So in conclusion, with this particular scent (or non-scent rather and no dyes) I have not noticed any staining, my laundry smells like nothing, meaning it's probably clean because otherwise it would smell like my workout clothes, and it's easy to toss in the dryer.

"Not going to lie, I'd never even heard of Miele until recently.  And then I found out they were quite popular and considerably high-end.  And considering I was ready to throw my old vacuum off the balcony in frustration, it was the perfect opportunity to try a canister vacuum for the first time.We'll start with setup.  This vacuum comes largely put together.  You'll need to setup the filter (which involves removing a sticker and pressing a button (although the pressing a button was a tad confusing from the instructions because it wasn't a normal button but a dye release).  You'll need to put the click button on the telescoping wand (which mine was tricky but I finally got it in the end, was afraid I'd break it first though) and you'll need to attach the hose to the vacuum.  You'll also need to place the batteries in the wand for the light feature, which requires a small phillips screwdriver.  So overall, not really that hard to setup, just hard to understand the instructions sometimes (which came in a variety of languages and was more of a summary and the pictures weren't always in English).  There are also numerous attachments that come with this unit, but all are easy to pop on and off of the wand.The canister itself is really made quite well.  It has two different compartments that open up.  The bottom lets you access the bag and the filter for changing them out as needed.  Yes, this is a bagged vacuum and requires brand specific bags and filters.  The second compartment has room for three of the attachments (brush, small nozzle and upholstery tool) and they are already located there upon purchase.  There are numerous buttons that can be activated by pressing or using your foot on the canister itself.  The on button, which starts the vacuum going, a cord return button which will wind the cord back up for you, and plus and minus buttons that control the power of the vacuum for different levels.  The cord is long enough that I can plug the vacuum in in my living room and vacuum my whole apartment without seeking out a new plug.  There are wheels on the canister that allow for easy maneuverability around the house.  Some other attachments come with the vacuum and they are in one of the cardboard boxes contained in the main shipping box.  They are too large to go in the canister itself and are a dusting brush, a larger plastic nozzle and a cap if you want to remove the hose and have the canister separate.The main head (shown in the picture) for vacuuming floors also has some settings and can be used by flipping the toggle for hardwood or carpet.  And boy does this thing have power.  At the highest setting I was convinced I could probably climb walls with this thing because of the powerful suction (although no worries, I didn't try).  But then, switching the power mode, it went light enough that I could vacuum my one carpet that even me walking gently across sometimes pulls up loops.  So that was a positive.  On the lightest setting it can even do curtains.  My only complaint about this head is that with the cat and me having long hair, it pretty much developed mats that I had to pull out and manually throw away.  It makes me wonder if I'll manage to clog it one day if I don't see these mats and remove them (I found another upon detaching the head and putting on another attachment).  But it sucked up everything on the floor that needed to be sucked up.  I tried to upholstery brush and it did a good job as well, making my couch look better than it has in awhile.  There was a plastic attachment that looked like a long pointed tube that was great for getting at the edges of walls and corners as well.This unit is exceptionally quiet too.  I'm  used to wanting to put on headphones while vacuuming just to drown out the noise and I didn't have to do that with this.  In fact, I could probably play music on a radio and still hear it.  I was quite astounded by the quietness actually.  The light feature is nice in theory, but it isn't one that you can shut on and off.  It has a timer and will go off by itself, which necessitates the need to press the button every half minute to keep the light on, which I found slightly annoying.  Sure it will save on batteries, but I wish the timer was a little longer so I didn't have to keep pressing the button.For the filters, I can't say that I really noticed a difference either way.  I'm not one of those people that goes into sneezing fits from dust when I vacuum so to me vacuuming is vacuuming.  I'm assuming since everything else works on this unit, that that part is working as well.For the most part, I really enjoy using this vacuum.  Not sure if I'll ever get used to a canister as compared to an upright, but it definitely is more versatile and can clean a multitude of things which is beneficial.  And with the suction power and quiet running, it's definitely made me a fan of the Miele brand.Review by M.

"I'm not the best drawer.  But I like trying.  And I figure if I have decent supplies then the outcome can't come out too terrible, right?  So oil pastels seem to fit the bill.  I mean, they're like crayons for grown ups.This set comes with 24 different colors ranging from bright red to black to blues, greens, and yellows and all sorts of colors in between.  Personally I think it seemed to favor the warmer tones more if we're considering the browns and earth colors to be ""warm"", but it still had a pretty good range.  It came in a nice box with a spot for each crayon, and providing you return them where you got them, there is a color chart on the inside of the box with the colors names.  Each pastel has a wide tip, about the size of a larger crayon, so they are a little bulky in that regard and you have to get creative to achieve thin lines.I'm a big fan of the blending, using either a tissue or my hand and these pastels worked great in that regard.  The layering, not so much.  Unless you're using a darker color over a lighter you're not going to be able to completely layer with these.  I can see maybe using a metal tool to take some of the pigment off a lighter color and thickly placing it on the surface to achieve shading that way, but you're going to have to blend if you go from dark to light.  They also work well for just a light coating, achieving a crayon looking texture.  Pressing harder you get a smooth shiny surface, but it also uses the pastel up fairly quickly.  I did a larger drawing on some of my professional art paper, and for every pastel I used, I used up about a sixth of the pastel on that one drawing.  So I don't see these lasting very long.  On just plain paper alone they stay true to the color you see in the box.  I didn't have any turn out paler or darker than I expected.Not a bad little kit.  I can see a wide variety of people using these for different projects.  While I wouldn't let a toddler have a go at them, I think anyone else would be appropriate.Review by M.

"Ok, I have to admit, I just got this shampoo because I thought about all the old commercials where those women were having a fantastic time in the shower because of this stuff.  Sadly, reality is not like that at all, but it's still a pretty decent shampoo if all you're looking to do is get your hair clean.Herbal Essence is known for having good scents.  This particular flavor, Mint and Grapefruit, does smell good.  It smells, sweet fruity, and doesn't have a hint of mint scent that I could distinguish.  Which for me is a good thing, as I don't really like mint.  The smell goes on in the shower but it doesn't stick to your hair (and it's gotten me some weird looks as I sniff my hair throughout the day trying to decipher if I can still smell it or not).  What's nice about this, is just because it smells like a fruit, there aren't artificial dyes trying to make it look fruity.  This is a clear shampoo.The ingredients in this bottle of shampoo aren't too bad either.  It's called ""Naked"" (they really are trying to go back to their commercial glory days!) and that means it has no parabens, silicone, or colorant in the mix.  There's still some sulfates and other things, but largely, for a conventional shampoo that's not bought in a specialty store, this doesn't have that bad of ingredients.  Still, if you're in the all organic, all natural, all healthy crowd, this may not be a shampoo you want to use.  There are a few ingredients in here that I couldn't begin to pronounce, let alone spell.After using, my hair is its usual clean.  And it will stay that way for a day or so, depending on how active I am or how sweaty I get.  Which is pretty standard for any shampoo.  For the volume part of this, I can't say I've noticed any difference.  My hair has always been the thin type, and as it gets longer it seems to stay that thin.  Although as much as I lose in a day I suppose I could say this shampoo is working just because I haven't found any bald spots, which is impressive considering I could make wigs out of what I take out of my brush every week (you really wanted that detail didn't you?).Overall I like this shampoo and will probably continue to use it.  I rotate through the shampoos I use just to keep my hair guessing, but I like to have a few different ones that I consistently come back to.  This one could fit the bill.Review by M.

"I'd love to travel, I'm somewhat scared of commitment.  These are the things that make me readily identify with the author of this book.  Even though in reality I'm nothing like her.  While she's out traveling the world, I've never been out of the country (unless you count the Canadian side of Niagara Falls).  While she bounces from relationship to relationship and seemingly doesn't care about sticking with one person at a time, I'm a serial monogamist.  So why on earth am I so drawn to her life?Eaves decides during college that she needs to travel.  Her boyfriend at the time goes all over the world and it inspires her to do more with her life.  She bounces along from Egypt, to Yemen, eventually finishing up college and going on to other relationships, to New Zealand, Australia, and other places.  She has a few more boyfriends, goes back to school again, and travels to a few more countries.  She never stops moving.  And this book tells of all that moving, although it mostly focuses on her relationships.The relationships in this book are somewhat shallow.  Eaves herself admits love to several different men, sometimes at the same time, and it makes it hard to know whether what she was feeling was deep or authentic.  Not that I'm to judge, I'm sure you can love multiple people on that level, but with the ease that she separates herself from some of these relationships, it calls it into question.  For herself, we recognize that she doesn't want to be held down.  That she likes the freedom of travel and that she seems to enjoy having superficial relationships that she can easily be freed from.  She's very solitary in a way.I enjoyed most of this book's descriptions of travel.  Towards the end it was more about her relationships, and I would have liked to have more detail on the countries she was staying in.  It seems that she sacrificed the part about travel for the part about social and her somewhat controlling boyfriend in the latter part of the book.  Granted, she was in France, which she didn't think was terribly exciting, but I'm sure there were some positive things about it and some beautiful sights.  Overall though, I thought the book moved fast and that it kept me fully engrossed in what was happening.I enjoyed this book, although I recognize not everyone may agree with the way that Eaves travels or her relationships.  I found it an interesting, non-conformist way of living life.WanderlustCopyright 2011301 pagesReview by M.

"I'm getting back into acoustic guitar, and have purchased a few of the books by Mark Hanson, namely ""The Art of Contemporary Travis Picking"" and ""The Art of Solo Fingerpicking"".  Those books have a lot of excellent content, but this is the book to start with. Simple enough to sound decent pretty quick and hold your interest, at least for a neophyte like me.  If you just get the book and CD, you'll hear Mark say things like 'notice that I'm using a capo', because there is a companion DVD with the same title that is available separately - it's not too expensive and worth considering.Update 11/21/15I've only been working with this book a short while, and have finished learning the ""Canyon Canon"" which sounds really good but which I found pretty easy to play with daily practice.  If you are learning acoustic guitar, you will want to start off with simple pieces so that you build your confidence. The beauty of this book is that as you progress, you will probably drop most of the easy tunes you start with, but these pieces by Mark Hanson will more than likely stay in your repertoire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R490Y3GYAWIO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0769200397#wasThisHelpful","R490Y3GYAWIO4","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a total guitar slide novice and have recently bought a few to experiment with. My favorite is the Dunlop ""Mudslide"" -  I really like the weight and the sound that slide produces. This glass slide is very inexpensive, so I figured ""what the heck"".  I like the compact size, but I'm not crazy about the sound. Wish it was porcelain, like the Mudslide. Cheap enough to try, though - you may love it.  :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJC67UJRB3Y4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0020YHXM2#wasThisHelpful","R1KJC67UJRB3Y4","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of the ""acoustic"" versions of this stand,  and liked it enough to order another.  Some people say it's not compact or light enough, some say it isn't stable enough - I don't agree.  First, folded or unfolded, this stand is compact and not overly heavy - despite the brand name,  I think it's more of a permanent home stand than a travel/stage stand.  Second, once the arms are opened up fully, this stand is plenty stable - Most any floor stand is not going to be impervious to kids and critters on the loose.  The one possible issue I see with this stand is the pointy front supports might not work well on a deep shag carpet or other uneven surface. That said, this is a cool stand that will cradle and display your acoustic guitar beautifully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XPHT64DL0MZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VMOD2C#wasThisHelpful","R1XPHT64DL0MZ6","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit up front that I only find slide guitar palatable in small doses.When I first attempted to play a long way back, I bought a cheap metal slide and didn't like the sound at all.Now that I have been more earnest in my second attempt, I decided to check out the Mudslide.I produces a very cool bluesy sound on my Gretsch  Jim Dandy, though I am still just noodling with it. :)Same as most other's experience, this ""medium"" slide has a rather small inner diameter - I have small/medium hands, and while this slide fits my pinky with wiggle room to spare, it's a tight fit on my ring finger.Construction is very nice, the interior finish is comfortable.  Treat it with care and it should last  forever.Dunlop even includes a little leaflet with slide facts and a couple alternate tuning suggestions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG3ST617GAAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002CZVUU#wasThisHelpful","R1RG3ST617GAAE","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great book with lots of helpful information and examples.  One reviewer lamented that this is not a ""beginners"" book, but honestly, I don't see how this style of playing could have been broken down any simpler.Why anyone would buy the Kindle version of this book is beyond me - the accompanying CD that comes with the printed book is a treasure - kinda sounds like it was recorded in someone's home studio, and the narration is pretty laid back (I don't mean these as negatives).  It's all pleasant enough, but when he gets to the ""blue"" notes section, a chill just shot up my spine.

"What sold me on giving this parlor sized guitar a shot was the positive and detailed reviews posted here plus some pretty awesome YouTube videos (it's amazing what some people can do).Even with all the positive press, when I first pulled this out of the box, I thought ""toy""!Then I tuned it,  played it and lost track of time - I love it!Yes, it doesn't project, and don't expect much bass, but it rings really sweet and the body size makes it ""extremely"" comfortable to play. The neck isn't exactly thin, but it isn't a baseball bat, either, and it has a silky matte finish that feels great.  When I get a  chance, I'm going to put a set of heavier strings on and see what happens.Bottom line, if $160 is dear to you, then you may want to see this little guitar in person first and try it.

"I have recently gotten back into guitar playing, focusing on acoustic.  I never did like the feel of the Fender picks, they felt too slick and ""brittle"" to me. My pick of choice back in the day was Dunlop nylon - they felt ok, but didn't give me the control of a ""shell"" pick.I bought a Dunlop medium/heavy assortment pack and zeroed in on these .88 green Tortex picks - they have a really nice feeling surface texture, and the .88 gauge makes individual notes ring beautifully.I am going to try the lighter yellow gauge - if you are experimenting with picks, you should definitely check out Tortex.Update 10/4/15Tried out the yellow .73 gauge, and was surprised at the difference in sound vs. the green .88's.  The .73s  produces a more ""trebley"" sound, with a more pronounced click when striking the strings, which is not unpleasant!

You are on an island where a Soviet experiment with a (then) newly discovered element went crazy wrong around 50 years ago, and you use a time shifting device (along with your guns) to save the world.For a shooter, it's got a pretty decent story, with some humorous moments (I love the 50's styled  Russian film clips at the beginning of the game) and a couple jump scares. Very nice graphics and good use of the DualShock's rumble feature.Typical variety of upgradable weapons for a shooter,  but the time control aspect adds another level of interest to the game in that it's used in a variety of clever ways to support the story , and yet  it's not bogged down with too many controls to learn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VAYL1UK8N2Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UWGCW2#wasThisHelpful","R2VAYL1UK8N2Y5","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

IF I played online a lot or IF the PS4 played PS3 games, I might feel different, but for a stand alone gaming system, the PS3 is a way better value.This console in this bundle has a 250Gb drive, which would take most people quite a bit of time to fill up.  Note that this PS3 console has a top loading drawer instead of a disc slot -  There are pros and cons to both designs, but personally I think that less can go wrong with a mechanical drawer vs. a motorized disc slot.This bundle includes ""The Last Of Us,"" which will probably be the PS3's crown jewel of game titles.

"""Scrubs"" is a great medical situation comedy series,  if you like their brand of humor, which is warm offbeat, but never too vulgar IMHO.The series was wonderfully cast  - fun to watch how they play off each other.It's good that the shows are 1/2 hour - you can get a few chuckles and get your mind off things for a few minutes, then move on.I had been waiting for this series to come out on Blu ray, but with the odd exception of season 8, this may never happen.

"Overall, I am quite pleased with this laptop.As far as the look, it's all plastic, but it's high quality plastic, if that makes sense - being a fan of HP computers,  I've seen some better looking HP laptops, but regrettably, lately, I've seen some crappy looking ones too. This one has a clean two- tone look. All of the connector jacks are nice and snug. Keyboard is chicklet-style, and feels nice - you can turn the keyboard backlight on and off with the F5 key.Sound-wise it isn't bad for a laptop/it ain't stellar, either - don't let the sales video and ""subwoofer"" spec. fool you - there isn't much bass improvement over any other mid-priced laptop. The highs and mids, however, are nicely detailed. IMHO, the onboard sound is decent enough for no-fuss on the go sound. If you want the best sound, use good headphones or an outboard speaker system.Performance-wise, it runs like a charm. This is my first experience with Win 8.1, and it all makes sense - I like the ""Tile"" concept, but you can easily switch to the familiar desktop  with a single click.  I am also becoming addicted to the touch screen - I know I will soon be habitually poking all of my other standard monitors now. :)It's had no problem running the stuff I've loaded so far. FL Studio 12 runs awesome on this machine. For games, I loaded ""Call of Juarez: Gunslinger"" - looks and plays wonderful.My only reservation? Even doing simple tasks, this machine runs warm within a half hour or so of use - much warmer than my 17"" HP laptop. A cooler fan helps, but it's just more stuff to lug around.Will update my review if needed, but other than the heat concern, I am delighted with this laptop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEQRFF44VMAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB3MXH4#wasThisHelpful","RHEQRFF44VMAM","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"O.K., Since I intend to use this as a handbag for work (a few reference books,occasionally a small laptop computer,a calculator, other misc. small gear) I am keeping it - it makes my stuff easy to carry, and the bag will fit into my locker. Overall, I am very happy with it!The aesthetics:It's a nice medium brown khaki - similar to what I saw on screen.Seems quite well made - stitching and materials are top drawer. The top handle has the usual X-stitching on the tabs, but they also reinforced this with a grommet - time will tell if this was a good idea or not. The backside panel is U zippered, which provides access to the backpack straps - the backpack straps are nicely padded. They also include a non-padded shoulder strap.There's a mesh half pocket on the bottom probably designed to hold a water bottle - I put a compact umbrella in there.It does have a very mild odor, but no where nearly as bad as what some people here were claiming.Some people were saying the bag itself seems heavy. Nope.It does have the following curious gibberish printed on the leather face panel:*******D/E/A/R(then the Kaukko logo)simple casualCOMFORTABLE & FREE STYLENATURE...DEEP RESPIRATION(DAILY LIFE)WESTERN U.S. CATTLE SUBPACKAGESFREE PERSON AT TIME*******Now, at least one person was so self-conscious about the above printing that they position the bag so that others can't see the panel. That's a bit extreme, but if the printing bugs you, don't get this bag. It's innocuous enough for me to live with. The leather panel has a zipper that travels under a canvas flap. If you know the utility of this, let me know.Will it fit a laptop computer? Not without caveats - a 17"" is out of the question.  It has an inner pocket designed to accommodate a smaller device - a tablet would slip in no problem ,but oddly, the top zipper opening is just a bit too small to allow you to get a 15"" laptop in the pocket easily, though you can put it in front of the pocket. Too bad, but not a deal breaker for me.All the above may read like I don't like this bag, but really, for my purposes, I do!

"There are several ""Call of Juarez"" titles, but this appears to be everyone's favorite, and for good reason.This is just an awesomely fun shooter and I'm not even a big fan of westerns.The campaign (Story) mode has an interesting & funny story.Some people feel the graphics are a bit too ""cartoony,"" but I really like the look (and sound) of this game. If you play this on a PC, I would recommend using a gamepad controller.Aside from the campaign, this game also has one of the best arcade modes I have ever seen - definitely has replay value.I have the game loaded on my PC (you do need a Steam account set up to download the game, but you don't have to be online to play it), but I was really geeked to find out recently that this title is also available for download on the PS3 (from the Playstation store).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1NNS6E6S9BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMSCWEU#wasThisHelpful","R1A1NNS6E6S9BH","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a console gamer most of my life, I've started to explore the world of PC gaming - there are a lot of great established titles out there that are being offered at rock bottom prices, plus tons of cool indie games that may never appear on a console.The thing is, it was very frustrating for me to play these games using a keyboard and a mouse. I can appreciate that it's the only way some people play, but I just can't get used to the layout.Boy, did this controller come to the rescue! My consoles are all PlayStations but the layout of this controller is similar enough. The build quality is excellent for this price - I got the wired version so I don't have to mess with batteries, and the cord length is very generous. Genuine plug and play, too (at least on my Win7 laptop).Games like ""Call of Juarez: Gunslinger"" and ""Melody's Escape"" are now just a joy to play on my PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LH8DBMLBEWJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QRKWLA#wasThisHelpful","R3LH8DBMLBEWJX","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, as far as zombie movies go, both of these films are good! I saw them several years ago, and watching them again makes me think that some of the people involved in ""The Walking Dead"" tv series must have been taking notes.My main aim here is to warn people that the Blu-ray transfer of the original film ""28 Days Later"" looks pretty bad. YES, the film may have been intended to have a dreamlike soft look, and it was never meant to be tack sharp. The problem is, that the high def transfer is riddled with artifacts that really distract you from the dreamlike quality the director intended. It looks like a transfer from a DVD that was transfered from a VHS tape (the second film in the set looks decent). Granted, this was probably the best transfer they could do, but it does the feel of this film more harm than good.Remember ""Jacob's Ladder""? That film was also meant to have a dreamlike quality, and people complain that the Blu-ray transfer looks like crap, but I think it managed to stay pretty faithful to the source film and the director's intent. Not sharp, not meant to be, but far fewer distracting artifacts.In the case of ""28 Days Later"", this is the first time I would suggest buying or sticking with the original DVD instead of buying the Blu-ray.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN76XZ17KAD2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SAPC20#wasThisHelpful","RN76XZ17KAD2Q","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to get my hands on a PS4 exclusive title and was going to wait for the price on this one to drop, but I finally found it locally on sale -really glad I picked it up sooner than later, as inFAMOUS Second Son is quickly becoming my favorite new console game.Never played any of the earlier titles, but the gist is you are an average joe that acquires superhuman powers, and you choose the path your character will travel -good or evil.For an ""origin"" type of story, I was kind of surprised about the meh way that Delsin aquires his first set of super skills, but those first skills are a blast to use.  As the game progresses, you pick up new skills or expand the strengths of the existing ones.The contoller layout is pretty easy to get the hang of - playing Delsin is a lot of fun. His movements are very fluid and also very fast - I am an older gamer, and I tend to like stealth elements in games, but haven't  come across any in this game yet (this ain't Batman). That's cool, but I can only play this game for short stretches because the action is full tilt and so far the only ""breathers"" you get are in the cut scenes, or when you're traveling from one objective to the next (haven't played any of the side missions yet, the main story is keeping me busy).The graphics of this game are easily the best of any PS4 game I currently own - the look of this game is quite stunning, especially when you unleash one of your superpowers, and it helps to pull you into the story. Second Son also utilizes the DualShock 4's touch pad and onboard speaker to good effect.Anyway, so far I am very happy with this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRF9VDS01FC52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGLLRV2#wasThisHelpful","RRF9VDS01FC52","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Back when the buzz was building for ""Destiny"", I saw one of the trailers and it certainly looked like  it would be a ""must have"" game once I got a PS4.I purposely avoided following the news for this game, didn't check out the beta when I preordered the ""Destiny"" PS4 bundle, and maybe that was my bad - I was hoping for an ""epic campaign"".Aside from the irksome requirement that you always have to be online, what surprises me even more is that after several hours of playing  the story mode, I have yet to experience a ""wow"" moment with this game. There's nothing about it that strikes me as unique or compelling.  When I think back on recent games I've really enjoyed, there have always been ""wow"" moments - For example, the first  several minutes of ""Uncharted 2: Among Thieves"" - that incredible train wreck opening grabbed my attention from the start, and compelled me to keep playing.That was the hope I had for the campaign, but it really hasn't won me over  yet. I know people are sick of the ""Borderlands"" comparison, but I think at least for the ""Story"" game mode (the campaign), it's fair - It's a quest based FPS. Enemies have those same horizontal  health bars over their heads, and as you beat them, you see the numbers fly, you pick up the booty they dropped - just like ""Borderlands"".  Heck, even the Ghosts remind me of Claptrap.To be fair,  if you have the inclination and time to invest, the other game modes may be where all the mojo is at, but as a fan of campaigns, ""Destiny"" won't be the first game I grab when I fire up my PS4...","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBW4327QM6GY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9Y3W#wasThisHelpful","RBW4327QM6GY4","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the first games I've picked up for my PS4, and I have been playing it a lot (I just play campaigns so no multi-player is no loss to me). The prologue playthrough is pretty long and ""ok"", but once you reach 1960, the game really takes off.The graphics are excellent, and controls are responsive (like the duck/lean feature).The game does give a nod to its previous incarnations - you have to manually pick up health, armor and ammo, and you enter at map point A, do the required tasks, and exit at map point B.I am fine with that - you do a LOT of shooting, and there are a wide variety of enemies, but you are doing more than that - you have to stealth your way through some spots, cut your way through fences, find hidden items...And there's also a decent story here, which keeps you coming back to see what happens next.This game has a lot of violence, gore, and non-PC content, so it won't be for everyone, but it's a great FPS.**** Edit 9/18/14Just finished the game (Fergus Timeline), and still think it's a great FPS, just thought it worth mentioning that while the story held my interest, up at around 70% completion it goes off on a tangent that was rather slapdash/meh. I agree with another reviewer here who said it would have been cool to take the story to the USA (as one of the trailers would have had us believe).

"If you are not a fan of slower paced stealth games, then you should pass on this. If you enjoyed V2, then you should really like this.Sniper Elite V2 was one of the few PS3 games I played through twice, and III improves the formula in every way (almost).I don't know how this game plays on the PS3, but on the PS4 the graphics are very good, and the character movements are smooth.The world is more open, and there is much more flexibility in how you accomplish a mission.AI of the bad guys seems improved (at least to me).Honestly, the X-ray Kill-Cam was never a major selling point to me, but of course it's back (apparently there is now an option to adjust the frequency).The only thing that takes some getting used to, is that like other shooters, they've swapped the functions of L1/R1 and L2/R2.This game is a prequel to the events of V2. At the conclusion of V2, they mentioned that your character (Karl Fairburne) becomes one of the first big players in the Cold War. That could make for an interesting follow up. In the meantime SE III satisfies my itch for stealth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J70G3IXL3039/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6MW540#wasThisHelpful","R2J70G3IXL3039","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Amazon allowed reviewers to post half stars, I'd give my new PS4 4&Â½ stars.Some of my ""peeves"" have to do with ""Destiny"" (see below), but as I  bought the Destiny Bundle, I think it's still fair to include it in my overall score.I own every Playstation from the original on up, so I knew it would be a great console, and it is:Small, sleek footprint - no power ""brick"" (I am no Xbox One basher, but it is pretty funny to watch those YouTube comparisons).  The build quality seems good, it runs fairly quiet, and Glacier White is a nice change of pace.In my opinion, all of the improvements to the Dualshock 4 controller are welcome, including the slightly bigger and rounder handgrips and improved trigger (shoulder) buttons. The new touch pad is also a big ""button"" itself, and has some interesting possibilities.The operating system is (for the most part) cleaned up and pretty easy to navigate (much improved over PS3).System utilities are improved - you can charge the controller without the console needing to be fully powered up, you can download updates in the background, etc. You can change the brightness of the lightbar on the controller, and you can adjust the controller speaker's volume.  One weird thing is that to turn off your controller (which I did a lot while playing Blu Ray movies on my PS3), you have to drill down a couple menu steps - on the PS3, this operation is a lot quicker.Most important of all of course, currently available PS4 games look good and play very smoothly and are great fun - really looking forward as the PS4 exclusive titles pick up momentum in the next few months!I did some research before buying, so I knew some things this system would be missing, but in case you don't know:The PS4 will not play PS3 games, and let's face it, there's still a lot of play left in PS3 titles.Unlike its predecessors, the PS4 doesn't have a dedicated RCA audio output - if you are just using your TV's onboard speakers, then sure, HDMI is a one connector solution, but if you want to route the PS4 audio to a separate sound system, that system needs to have an HDMI or optical input.  I've got an Onkyo amp that isn't ancient and has hosted my PS3 for several years - but all it has are RCA ins, so I can't use it with my PS4.  Sure, RCA is old technology, but Sony STILL  puts cassette players in most of their boom boxes, for cripes sake! How much would it have cost them to include RCA outs like they've always done?The hard drive is only 500Gb - that might seem big, it's really not, considering that some games now require a minimum of 50Gb, and it'll probably go up.  Yes, you can buy a DIY drive upgrade, but not everybody wants to dive into their PS4's guts.  I wish Sony would have tiered the product - i.e., made it also available with a 1Tb drive - I think a lot of people would have paid the extra cost if it were an option.I knew about the non backward compatibility, the lack of RCA outs and the smallish hard drive -what I didn't know was that for ""Destiny,"" a ""sufficiently robust WI-FI connection may be required"".  Yep, even if you just play the campaign, you have to be online because apparently even the campaign has multiplayer elements. I can appreciate that they have a  grand plans for this game, but I hope this isn't the start of a trend for other titles.  I have a decent WI-FI setup, but not the best.  Every PS4 title I had purchased loaded without incident, but I struggled with the online requirements of ""Destiny,"" and that was frustrating.  When I finally got the update downloaded, I was able to play for about 45 minutes without a glitch, and yes, it is no doubt an awesome game.  I just don't like the idea that every time I fire up ""Destiny"" I'll also have to power up my network and hope that it's ""sufficiently robust"" that day. :)Worth mentioning:Several people have been having trouble with the coating on the thumbsticks (joysticks...whatever) on their PS4 controllers disintegrating with regular use, and others have had no such issues.  I don't think it's mishandling,  it might be an interaction with the oils & sweat from some people's hands and that particular formulation of material.  I have a not too old Logitech mouse with a rubberized coating that's  doing the same ""shedding""  thing.  Anyway, if you have a new PS4 controller,  it might be worthwhile to buy one of the many brands of protective  ""caps"" out there - this is what I bought: Grip-iT Analog Stick Covers  and they work fine.I don't regret my purchase at all - just wanted to document my opinion of some pluses and minuses...","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293AAYX14I604/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVOVBGM#wasThisHelpful","R293AAYX14I604","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the first games I picked up for my new PS4 system, and it's like a glorified version of one of those goofy Android app games that you just cannot put down.I love it because anybody can pretty much learn all of the main controls in a few minutes, but the devil is in mastering those controls.It's also cool that so far, the courses have not been overly long, yet they have multiple check points, and any time you want, you can press the touchpad to start at the beginning. The goal is to make it through a course in one go, but you will also probably burst out laughing every time your rider faceplants.This all equates to a game that you can pop in to kill a few minutes, or play for extended periods (if you don't mind saying ""oh, sh!#"" a lot).Graphics are very nice, but I think the main advantage of this type of game on a next gen console is the smoothness of play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBO820GWWXVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMVRVC4#wasThisHelpful","R1WBO820GWWXVS","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After hearing that many people are experiencing trouble with the coating on the sticks of their Dualshock 4s, I picked these up at a local store.They are pretty easy to put on - the trick is to turn them inside out, position them on the stick, then pull the lip down.They fit snug, don't add too much height or bulk and have a nice grip (with a very subtle raised dot texture).How long they will last remains to be seen, but at this price you can always just buy another set and keep your controller protected...****Update 9/11/15****I still hold these grips in high esteem, but if you want something less ""mushy,"" with a higher raised dot texture, and more color options, check out the ""Mudder"" brand grips available on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BADJSUL3LDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOOSV98#wasThisHelpful","R7BADJSUL3LDX","A1ESUYMIG3TZT0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESUYMIG3TZT0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just play the campaign aspect of games;Starhawk is not your typical shooter - some shooting games incorporate sequences where you drive a vehicle or operate a turret for a short period of time, using simple controls.With Starhawk, operating land and air vehicles take up a good chunk of the game.In addition to that, there are spots in the game where you build and utilize structures, like defensive walls and automated gun turrets, adding a another layer of strategy to the battles.With all this going on, the game has a much steeper learning curve than most shooters.Still, once I got the hang of it, I really had a lot of fun with the some parts of the game, like the air battles.If all you want to do is 'gun and run', this game is definitely not for you.

"The beginning of this book - and the part I had access to via the preview function - starts out well enough. We are introduced to Andrea, and immediately to a situation where she determines that fighting solves nothing. It then jumps to a hypothetical situation of Andrea's cat being hit by a car and we are walked through Andrea's struggle between two concepts she knows to be right and realizing that they can't both apply to the situation. Should her cat be 'put to sleep' and spared inevitable pain or kept alive, suffering, in an effort to delay inevitable death. Before Andrea makes her choice, the question is offered, aptly, to the reader. Then next page shows Andrea choosing the difficult but most logical choice -- to end her cat's life, and thus, his suffering. I found this portion of the book to be precisely what I expected in terms of reader interaction and the promotion of free thought the book is supposed to be based upon.The question regarding Andrea's cat posed on page 20 of the 76-page book, is essentially the last real thought-inducing question posed to the reader. Allow me to express my surprise here, as I believed that this book would gently guide its reader to conclusions, rather than stating them outright.There are some pages following this discourse which discuss the concept of morality and there being 'good people who do believe in god(s)' and 'good people who do not believe in god(s).' Appropriate enough.Then it jumps into small segments of 'do and don't' lists, ie. 'Do be fair.' or 'Don't cheat' and most of these have little follow-ups on the 'why' of explaining the reason these are or are not things we should do. I honestly expected more. As in, I expected that rather than laying down a bunch of adult concepts spelled out in simple kid language, that the adult concepts would be geared toward a kid audience on a kid-level while still maintaining their core ideas.Perhaps the following example will demonstrate this fairly succinctly. On page 48, addressing the topic of honesty it gives this example: ""Suppose a woman you know comes to your home and says she needs somewhere to hide because her husband has been beating her up."" Huh? Really? Because dozens of 5 year olds are running their own covert battered women's shelters?I begin to question, with that last example, what age audience this is supposed to be geared toward. On one hand, the illustrations and tone of the writing seem quite well matched to an early grade-school child. It is written in simply-worded text that my five year old daughter could easily read herself (though I certainly intended to read it over with her first). But when you touch on a prickly topic like battered women, something that hopefully most children will not have to encounter, you open up some rather uncomfortable possibilities. The one that comes to my mind is my daughter going to school and telling her teacher than if daddy ever beats mommy, she won't tell him where mommy is. Parents out there may grasp why this would be an undesirable outcome of broadening their child's mind..... For children who have already encountered real-world domestic abuse, I think it's fair to say they have bigger fish to fry than pondering whether providing shelter to battered women whilst being honest with the husband is the moral high ground. The subject matter is too mature and could have been better chosen given the potential age group.Moving on.Later, on page 57, the Golden Rule is addressed. I'm quite fond of the Golden Rule and its endless applications. As I understand it, in its most common form, states ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Barker has a different take on it and says it means, ""Some people are kind to others because they want to be treated the same way themselves."" That's actually a quite different thing. Amazing how you can change words around ever so slightly and convey an entirely different concept. Barker goes on to demonstrate this glaring difference by saying, ""But other people are kind because they think human beings are valuable, not because they want a reward."" I find this perplexing. Perhaps I've gone my whole life interpreting the phrase ""as you would have them do unto you"" incorrectly, but I always believed that you treated others the way you would ideally like to be treated -- though that may not necessarily be the way they actually treat you in return. It's a form of empathy, you know? One that comes from the most valid source of logical data one has for interpersonal relations - their own interpretation of how the actions of others effect them. If an action effects you negatively, then you should not visit that action upon another being (human or otherwise). Which, going back to the initial scenario, could have easily been the logic for euthanizing the pet cat. If your death were inevitable and you were suffering greatly, would you choose euthanasia or would you prolong your life, suffering, dignity beyond reason? I would have euthanized the cat because I would ideally hope that another would use their own insight to do the same for me in a similar situation. I would still euthanize the cat, even if someone chose not to euthanize me were the tables turned, because my moral compass is internal and greatly based on my experience of personal pain and suffering and the experience of watching others needlessly endure it. That is all to say, I find the section on the Golden Rule to be off- perhaps influenced by a negative connotation with its general association with religion?This book is presented and titled as being a guide for young thinkers. But as I got progressively further into the book, it seemed to be laying out a sort of moral dogma, with little justification, and requiring little thought and contemplation from the reader. Dogmatic presentations of moral thinking are precisely what I believed the book was created to counter, and I feel it fell flat. This is even more sad because on each and every page I can see the author's *intention* and then as he carries that good idea along he almost seems to trip himself up on it and it just gets regurgitated on the page in ineffective form. By the end I felt that the ability to think your own way through it was rather squelched by the 'do and don't' tone it takes on.I bought this book as part of a long-term plan to counter Christianity-based indoctrination that has been directed at my daughter. As an atheist of many years, I find it difficult to stand idly by and let her believe that what little she has been fed by religious infleunces represents the thinking of the entire world. I'm terribly disappointed to say I don't this will make its way into our 'Chrisitanity-unschooling' curriculum. Which is a shame, because I've looked extensively and can find nothing else like it.I plan on returning this book. It will be my first book return on Amazon. But I feel our money could be better spent on educating our daughter about -- well anything. Mythology, eastern religions, philosophy, ethics, science and the cosmos.... There are a lot of paths to free thought. But this one, I believe, is too forward, too black-and-white, and not informative enough to be the optimal one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPBVY6RAO2K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879757310#wasThisHelpful","R1PPBVY6RAO2K5","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this truck for my daughter's 5th birthday. She'd seen it in the Bruder catalog that came with her younger sister's Man garbage truck, and talked about it for weeks after Christmas, so we didn't hesitate to make it her 'big' birthday gift.I tried it out a bit when it arrived and was immediately impressed with the spinning drum. I put in a few marbles, and discovered that - as advertised - the drum can be cranked in one direction to mix the contents, and the other direction send the contents down the chute. Like our garbage truck, the inside of the drum is a simple Archimedes screw-type design. The chute comes with two snap-on extensions which can be stored on either side of the truck and can be easily attached/detached as desired.Of course, my daughter's fondest desire was to make 'real cement' (ie. a water/sand mixture) and send this down the chute to, she says, make 'perfect sand castles.' So after unwrapping this truck, playing around with it indoors with marbles, shoving the cab full of her Playmobil people (which are really a quite nice fit, if slightly out-of-scale with the truck), she demanded an outdoor trial.You actually can, technically, fill the drum with sand and water, this is true. And it will, if you don't dilly dally, come down the chute when turned in the correct direction. But, the drum is not sealed and this created a bit of an issue. Sand and water will dribble out on the part where the drum rests on the bed up by the cab, creating friction on the spin of the drum. This can be gotten around somewhat by manually turning the drum, rather than using the crank, but even then the drum is difficult to turn and she found this a bit frustrating and demanded my help on a few occasions. No big deal. This friction, I will add, also strips the blue stripes around the same area of the drum which are a vinyl-type appliquÃ©. Not that this has ruined the truck's appearance or anything. It's a very small area. But.. I'd rather hoped that this truck might fare better as an outdoor plaything.The second issue is that I've not yet found a way (and this could just be me being overly cautious or missing some obvious detail) to fully open the drum. It seems possible, but every time I attempt it, I think forcing it might break something. This becomes an issue when our curious three-year old stuffs Calico Critters, Playmobil people, wrapping paper and other large/oddly shaped objects into it. Of course, turning the drum is futile if the object is too big to go down the chute, so a grown-up has to turn the truck upside-down and try to wriggle the object between the obstacles to get it out. A little annoying and tedious.All the same, the kids do love it. They are mostly content playing with it indoors, and my five year old is pleased with the objects that do work well in the drum: small rocks and marbles. She's also thrilled with having the doors to the cab open, being able to look at the engine compartment and simply zooming the truck to and fro. It's a massive toy, but it is very nicely made of sturdy, safe ABS plastic, and is attractive, realistic and superbly detailed. Most of the parts are durable enough for the 4+ set, save for the rearview mirrors. There also appears to be no water tank on this variation of the truck, so the people referring to that may be referring to another truck by Bruder.For the price we got it for (it was a pretty drastic discount after Christmas) I think it was a fine deal, and will see lots of play - even if not the precise sort of play my daughter hoped for. I've come to the conclusion that Bruder trucks are really better indoor toys, after having bought this - our second one.Country of origin: Germany","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZ8OU0XT5Q85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NYT1SU#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZ8OU0XT5Q85","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We decided to buy a Bambina doll for our soon-to-be-two-year-old daughter, because we wanted to buy her a nice first baby doll that was not made in China, and we wanted a doll made from materials we felt safe having her cuddle and sleep with. Kathe Kruse seems to have gone the extra mile to make a safer baby doll, as well as adhere to higher standards of quality. Also, all Bambina dolls, and their accessories are made in Germany. The vinyl components of these dolls are made of PVC that is mixed and processed with the high-quality (relatively) environmentally-friendly plasticizer Hexamoll® DINCH. They are also nonylphenol-free and phthalate-free.Before we purchased our Bambina doll, I pored over the internet looking for customer reviews, more photos, a better description, anything, and save for one review on Amazon Germany (which I was only able to poorly translate) there were none. Maybe that's because the Kathe Kruse dolls are so gosh darn expensive, and not a lot of people are willing to splurge for this sort of thing, but I would have loved to have some kind of customer perspective on what these dolls are like, in detail.I hope I'm able to provide that to someone else seeking the same information.We purchased Bambina Lara. Near as I can tell she only differs in her clothing and eye color, but these were the specific things I liked best about her anyway. Bambina Lara is a beautiful doll. Her face is all at once elegant and sweet. Her features are actually not as harsh as the oversaturated stock photos most of the sites have of her, although I was surprised, and perhaps a little dismayed to find that the color of her lips had been used to also make two small dots where her nostrils should be and at the corner of her eyes(see my photos). These are hardly noticeable when you're just looking at her normally, but when you really look at her closely, they stand out and are a bit odd.However, I quickly overcame this minor flaw. When you hold her, she has such a nice weight. She just feels good in your arms, from her heavy-ish limbs, to her large bottom that is the perfect shape for sitting up, or resting on your arm. Her eyes are exquisite, and while a lot of dolls have a little bit of creepiness to their eyes, Bambina doesn't. I had a hard time understanding what this ""light"" was people kept referring to in the eyes of Kathe Kruse dolls, but I totally get it now. I've always been partial to sleepy-eye dolls, but this doll has expanded my preference.Bambina Lara's clothing is absolutely fantastic, and I'm convinced this is the case with all Bambina dolls. The material and design really is exquisite in a way that is unusual in modern times, and reminds me somewhat of my grandmothers old Madame Alexander dolls. Her little shoes actually have a firm sole, and remind me very much of real baby shoes.Speaking of real babies, I've read more than once that Bambina dolls are the size of a real baby, and can wear newborn size clothing. This was an issue of particular curiosity to me, because we have so much newborn clothing from my girls I can't bear to part with, and how cool would it be to reuse these for this doll? Well Bambina sort of does and doesn't fit into newborn clothing. Like all dolls, her neck and shoulders are more slender, proportionately which leaves most necklines looking too wide or a little bulky. Her waist also appears to be shorter, so onesies don't fit her at all really (I admit I haven't tried a preemie size yet), and pants sit rather high on her, if they fit at all. Baby hats and socks and booties fit her perfectly, and I even have a 3 mos dress that fits her rather well (a little long), but ultimately, I would say maybe 1/15 newborn outfits may fit her well enough to keep in the mix, and maybe preemie clothes would be a better choice.Bambina's arms, legs, and head are made of hard vinyl that has a satiny surface. We received our doll with dirty marks on her arms, and I feared this satiny surface wouldn't be able to be thoroughly cleaned, but these marks came right off with soap and water. It's good to know she can easily be cleaned. Bambina's body is made from thick, durable canvas in skin-tone, a shade lighter than her extremities. Her vinyl limbs and face are a medium skin tone.Our Bambina's lips are pink with a strong coral overtone. In some of the pictures, this coral overtone looks a little heavy, but it's actually a pleasant color. Her eyes are a mixture of green and brown, and are obviously the part of her given the most attention detail-wise. It seems that the eyes are actually quite different on each doll, though I've not seen enough close-ups to verify this assumption.Bambina's cheeks are rosy, without being garish. Her hair is a dark brown and rather a flat tone in the middle, which becomes wispy as it nears her face and neck. Hopefully, I've captured this better in pictures than I can describe.Overall, she is a lovely doll, and I'm glad we chose her. I can't wait to present her to my daughter on her birthday, and hope she will be as overjoyed as I am about her new 'friend'.Updated Note: One gripe we have with this doll, having owned her for a few months now, is that despite the fact that she is handled very carefully her head has become incredibly scuffed. There are paint marks on it from where she's been accidentally bumped into the walls while being carried about, and various small scratches from literally every time her head has been bumped or dropped. Perhaps this is because she has such dark hair - though her hands and feet also get bumped they don't show the wear and tear in such an obvious way. Definitely a consideration when paying nearly 200 for a play doll. I imagine an easy way around this would be to go for a doll like Kikou or the bath babies that come with hair. This doll is otherwise fantastic and well-loved. My girls don't care that she is increasingly becoming more flawed - that's just a mom issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33G4UBNZ2KSA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KE3NSK#wasThisHelpful","R33G4UBNZ2KSA6","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These adorable little mushrooms are not kaleidescopes in the traditional sense; there are no beads inside, they are merely a faceted lens that gives a different perspective to anything you view through it. When we were a kid, they always referred to them as being 'bug eyes' and I think you were supposed to gather this must be how bumblebees see or something of that sort.The neat thing about these little kaleidoscopes - and something I wasn't aware of when I ordered a handful of them for party favors - is that each bears a differently faceted lens (see uploaded images). The red mushroom has almost a diamond-cut. The center is flat (normal view) and the diagonal facets that taper toward the edge create a kaleidescope view all around. The green mushroom has a blocky-style faceting and this translates, of course to many blocks of the same image when you look through it, turning this one while viewing gives a really lovely effect. The yellow has straight lines of faceted plastic across the the convex top. The effect of this one is really trippy (especially when being rotated while viewing), and is a totally scrambled view of the world, whereas the others just distort but still leave fairly recognizable shapes within the patterns. Either way, this variety was a totally unexpected bonus. While I like the appearance of the red mushroom best aesthetically, the green and yellow nearly tie for best kaleidescope view.As is the case with all Plan Toys, the rubberwood is stained rather than painted, super-smooth, and just feels really nice to the touch. They're really attractive and could easily double as large mushrooms in the play kitchen, or toadstools for little people to sit on. I like them and think that they were a great buy for an eco-friendly, safe toy to share with my girl's friends at their birthday party this year.Country of Origin: Thailand","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGPSF94T26WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018JKDWW#wasThisHelpful","RUGPSF94T26WX","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm totally in love with the little duck erasers in this set. They're every bit as cute and detailed as they appear to be in the picture. The frogs are... well, a great deal cuter than most erasers out there, but aren't quite the level of adorable the ducks are. Both, however, accurately match the photo.Like all Iwako erasers, these seperate into three or four different pieces; this is seemingly more a practical detail of manufacturing the multiple colors, than anything else. My kids have a few of the other erasers, and just love them for the cute characters. My three year old was appalled by the idea of using them as erasers when I told her that's what they were.We bought this  particular set as favors for our girls' upcoming party, and I think they'll be a fantastic and unique little addition to the gift bags. Very cool little item, never a disappointment. I love that they are made in Japan, rather than China.

"My daughters didn't explicitly ask for a plane for Christmas, but when I saw this one by Playmobil, I was so taken by it, I was sure one or both of them would appreciate it.I decided to give it to my four (almost five) year old, after reading the reviews about the parts coming easily detached. Before Christmas, as is my routine these days with Playmobil items, I assembled this piece as fully as I could, still allowing for repackaging. Much better than dedicating Christmas morning to lengthy assembly.The assembly on this piece is fairly straightforward, and is not more (and perhaps a little less) work than any other major Playmobil sets. There are lithos to be carefully applied to the cockpit, a bathroom within the plane to be assembled, complete with a tricky roll of toilet paper. Probably the most tedious aspect were the tiny windows, of which there are many, which must be popped into place. You do, however, get a rhythm going with that about halfway through. Then the jet engines and landing gear (which is stationary, and does not fold up into the plane). All told, I imagine I spent 30-odd minutes on it.The plane itself, when complete is magnificent. It is about 2'1"" in length, by 2'2"" wingspan. As another reviewer notes, this would not make for easy storage. We just park it in the corner of our living room alongside out massive Bruder garbage truck, and accept that we have a toy-littered house.The girls both love it, but unusually enough, it's been a far bigger hit with my two (almost three) year old daughter. She played with it all Christmas morning, and is often filling the half-dozen passenger seats and cockpit with her 123 people and/or the penguins from her Pengaloo game. The effect of a plane full of penguins is a riot!There is, of course, the issue of durability. Those who are familiar with Playmobil may have already made acquaintance with the four-part pegs that seat into one piece to attach it to another piece (sometimes poorly) in System X buildings. These are what is used to attach the wings, landing gear, and jet engines. In a vehicle with the proportions of the plane, these connectors don't hold up well, and will probably become more prone to detaching over time. This isn't so much a problem for us. Because of the size of the plane, it's more a land vehicle at this point. It's a little too bulky for our little girls to effectively 'fly' and they are not terribly rough with it. Nonetheless, I've replaced the landing gear and jet engines a few times. No big deal. However, introduce a rowdy two-year old boy into the equation (we were babysitting) and the pieces seem to go flying every which way more rapidly than they can be replaced. So a word to the wise: consider your audience before purchasing.Our audience, however, was ideal. It has been effectively integrated into all aspects of imaginative play, and it's just a fantastic, attractive, very realistic toy from the exterior to the interior. I love the way the door opens like that on a real plane. We also purchased the silver Playmobil Cargo crates to go with it, and this has added a dimension of interest, as the kids love to fill these with little goods and load them into the cargo area of the plane.If you're looking for the ideal plane for a preschool+ aged child, look no further.Country of Origin: Germany","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8M8DPJANVHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMFAWM#wasThisHelpful","R2E8M8DPJANVHL","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we became vegan a few years before the birth of our children, we struggled a great deal - at first - with trying to recreate those old familiar dishes - minus the eggs and dairy.This cookbook isn't the fanciest, it isn't gourmet, but it does provide a rough guideline for making simple meals - like pancakes! - without the seemingly requisite eggs and dairy. For us, the 'Brainless Banana Pancakes' have become our standard pancake recipe, even though since the kids came along we reverted back to a lacto-ovo diet. This recipe is so easy that I no longer refer to the book for it. I just mix what appears to be the right amount of ingredients, tweak it a little 'til the texture is right, and it turns out perfectly every time. How cool is that? It's also a  great way to get rid of those almost-bad bananas without the work of banana bread.We probably tried a couple dozen of the recipes in this book (as well as others we got from friends, family, the internet, etc.) before getting our bearings and beginning to create our own unique dishes... but I view this book as having been an important part of that process. One of the most helpful aspects of this book is that the ingredients for the recipes are common, inexpensive, and easy to acquire. We found this was not always the case with vegan cookboks, and was the primary reason a few of our cookbooks sat on the shelf untouched. You won't need to visit a specialty food store to find many, if any, of these ingredients.So while this may not be the final word on vegan cuisine, it's a great introductory book for when you find yourself thinking veganism is the way to go... but are unsure of how to go about it exactly. It's a purchase I don't regret and would recommend to any budding vegans looking for direction in changing their diets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275STZ90QI34P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1551520672#wasThisHelpful","R275STZ90QI34P","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this basket to attach to a retro-looking 14"" Diamondback Della Cruz bicycle for our four year old daughter. When the basket arrived, I initially thought it would be too big for her bicycle. But it turned out to be the perfect size. It is bigger - wider and deeper - than most children's plastic bicycle baskets. This has turned out to be quite a good thing. When my girls go bike riding, my daughter is always pleased to be able to carry the larger stuffed animals or her lunch sack or a huge pile out outdoor treasures (rocks!leaves!magnolia cones!).It's held up really well. I'm ashamed to say we've left the bike out in the rain a few too many times, but the basket - despite a slight change in color - is sturdy as ever!I'm not convinced this would be the ultimate basket for an adult's bike, but that all depends on what you're wanting to tote along. You could carry a small purse in here, or maybe a few (2-4) library books, or a small Sigg bottle and a paper lunch sack. But it's definitely not good for a trip to the grocery store or anything.For our purposes, however, it was absolutely ideal. It's also easy to attach which is nice.

"My three year old daughter received this little mouse family from a relative for Christmas.And I'll confess, every time we went to our local boutique-y toy store, I pondered these little animals with mixed emotions. There's no denying their cuteness which borders on being saccharine, but walks that fine line carefully enough so as to still appeal to virtually anyone -- including myself in an odd sort of way.I've always balked at the price (I'd assumed our local store had jacked it up 50-odd%, but no - their pricing is spot-on). I continue to marvel at how PVC (a fairly nasty, toxic-from-inception-to-disposal, chemical-leaching, cheap plastic) manufactured in the third world could have attached to it such a fancy price. I mean, I could totally see if they'd pioneered locating an uber-safe replacement plastic for PVC like Boon's Odd Ducks, or if they were recycling something -- *anything* like Green Toys, or making grand philanthropic social gestures in the third world like Plan Toys. But this company seems to be doing none of the above (though the PVC is supposedly phthalate free, though no information seems t exist on whther this translates to 'safe' -- and are they actually monitoring this, I wonder?). They're making toys from cheap materials that cost pennies and selling them at an insane mark-up. It's actually pretty ingenious.As for the toys themselves, they are pretty much exactly what they appear to be. Semi-hard PVC bodies, with white nylon fuzz fused onto them, pink fuzz on the ears and nose (the fuzz does pick up lots of lint, and doesn't weather long-term play well as our local toy-store's display animals can attest). The heads and limbs - arms and legs - do move, but not easily. My daughter seems oblivious to this - she never moves their limbs. The clothing can be removed, and most outfits attach with velcro. The little boy mouse's outfit, oddly, has no velcro, but stays on nonetheless. Most of the outfits are a single piece, except for the daddy mouse who has both a shirt and overalls. All of the mice have bendy white tails in the back and black bead-like eyes. Their expressions are pleasant and endearing.Despite any caveats mom may have about PVC toys, they are a permanent fixture because they are loved - fiercely. They are toted about the house and on car rides, gently fed and tucked into little beds, snuggled, the whole bit. Truth be known, I think I'd have easily been crazy about them as a young child too, long before the days where toxic toys were a source of maternal angst.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6YDEYNJA3Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QB5TMU#wasThisHelpful","R1U6YDEYNJA3Z7","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My three year old daughter received this set from a relative for Christmas. I was a little taken aback when I saw the price on it (FYI: it can be found for 40% less, I later discovered).Nonetheless it's a really pleasant little set, and its play value extends beyond the pieces that it comes with.This set essentially consists of a sturdy fenced enclosure (note: not all our Playmobil fenced enclosures could be termed 'sturdy') with two attached gazebos to provide the animals shelter. Then there is the group of animals: A goat & kid, a calf, a black sheep and white lamb, a mouse, bird, donkey and pony. There is a tree that seems to have difficulty standing on its own (not the best of the Playmobil trees, but we fortunately have dozens so its functionality is not missed). There are vegetables as food for the animals, bottles for the baby animals plus a bottle warmer and table, decorative foliage, and two straw beds for the animals to sleep on -- though none of the animals' legs move, so it seems a moot point. There are lots of bandage-stickers which outlive their usefulness immediately and will end their lives by becoming attached to the bottoms of socks and so forth. And finally there are people: a female adult and two little girls.Assembly time was only slightly tedious. Maybe 20 minutes - I wasn't rushing either. Re-assembly is intuitive and quite speedy.What ultimately makes this set great fun for my children is the enclosure, with its functioning front gate. It stays put during a bit of rough play, which is nice, and has become home to all manner of creatures, inluding our Playmobil dinosaurs who easily fill the entire area. It seems all animals, from Calico Critters to Iwako eraser animals, must be taken to this enclosure to receive their meals, and so - unlike much of our Playmobil sets, which get disassembled and stored when not in immediate use, this set has stayed intact on the living room floor since Christmas, where it sees daily play. The animals have provided a fair amount of play and plenty of squabbling. The other (smaller) accesories, have been generally dismissed, perhaps because the animals have deluxe meals concocted for them in the adjacent play kitchen and are served fruits and veggies that are about ten times the size of their bodies.All told, I think this set has been a big hit. I probably wouldn't have shelled out top dollar for it had it been my decision to purchase, but I'm glad someone else did, seeing how much play the children have gotten out of it.Country of Origin: Spain","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZ0B2YMKN6DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012K4WF6#wasThisHelpful","R3OZ0B2YMKN6DZ","A2HZKWV36U9SXM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HZKWV36U9SXM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm writing this from the standpoint of a non-Ableton user, to talk about how it integrates with opther DAWs.

I was using an Alesis Q49 before this came along and have since sold the Alesis, no brainer considering the tap pads and other mechanical controls that the LaunchKey offers. In addition to StudioOne 3 I also use a control for orchestral scoring with Notion so I'll comment on that too. Sorry, don't have any info for ProTools users.

"For this price I'm thinking it's the best value for the dollar in a budget laptop, because I haven't seen a screen this nice on a sub-400-dollar laptop before. You get a full size keyboard with 10-key pad (MacBook Pro doesn't even have that), it's super light weight yet includes a DVD burner. Someone else mentioned that the screen was NOT great and text was blurry, and that may be a defective unit unfortunately. The screen on mine was quite sharp (""sharp"" is relative I realize... we have a 15"" MacBook Pro w/Retina in the house and no standard LCD can match THAT, but for a cheap LCD, the Asus' screen is quite impressive).There are a few cons to a laptop at this price, main one being the keyboard really. Instead of a solid keyboard in a metal tray like with more expensive laptops, the cost saver here was a cheap keyboard built into the THIN top deck. You can definitely push down on the keyboard and have the whole thing sink in a little. Not a deal breaker at this price. But the other sort-of downer is the hard drive and the upgrade options. I set this up as our laptop for Rosetta Stone language learning and coming off an i7 desktop I don't want a sluggish unit. i3 processors are not too bad but they need help, mainly with an SSD as the hard drive. This laptop comes with the dreaded 5400rpm mechanical drive which is unacceptably slow in 2015. We didn't need a ton of drive space so I grabbed a Samsung 250GB SSD for 79 bucks on sale and installed it, and it truly sped up but THAT is the big downer... the installation. There isn't a hard drive slot (or door on the back) that you pop open to exchange the hard drive, the drive is inside the laptop and you have to pop the deck off the laptop, a clip at a time, basically disassembling it. I did find a YT vid where a guy walks through it, just search the model number. I work on PCs all the time so no biggie but it's a little involved. NONETHELESS, with the SSD this thing is a little speed demon now, not for gaming obviously, but for every day stuff it's QUITE relevant. Again, the screen is a surprise, really quite nice for this class laptop. Oh, it has 4GB ram soldered on the motherboard, and there is a VERY easy-to-access extra RAM slot on the back requiring only one screw, and I popped that off and put in another 4GB 1.35v stick I happened to have, so now this thing is running the i3 w/8GB ram on a Samsung 850 SSD (non-pro model) and it's pretty quick for what it is. The laptop is very inexpensive and the case is kinda cheap as expected, so don't drop this thing, but it's a good travel size laptop and with the SSD the battery is averaging 4-5 hours (with the brightness down a little). Not bad for most flights.Oh, yeah, disclaimer: I'm not sure how Asus will feel about you popping the top deck off when it comes to honoring the warranty, so it probably voids the warranty. But the cruddy mechanical hard drive makes the laptop pretty much useless by 2015 standards, so I figured I might as well give an SSD a shot, and it worked very well. But my lawyer (if I really had one, lol) would make me say the following: THE AUTHOR OF THIS POST ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILTY IF ANY DAMAGE IS INCURRED FROM ANY OWNER-EXECUTED UPGRADE OR DISASSEMBLY. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY.

"These do work well for food prep. My wife cooks a lot but actually has food sensitivities and has to wear gloves. These work well with her small hands, she found them easy to pull on, and food handling was pretty easy, much better than those baggy clear loose gloves that you buy in membership warehouse stores. The only thing to note, if this is importany, the gloves are somewhat porous so if you submerge your hands they will feel damp when you pull the gloves off. For most food applications that's not an issue but definitely don't use these if you work with acidic things like copper cleaner, etc. Overall, decent glove.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1G4MNUAQ53S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF499WY#wasThisHelpful","R2L1G4MNUAQ53S","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is really for the DIY'er, want to share the installation experience and hopefully save someone a headache or two.PROS:Well, it's installed, it works, it's definitely quieter than our old Genie, the adjustment process is simple and the parts are properly manufactured because everything fit together well.CONS:Just the manual. It's fine, you just need to read through it, TWICE, and get a handle on all of the part names which get referred to throughout the installation procedure as if they are cousins coming over for dinner, lol (""clip the idler pulley cover tab to the master link cover slot and slip through the trolley casing spring-loaded link slot on the outside of the casing"")... that sort of thing. I definitely had a ""wait... what?"" moment a few times, LOL! But the drawings are ample enough, so if you take your time and refer back to the parts list in the beginning of the manual, you figure it out. In hindsight I would have printed the parts list from the PDF manual you can get online (you get a printed copy, not to worry) and taped it to the workbench, because I had to look back at it many times.So I just installed this on Saturday (10/31) and was able to do 99% of the job by myself, only had my son hold the motor end once while I connected the rail on the header over the garage. I took my slow, sweet merry old time and it took about 5 hours, including removal of our old unit. Basically I did a task on a page of the manual, then sit at my workbench and read the next page, then execute, etc. I'm sure the whole job can be done in 3 hours or less, I was in no rush really. Plan on installing everything before you test, meaning, the laser sensors that go near the bottom of the door need to be in place or the unit will not run.During assembly, there's a maneuver you do with a spring loaded bolt where you try to hold a slotted ring with a flathead screwdriver while turning the nut at the other end, and after a couple 1/4 turns the thing is supposed to go SNAP and lock itself in, and your belt tension is then properly adjusted. It's kind of weird even after reading the instructions a few times but I finally got it. The screwdriver in the slot thing didn't work, it kept buckling, so I grabbed the ring with needlenose pliers and turned the nut with a wrench and in one turn it popped into place. If that sounds confusing, it is, but when you go to do it, it'll make more sense. Read that manual before you start, can't stress that enough.Door operation works well, although I'm used to a gear drive and this is a belt unit. Here in Phoenix our garages get up over 120 degrees and plastic stuff doesn't do well so hopefully that belt stays pliable. It's definitely quieter in its movement, but motor really whines as it's moving the door, almost sounds like it isn't going to make it, but the door movement is quite steady so I believe it's just what the motor sounds like.When I first went to test it by hitting the wall button, the unit opened fully where the trolley hit the stop pin by the motor, and then the door wouldn't work again. It kept trying to open further but of course it couldn't move, and after 2 seconds it gave up obviously. I couldn't get the door to go the other way and close. The wall unit has an LCD and shows error codes which refer to the manual. My code told me to make sure there were no obstructions, and if there weren't then the motor needs to be replaced. HUH?? So I read the Adjustment section again and realized that the unit initially wants you to set the Up position, followed by the Down position. Since I hadn't told it where Up was, it kept trying to open, lol. So I went through the adjustment procedure, told it that Up was right where it was, and now lets do Down, and the thing reversed properly and worked. Then I re-adjusted it so I could set the real Up position, about an inch in front of the stop pin for our door. Sorry for the long explanation but if you hit that wall where it's acting like it's seized, do the Adjustment procedure and it should be fine.The two remote units were already programmed which was nice, and the visor clip is bigger than the remotes our old Genie unit which is nice because visors these days are way thicker. The wall unit has a thermometer and clock in its LCD so we finally get to see HOW hot the garage gets in the summer, lol. You can also program it to tell it hpw the light fixture should work (come on when the door opens, or come on from motion sensor, or both). The wall unit has a separate light switch which I'm really happy about, because this unit has a bulb socket on each side of the motor and and lights up the garage quite nicely. I used these 26w CFLs which are max it takes (or 100w incadescent): GE 15836 - 26 Watt CFL Light Bulb - Compact Fluorescent - 100 W Equal - 2700K Warm White - Min. Start Temp. 5 Deg. F - 82 CRI - 65 Lumens per Watt - 12 Month Warranty . Now the garage is nice and bright and these CFLs are nice and warm with a 2700K color temp. Daylight CFLs are so blue and dreary, but these work really well.OK, wireless home network hook-up and iPhone app: don;t slap me but I'll be setting that up on Thursday, didn't have time these past couple days and the review was due. Sorry! I do work with wireless networks in my IT job so I'll be sure to explain how that process works and how easy or hard it was to get it to connect and work. Update coming!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1009PIHIBRIFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UGZYOM#wasThisHelpful","R1009PIHIBRIFC","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the bigger brother of the XP-830 that I've been using and REALLY liking because of the excellent dual-sided paper handling via a motorized tray, and because of the print quality. This 960 is the exact same: Clean printing, fast output that still looks sharp (draft mode used to be a JOKE with Epson), and a mechanically driven moving paper deck for DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING THAT IS FLAWLESS. I'm not kidding. I wrote in the 830 review that I didn't expect that and I had actually wondered why this printer was up there in price when you can easily get AIO's for 89 bucks. The motorized paper handling deck works very well, and looks totally cool while it's ""performing"", lol.Also, Epson has done such a great job with device printing on this Expression series. I now keep this printer connected to my PC at work, don't want it on the main wireless network nor do I want to share it. But I want to be able to print from my iPhone and iPad. Asking too much? NOPE, not with this unit. It creates its own wireless network and therefore you can print directly to it (I assume that means Android also, just have no way to test that). The LCD on the printer is a flip up color screen with menus to set everything up including the AirPrint network, or even print direct from your memory cards. Speaking of setting up, the driver and app software was an easy download from Epson's site, and it actually WORKED, quickly at that. Setup with the 4 Epsons I owned between 2000 and 2007 was ALWAYS a nightmare, the software would never detect the printer. That's all fixed now, the setup on this 960 was easy peazy, and right after it was done (using the online Windows 10 drivers, not the CD), the Epson utility software went right back out and checked for a Firmware update which there WAS one. I downloaded that and the update went perfect. I had done that with the 830 as well, so it appears Epson has that all shored up, and you won't brick your printer with a firmware update.The copy machine part also performed pretty near perfect. This printer also does CD/DVD printing and Epson provides a nifty slot to store the tray so you don't have to find a spot in your desk drawer to store it.OK, Photo printing: Epson uses 6 cartridges to include Photo Magenta and Photo Cyan which are lighter version to help get good gradations in color. Pretty standard in a true photo printer so I'm glad to see it in this all-in-one. The overall photo print quality is superb as expected and a big part of that has to do with the quality paper handling the printer has, that makes a HUGE difference. When you start printing your own photos bigger at 11x17, they really start to take on a different dimension. Landscapes look super sharp when using a glossier paper and this 960 excels in that area. There's no separate Photo Black cartidge in this 960 like with the 830 which is a little disappointing, but instead Epson opted for the light magenta and cyan cartridges instead. Great for landscape images, but for portrait work on matte papers, things like hair on a brunette may not have as much detail with just the one black cartridge. Nonetheless, the print quality is up to 2015 standards, if that helps explain it. I own two other Canon 13x19 printers as a comparison, and this supposed ""office all in one"" can keep up quite well.One last thought in regards to ANY photo printer: while the concept of borderless printing is a nice feature, nearly every pro photographer that I know that does their own prints never uses that feature, and neither do I. The nozzles have to stop spraying ink at the edge of the paper but in order to ensure borderless, the ink does spray slightly past the edge, and over time it makes quite a mess inside the unit. Ths 960 does do borderless so that's why I mention it. One way to get around that is to print with a slim ¼"" border then trim the print. This is just a suggestion based on many years of printing but it will cause less headaches down the road if you avoid that. Overall, this is best printer for office work and occasional photo printing I've own because all of the features work well (print, scan, copy). But if it was your ONLY photo printer then you will be more that satisfied, don't let the AIO category bother you, photos (with good photo paper) look great.Often when someone wants a home office AIO I steer them to Canons because I had given up years ago on Epson. But things have changed and the local wireless AirPrint network and the motorized dual-sided printing (and small footprint) makes this a new favorite. I use it everyday at work and it's been flawless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G2FEZLPQLM7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R2G2FEZLPQLM7I","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great watch. Built like a tank. I own several Invictas and one of my favorite attributes is the bands are long enough to fit my 8Â¼"" wrist. In fact, I had to remove one link from this band, it was too loose! Definitely a big guy's watch (which I am at 300+). It's pretty heavy, but it looks great. It looks better in person than the photo. The crown is real easy to turn and adjust. BTW, get a watch band link remover tool (like this one: Leegoal Watch Link Remover with Pins (12pins)) if you plan on getting the pins out to remove links which I'm almost certain you will have to. The pins are TIGHT, in fact there was an audible crack when I popped one of the two out. It's perfectly fine but no way you'll get these Invicta pins out any other way. Look inside the band and you'll see which direction to push the pin out with the tool, Invicta puts arrows there, great feature.The only things I was not so enamored with may not be a problem for others: the three dials are super small, no way my 50+ eyes will see them, but that's OK, the time is most important. The other thing to note is that the band rattles if you shake your arm. It's kinda cool in some ways but it does make noise. Lastly, if you've ever had to deal with the Invicta website for registering and/or creating account, you'll discover why they make money building watches and not websites. Pretty buggy, lol.Overall, for the price, it's a heavy bulky Sherman Tank that looks awesome, I'm quite pleased.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16D4TOMKHCXWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146HVIVC#wasThisHelpful","R16D4TOMKHCXWD","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolute 5-star filter. For 30 years I argued with all brands of filters (threads going bad, hard to keep clean, list goes on), and about 7 years ago Idecided to invest in a B+W and have never looked back. I only use CPLs and neutral density filters now (got past the gimmicky filters so prevalent in the 80s) and B+W are the only brand I will touch. There are a couple specific features of this XS-Pro CPL but first I want to mention that the precision of the threads and the fact that they use brass and not aluminum has always set B+W apart. Also the way they seal the film in between the glass is key to the optical quality they offer.I recently changed my wide angle lens from a 16-35/2.8 (with 82mm threads) to Canon's new 16-35mm/4.0 with IS which uses a 77mm filters, same as my 70-20mm, so I was ready for a CPL that would work on both. When B+W announced the XS-Pro line with the ultra thin ring, it was a no-brainer. It justy happened to become available on Vine, hence this review. But the two important  fetaures are the obvious lack of vignetting even at 16mm (on a full frame 5D3), and that the CPL effect is completely consistent and even , yet it's only a 1-stop loss of light! This will actually change how I use a CPL because it's mostly been to remove reflections from leaves and water for landscape work, and reflections in glass for architecture. This filter excels in that just like the F-mount Kaessemenn version. The 3-stp loss of light in those situations is not normally an issue because I'm on a tripod. I never liked using a CPL for darkening the sky because all CPLs made it look so postcard-blue, totaly fake looking. BUT, this HTC version only darkens the sky by one stop and therefore leaves the sky with some brightness but allows the camera's metering to open up to expose ground shadows. This is pretty crucial for shooting outdoor images handheld. I was walking sround on my street with the 16-35mm taking shots of the neighborhood that actually showed detail in the gorund and houses while still maintaining a not-too-blown-out sky. It was like I had a graduated ND filter that knew to just attenuate the highlights! This is crazy, opens up the possibility to reduce (not eliminate, that'll never happen) post processing for certain types of images. I usually shoot in manual and select the exposure which I still will quite often, but to have the freedom to control the luminance range on the fly BECAUSE this CPL is only cutting one stop of light is a special feature that I was not expecting. I absolutely need to purchase the 72mm version for my 50mm lens. This might sound a bit odd but I think B+W has a game changer here for run-and-gun street shooters, al la Henri Cartier-Bresson style of shooting. I'd give this filter 6 stars if I could, and I'm usually not that big of a filter fan.I've posted a photo showing how well this HTC removes reflections, even with only a 1-stop reduction in light. Quite impressive. The real advantage of course is when shooting landscapes with a ton of foliage, the reflections of light off of shiny leaves gets removed and the result is some seriously rich-looking foliage in your shot. That's one thing that Photoshop can't really do, but for this filter it's a breeze.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHHIH6T1PK3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OK6YSAS#wasThisHelpful","RAHHIH6T1PK3C","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually expected to NOT be that enthralled with this printer, I owned several Epson letter-sized inkjets from 2000-2008 and got fed up with the cheesy paper handling, the BUGGY driver installation that didn;t recognize your printer half the time, and worst of all, the clogging heads. I spent more time than necessary back then cleaning and soaking nozzles to try and get the things to print. I made my switch to Canon and never looked back until this came along.So I've been using it daily, hammering away, and its been nothing short of amazing, especially in the paper handling area. Clean printing, fast outout that still looks sharp (draft mode used to be a JOKE with Epson), and a mechanically driven moving paper deck for DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING THAT IS FLAWLESS. I'm not kidding.

I copied several documents for my guitar students and almost couldn't tell the two apart. I don't use the fax segment, but both copy and fax are really a scan and then execute an output so there's no reason faxing should noty look good.Photo printing: Canon added a very good feature that you see usually on the higher-end pro photo printers: besides the standard Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black cartridges, they included a Photo Black to handle certain types of photo paper media. Nice. I have that in my pro non-Epson 13x19 photo printers but to see it here makes this quite a viable unit to hammer out 4x6's to 8x10's.OK, last but very cool feature: device printing.

"This iOne is probably the BEST point of entry devices for any musician or budding audio engineer. Here's why: the unit itself has some terrific features for the price (which I'll explain in a sec) but the double bonus is the Studio One 3 Artist version which is the DAW software (Digital Audio Workstation) that comes bundled, because the ease of use of Studio One is superb. But first about the hardware, because it has a couple nice features, but there are also some scenarios where you would do much better with the iTwo version which I'll explain.OK, the iOne: it's like the ultimate songwriter's dream come true, especially if you play acoustic guitar and sing (or any type of instrument really). The setup is super easy, you can use your laptop, desktop OR iPad, it sounds good and does have monitoring so you can hear playback while recording additional parts. The Class A preamp in the XLR input jack does sound better than expected for a hundred-dollar unit. Not quite the headroom of the XMAX preamps in the PreSonus SudioLive board we use at church, but still quite good. I used to use the Focusrite iTrack Solo but the iPad connection required a very short and stiff specialized cable to connect the iPad.. If i have to worry that I need a special cable that could get lost, that's a deal-breaker. That's one feature of this iOne that I like: all you need is an extra iPad cable.OK, the Setup I use to record parts and song ideas, and I'm focusing this on the iPad setup because that's a flagship feature of this model series: I use a Groove Tubes GT50 mic for my acoustic guitar plugged into the iOne as expected. You then plug a standard Apple cable into the iOne and the Lightning end goes into the iPad, again, easy peazy. That's the extra Apple cable you will need. Then all you need is your iPad charger & cable which you'll actually use to power the iOne. If you are using a PC/Mac/laptop, the iOne powers off of that, FYI. OK, just download the PreSonus Capture app from the App Store and your recording setup is complete. If desired, you can also plug and standard guitar cable from your guitar into the second jack with is a 1/4"" TRS, and record two separate tracks. For additional tracks you can listen with headphones, and there's a 50/50 mix switch to monitor as you record. That's not ideal, the iTwo gives you a knob to dial the mix, but on this iOne it's a switch. Anyway, that's the simple setup.The Studio One 3 software that comes bundled (you download it) is for your Mac or PC. Once you install that and also download teh bundled instruments, etc, then the really cool part happens. With your computer and iPad on the same network, you open the Capture iPad app that has your recordings, and wireless send them to Studio One on your computer. DONE. Now you can do all of the editing you need, add effects, EQ, whatever. Even add more instruments if you have a MIDI USB Keyboard. The one thing I would say is that the available upgrade to Studio One 3 Professional is something you'll want to eventually do, it has a mastering section and supports 3rd party plugins like what you can get at Waves.Here are a couple reasons to consider the iTwo, just FYI: First is dual XLR inputs. If you want to record a piano or other live situation in stereo, the two mic jacks are huge. Second is that variable monitoring knob, WAY better than the 50-50 mix button on the iOne. Last is MIDI support if that's important, the iTwo has the ancient MIDI barrel jacks in the back. But overall the iOne is a songwriter's dream, and bundled with Capture and of course Studio One, what PreSonus is offering here is best features for the buck. I admit I'm a dedicated PreSonus customer, and Studio One 3 Pro is absolutely my favorite DAW. This iOne will be my songwriting quick-and-easy setup rig, and when the Studio 192 gets released, that'll become my main interface for serious recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQQPRBOLVCNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBMAJU8#wasThisHelpful","RGQQPRBOLVCNS","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To my surprise this turned out to be quite a nicely built clamp meter. Most AC-only clamp meters in this price range pretty much have the same features (this model doesn't do DC but it perfect for home construction). What I really liked was the narrower case and the strong rubber coating on both the case the selector knob... here's why and I should mention that this is my favorite feature: EASY one-handed operation (right hand). Most situations where I need to clamp a circuit almost always seem to be in a tight spot between studs over my head tucked in a corner, so having to reach with one hand has to be made easy, and this model 210 does that. It's so easy to change measurement modes and open the tight clamp it offers (a good thing). I also feel like if I drop this thing it'll bounce and laugh at me, not crack. It came with a decent cancas case as well, plus moisture-proff leads with the barrel plugs. For this price, great deal. My only gripe and this was the same with my previous clamp meter: needing a screwdriver to open the battery compartment, and it has to be a #1 Philips. A sturdy clip door would be so much better, but overall, good meter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IL06IFDU4SD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYFGJU2#wasThisHelpful","R3IL06IFDU4SD9","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite frustrating, the iPhone app simply will not connect to the Link unit, which is the transceiver that is the""link"" between the siren & door mounts, and the iPhone App (and remote control unit). I have tried every option that the manual and the website gives you for resetting the Link, it simply will not work. When the iPhone app DOES connect the screen immediately throws back ""Device Already In Use"". Huh?The most frustrating part is that MyFox has kept this TOO simple. The manual is a single sentence and an Ikea-like drawing on what step to take next, with NO troubleshooting info. The Link unit has several different types of flashing paterns for its one lighted logo, and you don't even know what they mean unless you go search it on their webpage. Absolutely nothing in the manual provided.I do know that the Link unit is connected to my network, that's a simple peek at the DHCP table on my router's firmware page. So I was hoping there would be the same firmware utility page for the link, but there is NONE, so simple troubleshooting is not possible and I have no ideas why the iPhne won;t connect, therefore making the system unable to be setup and managed. I know it's not my iPhone 6 Plus, I use that regularly to wirelessly link to our 32-channel digital mixing desk at our church and run the gain on our auziliary monitor mixes remotely, plus I'm the iOS support at the semiconductor company I work for (just stating that so it's known that I have somewhat of a clue). I have a decent NetGear router powering our network, not a cheap $59 model. The playing field is set, this system should work. At this point, even if I did get this working, how can I trust it? Ether the thing won't trigger when I need it, or that 110db alarm will fire off at 3am, I just know it. This is so frustrating, I thought we had a decent first line of defense with this system, but it simply will not connect. Also, you get ONE door/window sensor and the additional are $50 a piece, so with the additional 11 doors and windows in our home, that's $550 just for sensors.If this system jumped into action like MyFox claims, I'd give it 4 stars right off the bat. I'd even up it to 5 if they got more realistic about the sensor price (I know, a lot of research went itno making them, so the price better descrease as sales increase). But as it stands, it's useless.

"Three stars means It's Okay and for me PERSONALLY, that's where I'm at with this tuner, but not for the polytuningtechnology part. That feature is good, works as expected, I've never been disappointed with TC stuff ever since the 80's when I started using their gear (in fact, I own the M-One XL of theirs). But I'm not so crazy about this tuner because of its construction, not because of function. The tuner has VERY sharp metal edges on the body and the clip, I seriously think you could cut yourself slightly. I know if I drop this and it hits my guitar it's going to damage the finish. The other problem is the clamp itself: forget the squeaky noise it makes when you squeeze the clip open, it's the STRENGTH of the clamp that's a bit too much. And the rubber feet that actually touch the headstock are pretty hard, not pliable at all, so I'm definitely convinved that repeated use will dent the headstock ot at least the finish. I sprang for a Taylor 618e new 2015 series with the super-thin 3.5 mil finish, and this TC tuner is NOT going on my guitar any more. I don't need the polytune feaure all that much now that I've tested it. My Snark Super Tight works just fine, one string at a time doesn't bother me and that tuner is completely rubber coated. If you have something like a Strat with a thick gloss finish on a maple neck then you probably won't have finish damage. The tuner works well, I just don't trust how it mounts. So if you have no issues in that regard and want a polytune clip-on, then yes, go for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPABA0D1UCX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3JPABA0D1UCX9","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a longtime SanDisk User and have been waiting for this day, where I can get a multiformat card with at least 32GB, and to get this at 14 bucks is crazy good (My first CF card was 512MB, 92 bucks, lol). This SanDisk version supports UHS-I so shooting video or rapid fire shots is easy peazy. Then to be able to pop the card into an Ultra Micro slot and a huge advantage especially for Droid slate owners.Overall it's a 4-star card simply for the slower Write speeds, which are about ¼ of the Read speeds. Yes, it's under 20 bucks but only cards that ead and write at the same speed are 5 star cards IMO. I'm seeing about 15-17MB/sec writing to this card from an SSD (using a 700MB test file) on a PC. However, reading from this card to an SSD, that same 700MB file copied to the SSD instantly. Therefore copying off of this card to another device is fast and a big plus.Great build quality, the adapter feels very solid so you canb use this as an SDHC card without worry the Micro card will fly out. 10 year SanDisk warranty also can't be beat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROIKS6LS0CHJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q57T02#wasThisHelpful","ROIKS6LS0CHJE","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this on an Altec-Lansing speaker unit that has the 30-pin plug, design for you to sit your old iPhone or iPod on it. That unit sounds really good with its subwoofer so I hated losing the ability to use it with the new iPhones. Popping on the CoolStream is now a dream come true. Connects right up and does what it's supposed to. You will need one of the older 30-pin cables to charge this unit off of any USB port or even the Apple charger, but if you don't have one of those older cables laying around, you can pretty much find those in the impulse aisles for 5 bucks in every store from Walgreens to Ace Hardware, they're all over the place.One thing I want to mention: I had a problem one day where the music would cut out and come back on every 3 seconds or so. That happened with another BluTooth adapter I tried, I thought it was the adapter. Not so, it's the BAD memory management in the iPhone. They only come with 1GB ram, and often most of that gets used up. I have an app that shows available ram and it's usually down to 6-10MB available (not a typo) with only a few apps open. So I cleared my memory, tried playing music again and it worked fine all afternoon. So if you have that issue, close your apps, but the important one is to close ALL PAGES in Safari before you close Safari. If you just swipe up Safari to close it, all of your open web pages stay in memory and eat it up. I'm pretty ticked, $950 for an iPhone 6 Plus with 128GB storage and STILL only 1GB ram? ASpple has no excuse and it's not like they can't afford to up the ram in these things. ANYWAY, this CoolStream is awesome and make sure you have apps closed down once you start streaming with BT and it'll work great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y90LLCAEJXUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHUHMUS#wasThisHelpful","R1Y90LLCAEJXUL","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a hefty guy with fairly wide thumbs so finding a thumbpick that fits comfortably is a task in a half. I tried Nationals, forget it, not even close. I tried John Pearse and with a little heat-n-adjustment (I'll explain that in a sec) they fit really nice, BUT, the pick part is too short for me, doesn't stick out enough, I keep missing the strings. That's just how I play but the Pearse picks are comfortable. But now I have found thumbpick bliss with the Dunlops. Granted, out of the bag they are not quite right... the top part with the logo curves into my finger too much and digs in, I need it flatter. So I Googled a bit and discovered that tossing the pick for 8 seconds in my microwave (1000w unit for the scientifically minded) makes it perfectly moldable! I ""uncurve"" the top part a bit and then open the thumbpick up a little to make the opening bigger overall, and I am one happy picker. Fits perfectly. I have NOT tried this on the tortoise shell versions, it may work the same but the plastic compound may be different, not sure. But for the white ones, it's a dream come true. The pick part sticks out just enough for my liking, but certainly test that before yyou buy a bag of 50, lol. Final thought: I heard Tommy Emmanuel mention in an interview that he buys a big bag of Dunlops (Medium), goes through and finds the few that fit right and gives away the rest. So the picks are obviously a bit different in shape and opening size (as you would expect, it's plastic) but with the microwave trick you can pretty much make a custom tailored suit for your finger, lol.Somebody hand Tommy a microwave oven. =-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WPS6WVYPBMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EEHIHK#wasThisHelpful","R10WPS6WVYPBMJ","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've got this oven in my office at work and have been putting it through its paces... frozen pizzas, french bread pizzas, you name it. Also got english muffins with a jar of sauce and provolone to make little minis unfrozen. In all scenarios this pizza oven did a great job, but ONLY after I learned its ways and its quirks. The manual gives you general temp settings and times for everything from cinnamon rolls to frozen deep dish pizza, but just like any manual there's a bit of idealistic verbiage on how the thing really works. So TEST IT and you'll pick up pretty quickly how best to use it. As an example, frozen french bread pizzas (Stouffers) don't come out singing Kumbaya ready to be eaten with the stock temp in the manual, they come out a bit cold in the center and the pepperoni a tad burnt. So I modified the cooking a bit, and to be honest, this method seems to work for most frozen pizza: PREHEAT for 3-4 minutes first, that's pretty important (and I'm a guy, we like to toss it in, turn it on and nothing else), but do the preheat. Then bake the frozen items 10 minutes on Bake which is 375 degrees. Once the bell rings, turn the knob one click to Frozen Snacks which is 600 degrees and do 2 more minutes. Ba da bing, awesome frozen pizza. Skip the two minutes if you don't like a toasted top. So with a little experimentation you can get great results.Some folks call it a glorified toaster oven but the elements and size definitely work GREAT for pizza. The three top elements are spaced wide apart unlike a normal toaster oven so the broiling on top is quite even. Also, this thing runs HOT and will cook way faster than any toaster oven I've used. Because it's a pizza oven the inside area is not very tall, so things like foil-wrapped leftover fried chicken that DOES fit in our Black & Decker toaster oven definitely doesn't fit in here. But the deck is wide enough to handle 3 leftover pizza slices at once and heat them evenly due to the wide spaced elements up top. So for what it's SUPPOSED to do, it does well, hence 5 stars. I really couldn't think what to dock it for as a pizza oven. BTW, the deck is really heavy duty and stick-free, so if you're careful you won't many or any crumbs to clean out. I like this unit more than expected, hope it lasts. If it fails, I'll be back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEHK0XLUAT6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R1AEHK0XLUAT6B","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purposely waited three weeks to write this review because this is the 5th extender I've tried and I wanted to be absolutely sure this thing would work like it stated. I had reviewed a D-Link DAP-1650 that I had purchased and it seemingly worked well with our Linksys E6900 router. Then Cox offered me a nice bundle upgrade that included them providing a new NetGear N900 router, and when they did that the D-Link extender went erratically nuts and we fought it for over a month, dropping connections intermittenly especially with iOS devices. SO, the Netgear Extender comes along... here we go again. Unbelievably this extender has been totally flawless (I can't believe I just said that about a consumer network extender). First, it was, by far, the easiest setup I've ever done, and I don't use the easy button, I always set wireless networks manually becuase I change a certain range in the IP Address, and the setup webpage was a breeze to configure. I did it on my iPad, not even a laptop. Then the next huge plus I noticed was the LEDs on the unit letting you know if the location you chose has a strong enough signal. I had always wondered that, is the location I picked in our long-ish ranch home the right distance from the router? I have a constant green light, no orange so I know I'm good. I set up the unit as an Extender (you can also choose to run it as an access point) and the two networks, 2.4 and 5.0GHz, have worked perfectly for nearly a month. AND, the second set of LEDs on the unit shows the signal strength of your connected device. Our iPads are all green on the extended end of the house, and FINALLY we have full coverage, almost can't believe it. In fact, the router alone would fade on the other end of the house and my iPhone would switch to LTE before using an extender, and now of course I get full bars and am happy. BUT, the bars stay full walking back all the way to the router end of the house, this device is that strong! So we keep our devices on the extended network all the time and the drop-out headaches are gone finally, after two years of arguing with extenders.This unit does have a heftier price that other extenders and I believe that price vs performance means that the price should be considered, but I tell you what, the extra cost is worth the piece of mind to not have to deal with quirky intermittent signals any long. The only scenario I CAN'T review on is if this works as stable with non-NetGear routers. Being a higher-priced unit and clearly well-built, I'd guess it's work on a Linksys or other router. I sure hope so, this thing WORKS.UPDATE, 6/18/2015: Our power got cut off temporarily at our house which shut this extender off in a flash of course, and when the power was restored, it was back online and working in under a minute. I should say that our router/modem is on a battery backup so that never shut off, but still, cutting the power on extenders usually freaks them out for a few minutes, lol. This thing came right back up. And still not one dropout or interruption while on it, and we do stream a lot of video with the buggy Cox Contour app on our iPad. That's our TV in our bedroom and on the last extender we had, rebooting was a daily ritual. Not this NetGear, I'm still amazed.UPDATE, 8/3/2015: Energizer Bunny, this extender just keeps going and...It's usually after the first month when extenders seem to really start struggling, yet this NetGear is still flawless. Since our Cox-provided NetGear modem/router needs to be rebooted every few days because Cox can't get it together, we've basically stress-tested the extender's ability to jump right back on the network, and it has not failed AT ALL. rebooting the modem in the past meant rebooting the other rand extenders as well. No need for that with this NetGear. I still can't believe we found an extender that works, amazin'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPY5YOHX5PXUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CLCW#wasThisHelpful","RPY5YOHX5PXUK","A3EZFFPVS34AMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZFFPVS34AMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was the perfect follow-up to Jon Krakauer's Missoula. While Krakauker's book focused mainly on the rapes at the University of Montana, this book was much broader and did a great job of discussing many different aspects that contribute to our ""rape culture"" and how this is affecting women -- and men too. I found the book extremely well-written in a style that informed but also engaged the reader. Rape is a scary, hard-to-talk-about issue, especially when victims of this crime are so discredited. But the book offered hope as well. This definitely gives me a lot to talk about with my almost college age daughters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZS4434EL0DIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738217026#wasThisHelpful","RZS4434EL0DIJ","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are held securely in my ear and I had no problem even when I was hot and sweaty during my last stint of 3 hours of yardwork in the blazing sun.

"The headmaster of a New England boarding school receives a video of several students engaged in sexual activity which starts this story off with a bang. The book alternates from the point of view of a whole cast of characters who were either involved in the unfortunate incident or affected by it. Some is given as ""testimony"" and some is narration. The book also alternates between time periods--before the incident, the incident and after the incident. I thought all the different points of view worked well to get the reader to realize the far-reaching effects something like this has, though I was occasionally confused about where in time we were. I love Shreve's writing and really enjoyed this book. It seemed to lose steam at the end as it meandered to a finish, which is why I rated this 4 stars rather than 5.

As the execution date nears, Tessa has to relive her experiences to determine if he really is guilty or innocent.It took me a while to get into this book. The book alternates between the present which is a countdown to the execution of the convicted supposed killer and the past when Tessa was in therapy to help her deal with the aftermath of her experience with the Black-Eyed Susan killer.

"I am very impressed with the quality of this juicer. It's sturdy and attractive. It works excellently and the feeder tube is large enough that I can put whole apples in so I don't need to cut them up. All the parts are BPA-free and I like that I can choose the pulp level and the speed. I also appreciate the covered pitcher that comes with the juicer. Be sure to put the cover on as you are making the juice as it prevents the juice from spraying all over your counter and the large size of the pitcher is nice for storing any extra juice.That being said, this is advertised as an ""easy clean"" juicer. I don't find it easier to clean than other juicers I have used. There are many pieces to disassemble and clean--though the parts mostly just need to be emptied of pulp and rinsed. The only thing that needs to be scrubbed is the basket (the scrubber comes with the juicer) and that takes a few minutes. But still, it does take time to assemble, make the juice, disassemble and clean just to get a cup of juice. Not something I'd use every day but great for when I have the time, and the juice really is fantastic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1QPN8AP9VKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O50Q5Y6#wasThisHelpful","R1E1QPN8AP9VKG","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is a fictionalized memoir of Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife Sophia. Sophia, a talented but sickly artist, who falls intensely in love with Hawthorne from the first moment she meets him as does he with her. The story tells of their love, their trials, and along with glimpses of other classic authors they were friends with including Melville, Thoreau, Emerson, etc. The story was very readable, the characters real and likeable, and the tone of the book really kept to the period. The only thing that disappointed me was that personally I would have liked the book to be a little more about Hawthorne and his works, but it really about their relationship. I also found the sacrifices Sophia made regarding her art very sad.In any case, Robuck is a good writer and this was a very enjoyable read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUXSRBYP1HD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451418913#wasThisHelpful","R1GUXSRBYP1HD4","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughters are loving this curler now that they've gotten the hang of it. It's a little tricky to figure out and kind of scary how it sucks your hair in. We had a couple of crisis with hair getting stuck in the thing and having to rip it out because it was burning, but with a little practice they got it down. The trick is to be  careful not to put too much hair in the thing at a time and to make sure all the hair goes in the right place--if there are strays they get stuck. The actually curler works very well and creates long lasting curls. It's actually easy it is to use (once you know what you're doing) and my 13-year-old is happy that it is almost impossible to get burned by this iron. Another nice feature is that you can adjust it for which side of your head your are curling so you get matched curls which is difficult with a regular curling iron. This is not something to use when you are in a hurry but works very well if you take the time to learn how to use it and are very careful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBF1HSHRWW4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OA431J4#wasThisHelpful","R2QBF1HSHRWW4A","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This fan is light and easy to move to wherever in the house you need a little cooling. It's a little bigger than I thought it would be -- not really small enough to take with you on a trip (we like to take one along for white noise when traveling). I like that there are four settings: sleep (very low), white noise (low), refresh (medium), and power cool (high). You can also chose whether to have the fan stay still or rotate from side to side. What I don't like is: 1) you can't adjust the fan angle up or down and 2) it has a funny rattle noise to it so that it doesn't actually work that well if you like a fan to sleep with as white noise. This is okay but I like my other smaller Honeywell Turboforce fan better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIKT34PNQEVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHLU1WE#wasThisHelpful","RPIKT34PNQEVJ","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are curious to hear the backstory of pretty much every character ever mentioned in the Vampire Chronicle series -- mostly as told by one character to another -- then this is the book for you.  This book reminded me of a TV reunion show where all the characters are brought back to together and we get snippets from all of the various shows throughout the seasons. The story itself--what little there is--is pretty much a B-movie plot with an evil ""voice"" trying to take over the vampire world, complete with a doctor who can operate on vampires and actually gets one to procreate (give you three guesses who is the one and only vampire this procedure works on). The characters have no spark, no magic. Lestat, who repeatedly refers to himself as the ""brat prince,"" is really just an over-the-hill-prince who comes off like some bland, benevolent father in this book. Where is the charisma and outrageousness that made him the most fascinating character in the first few books of the series? And this new character Rose -- so completely helpless and needing to be rescued every few chapters -- is this really the best Rice could come up with?My recommendation: If you are a Vampire Chronicle fan looking for behind-the-scenes info on the characters, read this book. But if you are looking for a magical, engrossing story like the first few in the series--give it a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185OSTYUMKXKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962520#wasThisHelpful","R185OSTYUMKXKW","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Teenagers Ada and Stefan are in love -- but Ada lives in West Berlin and Stefan in East Berlin and in the 1980's those sections are divided by the Berlin Wall. Ada begs Stefan to come to West Berlin but escape is very risky.My teen daughter and I love books about Germany and were excited to hear about this book with such an original premise (most of the German books we find are about the Holocaust). But we both found this book really hard to get into and stick with, because of the way the author chose to tell the story. She does use some beautiful, poetic language but the telling is so disjointed and sketchy that is' hard to know what is going on sometimes--especially if the reader doesn't have a good grounding in what was happening in Germany during that time with the Turkish people. I was also confused as to why Ada is working so hard to have Stefan defect. The book made it seem that life was much better on the East German side. Stefan seemed to have a pretty comfortable life but Ada was living without heat. Why didn't she move to the East if she wanted to be with him.The book alternates between Ada's story and Stefan's story. The chapters are very short, which is another reason it's hard to get drawn into the story. But the worst choice the author made was to write Stefan's sections in the second person point of view, which is so distract and confusing because it actually isn't a second person point of view -- it's first person point of view but the author uses 'you' when she means 'I'. Ug! So the whole time I'm reading Stefan's sections I'm distracted by this point of view choice and not concentrating on the story.I'm so disappointed in this book -- the characters and the premise are really cool, but the book is just too much work to decipher and too many things didn't make sense..","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVRJI3D31U9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452124574#wasThisHelpful","R1XVRJI3D31U9S","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book, though a novel, is written in the style of a memoir. It is the story of boy who moves from southern Illinois to Goochland, Virginia and the narrator pretty much pokes fun at the place, the people, his family. The writing is very tongue-in-cheek and quite humorous but at the same time very hard to read for very long. The first chapter felt kind of like reading a prologue where I don't mind writing a little difficult and hard to follow -- but then I was ready to settle in and get into the story--but it's just more of the same. The writing seemed more like essays than a novel. It's hard to read more than a chapter or two in a sitting and there was definitely nothing calling me back to read on. I really don't think this writing style works for a novel and I had to really push myself to get through the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1808ELIIWZ2PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400062691#wasThisHelpful","R1808ELIIWZ2PD","ATJV9TWMRNF8K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJV9TWMRNF8K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to like CLEOPATRAâS SHADOWS more than I did, because I thought the idea was a great one. The author intended to reimagine the beginning of Cleopatraâs saga by telling the story through her younger sister Arsinoe. Cleopatra barely appears this book, which I was more than okay with, as I tend to like historical fiction that centers on lesser known figures. Arsinoe, and Cleopatraâs older sister, Berenice, are both footnotes in history because of their more famous sibling, but both had important lives of their own.CLEOPATRAâS SHADOWS alternates chapters between Arsinoe and Berenice. Berenice takes the throne when King Ptolemy sails to Rome for aid. Arsinoe is left behind in the palace by her father and mother, a lost child. Berenice struggles to hold the throne, to find enough men to fight for her, and to deal with her vengeance hungry mother. Arsinoe longs for Cleopatra, in the way younger sisters long for older sisters, but must beg Berenice for her life.I think my biggest problem with CLEOPATRAâS SHADOWS is that â¦ it just wasnât very interesting. It wasnât riveting or page-turning. It didnât keep my attention. There were portions that were good, such as Berenice debating between her motherâs lust for vengeance against Ptolemyâs other daughters or mercy for Arsinoe. Berenice was much more interesting for me than Arsinoe, but even so, many of her chapters plodded along. Arsinoeâs chapters were even more boring -- even though her life was in danger, I never felt like she would die, and I got tired of the many tutoring lessons. Other readers might find the inclusion of Roman histories and tragedies interesting, but I eventually had enough of being lectured. I also had a lot of unanswered questions, such as why Ganymedes left Arsinoe in the market. Based on the bonus material at the end of the book, I have a feeling CLEOPATRAâS SHADOWS is the first in a series, so perhaps my questions will be answered in future books.Iâm a character-driven reader, and unfortunately, I couldnât connect with either Berenice or Arsinoe. I didnât like or hate either one of them. My feelings towards both, and the secondary characters, were very blah. The author didnât bring them to life enough for me to care about what they did or what happened to them, and an hour after finishing CLEOPATRAâS SHADOWS, Iâve already forgotten a fair bit of the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNLRDVINZJE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316382981#wasThisHelpful","R3VNLRDVINZJE3","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE PRISONERS OF BREENDONK tells the history of Breendonk, a little known âreceptionâ camp in Belgium during WWII. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about WWII, but I had never heard of Breendonk before.The author focuses on personal narratives to tell the history of the camp. He tells the stories of many prisoners, including information about their lives before and after imprisonment, if possible. He starts with the story of Israel Neumann, a prisoner who has a sad tale: he once immigrated to America, but after a visit to Europe, he was declared unfit to re enter America and eventually ended up at Breendonk. I think that using so many personal narratives will help younger readers really connect with the tragedies of WWII.The book also includes lots of photographs, illustrations, and maps. Most of the photographs are from the only ones taken during the war, by Otto Kropf, a propagandist in the Wehrmacht. The illustrations were done by inmate Jacques Ochs. There are charts showing what happened to prisoners transported from Breendonk to other camps, and how many survived. Lastly, the author has a section detailing what happened to some of the Breendonk prisoners and their families. I always appreciate that sort of section, as so often youâre never sure what happened to many of the people mentioned.I do wish that the author had used full dates every single time, instead of just the month and year, because sometimes I wasnât sure of the timeline.I found THE PRISONERS OF BREENDONK quite informative, and I think it would be a good introduction to camps for high school readers who likely havenât read a lot of WWII nonfiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A3K2Q75SX3RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544096649#wasThisHelpful","R1A3K2Q75SX3RA","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the idea behind MECHANICA. While inspired by Cinderella, MECHANICA is more than a fairytale retelling. Nicolette is determined to make her own way in the world by becoming a successful inventor just like her mother. But with both of her parents gone, Nicoletteâs been turned into a servant for her Stepmother and step-sisters. On her sixteenth birthday, she receives a letter from her long-dead mother, informing her how to get into the workshop hidden in the cellar.Having the workshop changes everything. Suddenly Nicoletteâs able to invent her own machines, rather than just fix the ones left from her motherâs day. Nicolette comes up with a plan for independence, working very hard to perfect her projects and find ways of making money. Unlike many fairytale princesses, she doesnât sit around and mope while waiting for a prince to rescue her.I was a little wary at first when she met Fin and Caro, and warier still when she had such strong feelings for Fin. But. BUT. I *love* how the author handled the whole thing in the end. Nicolette thought about her feelings for Fin quite a bit, and a lot of the time, he was like an imaginary friend, someone to talk to during the long, rough days. And when thereâs a chance for them to be together, she thinks about what *she* wants, not what everyone else wants. MECHANICA doesnât go the usual route of romance in YA, and I was so, so, SO happy about that. I also liked that the author mentioned how the Fey have friend families instead of spouses.MECHANICA did have a couple of things I have to nitpick. Is there another book coming? I canât find any information so far, but I sure hope so. There were some unresolved things that were really built up, like the Ashes. I also hoped for more information on what happened during/after the Exposition, since attending it was so important to Nicolette. I didnât find MECHANICA to have a real big climax, just a kind of whimper at the end, regarding both the Exposition and the Steps.Overall, however, I quite enjoyed MECHANICA and Nicolette. I really do hope there is a sequel, so I can watch her continue to grow and find out more about the fascinating world the author created.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VBC6GSUP3YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547927711#wasThisHelpful","R21VBC6GSUP3YI","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love historical fiction, especially historical fiction that covers less popular time periods than Tudor England or WWII. Thereâs nothing wrong with those periods, but there are thousands of years of stories to tell rather than rehashing the same thing over and over. So, I was obviously excited to start LEGACY OF KINGS. Alexander the Great as a boy? Bring it on!LEGACY OF KINGS is the first in the Blood of Gods and Royals series. Itâs over 400 pages, and for the first book in a series, it felt about a hundred pages too long. Part of the reason why I felt it was too long is thereâs a huge cast of main characters. There are seven! The author had to spend a lot of time introducing everyone and setting up their arcs. Iâm sure all the characters are important in their own way, but a few were boring for me, because they didnât get a lot of page time and I didnât know enough about them. Yes, I know thatâs contradictory, but I wish the author had slimmed down her cast and really focused on characters such as Alexander and Cynane.Due to the large cast, LEGACY OF KINGS has a slow start. It takes the book a while to get going, and switching perspectives didnât immerse me in the time period at first. But I kept going, and after Iâd gone through everyoneâs perspectives at least once, the book got better. I swore I was reading a historical soap opera â but in a good, really entertaining way.I think the author did a great job of showing life in ancient Macedonia. I really liked the little details, such as how thereâs a bucket of sand in most rooms in case of fire. I also like how thereâs some magic in LEGACY OF KINGS, and hints of more to come. Itâs the end of the Age of Gods â¦ or is it? I donât know, and I canât wait to find out.I wavered between three and four stars for LEGACY OF KINGS. Itâs a book I liked because of the time period and the story. But I didnât love it, due to the large cast of characters and the slow pacing. Based on the ending, I think the authorâs going to really amp things up in the next book, EMPIRE OF DUST, so this is a series Iâm eager to continue.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3RO6IVGGS9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211724#wasThisHelpful","R3A3RO6IVGGS9P","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MAGIC SHIFTS is the eighth book in the super awesome Kate Daniels series. I just read the entire series to get caught up to MAGIC SHIFTS, and this is one series where the books get better and better. I canât recommend this series enough if you like a snarky, kick butt heroine, solid and creative worldbuilding, and villains and bad magic from all over the globe.In MAGIC SHIFTS, Kate and Curran are trying to live a normal life. As normal as life can be when Kateâs the daughter of the most powerful man alive and Curranâs the former Beast Lord. Thanks to Kateâs agreement with her father in the previous book, MAGIC BREAKS, theyâve left the Pack. But instead of settling into their new house, theyâre catapulted into a confusing investigation when Eduardo, a werebison, goes missing.THE GOOD:â¥ I was a little worried when I started MAGIC SHIFTS, because one of my favorite things about this series is the Pack. I liked watching Kate manage the shapeshifters, and seeing them bicker and politic their way around the Keep. But many of the characters I liked in previous books are still in the series, and you know what? Kate and Curran shine even outside of the Pack. Their relationship is solid but still growing, and seeing Curran try to behave for the neighbors was hilarious.â¥ At last, there are some real consequences for Kate throwing herself headlong into danger. I enjoy how Kate never hesitates to draw her sword and rush into a fight, but with the amount of abuse she puts her body through, you start to wonder how sheâs still alive, even with magic. I wonât spoil things, but I *loved* what happens to her in MAGIC SHIFTS.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.â¥ Three words: Roland. Likes. Applebeeâs. Those three words lead to what has to be one of my favorite scenes in the whole series. Again, Iâm not going to spoil the fantasticness, but I like where the authorâs going with Kate and Roland.â¥ As with the bad guys in other books, the author doesnât go with the traditional Western European supernatural creatures. Iâve seen the creature in MAGIC SHIFTS before, but this time it was *scary.* Yet again, I donât want to drop spoilers, but I will say Iâve never read such a cool theory on ghouls.THE BAD:Nothing.

"Daaaaamn. I just finished MAGIC BREAKS, and Iâm at a loss for words. Iâve said this in almost every review Iâve written for the Kate Daniels series, but this is a series where the books just get better and better.Iâve been looking forward to Kateâs confrontation with her father for seven books now. I had absolutely no idea how the author would handle it, since Kateâs always known that Roland has a gazillion times more magic than she does. Iâm not going to spoil what does happen, but I like how it all went down. It makes sense and shows how much Kate has grown over the series. Because you know if she had met Roland in book one, she would have stuck Slayer in his heart, and he would have killed her, and that would have been it. But now that Kate has lots of friends, fiancÃ© Curran, adopted street kid Julie, and the welfare of the Pack to worry about, she canât go in sword point first.In other books, I liked seeing lots of the Pack, but I also missed the Kate from the first few in the series, where she was more on her own. In MAGIC BREAKS, Kateâs separated from Curran and the Pack, and she has to rely on every bit of training from Voron to stay alive. I loved it. I had absolutely no idea where the story was going in this book, and I loved that, too. It was also great to learn even more about Roland and Kateâs powers, which is something I enjoy in every installment. The author has some super creative ideas for magic.Iâve been binge reading this series, but if youâve been following it all along and need a refresher, the author includes a handy list of characters and summary of events by Barabas, Kateâs bouda nanny.One of my favorite things about the Kate Daniels series is how talented the author is at making me feel about every single character. Lots of old faces are back in MAGIC BREAKS as well as some new ones. Even though Iâve never really liked Ghastek before, I felt for him in this book. Same with the alpha wererat couple, Robert and Thomas. Christopher, the insane guy Kate rescued in MAGIC RISES, shows up too, and I felt for him. Seriously. These characters tug on my (mostly nonexistent) heartstrings.And the last page of MAGIC BREAKS?

This is the first book where we get to see the rest of the world Post-Shift, as Kate and the Pack travel to Europe to guard a pregnant shapeshifter. They know itâs a trap, but they go anyway, because the promised payment is panacea, a medicine that can reverse loupism.I really liked getting to see more of the world than just Atlanta. Itâs good to see how other countries cope (or donât) with magic, and who has come out on top. You wonât believe who the lord of the castle is in MAGIC RISES â but heâs an excellent pick. MAGIC RISES has a lot of Pack dealings, but it also moves Kateâs arc towards her inevitable confrontation with her father. I appreciate that the author isnât making Roland a one book enemy, and I like how weâve learned more about his background and Kateâs powers as the series progresses.I wasnât super thrilled with Curran in this book; it felt like Kate and Curranâs relationship took a step backwards. There are a couple of inconsistencies with how they act, and I wanted to slap Curran for a good portion of MAGIC RISES. I didnât buy his excuse for the whole thing with Lorelei, and with the sheer amount of important stuff happening, I couldâve done without the relationship problems.Otherwise, I really enjoyed MAGIC RISES. As usual, I canât believe how much the author packed into the book: a bodyguard case, the lord of the castle, mysterious new shapeshifters, Kate/Curran, and some big important battles. There were a few scenes that made my eyes sting, because I care so much about the characters in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLKNGQJOTR45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937007588#wasThisHelpful","R2DLKNGQJOTR45","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MAGIC SLAYS is the fifth book in the Kate Daniels series. I say this every review, but the books in this series just keep getting better and better! Iâm a latecomer to this amazing urban fantasy series, but thatâs good in a way, because I canât imagine waiting a year between installments.If you thought Erra was bad in the previous book, MAGIC BLEEDS, the bad guys in MAGIC SLAYS are even worse. Kateâs case this time spotlights a danger to the entire city of Atlanta. Itâs something she canât handle herself, even though sheâs quit the Order and doesnât have them holding her back anymore. I really liked the big fight in MAGIC SLAYS, because lots of different groups come and fight together â it felt epic in scope.My favorite things about this series include Kate, Kate and Curran, the Pack, and the other characters. The author continues to deliver on all of those points.â¥ Kate has grown so much from the first book in the series while staying true to herself that itâs incredible. Sheâs still snarky and bad ass, but now more vulnerable because sheâs formed attachments and friendships with people.â¥ Kate and Curran â their relationship has become one of my favorite in an urban fantasy series. They bicker and have to work to develop their relationship and support each other. Itâs realistic, which is always important to me.â¥ I do so enjoy the Pack. Itâs great to see Kate act as the Alpha, showing the shapeshifters that she can act like them without going furry, and that sheâll protect them just as much as Curran does.â¥ I love Kate and Curran, but I also love all the other characters in this series. The authorâs really good at making you feel for everybody, if theyâre in one scene or multiple books. Andrea is back, which was great, since I like her friendship with Kate. Julieâs also back, yay! Although maybe not yay, because the poor kid goes through some rough stuff. The new bouda Ascanioâs a hoot, and the attack poodle Grendel is back. Seriously, there are some great characters in this series, and Iâm greedy enough to want novellas about all of them.MAGIC SLAYS slays it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29WA3S8ZP1FKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441020429#wasThisHelpful","R29WA3S8ZP1FKY","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MAGIC BLEEDS is the fourth book in the Kate Daniels series. Iâve been binge reading this series, and each book is better than the last, which is rare in a series. Kate Daniels has a spot on my favorite kickbutt characters list. Sheâs just plain awesome.MAGIC BLEEDS digs deeper into Kateâs background than previous books have. Kateâs case starts out as a typical Order investigation â as typical as something involving magic, death, and deadly diseases can be. Which, of course, is pretty typical in the authorâs version of Atlanta, where magic and tech alternately rule supreme. But the case becomes something more when she finds out the true identity of the Steel Mary whoâs been infecting corpses with diseases like syphilis and cholera.As with the other books in this series, I enjoyed the lore of the bad guy, which was inspired by Babylonian mythology. I never know whatâs going to come next, or how Kate will save the day, which is something I love. Itâs never fun when books are too predictable. I was scared for Kate and Curran and Atlanta, because there were some nail-biting action scenes where it looked like the end was about to come.Kate and Curranâs relationship takes a huge step forward in MAGIC BLEEDS. Iâm usually picky on romances, but I like the way the authorâs developed theirs over the course of the series. I thought what happened between Kate and Curran was realistic, which is really important for me with romances. They act as theyâve been characterized â they donât change personalities as things heat up or cool down.I also liked getting to see more of Pack politics. How well do wolves, rats, cats, hyenas, and other shapeshifters get along? Not very well. The Pack, its structure, and politics are just one more thing I enjoy about this series. I like how the authorâs given each clan a distinct personality and place in the hierarchy, because I love seeing Kate come in and totally ignore everything.MAGIC BLEEDS is full of everything I like about the Kate Daniels series: inventive magic, a scary world, well-developed characters, creative use of mythology and supernatural creatures, and too many other things to name.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWBGTXQEX8W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441018521#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWBGTXQEX8W2","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MAGIC STRIKES is the third book in the Kate Daniels series. I highly recommend this series if you like creative urban fantasy with a side of kickbutt heroine, sizzling chemistry, and non-stop action.In MAGIC STRIKES, we at last learn more about Kate and her background. Previous books in the series had some clues, but here we get the full story. Why Kate is so careful about never leaving her blood or any traces of it around. Why Kate knows so much about the powerful, mysterious, and secret leader of the People. And why Kate is a loner, which might be the most important information of all, since she bucks all of her life experience and training to help her friends.Kate doesnât have many friends, you see, so when Derek ends up nearly dead, sheâs willing to take part in a deadly tournament to get revenge on his attackers. The bad guys in MAGIC STRIKES are inspired by Hindu mythology, and damn, they were creepy and scary, but also cool. I like how the author never sticks with the traditional Western European baddies, but draws inspiration from all over the globe.I enjoyed every aspect of MAGIC STRIKES, from watching Kateâs protective side come out again to seeing her growing friendships with a variety of Pack members. Julie from MAGIC BURNS even makes a cameo appearance; I was happy to see her again. And I canât forget the romantic relationship developing between Kate and Curran. Iâm not always a fan of romances, but I appreciate that this one hasnât been rushed, and that Kate doesnât lose herself whenever Curran shows up. She admits sheâs attracted to him, but she doesnât let that attraction override her brain.The ending made me snort with laughter. Iâm not going to spoil, but itâs *good.* Thatâs just one more thing I like about Ilona Andrewsâ writing â it makes me laugh all the time, even in the middle of a dangerous action scene or when Kateâs just sitting in her apartment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUSQH2LLVZZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441017029#wasThisHelpful","R1SUSQH2LLVZZD","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"INK AND BONE is one of those books I always wanted, but I never knew it until I read it. There are so many good ideas and itâs such a great story that Iâm still thinking about INK AND BONE a month after finishing it. With the amount of books I read, about 20 per month, itâs rare that a book sticks with me.Jess lives in a world where owning personal copies of books is illegal. The Great Library has survived since the days of Alexandria and now exists in every city. The Library controls access to book and knowledge, functioning with as much power as a country. Jessâs family makes a living selling books on the black market, and seeing an opportunity, his father sends him to the Library, with the intent of having a spy on the inside.But joining the Library isnât that easy. There are 32 postulants and 6 available spots. The competition is fierce and dangerous. Jess must navigate a murky world, one where disagreeing with the Libraryâs policies and politics can be deadly. For example, when Jess is in the middle of a war zone, he could call on his family connections to survive, but doing so would expose his book smuggling background. What to do?Imagine the greatest texts of the world surviving through the centuries thanks to the Library. But at the same time, imagine the same Library controlling which of those texts the public can see. Imagine a world where you canât own your own books. Itâs every book loverâs nightmare, right?Rachel Caine explores those ideas and others in INK AND BONE. Itâs a very thinky book, but enjoyably so. Jessâs time as a postulant for the Library is the best sort of dangerous adventure, one thatâs fun to read but left me thinking.

"I was looking forward to reading A ROYAL ROMANCE because I wanted to see how the author would pull off an openly gay monarch. The answer? Pretty easy and plausibly, in my opinion. The book is set in 2053, not too far in the future, but far enough that Great Britain adores Georgiana, and thereâs medical advances to take care of that pesky heir issue.George and Beatrice are thrown together when the new queen picks the charity where Bea works as her main charity leading up to her coronation. Bea isnât happy that sheâll have to spend time with the Queen â sheâs a republican and thinks the monarchy should be abolished. But of course, once the two start interacting on a personal level, and Bea sees that Queen Georgiana is much more caring and responsible than she expected. George, isolated by her position as monarch, finds Beaâs bluntness and honesty refreshing.A ROYAL ROMANCE was a guilty pleasure read for me. It was just *fun* to see the relationship develop between George and Bea, to see Georgeâs life as queen and Beaâs as a commoner. It was also refreshing to see that both of their families were encouraging, even when Bea doubted that things could work between them because of their class differences. I did think the ending was a tad rushed, considering all the buildup and back-and-forth on their relationship. But A ROYAL ROMANCE left me wanting a sequel, and romances donât usually do that to me.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH24ONG2VPK6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGQTWEQ#wasThisHelpful","RH24ONG2VPK6O","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am picky when it comes to contemporary. Very, very picky. I originally picked up UNDER THE LIGHTS because I knew it had a girl/girl relationship, and those are all too rare in YA/NA.By the way, this is the second book in a series, but you donât need to have read the first, BEHIND THE SCENES, because UNDER THE LIGHTS is Vanessa and Joshâs story, not Ally and Liamâs.I got that relationship and so much more. Honestly, I was surprised at how deftly the author wove in many big important things, including:â¥ Diversity. Vanessa is Korean American. Sheâs part of the main cast for Daylight Falls â not to fulfill a racial quota, but because sheâs a good actress. Her parents want her to quit playing around and go to college, get a real job. But she wants to be an idol to girls just like her. So when she realizes sheâs attracted to Brianna, and that she might be gayâ¦â¥ Sexuality. Vanessaâs not so sure she can survive in Hollywood being a minority *and* being gay. Parts just donât exist when you fit into those slots. As it is, sheâs typecast in movies as the med student or science nerd. Her boyfriend, Zander, has never made her tingle like Bri does, *and* heâs pushing for her to make a purity pledge so they can be even better role models. Meanwhile, Josh, the other main character, makes no apologies that he likes to have sex with a different girl every night. His sexuality is praised â a reality TV show wants to follow him around.â¥ Celebrity culture and expectations. Joshâs mom, an aging soap star, wants a reality TV show to replace her canceled show. The only condition? Her famous bad boy son must be a part of it. Itâs totally okay for him to be a jerk to his fake girlfriend and woo girls in clubs. But for Vanessa? Itâs not okay for her to even be seen in a club â it goes against her good girl image.Thereâs so much good stuff in UNDER THE LIGHTS. I loved the authorâs voices for both characters and her writing style. I was in a reading slump when I started this book, and it helped pull me out. On one level, UNDER THE LIGHTS is fun and includes some very yummy scenes between Vanessa and Bri â including a non fade-to-black sex scene. On another level, UNDER THE LIGHTS has great commentary and observations on so many important cultural and life issues.UNDER THE LIGHTS has so much of what I want to see in YA and NA that Iâll be recommending the hell out of it.

"THE DUNGEONEERS has a healthy helping of Dungeons and Dragons, a dash of Harry Potter, and a heaping spoonful of humor and fun. I ate this book up like candy â it was much better than the endless stew served at Thwodinâs Legion.Colm Canderly has eight sisters who love to torment him (but they love him, too). But thatâs not the worst of his problems. Heâs from a poor family, and no matter how much cobbling work his father does, thereâs never enough to go around. So one day, he decides to lift the purses of wealthy men â¦ just to help the family, of course â¦ but discovers he has a real talent for thievery. Naturally, his honest father isnât happy, and insists Colm give the money back.Enter Finn. A member of Thwodinâs Legion, a premiere dungeoning guild, Finn recognizes Colmâs talent, and offers him the opportunity of a lifetime. What twelve-year-old boy wouldnât jump at the chance to make lots of gold, fight orcs, and get his name out there? At the guild hall, Colm is teamed up with his party, consisting of Lena the Barbarian (who faints at the sight of her own blood), Quinn the Mage (who stutters when heâs nervous, casting unpredictable spells), and Serene the Druid (whoâs scared of animals with lots of teeth). They must learn to work together, balancing each othersâ strengths and weaknesses, to survive in orc-infested, trap-laden dungeons.THE DUNGEONEERS was a treat to read. A funny, well-written, fantastical middle grade book great for kids and adults. I do think itâs a tad long, as there are some chapters without a lot of action or story forwarding. But the characters are all developed â all unique, with their own personalities that expand beyond their party roles. I enjoyed watching their friendship grow, and watching them train together. I appreciated that the author put time into showing how a rogue might practice his skills.THE DUNGEONEERS is the perfect book for when you canât find someone to play D&D with, or when you want to escape into a dungeon and come out with storybook gold without dodging boring orc traps!Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BQ6DHF2U1RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062338145#wasThisHelpful","R17BQ6DHF2U1RB","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CIRCUS MIRANDUS is a magical book.Yes, itâs about a magical circus, so you could assume some magic there, but thereâs magic in the characters, the story, the relationships -- everything, really. When I started reading this book, I was 14 chapters in before I knew it, and later I didnât want to turn the last page.CIRCUS MIRANDUS is a book you can read on a few levels. One, for kids to experience a fantastical circus and the power of relationships. Two, for adults to remember the power of magic and hopefully to think that believing in magic is a good thing, and to see how it can help anyone through tough times.I think the most impactful thing I can say about this book is that it made me ugly cry at one point and left me filled with hope by the end. Very few books affect me emotionally, but CIRCUS MIRANDUS was one. Why? *Everything* about this book is fantastic and so well done.I ached for Micah. At the start of the book, heâs facing the loss of his grandfather Ephraim, who is really more of a father to him. Aunt Gertrudis tries to keep them apart in their last days together, and gets angry any time they share their special stories of Circus Mirandus. Ephraim visited the circus as a youth, and was given a miracle. Heâs hung onto it for years, but now is the time to use it -- and Micahâs determined heâll get to do so.One little thing I especially loved about CIRCUS MIRANDUS was that we got to see the magic circus from both Ephraim and Micahâs eyes. I thought it really added to the book that the author included chapters from a young Ephraim, who went through something very similar to Micah.I have so much love for CIRCUS MIRANDUS. My experience while reading was amazing, and I canât recommend it enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUNJGV5B86WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428437#wasThisHelpful","R2FUNJGV5B86WF","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was super excited for A SCHOOL FOR UNUSUAL GIRLS. At Stranje House, unmarriageable girls are supposedly reformed. But in reality, their unusual qualities and abilities are further developed. Sent to Stranje House after she sets her fatherâs stables on fire while trying to create invisible ink, Georgiana wants to escape â¦ until she meets Sebastian Wyatt and learns that Miss Stranje wants her to create that ink.The summary strongly hints at romance, but I didnât think it would take over the whole book. The ârelationshipâ that springs up between Georgiana and Sebastian caused me to dislike A SCHOOL FOR UNUSUAL GIRLS. Georgianaâs supposed to be smart, but she falls in love with Sebastian after about two seconds of looking at him. Or thatâs what it felt like. I think they spent less than a week together, but they were falling in love by the middle of the book. I canât stand that type of undeveloped relationship, and it influenced how I felt about the book.Aside from the insta-love romance, I didnât get Georgiana. Again, sheâs supposed to be smart, but where does this come from? Why is she the only one who can develop the ultra-important invisible ink spies need in the war effort? Where do her special skills come from? Weâre not told of her successes, just her failures: setting the stables on fire, jumping out a window and hurting her arm, etc. And when Georgiana works on that ink, she nearly kills Sebastian and then makes another mistake because theyâre swooning over each other. And Stranje House itself? It sounds like an interesting place, but Georgiana doesnât partake in very many lessons because sheâs busy with Sebastian.Ultimately, A SCHOOL FOR UNUSUAL GIRLS just wasnât what I expected it to be. Instead of a history-filled, girl-powered jaunt through 1814, itâs an unrealistic romance with a tiny dash of adventure.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZ57M6ZFYVRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765376008#wasThisHelpful","RRZ57M6ZFYVRS","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MOSEHâS STAFF is the fourth book in A.W. Exleyâs Artifact Hunters series. In the past, Iâve described the series as quirky and unique. A good blend of historical fiction, fantasy, romance, adventure, mythology, and steampunk. These descriptions hold true with MOSEHâS STAFF, which is sadly the last book in the series. Iâm sad to see the end of Cara and Nate, but I do like how the author finished everything.As Queen Victoriaâs artifact hunters, Nate and Cara must figure out what artifact is causing endless winter and misery in London. Itâs April, but the Thames is frozen. London is the only area affected, and Victoriaâs not very happy about it. Cara and Nate have a good idea of who is behind events â the Curator â but how to stop him is a different question. How do you stop a man who bleeds water instead of blood?The hunt becomes even more personal when the Curator reveals his intentions to take Cara as his own, severing the bond of Nefertitiâs Heart that connects her and Nate. I love Cara and Nate together, but it was great to see Nate on his own as well. The author showed more of Nateâs darker side, the no holds barred man he was before Caraâs presence in his life. Nateâs the guy Iâd want on my side if someone took me, because he stops at nothing to rescue Cara.Thereâs a lot of revelations in MOSEHâS STAFF, tying up loose ends from previous books in the series, such as explaining why Cara and Nate fit so perfectly together, or bringing back the dragon from HATSHEPSUTâS COLLAR. Many of Cara and Nateâs friends show up in MOSEHâS STAFF (minus Loki, sadface), rallying around Nate to help find Cara. And Cara, kick butt woman that she is, isnât content to sit back and be rescued. She confronts her own demons in MOSEHâS STAFF while trying to figure out which artifact powers the Curator.All in all, MOSEHâS STAFF is a satisfying conclusion to the Artifact Hunters series, full of what I loved about the previous books: Cara and Nate, twists on mythology, humor in dark moments, and lots of action.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMF8IFZ52VO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTH490S#wasThisHelpful","R2EMF8IFZ52VO2","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though Iâm a huge fantasy fan, Iâve never read any Shannara books. I have read most of Brooksâ Magic Kingdom of Landover series and liked them, but I never knew where to start with Shannara because there are so many. THE DARKLING CHILD, the second in the Defenders of Shannara trilogy, is supposed to be a standalone, and a good entry point for new readers.After reading THE DARKLING CHILD, I have no interest in reading any other books in the Shannara series. I struggled to get through this book, and wondered more than once how Brooks is so popular. Maybe his work has decreased in quality over the years, because THE DARKLING CHILD? Substandard fantasy. I really felt like the author was trying to hit a certain page count and that was it.I donât even know where to start, other than to say I canât remember much of the book, and I finished it a day ago. I was tempted to put THE DARKLING CHILD down after the first few chapters, but I know fantasy can have a slow pace to start, so I gave it a chance. But I wish I didnât, because this book was a slog to get through.I wouldnât recommend this if youâre new to Shannara, because other than explaining the origin of wishsong, thereâs no real worldbuilding. I donât know what the Federation is, what the druids do, etc. There are also references to the first book in this trilogy, THE HIGH DRUIDâS BLADE, but those werenât as bad as the shoddy writing, YA-style romances, predictable story, and lack of women other than as plot devices.After my dismal experience with THE DARKLING CHILD, I wonât be returning to Shannara.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYKV3B7B9JV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540794#wasThisHelpful","RMYKV3B7B9JV1","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The summary for DAUGHTER OF DEEP SILENCE makes it sound like the kind of book Iâd love. Frances is one of the few survivors of the destruction of the Persephone; more importantly, sheâs the only survivor whoâs willing to face the truth of what happened. The two other survivors, a Senator and his son, claim a rogue wave destroyed the ship, but Frances knows everyone on board was murdered at gunpoint. After rescue, she takes on the identity of Libby OâMartin, a girl she met on the ship. Frances is determined to get revenge for the murders of her parents and the life she lost.Fast forward four years. Frances has seamlessly become Libby, and now sheâs out to destroy the Senator and his son for covering up the truth about the Persephone. The only snag in her plan? The Senatorâs son - Grey - is her first love. They also met on the ship, and somehow fell in love in a few days. When she sees him again, Frances is torn between her revenge and loving Grey.I found DAUGHTER OF DEEP SILENCE skewed too far in the unbelievable romance direction for me to enjoy the book at all. I wanted to put the book aside by page 8, after I read, âIt didnât matter that Iâd known him barely a week, it had been long enough to fall for him with an intensity Iâd never experienced before (p. 8).â Okay, I get that theyâre both fourteen at the time, and swept away by each other, but when Frances encounters him years later? When sheâs putting her revenge plans underway? Sheâs pretty much in love with him all over again, and the Frances part of her thatâs hiding inside the Libby disguise wants to throw all caution to the wind and be loved again. To top that off, Iâm not sure why Frances liked Grey at first -- maybe because he was the first boy that showed her attention? I donât know. You canât just tell me that they fell in love in a few days and itâs a ârelationshipâ that overcomes her desire to get revenge for the murder of her parents and hundreds of other people.DAUGHTER OF DEEP SILENCE requires a *lot* of suspension of disbelief: that Libby and Frances looked enough alike for Frances to assume Libbyâs identity; that Frances and Grey fell in love at first sight; that Frances can carry out such a complicated revenge plot without any real experience; etc., etc. I also found the authorâs writing style to be somewhat stilted, with lots of telling that didnât add to the suspense for me. The pace was super slow, and I skimmed a lot of the book because I just wasnât interested in what was going on. The only reason I kept reading? I wanted to find out why everyone on the Persephone was murdered. But even that wasnât too interesting. I wish Iâd gone with my instincts and put DAUGHTER OF DEEP SILENCE down after the first few chapters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSBTS10NOWE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426507#wasThisHelpful","R2OSBTS10NOWE4","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was considering making myself a pair of PVC parallettes to exercise at home, so this was a great product for me to review. Although I know the PVC could support my weight, I just feel more comfortable with wood and metal.These are extremely easy to assemble; thereâs even an included wrench. All you have to do is screw the upper portion of the bar to the non-skid foot bars. They donât take up a lot of room in the house, which is good for storing them when youâre not using.I do wish that the company had included a brochure on exercises to try, rather than just putting their website address on the bottom of the assembly instructions. When I put something together, I want to try it out right away, not have to go look up exercise ideas. I also didnât like that the handles are unfinished wood. I could feel a couple of slightly rough spots â not splintery, but just a tad rough. I might do some sanding to make the bars silky smooth.Otherwise, I do like the product, and can see myself getting a lot of use out of the bars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3HS34Q5H895/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V17H1S0#wasThisHelpful","R3V3HS34Q5H895","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES is the first book in a new fantasy series by Sarah J. Maas. A New Adult retelling of Beauty and the Beast in a world where faeries are the real power, the book follows prickly Feyre, who is stolen from her home after she kills a faerie disguised as a wolf. Now, instead of struggling to provide for her family, Feyre will spend the rest of her days in Prythian, the faerie lands. But are things what they seem in magical Prythian? Are the faeries as bad as Feyre has always been told?This is my first Sarah J. Maas book. Iâve heard good things about her other series, but A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES hooked me because of that cover (perfect!) and that itâs New Adult. Basically, if you donât know what New Adult means â itâs the next step after Young Adult. Older protagonists, more romance than just kissing, and more serious situations. I will say that this book doesnât veer too deeply into NA territory. There are a few sexual scenes, but I personally wouldnât call them explicit. Your opinion may vary of course, but compared to other NA, this book is somewhat tame and mostly reads like a YA book.Okay, that aside, I mostly liked A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES. I liked Feyre. For years, she had the responsibility of keeping her father and sisters alive. Itâs a thankless job, since they mourn the life of privilege they lost and donât care that Feyre has given up her dreams to take care of them. So, in a way, when Feyreâs taken to Prythian, itâs an escape for her. I liked watching Feyre rediscover herself and having the chance to do things she enjoys, such as painting. I also liked how she gradually realized that maybe not everything sheâd been told about faeries was true.I liked the authorâs vision of faerie courts and lands. I tend to like darker fae, and Maas definitely has some of those. The last quarter or so of A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES was my favorite part for that reason, since itâs where we get to see a lot of fae and their trickery.I thought the book was paced too slowly. Yes, I know A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES is fantasy, but there were portions of the book where it seemed like nothing happened other than Feyre and Tamlin staring at each other. 75% of the book is slow, leaving the last 25% and the final climax feeling too rushed for all those pages. By the time I finished the book, I couldâve sworn it was 600 pages, not ~430.Some of that slow 75% was used for the development of Feyre and Tamlinâs relationship. While Iâm happy it wasnât insta-lust or part of a love triangle, I didnât really feel the love. However, I did like that once Feyre committed, she committed big time.Overall, A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES was an okay book for me. I had a couple of issues with it, but this is a series I will continue. The author interested me enough in her version of fae history/courts/politics that I want to know what happens next with Feyre and Tamlin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2729A7NWTHNJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619634449#wasThisHelpful","R2729A7NWTHNJY","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"âBut really knowing me, few people do (p. 2).âSo says Billy Zeets, unlikely hero. He claims he isnât a hero, and that if he did what he did, so could you, âCause I ainât betterân nobody (p. 5).âBilly is the best part of ASK THE DARK. The book is written in his voice, and while it might take a bit of getting used to, his vernacular is what piqued my interest when I sampled the book. Billyâs a poor boy raised on the wrong side of town, a mostly reformed troublemaker who doesnât do well in school. It would have been unrealistic for him to speak grammatically correct English.The next best part of ASK THE DARK is Billyâs drive to keep his family from losing their house. Thanks to a series of unfortunate events, Billyâs father canât keep up with the remortgage payments and, a broken man, heâs ready to give up. But Billy doesnât think itâs right that they lose the house his dad worked all his life for. But how can a fourteen-year-old, let alone one with a bad reputation, make $48,000 in three months?So, when Billy stumbles over some mysterious boxes in an abandoned house, his first thought is what he can find to sell. Not that the boxes are the first clue in solving the mystery of kidnapped boys. It takes Billy a while to put the pieces together, and even when he realizes he might know something important, he also knows the police wonât believe a word he says because of his past.ASK THE DARK was a bit slow paced for me, especially for a thriller. But I suppose the slower pace makes sense, because Billy has to connect all the clues on his own, and thereâs not always a lightbulb moment. Sometimes it takes thinking about. I also wish there had been more details on what happened to the kidnapped boys, rather than Billy saying youâd have to ask them.But overall, I like the messages in ASK THE DARK. Billyâs devotion to his father and sister, to saving their house, and how he realized sometimes you have to be the adult when your parent(s) arenât acting like adults. I also liked how Billy became an unlikely hero in his quest, and how he faced the darkness, even going above and beyond to save a boy who had bullied him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BRJ3QP5RRUI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544308271#wasThisHelpful","R2BRJ3QP5RRUI5","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A THOUSAND MILES TO FREEDOM is Eunsun Kimâs story of her nine year quest to escape North Korea. I was interested in this memoir because I havenât read any before about North Korea, and I just know the little Iâve heard in the news.While the content of the book is often difficult to stomach -- Eunsunâs family nearly dying of starvation, being sold to a Chinese farmer, being caught by the police and returned to North Korea -- the writing is very simple. I think teenagers and mature younger kids could easily handle this book, if they are curious about North Korea and what one might endure to escape. The simple writing also makes A THOUSAND MILES TO FREEDOM a relatively quick read. I was expecting something with a higher quality of writing, although the style might be due to translation. I believe the book was originally published in French.I also would have liked more insight into life in North Korea. I understand that the author didnât know a lot when she lived in the country, because citizens were only supposed to know the propaganda. But since finally finding a safe place in South Korea, Eunsun says that she has learned a lot about her country and its regime. I wish she would have shared more of what she learned with the reader.A THOUSAND MILES TO FREEDOM is mainly the story of Eunsun and her familyâs journey to escape starvation and death in North Korea. They didnât leave because of politics -- they left because if they didnât, they would die because there was no food to eat. But escaping was no easy task, and the family endured a lot. But again, I wish the author had gone into more detail on certain things. When sheâs sent to a North Korean reeducation camp, experiences there are described in a very short passage, compared to say, the description of her life on a Chinese farm.I did find it interesting that once Eunsun and her mother made it to South Korea, the country helped them out. They were made citizens, took a course on capitalism and acclimating to life in South Korea, and were given money to rent an apartment. Eunsun was even able to attend a prestigious college because of a special program for North Korean students.Overall, A THOUSAND MILES TO FREEDOM is a hopeful memoir, but I wish it had a bit more depth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FU5Q39OV141/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250064643#wasThisHelpful","R12FU5Q39OV141","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In SISTERS OF BLOOD AND SPIRIT, twins Lark and Wren take on a vicious ghost thatâs targeted some of the townâs teenagers. Lark and Wren are uniquely capable of fighting ghosts because Wren is dead and Lark can talk to ghosts.WHAT I LIKED:âLarkâs personality. Sheâs abrasive, snarky, and speaks her mind. Understandably so, since most of the school sees her as a freak for talking to her dead sister and trying to commit suicide.âNan. It was great to see a supportive parent figure in a YA book. Nan is understanding, accepts Lark and Wren, and doesnât try to talk Lark out of fighting ghosts. I also liked that Lark fessed up to her grandmother, because she didnât want to keep secrets.âThe romance between Lark and Ben. Usually Iâm indifferent on romance, but I could get behind this one. It was great to have a boy who came out and said he liked Lark without being arrogant about it. I also liked that they crushed on each other a bit and didnât rush things.âThe concept. The idea behind SISTERS OF BLOOD AND SPIRIT is what made me want to read the book. Twin sisters, able to communicate and interact even though one is dead? Pretty cool.WHAT I DIDNâT LIKE:âA lot left unexplained. I see now that SISTERS OF BLOOD AND SPIRIT is the first in a new series, but I was still left with a lot of questions. What are the Shadow Lands? Why is Wren so powerful? Why does Wren stay with Lark? Why does Bent (the bookâs villain) want to form an army? Who is Emily? And so on.âToo many in the Scooby Gang. Most of the book is taken up with Lark and Wren helping their new friends hunt a ghost, but I couldnât tell some of those friends apart. Thereâs Mace, Sarah, Gage, Ben, Kevin, and Roxi. Some have more page time than others, and maybe theyâll have more development in future books, but in this book, some of them are just chess pieces.âLarkâs suicide attempt. The author mentions this a lot, as well as mentions that the ghosts at the psych ward wanted to recruit Wren. I feel like the reader needed to see this, rather than be told about it again and again.âThe ending is rushed. Lark and the others actually put some preparation and thought into defeating the bad ghost, but itâs over super fast. I expected more there, and hey, what happened to Bentâs razor?Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M77V74I4IUG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211481#wasThisHelpful","R2M77V74I4IUG9","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâve been using the Hefty Ultimate Flex trash bags for a while. I really like the Clean Burst scent -- itâs not too floral and isnât overpowering. Call me weird, but I like smelling it when I put in a new bag.My one previous gripe with the Hefty bags was that they stuck together like glue, and I was always worried Iâd make a hole when I was stretching the bag open. But Hefty has fixed that, because these bags open way more easily than they used to. It now takes seconds to put in a new one, rather than 5 minutes of fussing with the bag.The âGripperâ drawstring is nice and strong, and Iâve never broken one when tying closed or stretching around my kitchen wastebasket.

"Have you ever wondered what happened after the prince kissed Sleeping Beauty? Did they live Happily Ever After?A WICKED THING is the first in a new YA fantasy series that explores life after The Kiss. When Aurora is awakened by Prince Rodricâs kiss, sheâs thrust 102 years into the future. Her family is dead, the kingdom she knew is full of strife, and sheâs expected to marry Rodric even though she barely knows him.I really like the idea behind A WICKED THING. I think the book is a realistic exploration of what happens after Aurora wakes up. Aurora spends the first bit of the book confused and disoriented, unsure of what to do. Sheâs somewhat passive, which would usually bug me, but it made sense here. I like to think Iâd be all kick butt, but Iâd probably act exactly as Aurora did in this situation. I mean, what would you do if you were woken up by a strange prince, and then his family basically threatened you and made you marry him?But somewhere along the way, A WICKED THING became boring. I feel like the book was missing something, even though thereâs a lot in it. Thereâs cute rebel Tristan, shy and friendly Rodric, the enigmatic Finnegan, the wicked witch Celestine, etc. Thereâs a lot of storylines and a lot of possible love interests, but they donât really go anywhere. The majority of the book is Aurora debating between running and marrying Rodric. I didnât feel too connected to Aurora, likely because of the third-person point-of-view.When I finished A WICKED THING, I was left wanting more. I wanted more to happen by the end of the book, and I wanted an idea of where the series is heading. The beginning of A WICKED THING was better than the last half, but I probably would continue the series because I like the idea of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9WNER4V1LZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062303538#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9WNER4V1LZI","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I havenât read a Barry Lyga book before, but Iâd heard good things about them. AFTER THE RED RAIN has an interesting summary -- Iâm a sucker for post-apocalyptic books -- so I gave it a go.But after finishing, Iâm honestly not sure what I read.AFTER THE RED RAIN asks a lot of questions and introduces some cool ideas, but fails to follow through on answering those questions or developing those ideas. I donât know if this book is a standalone, but if it is -- Iâd recommend not reading if youâre the type of reader that likes a complete ending. Thereâs quite a bit left unresolved at the end, which left me disappointed.The setting of AFTER THE RED RAIN was my favorite thing about the book. Thereâs no explanation for *how* the world ended up in its current state, but the current state is well established. People live in Territories, go to work for their ration, and thatâs about it. Thereâs nothing to hope for, because although I saw Ludo Territory as a miserable place, with dangerous air and rain, food recreated from the DNA of extinct animals and plants, and citizens tracked through their brands, Deedra and the others donât know any better. They donât know anything about the past, so they think their world is good, and getting better. That aspect of the book was well done.But the rest of AFTER THE RED RAINâ¦ I got the impression this is a book written to be a movie. There are some chapter long fight scenes that I could see recreated in an action flick. Thereâs Deedra the orphan, surviving on her own and doing okay, but then falling in love with the mysterious Rose. Thereâs a corrupt government magistrate and a mad scientist. Thereâs a shocking revelation about âthe Red Rain.â Thereâs a scene where Deedra and Rose stare off into the scant sunlight and talk about making a difference.I wanted more character development for Deedra and Rose. I wanted to know where the heck Rose came from, and what his purpose was. And so on. I wanted answers! I also think AFTER THE RED RAIN was too long, limping along at a slow pace to the vague ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RTF34J4GSZRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316406031#wasThisHelpful","R1RTF34J4GSZRU","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâve read quite a few young adult and adult books, fiction and nonfiction, about life in religious cults, so EDEN WEST wasnât anything new for me. Before I started the book, I thought it would be a fresh take on the subject, especially as itâs written from the perspective of a boy, seventeen-year-old Jacob.But EDEN WEST was just an average book. Thereâs a lot of focus on themes and symbols, such as the wolf slaughtering the sheep. Thereâs a lot of the âcult mainstays,â such as polygamy for the powerful men, teenage wives, living off the land, seeing the outside world as evil, the End Days are coming and only the Grace will be saved, etc.In the book, Jacob encounters two outsiders who start him on the process of questioning his faith and himself. Lynna lives on the land next to Nodd, and Tobias is brought to Nodd with his mother and sister to be a convert. Jacob has lived in Nodd since he was five, so his reactions to knowledge of the outside world and questioning his beliefs are understandably childlike at times. But I was frustrated when, time and time again, Jacob would resolve to work harder, be more faithful, to ignore temptations.Now, I understand thatâs typical behavior in these types of situations. But it ties into my biggest peeve with EDEN WEST: not a lot happens.The book doesnât really dig into any of the issues it brings up. Jacob thinks about his life a lot, and by the end of the book, it seems like he may leave Nodd. But will he?SPOILER.And thatâs where the book ends. Iâm the type of reader that likes a firm conclusion, so the vague openness of EDEN WESTâs ending left me disappointed that I bothered to finish the book.If you havenât read other cult books before, you might enjoy EDEN WEST. But if you have, Iâm not sure youâll find anything new or extraordinary here. I didnât.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22T6DWP5LMHDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763674184#wasThisHelpful","R22T6DWP5LMHDO","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE WITCH OF STALINGRAD initially captured my interest because of the night witches. I canât believe I havenât heard of them before, because now Iâm fascinated! Once I dove into this book, I dove just as quickly into researching the night witches, and I was pleased to learn the author based many of her characters on real Soviet pilots.The book is told from the perspectives of two different women: Lilya Drachenko, Soviet pilot extraordinaire and night witch, and Alex Preston, American photojournalist and a former Russian. Throughout the course of THE WITCH OF STALINGRAD, both women question the beliefs theyâve grown up with as well as question what their futures could be. There is a lot of character growth in this book, which is something I enjoy.THE WITCH OF STALINGRAD is way more than just a wartime romance. At first, I didnât expect such depth and historical accuracy, but I was delighted to find it. This book is gritty, a realistic look at life in a warzone. Thereâs details on living under Stalin for the Russians, lots of piloting from night witch flying to fighter battles, and even time in a concentration camp. If you have any interest in the Soviet side of WWII, or the night witches, Iâd recommend this book for that alone.Lilya and Alex do become attracted to one another, but also spend a lot of the book apart, due to the war and their respective duties. Their relationship is sweet and realistic, with a few hints of explicitness that fit into the time period. Aside from Lilya and Alex, this book is full of strong women, female friendships, and women supporting each other. I like how the author put her own spin on âwomen canât do X or Y,â showing over and over again that yes, they can. And I loved when Alex went off on General Patton. Iâd quote, but I donât want to spoil it. Iâll just say itâs fantastic.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32B2DGHVFMHEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626393303#wasThisHelpful","R32B2DGHVFMHEA","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT is the first in a YA urban fantasy series. I was intrigued by the publisherâs comparison to Leigh Bardugoâs SHADOW AND BONE, which is one of my favorite YA fantasy series. However, THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT didnât remind me of SHADOW AND BONE at all, other than both books having a firebird.I liked the first half of THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT. Echoâs a fun character, full of snark and longing to belong to an alien world. When she was a kid, she ran away from an abusive home. The Ala found her in the New York Public Library and took her to the Nest. The Ala is the Seer of the Avicen, a race of feathered beings. Their mortal enemies are the Drakharin -- dragon people -- and theyâve been in a war thatâs gone on for centuries under humanityâs nose.But somewhere around the middle, THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT lost its shine for me. The book slowed down. I got bored, and even when things picked up again, I didnât really care. Iâm writing this review a few days after finishing, and I already canât remember a lot of the book. I had really high hopes for THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT, but it was just okay.WHAT I LIKED:--Whenever the characters hopped to a new place, the author described that place really well. Her writing is atmospheric, and I felt like I was in New York or Paris or Strasbourg. There were also lots of yummy food details.--The friendship that developed between Echo, Ivy, Caius, Dorian, and Jasper. I also liked the romantic relationship between Dorian and Jasper -- yay for diversity, and a romance that didnât feel like insta-love.--The *idea* of the Avicen and Drakharin. Bird people and dragon people? Very cool. The glimpses I got of their worlds were fascinating, leaving me wanting a lot more.WHAT I DIDNâT LIKE:--The author told me the Avicen and Drakharin are at war. But *why* have they fought each other for so long? The author didnât show me they hated each other, just told me again and again. So I didnât feel invested in Echoâs quest for the firebird.--Echoâs romantic entanglements. Thereâs somewhat of a love triangle here, complete with a leg of insta-love. I did appreciate that Echo usually realized when she was on a hormone high, because Iâve very rarely seen that. But I didnât see the attraction between Echo and Caius, and their moments felt forced for me.--Everything else. I donât know how to describe it, and Iâve been trying for days. But THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT justâ¦ fell flat. Usually I can write a review very quickly, but Iâve been struggling with this one for a few days, which is a sign. This book just wasnât memorable or outstanding for me.Overall, I was left wanting so much more from THE GIRL AT MIDNIGHT. I expected more fantasy, more about the Avicen and the Drakharin, more basis for Echo and Caius, more of everything.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7DV7F18DDN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574465X#wasThisHelpful","R1F7DV7F18DDN1","A2KBHSK5BS35BH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBHSK5BS35BH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Aaronâs work blew me away; it was thoughtful, honest, and considerate without being inaccessible. I was immediately impressed by his ability to craft language. Many of his poems address grief, loss, and other sometimes-nebulous concepts with a clarity and humility that illuminates the commonalities we all share. Very motivational and inspiring.

"There's too many bad reviews on these. Mostly from people who are doing it wrong. I find that applying a little butter with your finger around the inside works the best. This also makes cleaning effortless after. Forget spraying, that's hit and miss and you'd need to be liberal with the spray. Be sure the rings are clean and smooth to begin with. Set the buttered rings in a non-stick pan and medium heat both together. When the pan is hot enough, pour the eggs into ring. If you're doing scrambled eggs, use cream. I have not found any ""leaking"" issues in a perfectly flat pan surface. Note: I learned the hard way, spraying doesn't work. Once the rings are crusty with egg, it's next to impossible to clean off, but not impossible. The same with your plate and utensils. Stuck on egg is a pain to get off. I used a black ScotchBrite Extra Heavy Scour (non-scratch) pad I found at Target and gently scrubbed. Soaking doesn't work and only promotes rust. Pinch the handles together to remove from ring to wipe any little rust off. After wash, I dry them well. The perfect size for muffins.

"Nice looking trail âtrekingâ or walking shoe. Well constructed. The charcoal, black, and fuchsia combination is attractive without looking garish. I would not recommend them for for running due to the non-existent cushioning. Docking 2 stars because it appears the insoles were left out of my pair. Sometimes when activity shoes aren't exactly right, I replace the [normally] removable foam insoles with Spencos, but that's completely impossible with these.

"I bought mine directly from the Vans Store in town. Now on my 3rd pair (somehow lost one pair), which I bought again just in case Vans discontinues the KVD style. That's how much I love them. They're a ""lighter"" looking style and more feminine than the skateboard shoes Vans is known for. For casual canvas shoes, they fit just a bit loose, but they are slip-ons afterall. Classic, comfortable, very well made and durable which I can attest to, having owned several pairs now for three years.

It's really light, and seems to have good battery life.Finally, I think it would be a great first laptop for kids.I like the keyboard feel and the matte screen and though I prefer a mouse, the touchpad works really well.  I tried my normal level of internet use, and everything worked as expected.  No lag or hang ups.  A feature I really like is that the help section helps you to understand the limitations of the machine, for example - I looked to see if it was possible to download iTunes (it is not) and the Chromebook told me how I could listen to music on the machine.Overall, I think it's a great value for the money.

"When I picked this book for my book club I knew it was topical.  I knew we (as a nation) need to focus our attention on the racism in this country and one way to do that is to remind ourselves what we've already been through.  When I picked this book for my book club, the shooting in South Carolina hadn't happened.  And the Confederate flag was a mostly forgotten relic gently flapping its message of hate at a state capitol building, and sparking the fire of racism in some southern minds.  When I picked this book for my book club, Donald Trump hadn't yet announced his 2016 Presidential bid along with his racism.Let's turn to 1963.  On September 15, 1963 there was a bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama killing 4 young girls.  Children.  Addie, Denise, Carole and Cynthia - The Four Spirits.  The white author lived in Birmingham during this era and she promised herself that if she ever became a novelist, she would write about this time in history.  There are autobiographical elements.  It's not about Addie, Denise, Carole and Cynthia - it's about cross section of fictional characters, black and white, good and evil.  There are a lot of characters points of view and at times I thought too many, but the author set out to paint a picture of life in the time and life in that time can only be described through many visions.  It worked for me.This is a story of the most extreme bravery.  I have been the only white person in a room many times and never felt a qualm about it.  I remember one time I was on a local bus in Jamaica, it was PACKED and I was not only the only white person, but the only woman. I see a policeperson and generally feel safe (or that I'm going to get a ticket :( ), they see a policeperson and wonder if they are going to be killed.  Today.  In 2015.  It IS that black and white.  I applaud every person of color who ever tried to grab a burger at a Woolworth's lunch counter.  Who put themselves in that seat of rejection and were rejected.  I want to cry for them.  To hug them, and because I'm Italian, cook for them.After the bombing, one of the characters is digging through debris of the church, looking for survivors.  In his head echoes of MLK ...""I live a nightmare, I live a nightmare ... ""There's a quote in the book: ""In church, you have a right to be safe.  Surely?""  (Fast forward to 2015:  Not yet.)  ""No safe place.  She wept with shame.  <i>They</i> allowed no sanctity, no sacred place.  And she?  The force of hate left her mindless.  Helpless.  Bound to the shame of her own helplessness.  Raped again, made helpless.""In November, Kennedy is killed.  I've always thought of that day as the entire nation mourning.  Our beloved president shot.  I don't think of the past in the terms of the ""red and blue"" I think of the present.  But it was there.  Residents of the South celebrated because Kennedy was pro-integration and now he was gone.  ""The dusk air of the city was festive...... Everybody walked briskly.  They were exhilarated, these shoppers and commuters of Birmingham.""  One of the characters in the book works at a gas station.  He offers customers free confederate flag stickers in celebration.  (Fast forward to 2015:  Confederate flag patch on a jacket.)To talk about the characters and their circumstances is to recount the whole book.  Suffice it to say that there were heroes, and cowards.  There was great, gut wrenching sadness.  There were goosebumps.  There was so much fear.  Palpable fear.  There were the Four Spirits watching over the city.  There were martyrs.  Was there change?  True change?  We changed the laws, but did we change hearts and minds?This felt like a passion project for Jeter Naslund.  I'm a fan of her other works, but there is something about this book that just got me in the core.  Not sure it would impact everybody the same way, but it certainly did me.  Though a long book, it moved quickly and I was completely immersed in the reading of it.  I'm so glad I finally read this!  It's been sitting here for AGES.  But I know that the timing was right.  I know that because because less than a month ago 9 people were killed in a church.  And just a day before that an overt racist announced his bid for the White House.  AND HE'S NUMBER TWO IN THE REPUBLICAN POLLS. (Supporting Trump is a condoning racism.  No ambiguity.)  This is a nation with people who teach their children racism, as Roof's father clearly did.  We have to just say no.  We have to make it stop.  WE HAVE TO MAKE IT STOP.In Jeter Naslund's words we need ""a readiness to be kind, one to another; the courage to embrace people, without regard for color, for their essential HUMANNESS.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWGKTMRFJLT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006093669X#wasThisHelpful","RMWGKTMRFJLT4","A11K70GWSB7A5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11K70GWSB7A5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would love to give it 5 stars, but I am disappointed in the overall sound quality.Set up was simple and the headphones are easy to use.  There is great coverage - in a 2-story Townhouse and I can hear in any room...upstairs, downstairs (away from the transmitter) even outside on my patio, without losing any volume or tone quality.On use - I have to have the TV volume OFF when using the headset because there is a slight delay.  I have also used the Sennheiser RS120 and that's not an issue with that system.  It's fine when I'm watching TV by myself, but when others are in the room it's a bit annoying for me because of the delay.  The sound is adequate for voices, I was disappointed in the quality of the music transmission.  When you are listening under these conditions, if the music is full and intense, it adds to the drama of what you are watching...you are ""there""...and that's what I was missing...I wasn't ""there"".  I would have thought for the advertised price, it would sound more like the higher end headsets available from Bose, Sony, etc.  I will definitely continue to use it and be happy with it, but I will miss the experience that could have been ""there""!From a comfort perspective, it's more comfortable than the Sennheiser but from an overall experience perspective the Sennheiser wins.I have not tried to hook up any other devices so the amplifier other than the earbuds that came with the system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTCGA6XBMU70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT50VM#wasThisHelpful","R2LTCGA6XBMU70","A11K70GWSB7A5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11K70GWSB7A5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I knew this wasn't my kind of book, but I'm actually super annoyed by it. It was really just ""OK"" - The dialog was stiff, weird and unnatural most of the time, and I HATE being told how funny something or somebody is, when it's not at all funny. Also, the author said people ""Rappelled up"" a tree, and rappelling means to descend, so why didn't somebody catch that???  And no child has said ""Cool Beans"" for years.Auggie has a horrible facial deformity, and he's starting his first year of school. Children can be horrible, as we all know. But somehow Auggie has this fantastic personality (not seen in the book) and at this miraculous school he comes to be accepted by his whole grade. NEVER. HAPPENS. Really, this was a fairy tale. And I suppose if you had a facial deformity and you read this book it would make you hopeful, so from that aspect I suppose it succeeds. I don't know why I felt this needed to be realistic, because the reality of it was super depressing.I understand it's written for a younger audience, but are we doing our children any good by pretending that this could actually happen?  The book should have been about Summer's bravery in bucking the tide at the school and being the kinder person.  That would have been the better message for kids.Palacio felt bad for being a schmuck and this was her way to assuage her guilt.  The reality is, as sad as it is, many of us may have that kind of reaction.  But it's irresponsible to use this book as a way to teach a lesson.It was a blessedly fast read.SPOILERThe dog did not need to die. that was just stupid and unnecessary - a ploy to bring emotion to the story.END SPOILER","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34JLBQ6FNHGJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375869026#wasThisHelpful","R34JLBQ6FNHGJN","A11K70GWSB7A5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11K70GWSB7A5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found wetting the brush with warm water also helps.I have super plaquey teeth, and even though I brush thoroughly and floss every single day, going to the dentist for a cleaning is still uncomfortable.  My hygienist recommended this.  I read a lot of the reviews, and frankly they scared me.  People talking about how loud, and how much vibration there was.  It did not sound comfortable, so I waited.  Then my dad convinced me to give it a try.  It takes adjusting, and if you have a headache, it may amplify the headache, but after about 2 weeks you hardly notice anymore.  Just try to make it as comfortable in the beginning and you will adjust.My teeth feel cleaner and look better.  I think this was a good decision for me.

"I loved the Spellman Files, and I think Lutz could have had a lucrative career if she did nothing but those.  Obviously she realized she had more in her, and I'm glad she did for a lot of reasons.  (One of them being I don't continue on with series that long, and one of them being this book.)This is the story of the friendship of three women, told over 25 years.  It is completely non-linear.  Often times I find that when a book is told in this way, it's jarring for me when the timeline changes, but Lutz did this so well that I wasn't disappointed when we changed timelines, I was excited.  I couldn't wait to see ""when"" we were going next.This isn't a totally unique premise .... the girls meet, and their bond is forged and/or tested by an ""event.""  The success of this book hinges entirely on the storytelling and the characters!  Lutz is known for her humor, and it's more subdued in this book but it's definitely still there.  The personalities of these characters are great.  You can see a bit of the Spellman girls in these women, but they transcend those characteristics.  Honestly, I'm not sure if everybody is going to love the characters - but I did.I finished this in two sittings.  There was a suspenseful quality to be sure.Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E22ZXUMHOOKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544411633#wasThisHelpful","R3E22ZXUMHOOKM","A11K70GWSB7A5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11K70GWSB7A5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a lot to like about this monitor, great image quality, great colors, consistent backlighting, and the price. I love the sleek frameless design and the antiglare screen that you can view from almost any angle.Earlier this year I purchased a HD Samsung monitor that was priced slightly more than this HP and was shocked at the poor quality of the construction, it looked cheap, it wasnât level. The color was unnaturally vivid, the backlighting was uneven and there was bleed -through of the backlighting on the edges.  I couldnât return it fast enough.After that experience I was fully prepared to be underwhelmed with this HP. I hooked it up, turned it on and heard myself saying âoh wowâ.  The image and color was fabulous.  The monitor auto-adjusted and looked great without installing any software. It comes with a disk that includes a manual, driver and âMy Displayâ software. The My Display control panel will give you choices of presets for gaming, movies, photo editing or working on documents.  It will also allow you to partition the screen to allow independent control of each partition.On the stand it sits 15 1/4â high and is 19 3/4â wide. It canât be adjusted for height; it only tilts forward and backward for viewing angle.

The Hefty are a little wider and not as long as the ZipLoc and I do appreciate the wider opening on these.

"This case interested me because I liked the idea of being able to personalize the back with my own photos or artwork. It would have been nice if they included a template and I checked the manufacturer web site in case they made one available. But no template, they donât want to make it easy to use anything other than the inserts they offer for purchase.After getting the case and looking it over I realized that I wouldnât need the template because it is so ugly and cheap looking I didnât want to put it on my phone.  The rubber bumper was poorly molded and bits of extra material cling to the edges that frame the front glass of the phone.  The rubber material has a mottled matte/glossy finish that looks cheap. The back of the bumper is glossy black plastic that is very slippery in hand and will slide off a surface easily. The clear back is slightly indented so it will not make direct contact with the surface you place it on but It appears to be made of polystyrene and despite my case has never been in use it already is scratched. If you think your phone is just too nice looking and a âgrungeâ look is what you are after this might be the one for you.This case is a huge disappointment especially considering the exorbitant price and overall I think putting it on a beautiful iPhone just diminishes it. As a manufacturer I would be embarrassed to have my name on it.I read every positive review to try to understand what people liked about this case but I just donât get it and none swayed my opinion about it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1FBZW5NW725/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TD5W#wasThisHelpful","RU1FBZW5NW725","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall I was impressed with the amount of pet hair and dirt, even fine dirt this can pick up for a âbudget pricedâ robotic vacuum. The dust bin is very small and needs to be emptied frequently. There is a trash can icon that lights up on the vac as a reminder it needs to be emptied. It has two speeds; normal and turbo.  Turbo is very loud.If you want to set up unattended scheduled cleanings you will need to use the dock. It requires 40â of open space on the left of the dock, 12â on the right and 79â in front so you are limited in where you can set it up. The dock itself is very light weight and has two pieces; the dock and a mounting bracket. The bracket is secured to the wall with either the supplied double-stick foam tape or screws. My dock is on low pile carpet and there is enough friction I have been able to get away without mounting it to the wall. If you have an area that doesnât need any pre-vacuuming prep to remove obstacles the programed running times are convenient.I do like the feature that this vac can be charged with either the dock or by plugging the cord directly into the vac. That is convenient if you donât have a clear place to set up the dock or if you never do unattended vacuum cycles. When repeatedly pressing the power button to select running time the vac will instantly start after the last press.  The default is random pattern and with that setting it will just randomly switch between patterns until the time runs out. I did not find that to be as effective as choosing a single pattern to systematically go over the floor.I found the virtual wall generally performed well, the only time it failed was when the beam was interrupted by being too close to the folds of a bed skirt.It has some of the same issues all robot vacs do; inadequate edge and corner cleaning, problems with rug fringe and cords getting caught in the wheels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GN0N6E56Y5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C99PQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GN0N6E56Y5U","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice looking case that does provide great protection. I like the once-piece design with the soft silicone bezel and interior. It fits my iPhone 6s snugly but does noticeably add to the weight of the phone. The hard shell is slippery but the silicone bezel and buttons do provide a decent grip.The manufacturer claims the hard glossy case is scratch resistant but it isnât; not even slightly. Iâve had the case on my phone for 4 days and during that time either the phone was on a table/desk or by itself in a fabric lined pocket in my purse. Despite the tender treatment there are quite a few fine scratches on the case already. These cases are pricey and I did expect to get better wear from it. At full retail price I donât think it is a good value and wouldnât purchase another.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8R6KCMYM13E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EUR4BY#wasThisHelpful","R3V8R6KCMYM13E","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Esthetically this scale is beautiful, and honestly I love it just for that.  Its  14â x 14â x 1 1/4â high with a large easy to read digital display. It is accurate and seems to be very well made.  If you want to use the app they have two My Vitals apps for the iPhone. The My Vitals 2.0 is 64 MB vs. 94 MB for the original app. You donât have that choice for the iPad the 94 MB version is the only one available. Both versions are designed to work with other iHealth Bluetooth devices like the blood pressure and activity monitor.  You can also enter data manually for blood pressure and pulse/ oximeter but not the activity monitor.Fortunately you donât need to bring your phone with you for every weigh in; it will remember up to 200 weight measurements that can be downloaded next time the scale is connected to the iPhone/iPad. The Bluetooth will not activate when you step on the scale if the paired device is not in range, saving battery life. Reconnecting takes just a few seconds.You donât need to use the app at all if you donât want to create a weight record. But if you donât have the app installed you will not receive notices if the scale has a software update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ELN2ZA9396T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF7DB1U#wasThisHelpful","R34ELN2ZA9396T","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It looks like they had entertaining in mind when they designed this model with a sleek glossy black body with and chrome details. I love the hinged lid feature; no longer do I have to wonder where I will set down a hot, wet lid and it is so nice for buffets when serving foods that tend to dry out on top if kept uncovered. The stoneware is oven safe so I can bake something in the oven if that would give better results than slow cooking and use the crock pot to keep it warm for serving.The glass lid is very tough. I accidentally dropped it from about 8â above the stoneware, and it hit hard! I thought for sure it was totaled before I ever had a chance to cook with it. But there was not a chip or crack in either the lid or stoneware.When set to low temperature it is hot enough to cook at a brisk simmer.

"I have a 2005 Weber Performer and purchased the Weber model 9911 cover in 2008. It was very expensive but it lasted 8 years. I replaced it last year with the Weber model 7455; also not inexpensive and I was disappointed that for the price it was so thin and flimsy feeling. I knew immediately the cover was not going to last; a year later it is brittle and cracking. Both of the Weber covers would get lifted off in strong winds and condensation would form under the cover.I could tell immediately that this Ravenna is much higher quality than the Weber 7455. It is made from heavyweight polyester fabric with a water resistant layer laminated to the inside and double stitched seams. I love the details like the vent for better air circulation and the quick and easy to use hem straps.  It fits my 2005 Performer just fine and covers to the top of the casters.I think this is the best value in a grill cover. Great color too, not so light it will show every bit of dirt and grime and a pleasing neutral brown that blends in and doesn't call too much attention to it.I like this so much I'm planning on purchasing a patio table cover from the same line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5KZ27EXBG3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MTYWAM#wasThisHelpful","R2H5KZ27EXBG3T","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using an Omron 10 series upper arm cuff and an Omron Series 7 BP652 wrist monitor before receiving this BP654. Like the BP652 This 7 Series Plus BP654 reads slightly lower than the upper arm cuff; particularly the diastolic measurement. But I love how easy the wrist BP monitor is to use so I am more likely to take the time to read my blood pressure than with the upper arm cuff. The 654 has added the feature of using with an app to record readings. It isn't necessary to use the app; the monitor will store up to 100 readings and also can give you an average reading from the last 3 readings taken within 10 minutes.  It is also very quiet; it doesn't make a sound as it inflates. And it is compact, the hard plastic storage case is, just 3"" x 4"" x 1-3/4"" so it is easy to keep handy in comparison to an upper arm cuff monitor.Overall I like this wrist monitor very much, it is quick and easy to take a reading and so much more comfortable than an upper arm cuff monitor.

"This is a nice solidly built cradle. The suction pad is a large 2 3/4"" and is slightly tacky. It has a screw collar to tighten the suction cup to the windshield or dash that I find easier to use than a lever attachment. I attached it to my slightly textured dash and despite the lack of a completely smooth surface it is holding strong. You can turn the cradle to hold your phone in the landscape or portrait position.The arm grips are well padded and hold my phone very securely without concern about scratching or damage and I like that they included the fold down supports for the bottom of the phone for an extra security. They don't block the charging port so I can keep my phone plugged in while in the mount. The arm grips release with a push of a button so it takes a second to release the phone and go.This model has a short stem for use in smaller vehicles where the dash and windshield are closer to the driver.

"I had a Thermos King Travel Tumbler and it worked great. It kept my coffee hot all morning but the cap mechanism was a pain to disassemble/ reassemble for cleaning and the gasket eventually gave out after a year and I tossed the tumbler with no interest in buying another one.Thermos Stainless Steel King 16-Ounce Travel Tumbler, Midnight Blue.I bought a two pack of Contigo auto seal travel mugs to replace the Thermos.Contigo Autoseal Travel Mug - Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler - 2 Pack (Blue/Green) They are very easy to clean and I liked the auto seal feature that keeps the mug sealed at all times unless you press a button to sip. But they are not insulated very well and my coffee would already be tepid after 2 to 3 hours. They are so poorly insulated the exterior of the mug would get very warm. So off to the thrift store with those.I decided to give this Stanley a try. It is very easy to disassemble/reassemble for cleaning and has the same type of auto lock feature I liked about the Contigo.  I always preheat thermal containers with boiling water for at least 5 minutes before filling with coffee about 7am. With the Stanley my coffee is still hot at noon after sipping on it all morning, performing just as well as the Thermos brand mug.The only disappointment I have with this mug is the finish. The product page picture gives the impression it will be of the classic green hammertone finish that has been on Stanley containers for years. But its not.  It is a much less interesting glossy olive drab paint with a textured finish.

"In comparison to wood or plastic raised bed gardens that have a more utilitarian appearance this garden bed is attractive enough to use in the front of the house for flower beds. The almond sides and brown corner posts match almost exactly the almond stucco and brown painted trim on my house.It assembles quickly and not counting site preparation I was ready to add soil and start planting in about 20 minutes.All surfaces except the corner post cap are finished with matte painted metal. The corner post caps are plastic and do benefit by a periodic wipe of a vinyl protectant like you would use for a car.Mine arrived without some push-in fasteners. I emailed the customer service address included with the instructions and I received the parts in about a week. When they arrived I was disappointed to see that the fasteners are plastic and I wonder how well they will hold up year after year. At least that is not the only thing holding the bed together, the side panels attach to the corner posts with a screw-head and keyhole fastener and should be strong enough on its own. The plastic fasteners are installed on the interior corners of the bed and I did need to use a mallet to fully seat a couple of them.Overall I am very pleased with the Spacemaker Raised Garden Bed. its a nice addition to my garden and I think it is a good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUXMQYZ98RYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKPBNGU#wasThisHelpful","R1KUXMQYZ98RYH","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this to replace an older Panasonic phone system that could only block 30 numbers.  In addition to the ability to block 250 numbers they have added a dedicated call block button on each handset to easily block an incoming call. You can also block numbers from the caller ID list by ""Select"" ""Save"" and ""Call Block"". You can choose if you want the phone to ring once for a blocked call or not at all. I like it to ring once because I take great pleasure in knowing a telemarketer has just been disconnected. You can also manually program in blocked numbers.Just a few of the other great features:You can link two cell phones or a headset and one phone. You also have the ability to program which extensions will ring when a cell call comes in.You can use the landline and a linked cell phone simultaneously effectively creating a 2 line phone service.If you don't want your sleep disturbed you can program a silent mode for certain hours of the day and you can choose to silence all or let some contacts ring through.The only down side to this phone is the ring-tones; they are awful and seem like they are carryovers from the early 90's electronic ring tones. I have an older AT&T phone set that has much better choices for tones and the ability to customize individual tones for contacts but it can't block numbers. So I have both phones set up and I keep the ringer volume on the Panasonic low. There are no conflicts between phone systems and I get the best of both worlds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G5G5JQM1JJN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5ZJYGK#wasThisHelpful","R2G5G5JQM1JJN0","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was intrigued by the idea of a metallic cable; reading the description of the cable and taking in consideration the price I expected the cable would be covered in a metallic braided wire and thought that would be a cool looking and durable cable.But apparently the metallic part of the description refers just to the satin finish aluminum connectors.  The cable is covered in a grey braided cloth that reminds me of the vintage cloth covered power cords.

"I love how quiet this Aera Baby Max purifier is and it is compact so it fits easily into smaller rooms. The controls are intuitive and I appreciate the ability to dim the display. Although the controls can be locked to prevent children from playing with them and changing the settings it isn't represented as a ""child proof"" air purifier.When set on Auto the purifier will run on the lowest speed until it detects a decrease in air quality and will step up the fan speed as needed.

"It was difficult to decide how to rate this Wi-Fi extender because it is a nice device with great features but ultimately not something I wanted to continue using.I like the design of this extender with the adjustable antenna, dual band, and Ethernet port for connecting devices that don't have wireless capabilities. The pass-through plug outlet is a nice touch so you don't even need to give up a plug slot. They did place the extenders plug very close to the top edge so it doesn't block use of the other outlet.  I had the best signals when I could use it in an outlet that was not near the floor on a baseboard.Set up was not difficult and can be done on your phone, tablet, or PC. I love the feature that lets you know if you have selected the best location. Why waste your time setting up only to find the extender isn't getting a good signal.I have an old brick and stucco house with lath & plaster interior walls that do an effective job of reducing my routers signal strength, especially in my kitchen. Just to see how well the extender could receive a signal far from the router I set this up in several areas in my house including the basement laundry room in an outlet on the cement foundation with a washer, dryer and upright freezer between the extender and router one flight up and across the house. It had no complaints about the signal and I was able to connect no problem.I decided not to use the Linksys extender at all because it reduced the overall speed of my connection in the places I already received a great signal from my router. I would rather have the reduced signal in the kitchen than give up the signal strength and speed I get in other areas. That isn't a problem just for this Linksys but Wi-Fi extenders in general. I think it may be the most useful for those who have a severe problem with dead spots or if you need the Ethernet connection feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYYVIM9ZLQU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20YA#wasThisHelpful","R1YYYVIM9ZLQU6","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using the Personal Cloud to store files and photographs I want to access from other devices and locations and as a backup for individual files and folders.Set up was quick and easy. It comes with a 4 foot Ethernet cable and a 68"" power cord. My computer recognized the drive right away. A very minimal Quick Start guide is included but full user manuals for the Personal Cloud and using Seagate Access are available at the Seagate website. After registering with an email and password for the account I installed the S drive software on a Windows desktop and laptop; and the Seagate Media app on my iPad and iPhone.You can select to view files by type or show all and you can choose between thumbnails or list. Actual thumbnails are only available with photos so in thumbnail view with other files you will see a generic icon for document of video. There is a search function so you can also search for files by name.If you choose to invite other users to have access to your Personal Cloud, they will have to download the Sdrive and/or Media app and register an email address and password with Seagate. Everything put in the Public folder can be viewed by everyone you have invited to have access to the drive. There is a private folder but it is only available to the owner when accessing the Personal Cloud with the Sdrive not the Media app.I was quite happy with the Cloud until I realized some files and folders were not showing up when using the Media app. I found the files and folders were in the public folder when I used the Sdrive on my laptop to check if I had missed adding them.I poked around in the Seagate forum to look for a solution and tried disabling and enabling the Media app access and then re-indexing.  I usually hate the process of looking in forums for answers but Seagate has theirs set up so I was able to find what I needed relatively painlessly.  The indexing is supposed to take a ""few minutes"" but over an hour later my iPad and iPhone were still indexing. And that was for a relatively small amount, just 11.4 Gigabytes. But it worked like a charm and everything is visible on the Media app now. So if you try this just be patient, it will look like it isn't progressing, but it is and eventually will finish.The Personal Cloud is very quiet, much more than other NAS I have used. I also like that Seagate went beyond the plain rectangular box and added aesthetics like ventilation grills of elongated triangles, the slight cutaway on the bottom edge and the subtle Seagate Logo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0AA7G3PI00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZZZN84#wasThisHelpful","RD0AA7G3PI00","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A ceramic knife can't replace a traditional stainless or carbon steel knife because of it fragility. You can't use any force to cut through hard food like winter squash without risking snapping the blade.What a ceramic knife does excel at with its very sharp, thin and smooth blade is precise cutting like paper thin slices, fine julienne or tiny dicing like brunoise.  It is a great addition to your kitchen tools and will last a long time as long as you are careful about using, cleaning and storing it.This T-fal is quite sharp and performs very well at the tasks it is suited for. I have mixed feelings about the bolster feature that keeps the blade raised off the counter about 1/2"". It does keep what is on the knife off your counter and cutting board and that is nice, but it also makes it easier to bump into the knife and either knock it off the counter or cut yourself.  I have to be more careful where I set the knife down and make sure the sharp edge of the blade is facing away from me. The large bolster also prevents a traditional ""pinch grip"" on the knife where your thumb and forefinger grip the blade for more vertical stability but on a knife of this size and limited function it isn't as critical as when using a traditional 8"" or 10"" chef's knife.This T-fal knife is a nice price point because it is inevitable that eventually something will happen to chip or break a ceramic knife no matter how much you pay for it.  I like that for the price they include a sheath because it is a must-have unless you can keep the knife in a block.In the Care and Use instructions it states ""Never re-sharpen"".  Some manufactures like Kyrocera will let you send in your knife for sharpening or they offer a small battery operated sharpener designed for their knives. But don't expect if you pay twice the price for a ceramic knife like the Kyrocera it will be any less fragile. I worked in a kitchenware store that sold Kyrocera knives and heard plenty of complaints about fragility. I prefer not to worry about sharpening a ceramic knife; just take good care of it and replace when needed so something like this T-fal is perfect.You must use a softer cutting surface like wood or plastic but you should be doing that anyway for your steel knives to help keep the edge longer.The T-fal is dishwasher safe but that is risky unless you make sure the knife won't come in contact with anything else during the cycle. It is best to hand wash and put away any knife as soon as you're done using it.This review is of the T-fal 6"" Chefs Knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R142EKDET2JLLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7UOTU0#wasThisHelpful","R142EKDET2JLLB","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When comparing this Apple certified Mediabridge cable with Apple's  OEM cable the Apple cable seems so thin and delicate. And I never did like Apple's tiny high gloss connector mold that was always hard to get a grip on when unplugging from my devices. I have been using Belkin cables as a replacement when I had an opportunity to try this 6ft Mediabridge cable.The Mediabridge cable is very well made and I appreciate they manufacture them with a thicker gauge wire for faster charging. The connector ends are longer and easy to grip but still thin enough I have no problems using them with my cases.

The lenses are distortion free, nothing is more annoying than bad lenses that blur vision and give you a headache.

"I love spicy oriental scents and anything with musk, patchouli and sandalwood gets my attention. Once I smelled this it was instantly familiar as many men must use this as their signature scent.Most likely because I don't like the scent of lavender and myrrh those mid-level scents stand out to me in this cologne; though as you wear it more of the musk, patchouli and sandalwood notes come out.For an eau de toilette this is still a very intense scent and should be used with restraint or it can easily become overpowering. I prefer a level of cologne where you just get an intriguing whiff and you want to get closer to smell more of it.

"Whats not to love about this classic assortment? If you're wondering this big bag had about 224 bars.I'm confused on the pricing of this 66.7 oz bag though.

"I was blown away by the sound quality of these headphones; clear rich mid and high tones and good bass. I love the comfort of the smaller size and neck band; for me they are much more comfortable to wear than a full over the ear type. I always have problems with full size headphones, they are uncomfortable with even small earrings and the headband always slips when I'm moving around.The Cadence sits just above the bottom of my earlobe so they don't cause problems with earrings. They also don't interfere with putting on and removing my reading or sunglasses. I don't even notice the neckband when I'm wearing these and I had no problem with the headphones sliding off my ears when working out, gardening or doing housework.  The headphones also do a good job keeping the sound contained so you can use these at a moderate level around others without disturbing them.The multifunction button used to power on/off /pair and answer/hang up calls can also be used to access Siri on the iPhone if you press it once when no call is coming in.  When a call is coming in the music cuts off just before the phone starts ringing and there is a voice Caller ID that will announce the number or contact. The voice quality is good on both ends.Also included is a nice 4 1/2"" X 5 1/2"" x 1 3/4"" firm shell case with two interior mesh pockets to hold the headphones and charging cable. I also like the simple cardboard packaging with a slipcover that Mediabridge uses for their products. You can open it without worrying about taking off a finger.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is the bright blue led light on the right earpiece that blinks three times every few seconds when they are connected to a Bluetooth device. It makes me self-conscious using around others because the light calls attention to the headphones and is a distraction.These headphones were sent to me at no cost for the purpose of an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILEHYDT6DICO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS1KKLM#wasThisHelpful","R1ILEHYDT6DICO","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Pairing was easy enough and after the initial pairing it will re-connect the your device automatically.As well designed as the speaker is the layout of the instructions are not. There are about 26 languages included and instead of including all of the instructions for a particular language together the instructions are split into 5 sections and you have to hunt for your language in each section.

"This case provides great protection and utility in a nice looking package. It is a great choice for anyone who wants the convenience of a traditional keyboard but especially for those who want to carry their iPad for school or work. The closed case is only 5/8"" thick; one side is satin finish aluminum that holds the keyboard. The other side is a sturdy plastic frame with a large rubberized plastic panel and hinge. The iPad snaps into that side and is held securely but is easy to remove and replace. The rubberized panel provides a good grip when holding the closed case. This case will add about 15 oz. to the weight of the iPad.There are three magnetic areas behind the keyboard that lock the iPad frame into one of 3 viewing angles. These slots double as on/off switches for the keyboard. Once you pair the keyboard with your iPad it will automatically connect in seconds when you place the cover in one of the slots and disconnect when removed.They have made some small changes from the original Ultimate Keyboard Case. Instead of one center magnet holding the iPad upright on the keyboard there is a magnet on each side so the iPad is held even more securely in the desired position.  They have added two tiny bump out feet to the aluminum bottom of the case so between those and the silicone edging around the hinge the aluminum sits slightly above the table surface protecting the aluminum from scratching.The back of the iPad is completely enclosed and protected while allowing full access to all controls, ports and cameras. The case also has wake/sleep magnets. Unfortunately there is no portrait orientation for this case.The full qwerty keyboard is small but has a good feel and is easy to use. There are shortcut keys for cut, copy, paste and search. Also keyboard volume, play/pause forward and reverse. There is a home screen key and a microphone key that will bring up Siri. One charge will last about 2 months even with daily use. I set up a reoccurring reminder to charge the case so it doesn't run out of power at an inopportune time.I like the convenience of a keyboard and think this case is the best available.

"The upper reservoir holds about 4 cups of water so to max fill you need to wait for the first 4 cups to clear and add the second 4 cups and wait a little longer to add the last two cups. The reason that's important is because of the tyranny of the filter change indictor. The indicator works by sensing when the reservoir lid has been opened longer than 10 seconds. To be accurate you need to fill the pitcher at one time and use it completely before filling again. When you close the lid after filling one of the 3 lights will blink indicating good, change soon or change. I tried to beat it by sneaking in a quick top-off under 10 seconds but it blinked anyway ticking off another complete fill.The instructions state that ""the indicator contains a sealed battery. After several years of use, the indicator will stop working, but the pitcher is still functional"".  With that I would prefer to not have the indicator light at all and just keep track of filter changes with a calendar and top off the water whenever I darn well please.For years I have been using one of Brita's Slim pitchersBrita Slim Water Filter Pitcher, 5 Cup; the capacity is only 5 cups so I am constantly filling it. I thought it would be great to have a larger capacity pitcher but I find this Grand pitcher cumbersome and when filled with 10 cups of water it weighs 7 1/2 pounds.  The Slim doesn't take up so much counter or refrigerator real estate.Things I like about this pitcher.The front of the handle has a grippy silicone facing that provides a secure grip.The new filter design does significantly reduce the amount of carbon particles that usually would accumulate in the reservoir with the original filter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36COIBN4I39GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEYJ088#wasThisHelpful","R36COIBN4I39GE","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was most interested in the UV Protection claim on these pouches and devised a short term test. I printed out three of the same photo and laminated one with a 3 mil Fellows Image Last, one with 3mil Scotch laminating pouches Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches 8.9 x 11.4 Inches 3 mil, 200-Pack (TP3854-200) and left one sheet as control without any lamination.  I taped all three sheets in a south facing window for two weeks. Comparing the sheets there was slight but noticeable color fading in both the control and the Scotch although the Scotch did fair better than the control. I could not detect any noticeable fading of the Image Last laminated photo.I did notice some other differences between the Fellows and the Scotch. Despite both pouches were 3mil the Scotch feel slightly thicker than the Fellows and an after laminating the Scotch felt stiffer and less flexible than the Fellows.  The clear laminated edges around the Fellows sheet are much clearer and sealed tight right up to the edge of the laminated photo and the edges of the pouch. The Scotch edges are cloudier and more prone to slight sealing gaps around the edges of the laminated sheet and air bubbles around the edges of the laminated pouch.When I wrote this if purchasing the 200 sheet packages the Scotch pouches will cost about 15 cents a sheet versus the Fellows at 19 cents. If your laminating projects would benefit by the UV protection and nicer looking edges the Fellows are well worth the extra few cents. If these things are not critical and you like the idea of a stiffer end result and saving a few cents each sheet the Scotch will do a serviceable job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPB7Z4JLNSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAPL1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3MPB7Z4JLNSX","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For years I have been using a Casabella squeegee Casabella 44037 Clip on Silicone Squeegee, White to dry off the ceramic tile in my shower and always thought it worked well in addition to being nice looking.The OXO squeegee has a very thin silicone blade similar to a windshield wiper that does a much better job removing water and even getting into the grout lines that the Casabella with its thicker more rigid blade would just skim over. The OXO also is lighter and the thinner handle is much more comfortable to hold.The soft silicone swivel hook is a great design that allows you to hang it from the shower pipe or a towel bar. The interior of the hook is about 1"" in diameter and made of flexible silicone so it can expand to slide over the pipe and won't scratch metal surfaces.  It is a big improvement over previous OXO squeegees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCSC8KGSOIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNAYWUE#wasThisHelpful","ROCSC8KGSOIL","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This twine holder has the one feature I have been looking for; I can pull and cut the twine with one hand. So when I am tying up a roast or trussing poultry I don't have to worry about contaminating the twine or even touching the holder.

"The grill has a 6 1/2"" x 9 1/4"" cooking surface and would be tight fit for 4 servings of something over 3 to 4 ounces each.  Not including the 2 prong plug the power cord is 24"" long and there is a cord wrap on the bottom. It has a floating hinge to adjust to the thickness of food and it does indeed heat up in 4 minutes. Instructions are minimal; safety instructions and a suggested cooking time chart for burgers, chicken breast, steak and salmon.The elements will cycle off when the plates are about 400° then cool to about 300Â° before cycling on again. The difference between the center temperature where the element is and the outer two inches around the edges is about 20Â°, not bad.  A sear temperature would be about 450Â°, because this cooks at a lower temperature and drops 100Â° before heating again the best results would be with thicker cuts that have a chance to get nicely browned before overcooking.To check out its versatility I planned a bacon cheeseburger panini. It did a very nice job with thick-cut bacon. The top plate was not able to make full contact but  still was able to keep the bacon flat while cooking and it turned out evenly crisp and brown in 5 minutes. I liked the results much better than pan fried bacon.  I made two 3 oz. beef burgers and they were done in about 5 minutes. Because they were small the burgers did not get a deep brown sear before they were done but they were browned with grill marks.  I unplugged the grill and wiped the plates with paper towels to have a clean surface for grilling the sandwiches before plugging it in again. My sandwiches were thick and I had an issue with them sliding while setting the top down and not setting flat. I ended up carefully lifting the hinge end with the handle of a spatula to level the top before setting it on the sandwiches.There are five 1/4"" high stops cast into the bottom plate so food like sausages won't roll off the grill. The plates are easy to remove and are dishwasher safe but to extend the life of the nonstick surface you would want to only hand wash the plates. The back of the plates are aluminum which reacts poorly to automatic dishwasher detergent so that is another good reason the hand wash the plates. The non-stick surface works very well and the clean-up from cooking bacon and burgers was easy.Things I don't like about this grill.The rear feet are hard slippery plastic and will slide around quite readily. The front ""feet"" are tiny silicone buttons so they provide a slight grip. On the unit I received one of my buttons was missing.The drip tray is shallow at 1/2"" and does not lock or snap into place. It rests on the counter and the back edge is tabbed to fit into a recess at the bottom of the grill. It will keep it from moving from side to side but is very easy to pull away from the grill so it could be a hazard if snagged with a hot pad or spatula and pulled out with hot grease in it. Because the grill slides around easily just opening the lid can move the grill away from the drip tray.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KHMHME81G0TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXP2#wasThisHelpful","R2KHMHME81G0TH","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is similar to the GoalZero Nomad system except the NOCO uses lithium ion battery packs instead of AA NiMh rechargeable batteries and the Nomad is a 7W panel vs. the NOCO at 9W.This NOCO package includes a combination flashlight/11Wh battery pack, one solar panel, a 5V Flex USB regulator, a USB to Micro USB cord to charge the flashlight/battery. The size of this battery pack is really only practical for charging items like a cell phone twice, an action camera or GPS three times. For more charges or for a tablet you would want one of their larger battery packs like the XGB6 NOCO XGrid XGB6 22Wh Rugged USB Battery Pack or XGB12 NOCO XGrid XGB12 44Wh Rugged USB Battery Pack. The battery packs can be charged from an outlet or the solar panel.The flashlight is a nice compact size with a rubberized case and is bright with 4 modes; 100%, 50%, 10% and Strobe. It does not have a power remaining indicator like the larger battery packs do. The hinged bottom cover over the ports does not close securely and detracts from an otherwise well designed device. Under ideal conditions with full sun the flashlight battery pack will charge in about 4.5 hours. If it is partly cloudy it can take significantly longer. You can also directly connect your device to the solar panel for charging.The system is flexible; you can string solar panels together to increase the charging power or purchase 12V NOCO GC027 12V 2A Flex Regulator or 6V NOCO XGrid FLEX6V 6V 2A Flex Regulator Regulators for charging auto batteries. The solar panel is sturdy and can be hung across a backpack. It includes mesh pockets on both sides for holding the accessories and could also be used to hold the device you are charging while hiking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FB3ZB5O9KME3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXE4#wasThisHelpful","R3FB3ZB5O9KME3","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The labels come two to a 4 x 6 sheet with a separate sheet of clear adhesive ""laminate"".  There is no downloadable template for these labels; the only printing option available is through their Design and Print Online at Avery.com. Through Design and Print there are many options for customizing the label including backgrounds, images, frames and fonts. The final design opens as a pdf for printing and you can save the pdf for future printing if desired.I went through the process and designed a label and did some test prints. The problem I ran into was getting my printer to accept the sheet straight. I tried and failed 4 times and was never able to print out a perfect set of labels. There was one I could trim and apply to the intended container and then the task of getting the very thin laminate sheet on straight without any ripples or bubbles. Fail. Two bubbles and one small ripple at the edge.  It is a nice idea but expensive, troublesome and the thin laminate doesn't look very professional.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDMCPZNXYB2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFMMVBU#wasThisHelpful","R1MDMCPZNXYB2Z","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yamaha YAS-93  This review is for the basic model without Bluetooth or wireless subwoofer.This is a good option for someone just looking to improve sound quality over the built-in TV speakers in a small to medium sized room at a reasonable price.The sound is clear and distortion free but will not provide a real projecting surround sound or thumping subwoofer experience. Increasing the subwoofer volume is just increasing the bass.The Clear Voice feature works very well. My husband uses hearing aids and understanding dialog over the soundtrack has always been a frustrating issue for him. Using Clear Voice does make understanding dialog much easier.The IR remote signal repeater feature also works very well. The sound bar sits at the base of our TV and does block the remote signal but the repeater function has worked flawlessly.Set up is very easy with the included optical cable to the TV.

"If you own any of the ATK cookbooks you already know that it will have extensively tested recipes, equipment reviews and recommendations, kitchen tips and discoveries and lots of helpful photos.The make-ahead cookbook is no exception and I was happy to see the wide variety of recipes and preparation methods included.There are family friendly meals, meals that would be great for entertaining and many recipes with ethnic flavors including Mexican, Asian, Italian and Indian. There are lots of  great tips and techniques that can also be used to adapt and improve other favorite recipes.

Although one of the chapters;Shop Smart-One Grocery Bag Makes Three Dinners, focuses on planning and shopping for three meals. None of the meals are make-ahead but each take 1 hour or less to prep and cook. 8 three-meal menus are provided in that chapter. One of the menus that happens to be vegetarian is Baked Quinoa with Roasted Kale and Chickpeas, Gemeli with Caramelized Onions,Kale and Mushrooms and Grilled Portobello BurgersPrep ahead: Ready to Cook Meals.

"What I like most about this set is the size and shape.  There is not much of anything available for food in the 7qt range that isn't a bowl.The main container is 8 1/2"" x 13"" x 3 3/4"" deep and is great for big batches of food like salads as well as bars, cookies, cake and cupcakes.  The included trays I expect to use less frequently but they are a nice addition that increases the versatility of the set. The container and trays are made of sturdy plastic. The lid can be also be used as a serving tray; turned over it has a 8 1/2"" x 13"" x 3/4"" deep depression.The weak link in this set is the lid. I am used to food storage containers having airtight seals that ""snap"" closed. This lid has a friction fit that does not feel secure and is not airtight so any food stored more than 24 hours would need to have a layer of plastic wrap under the lid to keep the moisture in.  If the lid were to get bent or warped in any way there is not enough friction in the fit to be able to keep it on.  So for the lid only I recommend hand washing and storing on the container.I keep some large rubber bands around the house to secure food containers when transporting just to make sure the lid stays put. With this container unless it was to be transported very carefully some sort of band would be a must, preferably one on each end.  If this had been designed with an airtight lid and wrap-around band/handle strap it would be five stars.The rest of the pieces are dishwasher, microwave and freezer safe. Technically the lid is dishwasher and microwave safe but I wouldn't put it in the microwave or dishwasher. If using the container in the freezer it would need to be short-term because without an airtight seal the food would get ice crystals and degrade quickly.Because it is plastic it has the usual caveats about microwaving. Foods high in oil, fat or sugar can cause pitting or staining in the case of tomato based foods.Despite the issues with the lid I'm happy with the set because I have a lot of use for a container this size and shape.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZRLF52P77FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PRHHRE#wasThisHelpful","R1FZRLF52P77FT","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These brownies bake up moist, fudgy and chewy with great chocolate flavor. They taste like homemade because they use the same ingredients a home baker would; sugar, unbleached wheat flour, semisweet chocolate chips, organic cocoa powder, corn starch, salt and natural vanilla flavor. There is a generous amount of  mini chocolate chips in the mix that contain only unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter and vanilla extract.In comparison the major brands can contain bleached flour, corn syrup, vegetable oil and artificial flavor. If they contain chocolate chips often they are made with lecithin, palm oils and artificial flavor.All you need to make the brownies in addition to the mix is 1/2 cup of melted butter and two eggs. I baked them in an 8"" x 8"" pan and they were 3/4"" thick. I especially love the chewy texture and I think these would also be great baked in an 11"" x 7"" pan and used to make ice cream sandwiches.I am very impressed with these brownies and would definitely buy this mix.

"I'm comparing this with Intermatic DT620 astronomic timers Intermatic DT620CL 15 Amp Indoor Astronomic Digital Timer that I have been using for years.  I wouldn't want to do without the convenience of a timer that can adjust for the changing dawn and dusk times and DST. No more moving furniture twice or more a year to manually adjust the timing. Once you go astonomic you will never go back.What I like about this model DT121K is that it's more compact; 3 1/4""H x 2 1/2"" W x 1 7/8"" D  vs the DT620 at 3 1/4"" H x 3 1/8"" W x 2 1/4"" D (not including plug). The DT121K is also much easier to set up and program; I had it done in just a few minutes, less than half the time it takes me to set up and program the DT620. This model can be used with LED and CFL bulbs unlik ethe DT620.The two plugs are not controlled independently but come in handy if one plug is blocked by something else or if using for two table lamps on either side of a couch.This DT121K is being used with table lamp that comes on at dusk and off at a set time. I use one DT620  for a night light in the hall that comes on at dusk and off at dawn. In the winter I use one for a heated mattress pad that comes on the same time every night but off at different times for weekday/weekend.Before you program the timer for the first time or if it hasn't been used for a long time you need to plug it into an outlet for 30 minutes to charge the lithium battery.  You can adjust the current dawn/ dusk times. I found the default setting for my time zone was different than my location in the time zone. Another reason to adjust the dusk time would be if you wanted a light to come on just before dusk. Once you have set the time it will automatically adjust it a few minutes each day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4YT1HKAX9E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBHBH6C#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4YT1HKAX9E6","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It wasn't apparent until we installed it that the front cover assembly had been damaged. I have a Friedrich Chill and love it so I did not want to give up on the Kuhl. I called the Friedrich customer service number included with the unit and explained the problem. A few minutes later the part had been ordered for me and I received it in 5 days with installation instructions.The Kuhl is substantially quieter than the GE AEL08LQ 8000 BTU it replaced.  It's actually possible to have a conversation in the same room with it unlike the GE. With most window air conditioners including the Friedrich Chill it is obvious when the compressor is running but the Kuhl is so much quieter with almost no vibration.I wonder if the reviewers who didn't feel any cool air coming out had the control set for fan only because the air coming out is very cold. Despite using it in an area much larger than the 300 sq ft it is rated for; a 550 sq ft living room & dining room it is doing a great job of cooling the area. And it is excellent at removing humidity. So much so when it is cloudy and not hot enough to run both my main floor air conditioners but still humid I can run just this air conditioner and it dries the air in the rest of my first floor. I use a tower fan to circulate the air from the living room where the A/C is installed to the dining room.It does come with two pre-programed schedules one for home use and one for commercial use.You can also customize one on and one off setting per day but if you want anything more complicated than one on and one off per 24 hours you would need to purchase the additional accessory of Wi-Fi Lite Friedrich KWIFI wi-fi kit for all Kuhl & Kuhl+ N-Series models and download the phone app to operate it.This unit is larger than other 7800-8000 BTU air conditioners. It is 20"" wide x 23 1/4 inches deep compared to my GE 8000 BTU that is 18 1/2"" wide  and 15"" deep. It will fit windows from 22 to 45 inches wide.It has a generous 70"" cord length not including the plug. The cord is on the left side of the unit but instructions are included for changing to the right side.Installation in a window is incredibly easy but because of the weight of this unit you do need two people. After attaching the curtains to the cabinet you place it in the window and screw the cabinet down to the sill with one screw in the center.  We needed to add a shim to the sill of our 1920 window because it is deeper than in newer homes. Then attach the side curtains to the sash and frame with screws and then you are ready to slide the A/C into the cabinet and plug it in.It comes with one of the optional replaceable carbon filters Friedrich KWCFQ carbon filters - 3 pack for Kuhl and Kuhl+ series - Q chassis models that they claim will capture allergens such as dust, mold spores, pet dander, dust mites and pollen; adsorb odors, ozone and volatile organic compounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZA0RUT9P7A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM2ZO42#wasThisHelpful","RVZA0RUT9P7A6","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought these would be handy to keep in my gardening basket for harvesting herbs, tomatoes and deadheading flowers. I have been using traditional bypass pruning shears but they are cumbersome for light trimming or getting into tight spaces.Maybe I have gotten spoiled by soft grip garden tools and scissors but the handles on these are so hard. And there is a lot of friction between the blades so opening and closing them takes more effort than typical shears.  I even tried a silicone spray on them but that had no effect. Because of the friction and hard handle using these for any repetitive task is very fatiguing and uncomfortable. I prefer my soft-grip spring assist pruner for gardening chores.They are sharp and the ability to take them apart for cleaning is a nice feature.

"The frustration free packaging identifies these as Belkin Anti -Glare. I think they might be ""seconds"". Mine had an extra rectangular hole above the front speaker. I received the 4-pack and there were 2 screen protectors in each pack for a total of 8. The anti-glare coating does help quite a bit when using the phone outdoors. Viewing the screen straight on there is a very slight loss of brightness and clarity; that increases to hazy grey when viewing at a sharp angle.I didn't have a problem applying these but prep is everything when putting on any screen protector.  Some brands like Tech Amor give you a microfiber cleaning cloth and tacky tape to clean your screen before applying.Tech Armor Apple iPhone 4 and 4S Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] The Armor Tec also has plastic on both sides of the screen protector so you don't scratch it when burnishing out the air bubbles and are also slightly thicker than the Belkin's. All those niceties so add to the price and you can't beat the value of these Belkin's if you don't mind flaws like an extra hole on the screen.To use these you will need a microfiber cleaning cloth MagikCleen. Superior Premium Microfiber Cleaning Cloths for cleaning Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Cameras, iPads, Hand Held Video Games, Eyeglasses, Sunglasses, LED Screens, LCD Screens, Electronics(5 pack-4+1 bonus) , a can of dusting spray Dust-Off FALDPSXL12 Disposable Compressed Gas Duster, 12-oz. Can and a credit card or other smooth edge card.  If you want to preserve the original finish on your phone's screen don't use anything but a little water on the cloth if needed for stubborn spots. Don't use Kleenex or paper towels; they are linty and they scratch.Once you have the screen clean use the dusting spray to blow off any remaining dust. Remove the protective backing from the screen protector taking care to handle it only by the edges and apply. I like to line up the center bottom and home button hole before setting it on the phone.  I hold the sheet slightly curled so the center touches first and when you let go it will adhere to the rest of the screen. If your screen is clean and edges are straight it should lay out with minimal bubbling that you can burnish out with the card. If an edge is not attaching the protector was probably not lined up straight. You can try removing and reapplying but you increase the chance of picking up stray dust on it and not being able to use it at all but it is worth a shot anyway.These are serviceable and cheap. I wouldn't buy them again simply because the extra hole does bother me. For the few times I need to apply every year full price doesn't break the bank.If these are seconds with manufacturing errors it should be included in the description so you know exactly what your getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVNK2NP1ZA72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQT0Q0Y#wasThisHelpful","RXVNK2NP1ZA72","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine bought a bottle of the Fee Brothers Gin Barrel-Aged Orange Bitters and kept telling me how amazing  they were. I hesitated at the price but finally caved and bought a bottle. He was right they are amazing. The undertone of gin flavor with the bitter orange is a perfect combination; even for me who is still not so fond of gin after a one to many martini lunch in my youth.It does make a killer old fashioned but I also love a few drops mixed with sparkling water or lemon-lime soda.

"I was surprised how large this monitor is; the face and footprint of the unit is 6.6"" x 5"". It has very large numbers and simple controls. After a reading the lights next to the systolic and diastolic measurement will be either green for normal range or amber for higher than the normal range.It comes with an A/C adapter and you can just plug it in and take a reading but if you want to use the date/time and save your measurement history you will need to install 4AA batteries.(not included)I have been using the Omron wrist blood pressure monitor for several years Omron 7 Series Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor and I love how easy it is to use but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that accurate and always reads lower than my typical blood pressure. The readings from this 10 series monitor are much closer to my average so I am more confident in the accuracy.I had a lot of trouble with the cuff until it dawned on me I should slip my arm into and slide it up my arm instead of wrapping it around my arm. The instructions just say ""apply the arm cuff to your left upper arm"". The cuff does inflate to the point it is squeezing my arm quite firmly and because of that sometimes it seems to take forever to count down and release. Once it just took off and got up to 220 before I shut it off. I did have some broken capillaries on my arm from that.There is no case for it and unfortunately even the original box isn't suitable for storage or transport because it is open on two sides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QJDEAXY02Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQB2SS#wasThisHelpful","R32QJDEAXY02Y3","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always wanted a touchless soap dispenser for my kitchen but they were all much too large to fit on the back of my sink. This compact model fits perfectly and looks great.I love that it is rechargeable so there is no bother and expense with replacing batteries.  It does come with just a USB cable for charging so if you want to charge it from a wall outlet you will need a USB wall charger.Universal US USB Wall Charger Plug In-door Power AC Adapter For iPhone 4 S 5 5G Galaxy S4 S3(White) I just used the one that came with my iPhone and it was fully charged in about 30 minutes.The top has a small charging/ low battery indicator light and a - and + button.  Adjusting the amount of soap dispensed is as easy as touching one of the buttons and it will retain that setting until you change it. I find the smallest amount works fine most of the time so if I need more soap I'll put my hand under the spout twice.  If you want to turn it off to prevent accidental dispensing it is as simple as pressing the - button for two seconds. The battery indicator light will blink red once to confirm the setting. To turn it on press the + for two seconds and the light will blink green to confirm.  It is quick and easy to fill from the flip up cover on top. The rear of the dispenser is clear plastic so you can easily check the soap level. The 2"" long spout provides plenty of clearance for your hands and it dispenses the soap very quickly.It comes with a 3.5 oz. package of lavender scented simplehuman hand soap. I didn't try that because I don't like lavender scented products. I fill it with Caldrea liquid hand soap and it works just fine.This dispenser is a little spendy but it is well made, functional and nice looking. I love it and think it is worth it.Update 12/30/14 - One morning I found my soap dispenser repeatedly self dispensing. I went to the Simplehuman website support section and they state that there are two reasons this will happen; something has gotten on the sensor window or something in proximity trips the motion sensor. I knew I didn't have a proximity problem so I turned it off, cleaned off the sensor window and recharged the dispenser. That solved the problem and now I know to make sure I clean the sensor more frequently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV7WXJQM1GYWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHWNE6C#wasThisHelpful","RV7WXJQM1GYWJ","A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Michael McDowell fortunately hit the Seventies horror boom at just the right time when he left his Ph.D. program in literature at Brandeis so that his skills could find the right appreciative audience. Here he gets to wear his learning (lightly) in this deft exploration of many of the themes of American Victorian melodrama and the penny dreadful. There's everything here you might imagine from this clever re-imagining of the genres, from an upright and virginal heroine who can't pay the rent (but she must pay the rent!) and cares for her aging penniless mother; there's a heartless rich girl to disparage her clothing and marriage prospects; a handsome and wealthy suitor; a benevolent society woman; a helpless grandfather; the narrator making asides of the ""Had they but known then..."" variety; and even a murderous menacing family to bedevil the heroine. The last of these shows best McDowell's work in horror fiction; the terrible but fatally unimaginative Slapes--a father, his daughter, and her stepmother--are the most memorable characters in the book, and the daughter Katie is not only a psychopathic serial killer but also has mindreading and precognitive powers of which she makes fascinating use. Indeed, Katie is so formidable as to have even become the novel's eponymous character, though it shouldmore rightly have been called PHILOMENA after the resourceful heroine (who, in a nice twist, is not quite so forgiving or gentle as her 19th-century antecedent heroines). The novel is enormously helped by McDowell's extensive knowledge of 1870s America; he never shows off what he knows, but the depth and breadth of knowledge of the era is very apparent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UW91I5WU3LNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941147682#wasThisHelpful","R1UW91I5WU3LNQ","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be the best of John Harwood's re-writings of Victorian ghost stories and sensation novels. It's a re-writing largely of THE WOMAN IN WHITE, and like Willkie Collins's most famous novel it makes much of multiple narrative voices and forms, surprises and reversals, and also involves all kinds of doubles and doppelgangers. In the 1880s, Georgina Ferrars wakes up in an insane asylum in Cornwall with the staff assuring her she put herself under voluntary incarceration with them under her actual name, Lucy Ashton; when she asks them to check with her uncle back in London to prove her identity, he assures them his niece Georgina is still living with him there. Things go on from there rounding most of the usual tropes of sensation novels from the High to late Victorian period, including hidden wills, falsified names, controlling parents, and crumbling old houses. It's a very fine and very gripping read, although it does not take the genre quite to another level as did Susan Waters' FINGERSMITH (which was also a re-writing of THE WOMAN IN WHITE, and which also like this novel brought out the homoerotic elements in the Collins novel more to the forefront).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PRPP6ITHNOAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544227727#wasThisHelpful","R2PRPP6ITHNOAA","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although THE GALTON CASE represents Ross Macdonald's breakthrough where he really found his voice as a crime novelist, his next Lew Archer book, THE WYCHERLY WOMAN, was a genuine setback. It starts out like most of Macdonald's Archer novels do, with his detective hero called in by a wealthy Californian to solve family trouble, but instead of dwelling on the lives and the psychology of the wealthy (as THE GALTON CASE and his other later mature novels do), THE WYCHERLY WOMAN gets drawn instead into an unconvincing, vaguely Chandleresque world of wiretappers, blackmailers, and sleazy hotels. It has a murder plot that's much too complex (again showing the influence of Raymond Chandler) and some inauthentic dialogue among lowlifes, and it becomes very hard to care about the characters. And it's also very hard to see why Archer, who gets so easily impatient with his clients in all the other books, would ever stay on Homer Wycherly's payroll given how unbelievably secretive and witholding the millionaire is (at several points in the novel he would have certainly at least threatened to quit the case had he been written fully in character).It's not until his next novel, THE ZEBRA-STRIPED HEARSE, that Macdonald seemed confident in the new direction in which he was moving and assumed full control of his mature style. No Lew Archer novel is unreadable, but this is not one of Macdonald's strongest books, and shows few of his genuine strengths as a mystery writer.

"NIGHT MOVES is often lauded as one of the best films of the Seventies, even though it didn't do very well at the box office during its initial release. A re-working of the classic private eye story, the story actually tries for more than that with its complex depiction of a seedy and dispirited America in the mid-Seventies. All of the locales look exceptionally seedy (not just the run-down motel in the Florida Keys where much of the action takes place, but also the homes of the very wealthy), and the film repeatedly makes reference to the various political tragedies of the decade previous (even the film's closing moments seem to evoke Chappaquiddick). The film also is a thoughtful exploration of the problems of American middle-class, middle-aged masculinity in a time of women's liberation and a rising divorce rate, and it has as its protagonist the greatest portraitist of middle-age white masculinity in the Seventies, Gene Hackman, in one of the best roles of his career as the football player turned second-rate private investigator Harry Moseby.Though Hackman is terrific as the morally compromised Moseby, he's let down repeatedly by his supporting cast. Both of his major love interests, Susan Clark and Elizabeth Warren, let him down: Clark is fatally uninteresting as his straying wife, and Warren is visually striking but has trouble sometimes with Allen Sharp's dialogue. (Though some of Sharp's conversations are brilliant, at times he seems to call too much attention to how clever he can be.) Viewers today are often excited to see Melanie Griffith and James Wood early in their careers in important roles here, but the truth is neither of them is very good. As the nymphet daughter at the center of Moseby's investigation, Griffith (who played a similar role the same year in another private eye film, THE DROWNING POOL, and who undresses at least four times before the camera) just doesn't pull off what's required of her. Much of the film's emotional weight depends on her ability to charm both Harry and the audience in its middle third, but Griffith just hadn't yet learned how to be endearing as well as irritating. Woods is repellent in a way that is partially his character but also largely him; he keeps trying to upstage Hackman (ineffectively). All the actors are also weighed down by the film's convoluted plot, which depends far too much on ridiculous coincidence and cheap cosmic irony.The film has eared a high reputation among film critics, but for all NIGHT MOVES accomplishes, it is very flawed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOYDKPT9FF8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GX1CE#wasThisHelpful","R1UOYDKPT9FF8U","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Thomson has seen more films (and written more about them) than most people alive, and this compendium serves best as a way to tag films you really ought to see but didn't know you should (my own copy is covered in Post-It flags for this reason). I've already been grateful since buying this for Thomson's recommendation of two terrific films noirs, THE PROWLER and ANGEL FACE, and he is especially fine on this genre, given his propensity for the dark and the perverse. (There are few writers alive who have better taste than he does on film noir or are more articulate on the subject: I can only think of Eddie Muller.) Accompanying his love for the twisted from the ordinary, however, is a distaste for an a bafflement by happiness and ""normality,"" to which Thomson freely confesses in a review of THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. This allows him to a certain critical blindness which sometimes mars his appreciation of certain films. In his review of Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT, for example, Thomson wishes that Charlie Newton were written to be much darker, like her Uncle Charlie, and he confesses impatience with the careful depiction of Charlie's family other than her uncle--which in many ways misses the whole point of the movie.A greater flaw in the book is Thomson's writing. The high speed at which many of these reviews seem to be written lets him down, and though his knowledge of the film world is encyclopedic and his taste very interesting, his sometimes rushed prose style hampered my enjoyment of the book. His pursuit of unusual metaphors or other figures of speech is quite often jarring, and there are times when he lapses into mere description (as in his review of Sokurov's MOTHER AND SON) or embarrassing rhapsody (such as his concluding paragraphs on KISS ME DEADLY). Worst of all, Thomson keeps making stupid errors in his reviews. In his review of MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, he claims, ""LADY IN THE DARK--the most ambitious stage musical of recent years--flopped as a film,"" when it was actually the fourth highest moneymaking film of the year in 1944, and did even better than MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. And in his review of THE SHINING, Thomson wonders at some length why the Colorado hotel where the film is set is useless in winter: ""Why? Because it snows! DID NO ONE EVER TELL THEM ABOUT SKIING?"" (It is carefully and explicitly explained in the opening minutes of the film that the hotel is unreachable by guests during most of the winter because of the heavy snows, and cannot function as a resort during that season.) A tough-minded revision would greatly enhance the worth of this flawed compendium.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUIEVO0TNH07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375711341#wasThisHelpful","R1QUIEVO0TNH07","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A landmark motion picture, HARPER came about when producer Elliott Kastner and writer William Goldman decided to adapt one of Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer mysteries in order to create a new kind of Hollywood movie. One of the most popular and best mystery writers of the day, Macdonald's Archer novels had progressed by the 1960s from their very Chandleresque overtones to become very sophisticated studies of psychology and moral complexity; but this wasn't what Goldman and Kastner were after. They turned to adapting the first of the Archer mysteries, THE MOVING TARGET, to re-create the Hollywood detective thriller with a new emphasis on grittiness and machismo: thus the film features its detective (re-named ""Lew Harper,"" for reasons that continue to be debated) moving in a very seedy milieu, involving drugs, illegal aliens, and torture, and uses language that was considered very edgy for its time (including, unfortunately, derogatory terms for gay men and for women that were not common in movies of the time).It's undeniable that HARPER, which was a huge success, was enormously influential and not only helped pave the way the next year for BONNIE AND CLYDE, which of course ushered in the so-called ""Hollywood Renaissance"" of the late 60s and early 70s. Moreover, its success had a huge influence on detective movies and shows of the coming era, with its particularly vicious thugs, its high-speed auto chase near the end (though the one in Steve McQueen's BULLITT was even more influential), and its hero's dodgy personal living situation (which must have been noticed by the creators of THE ROCKFORD FILES). But despite its popularity and the trends it set, it doesn't age very well, particularly in its attitude towards women. Almost every major female character in this film is extensively disparaged at some point for not being attractive enough, which seems a bit depressing given how much more complex Ross Macdonald's female characters, and the attitude towards them shown by his Lew Archer, had become by this time. There's a whole cavalcade of celebrity actors of the time playing minor roles, from Lauren Bacall, Shelley Winters, Janet Leigh, and Robert Wagner from the world of Hollywood to Julie Harris and Arthur Hill from Broadway. Bacall (whose presence winks back to THE BIG SLEEP) and Wagner fare the best, since they have the most fun with their parts, while Julie Harris makes a particularly unconvincing drug-addicted jazz chickie-baby (with exquisite stage diction). Although this was one of Paul Newman's most popular turns, he does little to convince himself as Harper, who here has annoying predilections for affecting terrible fake accents and for getting beaten up--he must get conked on the back of the head about three different times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SULPEQJRM7OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HWZ4D4#wasThisHelpful","R1SULPEQJRM7OB","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best novels in Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer series, THE ZEBRA-STRIPED HEARSE may have as its only significant flaw its rococo title, which belies its elegance as a mystery novel. Once again his low-key and intensely likable shamus Archer is employed by a wealthy California family and winds up unearthing a series of buried murders; this time his case revolves around an heiress who is being wooed by a handsome artist. When the girl's martinet father hires Archer to uncover the truth about the artist's past, Archer finds that the artist has been operating under the identity of a murdered man--and that his previous wife was herself murdered as well, with the artist as the absconded main suspect. The case Archer builds (traveling to Mazatlan and then lake Tahoe) against the Lothario is so overwhelming that by the time he is apprehended halfway through the narrative its almost a disappointment that Archer finally believes him innocent. But who killed the artist's first wife and the other man? The story of how the victims were involved with the rest of the story begins to piece itself together through Archer's persistent questions...Macdonald loved writing about unhappy rich families and their wayward children; his novels owed much to  Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP (the glowering paterfamilias here is named Colonel Blackwood, as opposed to Chandler's General Sternwood), but perhaps even more to the dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles. The rich layering of all the Blackwoods' lives, from father to daughter to mother to stepmother, and of the characters of all the  various people in orbit around them is one of the great pleasures of this novel; another is its fine mystery, which kept me guessing to the end. Despite Macdonald's great love for showing how the past determines the problems of the present, the novel's almost incidental portrait of a slightly menacing group of surfers (who ride around in the symbolic vehicle of the title) seems not only exactly up-to-date for the early 60s when it was published.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0UXIK3VHKT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375701451#wasThisHelpful","R1U0UXIK3VHKT8","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just as the great hard-boiled writers Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald have been said to write the same story over and again, Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, their descendants, recreated their first and highly successful Batman tale THE LONG HALLOWEEN, but made it even better, and found more of a voice for themselves. Again the story involves the early years of Batman and Commissioner Gordon in Gotham City (this story brings us up to the creation of Robin through the murder of Dick Grayson's parents by members of the mob), and again a serial killer strikes on holidays and is heavily involved with the Falcone crime family; but the mystery is more tightly plotted this time, and much more plausible. Tim Sale's artwork is also much stronger here; whereas in THE LONG HALLOWEEN the world of Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon and organized crime was rendered more realistically, with the world of the encroaching ""masks"" (the classic Batman rogues gallery) was heavily stylized, here the two seem more blended together, with a stronger sense of expressionism dominating the renditions.

"This may be the best Batman story ever told; it has certainly been the most influential since the 1930s in terms of setting up a mythos and tone for the entire Batman series. Frank Miller wrote this 1989 four part story in his trademark noir style honed on ""Daredevil"" and ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" but the series doesn't go in for the kind of baroque excess that Miller began to indulge in more and more since leaving ""Daredevil."" Undoubtedly it was the influence of the fantastic artist Dave Mazzuchelli (whose own work recalls Miller's earliest work for ""Daredevil"") that brings a kind of realism to this story. It follows an entire year in Gotham City as its favorite son, Bruce Wayne, returns from years abroad after his parents' murder, and a new police officer, Jim Gordon, is hired by the corrupt police commissioner Gillian Loeb; over the course of the year, Wayne will begin his new identity as the Batman, the vigilante obsessed with cleaning up crime, and set in motion a series of events that will result in the creation of the Catwoman, the kidnapping of Gordon's infant son, and the overthrow of Loeb's administration. The series also features heavily the Falcone crime family (and its boss, ""The Roman"") that figures so heavily into two of the later great Batman long stories, ""The Long Halloween"" and ""Dark Victory.""The emphasis on realism in this story (which Mazzuchelli comments upon and even questions in a smart little coda he draws for this edition) is its strong suit; its narrated alternately by both Gordon and Wayne, and the world they move in seems completely believable, despite the presence of a man dressed up as a bat who fights crime (and a prostitute who dresses up as a cat to steal). The art is some of the best I've ever seen in a Batman book, and certain panels (such as of the young Gordon trapped in traffic during a rainstorm) linger long in the memory. So much of what later happened with Batman in multiple media (including the new ""Gotham"" series on television) depends heavily on what Miller and Mazzuchelli established here; its almost indispensable if you're interested in the character and his various incarnations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3VYIDKY00WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401207529#wasThisHelpful","R3E3VYIDKY00WQ","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE CHILL won Ross Macdonald the second of his Edgar Awards (the first was for THE WYCHERLY WOMAN the year before) and the Silver Dagger Award from the Crime Writers' Association (the next year would see him winning the Gold Dagger for THE FAR SIDE OF THE DOLLAR, which also won him the Edgar for the third time). By any standard this is a very fine Macdonald mystery, which means its one of the finest of crime novels. Although Ross Macdonald is most famous for his clean prose (at this point honed as sharp as it can be) and his psychological insights into his suspects and victims, this novel distinguishes itself by its superlative plotting. Although the solution to the novels multiple murders is very complex and involves many surprises, Macdonald eschews the messier expository models favored by Raymond Chandler (one of his heroes) for a narrative through-line so clean that the reader comes to the denouement feeling full command of the story. What makes this all the more remarkable is that Macdonald saves his big reveal for the final page-and-a-half of the novel--something that's almost impossible for most mystery writers to do convincingly. What's more, his final surprise caught me completely off-guard; the novel is a splendid work of misdirection to the very end.The plot involves some old Macdonald stay-bys, including wayward sons and wealthy families dominating local politics. What's so surprising, though, is how in this novel he plays with his story, so that when the novel starts with one mystery--a saddened husband hires Archer to find why his newlywed wife up and left him--but then moves in an entirely different direction. When the first body is found (of an attractive professor in a college town), we've already moved far beyond where we started. The case also involves two other murders, one from ten years ago and the other from twenty; though seemingly unrelated, the pleasure of the work is in seeing how they are indeed greatly related (and that there is a reason why Archer comes across both of them in his detective work).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K4X992Y9RUN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679768076#wasThisHelpful","R1K4X992Y9RUN8","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of all the writers among his fin-de-siecle cohort, Richard Marsh has most often been paired with Bram Stoker, mostly because of their competing best sellers from 1897 about foreign supernatural monsters wreaking havoc in England (THE BEETLE and DRACULA). THE JOSS shows Marsh writing in a line that might be more profitably compared to Robert Louis Stevenson or Joseph Conrad, however: its final quarter involves the romantic and disturbing tale of a father ""gone native"" (as the phrase of the time would have it) in the South Seas. Given that Conrad was not especially popular when this novel was written (1904), the comparison becomes all the more striking in this, the novel's best section. Because unlike THE BEETLE, Marsh's THE JOSS does not peter out toward its conclusion but rather gains narrative strength as it concludes; unfortunately, it must overcome some muddled structural problems near the text's beginning. As with THE BEETLE, THE JOSS is told severally by a series of narrators, a technique Marsh likely borrowed from Willkie Collins, the grand master of contemporary urban terror and horror (or sensation fiction) in Victorian England. But in this work the dissonances from one section to another seem quite jarring: the narrator of the initial telling, Mary(also called Polly), transforms utterly from the put-upon shopgirl of her own narrative to the completely fearless superheroine of her best friend Emily's narrative in the next section; then she disappears almost entirely from the story until the very last pages. Marsh is always much better with mystery and atmosphere than he is with character, but the inability for him to choose among his characters as to who is central seems more jarring here than it did in THE BEETLE (where the ghastly title character held everything together by its sheer malevolence). The descriptions of urban nightmare settings are again nicely done, and Mary/Polly's inherited decrepit house--overrun with both blackbeetles and rats--is memorably creepy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQNSQ5XC83X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979233232#wasThisHelpful","R2DQNSQ5XC83X1","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actually outselling DRACULA when they both came out in 1897, Richard Marsh's THE BEETLE was much talked about for years after its publication and even turned into a silent film. It's not as sustained as Bram Stoker's most famous novel and drags off a bit towards the end in a complicated railway chase, but sections of it are as frightening as anything Stoker ever wrote. Like DRACULA, Marsh's novel involves an Eastern invader with supernatural powers coming to England to attack a beautiful woman; it also invokes a whole series of tropes typical of the period, including gender confusion, fears of rampant unchecked sexual experimentation, imperialist concerns, and anxieties regarding the explosion of London's urban growth. The novel's central (and only really memorable) character is the titular Beetle, a monster from Egypt that can change its sex, its size, and its species: it comes to London to seek revenge against a politician who abandoned it decades ago in Cairo, and seeks to destroy him through his New Woman fiancÃ©e. The Beetle's presence in the novel is much more terrifying than its actual plans (which are never thoroughly explained); even so, it's quite a satisfyingly terrible monster. The novel's initial quarter, told from the view of a vagrant who sneaks into a London house for shelter in a storm only to find himself completely in the Beetle's mesmeric thrall, is outstanding in its hallucinatory detail and its evocation of sensory horror.Unlike DRACULA, the  THE BEETLE became almost forgotten within a generation. In just the last decade, however, multiple editions of it have appeared, not only because it speaks to much to the scholarship of critics in the fin de siecle (such as Elaine Showalter, Roger Luckhurst, and Sally Ledger) but also because it's such a rattling good read. This thoughtfully annotated edition from Valancourt, printed on beautiful paper and with the novel's original illustrations, may well be the best out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GR1POGRU3BCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934555495#wasThisHelpful","R1GR1POGRU3BCY","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the course of a weekend, a rationalist sociology professor (Peter Wyngarde) discovers his wife (Janet Blair) has been practicing black magic to advance his career and protect him from bad juju in his department. After he forces her to burn all of her conjuring fetishes and charms, he returns to school on Monday to find his life has fallen to pieces. The source of this little-known British horror film was Fritz Lieber's novel CONJURE WIFE, a favorite of the screenwriters Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont, about faculty wives practicing the dark arts to advance their husbands' careers. The best witch stories are often explorations into the darker forms of misogyny, and the hypercompetitive world of department politics (with suspicions faculty members on the rise were being helped illicitly by their wives) makes an interesting avenue for such a tale. Some of the film's best parts are at the beginning, when we begin to get a nasty taste of the department backstabbing at a bridge party; afterwards, the hostess's frantic search for what one of her guests may have left behind is one of the finest sequences in the film. It inspires the director, Sidney Hayers, into some of his most inventive camerawork (we see from the undersides of tables and sofas as Blair's fingers go exploring), that he also uses for some of the film's later showpieces, including Wyndgarde's frantic race in his car against a bus his wife is on, and the magical attack of a giant eagle near the film's end (which inspired its original title, NIGHT OF THE EAGLE).Unfortunately, Hayers is so focused on ratcheting up the film's intensity that he almost never gives the actors time to breathe, or even provide the exposition that could make more sense of what Blair and Wyngrade face together: some of the evil magic used against them seems to involve only hypnosis, and other times curses, and other times the actual transmutation of reality--but we never find out the rules to any of this. (This is the rare horror film where too much is left unexplained.) Wyngrade and Blair--both unusual choices for their roles--are also pushed a bit too hard; Wyngarde's magnetism allows him to fare better, but Blair seems too histrionic and one-note, as is Margaret Johnston as another faculty wife and also a colleague of Wyngarde's. The film isn't quite in the league of NIGHT OF THE DEMON, but compared to most other British horror films of its era, it's really worth watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28JVLVQWJT8MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X63SCY#wasThisHelpful","R28JVLVQWJT8MR","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many British cultural critics consider Terence Davies likely their greatest living director, and much of that estimation rests on this, his loveliest film. An excursion into memory, THE LONG DAY CLOSES may evoke Fellini (in its visions of the past rendered larger than life, as in the famous ship sequence in AMARCORD) and Dennis Potter (in its use of popular music not just to romanticize the past but to show its inevitable dissonances with its realities) while all the time seeming very much its own special and distinct creation. The tableaux Davies evokes--from its opening shot of a poor Liverpool residential street drenched in a downpour, to its great closing shot of a mottled evening sky--almost stop the heart with their beauty. The story is a patchwork of memories of the childhood of Davies himself, here called ""Bud"": the youngest by far of four children, the film documents a year of his life (at age eleven) that roughly covers 1955 to 1956. No great dramatic incidents occur in the story: no one take seriously ill, or runs away, or gets married, or even fights. The film is in an assemblage of ""spots of memory"" wherein Bud usually stays at the margins (he is usually seen poised on a staircase or in a window), watching or listening to his family and the people around him. Although adored by his mother and elder siblings he is always an outsider; newly aware of his budding attraction to men, he can't join in in his brothers' attractions to the opposite sex (their fiancees are in the house nearly as much as the children themselves), and stays forever aloof. Family socializing is a wondrous time for Bud, although he is almost always the only youngster included. The only time he sees his age peers are at school, which is presented as a noisy painful place governed by adults who despise children. His great sources of solace are in the Catholic church, where he is a devout practitioner of his mother's Catholic faith, in the local movie palaces (of which he is an equally devout follower), and the radio: Davies uses the popular music of the time--Nat King Cole and Doris Day--not simply to enhance the beauty of Bud's surroundings but also to create a thread of mass culture to unite the ages and genders of Bud's community.The film could be a little much, especially in its treatment of Bud's loneliness: there are times when he veers dangerously close to Matt Lucas's ""the only gay boy in the village"" in his constant self-pity and sorrow. But the highly personal and subjective nature of the film renders all this allowable. Davies is so sure in his decisions and his tone that his romanticization of the past is ultimately proudly affirmed; what is more, he also even deftly deconstructs it as the film proceeds. Criterion's reissue of this film (with great sound and image restoration, and lovely extras) could not be more welcome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMBFREKJD0WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBT637S#wasThisHelpful","R3UMBFREKJD0WF","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The great British filmmaker of memory and loss Terence Davies made his first full documentary here with this 2008 collage film of ""found footage"" from the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s about his beloved home city of Liverpool. The footage and its editing are absolutely extraordinary: Davies (as in his great feature films DISTANT VOICES, STILL LIVES and THE LONG DAY CLOSES) is able to re-create a mid-century Liverpool that's both much more beautiful than you could have dreamed, and much more sordid than you could have feared. Anchored visually in its Edwardian heyday by the Great Liver Building (which also anchors the actual city docksides), the film documents not only the decay of the enormous darkened buildings of the Victorian and early 20th centuries, but also documents, with due alarm, the rise of horrible Council Estate tall buildings during the post-War period. The chosen footage also depicts (with an uncanny eye for visual beauty)  the beauty of the docks themselves, the trains, the beautiful electric signs of the cinemas, and the very human and lively city inhabitants, from children at play to adults retaining their dignity in decaying surroundings.For the eye, the film is something of a feast; but for the ear, the film just doesn't work. To accompany his matchless visual sense, Terence Davies also has quite an aural distinction for selecting lovely and evocative pieces of music (from Liszt to Peggy Lee) to accompany them; but he has something fo a tin ear for his own voice. His first mistake was to provide the film's narration in his hyperdramatic sonorous tones; his second mistake was to select a salad of super-familiar quotations (from Psalms to TS Eliot to Christopher Marlowe) that risk rendering his striking and singular images banal. Finally, he ""comments"" as he goes, making quite clear his crankiness towards the extravagance of the royal family, the musical unsophistication of rock music, his cynicism towards the Catholic church he so loved in his youth, and other fairly predictable and uninteresting biases and opinions. Instead of enhancing his visual feast, Davies's narration detracts from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GGOXCKIVVJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TH2DO4#wasThisHelpful","R34GGOXCKIVVJK","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biographical subject of THE ORIENTALIST is an early twentieth-century Azerbaijani novelist and biographer named Lev Nussimbaum, who also published under the names of Essad Bey and (this book argues) Kurban Said, and who was almost forgotten in the West. because I was unfamiliar with him, I kept resisting reading this book until so many friends recommended it to me I had try it, and then I found it very difficult to put down. In Nussimbaum, Tom Reiss has found a subject on whom he can hang a grand tale of adventure, intrigue, and glamor in the war-torn worlds of Europe and central Asia from the beginning of the century until near the start of the second World War; its worlds reminded me of nothing so much as that of Sidney Reilly, the famous secret agent the United Kingdom employed in this same time frame to spy on the Germans and Russians and who was a major source for Ian Fleming's James Bond character. (I kept hearing the Shostakovich theme song to the Sam Neill series REILLY, ACE OF SPIES as I read this.) Nussimbaum started out in Baku as the son of a Jewish oil millionaire, then fled with his family during the Russian revolutionary period to Kyzyl-Su, Constantinople, Paris and Berlin, where they finally all finally settled with the enormous White Russian community headquartered there (along with the Nabokovs). Nussimbaum changed his identity to that of the Muslim-born fez-wearing Essad Bey to heighten his own glamor, began publishing bestsellers (including biographies of Stalin and Czar Nicholas II), married an heiress and became an international socialite before succumbing at a very young age to gangrene of the extremities.Reiss is less interested in Nussimbaum's writing than he is in his exciting experiences, which involved apparently one life-threatening escapade after another. Most of these events come from Nussimbaum's own autobiographical writings, the truth claims of which Reiss rightly questions frequently even though he seems to accept many of them despite their romantic nature. It;'s hard to know how rightly to take Reiss's judgment as to which stories are true and which are not since Reiss was here for the first time writing a biography of a then-dead subject. The best way to take this book is really on its own terms, and if you stop trying to evaluate the likelihood of the stories and just give into it as a series of rattling good tales it's an enormous amount of fun for its first half. (There's also lots of fascinating information about some of the less-known historical events of the period with which Nussimbaum was involved.) The narrative of the book involves Reiss's own tricky biographical enquiries into Nussimbaum's life and times, much along the lines of something like AJA Symons's THE QUEST FOR CORVO: Reiss does a fine job with this in the book's first half, but by the end of the book he seems to tripped up making his claims that Nussimbaum was the author of ALI AND NINO (which many other scholars have disputed) that it becomes hard to untangle the through-line of the narrative. (Reiss clearly expects readers of this biography to have read it in its original form as a long article in THE NEW YORKER -- a bizarre and unhelpful expectation.) Until the recounting of Nussimbaum's divorce (at which point the narrative falls apart), the biography is not only terrific but something I'd recommend to go out of their way to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S14W0KEUS0AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812972767#wasThisHelpful","R3S14W0KEUS0AD","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fragile, waiflike, and tentative, Mia Farrow was absolutely perfectly cast in ROSEMARY'S BABY, and spent much of the next ten years (until she met Woody Allen, who gave her more varied parts) playing the prey for Satanists, murderers, witches, and ghosts. In one of the more beautifully done of these victim stints, she plays Sarah, a woman who comes to live with her aunt and uncle and their daughter after she is blinded in a horse accident. Early in the this film, she returns from a day of riding to their beautifully appointed mansion in the autumnal English countryside: the utter silence in the house and the low camera angles suggest something is not right. The director, Richard Fleischer, takes him time as we watch Sarah navigate through the house's many halls and rooms, making coffee for herself in the kitchen; we see broken glass  (which she narrowly avoids stepping on, through pure luck) on the floors, but we still don't know what's wrong until she's in bed, and we see her beautiful cousin's corpse sprawled out unnaturally in the bed next to her. All the family have been slaughtered.This scene is so scary and carefully done that almost nothing could compare to it... and for  long time, nothing in the film does. Fleischer films everything beautifully, though, and scarily shows the killer (who wears star-embossed cowboy boots) only at a low level, so you don't find out who he is until the end of the film. Unlike WAIT UNTIL DARK (its clear direct inspiration), the film does not act to empower its blind heroine so much as to use her handicap as an opportunity by which she might be subjected to all sorts of nasty spills and mishaps: of course eventually she does step on that broken glass in the kitchen, and also runs through the wrong door leading into the cellar, rides a horse into a low-hanging branch, tumbles down a steep muddy hillside... it all gets to be a bit much. (The biggest suspense in this long middle section is actually whether the terrified Farrow will stumble in her panic into the many priceless vases and fragile objets d'art her relatives have somewhat tactlessly left on the side tables in all their long hallways.) The film does have a great final sequence, though, involving Farrow washing off in a bathroom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWLE9PQGYFWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009ZPU3#wasThisHelpful","R3DWLE9PQGYFWP","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Williams's 1965 novel about a Missouri professor's life and career has been rediscovered in the last several years: it's become NYRB Classics' bestseller, it's attracted the attention of movie stars, and it's become some thing of a cult novel in Europe. It's pleasing to see that such a fine little forgotten book should enjoy such a fine second life, but it is somewhat bewildering, given what a dark tale it is. it's basically a story of one man's persecution through the years by the goddess Nemesis, who takes many forms: the foolish wife the young academic marries, who then turns against him; the department chair, who tries purposefully to humiliate him; the town gossip, which maliciously attacks him when he has some of the few happy months of his life in an affair with a young instructor; and finally cancer, which brings him to his grave. Watching William Stoner meet these persecutions with both stoicism and dignity is rather remarkable, and gives the novel its pleasures. In many ways it owes much to a tradition of realist literature coming straight out of Flaubert, although Emma Bovary meets life's obstacles in the reverse of the way Stoner does (and with none of his grace). STONER is a grim little book, but it well deserves its moment in the sun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF5SFZNCJWBE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171993#wasThisHelpful","RF5SFZNCJWBE1","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though marketed as a standard horror film, the fact that this piece attracted actors with as much prestige as Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, and Rebecca Hall should be a clue that THE AWAKENING is not an ordinary ghost film, but something very special and moving. Set in 1921, the story involves a famous ghost-debunker (Hall) who is brought to a former country estate re-purposed as a boy's school to find how a little asthmatic student was frightened to death. The film really isn't very frightening, which is its worst flaw but perhaps still central to its aesthetic: it's structured less as a horror work and more as a mood and a character piece. The house (a combination of several different Scottish houses filmed from different angles) is itself a major character, and is gorgeously photographed. Although she plays a character who could not have existed in 1921 as she is depicted (the gender roles of the era are flouted too much here), Rebecca Hall brings a dose of good common sense and humor to her part; Dominic West is perfectly cast as her romantic interest, a Latin teacher recovering from wounds from the Great War. The film works best as a mystery story, one which doesn't cheat on its outcome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DENMSR3YPQIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097C046W#wasThisHelpful","R2DENMSR3YPQIL","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very hard to keep a great television series going beyond four or five seasons: even such brilliant shows as MARY TYLER MOORE and THE SOPRANOS had trouble keeping their quality at a consistent level. Alas, this is also true for MAD MEN, one of the most beautifully accomplished series of the last ten years. In this, its sixth season, nothing seems as new or as interesting anymore for the writers, as story tricks that seemed tremendously inventive in seasons past (hallucinatory drug use, the central ad agency re-branding itself and going through a major personnel shift, etc.) recur here in mostly tired ways, and Don Draper (the series' antihero) seems caught in a pattern of marital infidelities we've of course seen before quite a bit. All this would seem forgivable if so many characters weren't by this point so sour and unpleasant. Certainly the contempt that ad men have for their clients' limitations and timidities has been a major theme in the series, but Don and Peggy by this point (initially at different agencies) seem so consistently condescending and irritable that it's hard to root for their campaigns very much or care whether they can score new clients. There are some interesting ideas this season, but not many. Despite the wonderful work of newcomer to the show Linda Cardellini as Don's new neighbor and mistress, this has been by far the series' weakest season.The DVD set of the sixth season is equally disappointing: there is not a single episode commentary, which makes buying the set mostly pointless because most episodes can be seen anyway on cable on-demand services anyway. Had I know this I would not have bought the set: getting to hear the actors' and especially the writers' ideas behind the series has been one of the most entertaining part of the DVD sets for this show previously. Omitting series creator's Matt Weiner's insightful commentaries, in particular, is something I do not understand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2667YY8Z78E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUUAV08#wasThisHelpful","R3I2667YY8Z78E","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HIGHLAND FLING is for the most part so accomplished that it's hard to believe it was Nancy Mitford's first novel: it shows already firmly  in place her tremendous gift with witty dialogue and her lifelong love of juxtaposing the differing mindsets of the upper classes. Although it shows some structural weakness (or naivete) in that it takes until the fifth chapter for Mitford to introduce her main character Jane Dacre, once Jane enters the picture and the action moves from London to Scotland it never stops being funny.The set-up involves two dizzy and constantly hard-up London socialities, Walter and Sally Monteath, being asked by Sally's titled aunt to care for her Scottish castle and their seasonal shooting guests where she and her husband the earl are out of the country. To make their stay (which will save them quite a bit of money) more palatable, Sally and Walter invite a few of their friends among the Bright Young Things, Jane and the surrealist painter Albert Gates, come with them. The humor depends on first glance on the generational differences between the elder shooting guests, Establishment monsters of conservativism addicted to hunting and fishing, and the Monteaths' friends, who are their mostly for gossip and aesthetic reasons (Albert, who has taken to calling himself Albert Memorial Gates, is so avant-garde that he has gone to the other extreme and become a devotee of Victoriana, of which the castle abounds but which was very much out-of-date among the Establishment by the time the novel was written). Much of the novel's humor depends on the clash between the aesthetics of the elder and younger generations, and the lengthy description of the ""safe"" bourgeois tastes of Lady Brenda Chadlington, the one figure who most floats between the two groups, won't be as funny unless you are firmly entrenched in the visual style of the period. HIGHLAND FLING goes beyond this, however, and like most of Mitford's novels engages with the political as well as the aesthetic: Albert's explicit denunciation of the Edwardian attitudes of the most aggressive of the elders, General Murgatroyd, that to the First World War makes this novel more than simply delicious froth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHP71L4A8DAE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345806956#wasThisHelpful","RHP71L4A8DAE5","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew Jarecki's 2010 crime film is ""ripped from the headlines,"" as they say: although the names are changed, the parallels of this film's story to the mysteries surrounding New York real-estate heir Robert Durst are of course inescapable and intended. In 1982, Durst's wife, a medical student at Albert Einstein, disappeared and was never found again; the case was re-opened around the turn of the millenium, after which a young woman working on a book based on Kathleen Durst's disappearance was executed gangland style (the killer was never found), and Robert Durst, who hid from the public spotlight by moving to Galveston and dressing as a woman, was arrested for killing his neighbor and disposing of the body with a saw. (The killing was found by a jury to be in self-defense, although Durst was found guilty of improperly disposing of a body.) There's so much that was so strange in this heavily sensationalized story (Robert Durst also as a child witnessed  his mother commit suicide by throwing herself from the roof of their family mansion) that it might seem a natural for a great film, combining murder, mystery, money, and cross-dressing.To his credit, Andrew Jarecki (best known for his documentary CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS) does recognize that his story is interesting mostly as an indictment of capitalism, and how great wealth makes even in its beneficiaries miserable. But we've seen this before in all kinds of American films based on true events, from CITIZEN KANE to REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, and this film doesn't have any of the great redemptive black humor of those other films. Nor does it have much of an air of tragedy about it, either: it just sort of sits there, unformed. It's worth watching only for the two performances at its center: although Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst both start out doing exactly what we've seen them do multiple times--Gosling being twitchy and wounded, and Dunst being a golden sunshine girl--, as the film continues they do very new things. Dunst is phenomenal in several wordless shots where we see her misery sink in upon her, and as Gosling's character becomes more and more unhinged, he takes on a more hooded aspect to his character, making his motives and decisions much more mysterious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5YW9HESUM3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H83IG4#wasThisHelpful","RY5YW9HESUM3A","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every Jane Campion film or television project is worth seeing because of her intelligence, her political commitments, and her remarkable visuals; every one of them also has major flaws compounded by Campion's heavy-handedness with her messages. This recent miniseries produced, co-written, and co-directed by Campion is no exception to either rule: set in her native New Zealand, it involves a stunningly dramatic and mysterious setting, a mystery centered upon an atrocity committed to a beautiful girl, a determined detective trying to root out the truth, and a community around the victim that is involved in far more horrors than the detective ever dreamed. The parallels to the Danish TV show FORBRYDELSEN (THE KILLING) and to TWIN PEAKS (which also inspired the Danish series) are inescapable, especially given in how both those earlier shows matters of gender and violence stood front and center. Campion, of course, is one of the most intriguing feminist film directors in the world, are her analysis of violence committed against women is even more front and center than in its predecessors. In this miniseries, a 12 year-old girl, Tui (Jacqueline Joe), is found trying to walk into a great lake on New Zealand's South Island, and when she is rescued, it is discovered she is pregnant, but she refuses to name the father to a detective (Elisabeth Moss); soon after, she disappears entirely. As the detective becomes obsessed with finding this young girl, she runs up against an odd mixture of the lake's inhabitants: the girl's father (Peter Mullan), a violent and self-pitying local criminal patriarch; his son, the detective's former boyfriend, who comes to care for her; and an odd New Age community of women led by an androgynous, taciturn guru (Holly Hunter).Campion's trademark gorgeous visuals and dreamy pacing kept me through the entire miniseries, and its really something to see, with the alien landscape of New Zealand's stark Lake Wakitupu and its nearby dramatic neighbor Mount Earnshaw. Some of the most remarkable shots are of helicopters, showing the landscape dwarfing the insectlike people crawling on it, or reducing the colorful stacked railroad cars of the New Age community to the scale of mere children's blocks. Whether the miniseries works as an actual narrative, however, is another matter. The mystery itself isn't very interesting and is fairly guessable, as is the big twist in the final episodes; there's also too much revenge fantasy, with nearly every rapist (the miniseries is fairly crawling with them) implausibly shot or maimed by story's end. Of the major actors, Moss and Mullan do the best work. As the detective Robin, Moss is very different here from anything we've seen her do before, and her quiet ability to assume command is nicely done. Mullan is ideally cast as a terrifyingly mercurial man who wallows in self-pit and who can be surprisingly tender before erupting into cruelty: one of the best (and scariest) bits in the show is a long sequence involving Mullan's tryst with one of the women (Robyn Malcolm, in a warm and fine turn) from the compound. Although Holly Hunter does excellent work as the guru GJ, and can strikingly evoke her character's air of electric quietude, she's burdened a bit by her own movie star aura (a less well-known actress would probably have suited the part more effectively). Jacqueline Joe has an unearthly beauty as Tui, but perhaps no child actor could have pulled the part off convincingly: the mirror of GJ at a different age (willowy, prophetic, and surprisingly tough), Tui has so much symbolic weight freighted onto her by Robin and the film alike that she struggles under the burden of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30G9HQNNQO2MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B83OIVA#wasThisHelpful","R30G9HQNNQO2MA","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill Blakemore's beautifully crafted study of how people can become obsessed with their own interpretations centers on one of the most analyzed and re-watched movies of the 1980s, Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING. In this documentary, multiple analysts talk you through their own readings of Kubrick's film, showing you how often the film refutes logical expectations and brings up puzzles worthy of interpretation: the hotel manager's office in the Kubrick film seems to be in the exact center of the hotel's main floor, for example, but it impossibly has a window looking out to the outdoors; the little boy at the center of the film takes three famous rides around the hotel on his Big Wheel where the first of the rides makes perfect sense but the latter two do not; an odd character is introduced near the beginning and stands around in several scenes but says nothing, and his purpose in the film is never overtly explained.Like all of Kubrick's films, THE SHINING is an interpretive labyrinth literalized in this film by the hedge maze outside the hotel (again, in an impossible location) and the maze-like patterns of the hotel carpets; like the three main characters in the film, the interpreters try as best as they can to get outside of the labyrinth but repeatedly find their ways blocked. Three major readings of the film emerge, but although all the interpreters repeatedly point out striking or unusual things to us, none of these three major readings (that the film is Kubrick's comment on the Holocaust; that it's about atrocities committed by the US government against Native Americans; that it's about the faking of the moon landings) is ultimately convincing. The film cleverly edits juxtapositions of the actual Kubrick film and other movies (from FAUST to CAPRICORN ONE) to make its points; it's a gorgeous overall piece of editing razzledazzle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YENNIR2OHEX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6I7EGQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YENNIR2OHEX4","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vintage has been reissuing all of Nancy Mitford's hilarious novels, and two of the shorter ones, CHRISTMAS PUDDING and PIGEON PIE, have been paired in one binding most likely due to the fact that they're her shortest novels. They're both quite funny and about the kind of social milieu Mitford always deals in--the pampered upper classes--, although in tone they're fairly dissimilar, and could both be paired more aptly with two other longer novels that preceded each of them. CHRISTMAS PUDDING shares with its immediate predecessor HIGHLAND FLING several characters and a similar milieu (a country estate where a dissimilar group of aristocrats and their hangers-on has assembled), while PIGEON PIE is much more akin to the novel that came between it and CHRISTMAS PUDDING, WIGS ON THE GREEN, in its political theme and more slapstick Wodehousean humor.Each of the books is worth reading if you like Mitford in the first place, and PIGEON PIE is especially interesting for its treatment of the ""Phony War"" of 1939-1940 and its treatment of espionage, politics, and even murder. For the casual reader, however, CHRISTMAS PUDDING will probably be the more palatable: it's funnier than its companion in the volume (Mitford was much funnier when dealing with dialogue rather than with antic behavior), and treats marriage in a very different way than Jane Austen or Trollope did, and it has fewer period cultural references that might escape an audience not thoroughly versed in the details of the early war years. Mitford is so funny that it's a treat both books have been reissued, although these are not a patch on her two fictional masterpieces THE PURSUIT OF LOVE and LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNBDBF524ILF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034580662X#wasThisHelpful","RYNBDBF524ILF","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the four years between Will Hays' writing of the Motion Picture Production Code in 1930 and the actual enforcing of it, the major studios instead tried willfully to flout it as much as possible, producing some of the most interesting and exciting films of the Studio Era. This 1934 Warner Brothers film was one of the very last to slip in before the enforcement of the Hays Code, and was actually banned two months after its release by the Catholic League of Decency--and you'll know why when you see it.Based on a stage play by Leon Abrams and George Abbott that echoes in its mood and setting THE PETRIFIED FOREST, the film does little to move its actors away from their stagebound origins in and before a Mojave Desert rest-stop; fortunately, the director, Mervyn LeRoy, works against this by providing multiple pan shots across the desert, establishing the loneliness and eeriness of the setting. The rest-stop is run by two sisters, played by two of the finest actresses of the time, the emotive and huge-eyed Ann Dvorak, and the intensely likeable Aline MacMahon, for whom the studio treated the film as a big star-making vehicle. In those days, some of the most beloved stars in Hollywood (such as Wallace Beery and Marie Dressler) were of unusual ages or builds, so its not that surprising Warners' should have given this plum to MacMahon (who resembles Fanny Brice), though she rarely again got the kind of role she deserved. Here she's escaped from a bad relationship in Tulsa to raise her much younger sister (Dvorak) and act as the rest-stop's mechanic: the film involves the chance return of her old lover, Preston Foster, who hides from her the fact he's a murderous bank robber on the lam. All kinds of fine character actors turn up at the stop, too: Jane Darwell and Edgar Kennedy as a couple beaten by the heat; Muriel Evans as one of a pair of hitchhiking ""tomatoes"" who have their thighs pinched in the front seat by their professorial Good Samaritan; and Glenda Farrell and Ruth Donnelly as a pair of bickering friends who have been newly Reno-vated--and whose suitcases full of jewelry tempt the larcenous Foster and his partner (Lyle Talbot). Despite the staginess of the action, the film is mostly excellent thanks to MacMahon, who establishes real rapport with Dvorak and brings a true sense of complexity to her character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUP3GNYXH1M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H0M2T6#wasThisHelpful","R1QUP3GNYXH1M3","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Moore is one of the three or four most important figures in the history of graphic novels, and FROM HELL is clearly his masterpiece, although it is also his most unsettling and upsetting work. The text is a recreation of the Whitechapel murders of 1888 attributed to Jack the Ripper, mostly from the point of view of the person Moore (and a few others before him--not very persuasively in any of the cases) proposes to be the Ripper, Sir William Gull, the personal physician to many members of the British Royal Family. The artwork by Eddie Campbell is absolutely perfect for the work--its sketchy and jumpy draftsmanship beautifully evokes the repressive paranoia Moore wishes to create, and Campbell's use of blackness is practically nonpareil. The book seems in the end to be more Moore's than Campbell's, however, given the former's extensive footnotes at the end of the text: they not only act to establish a kind of authority (though a somewhat questionable one, because most of the works in Moore's extensive bibliography are by amateur Ripperologists) but also make his seem like the final word on the entire matter.It's a difficult text in many ways, not simply because of its lengths and because its lettering is not always easy to decipher. Like many encyclopedic narratives (by Melville, Dickens, Joyce, and most analogously Bolano), it has its long boring stretches, where the obsession with detail overwhelms the sense of narrative drive. Its ethical implications are genuinely disturbing: you're not only asked to follow the Ripper as the text's antihero and view his horrible murders as the narrative highpoints, but you're also asked to see Queen Victoria (!!!) as the ""prime instigator"" (Moore's own phrase) of the entire murderous conspiracy, as if the misogyny of the Ripper's murders were not enough. And the damage wreaked upon actual historical events and real people's lives (it is almost impossible the actual Sir William Gull could have been the Ripper) is fairly extensive.What saves all this from ruining the work is Moore's awareness of all of these matters. In the superb coda to the text, ""Dance of the Gull-Catchers,"" Moore mocks his own enterprise and shows how aware he is that the Ripper will never and can never be actually identified. He also shows his full awareness of the foolishness of playing with history to create his own narrative. And the book's most notorious section--the full serial number devoted to the Ripper's last and most horrific crime, the murder and then lengthy mutilation of Mary Kelly--is here presented in such detail and so graphically that we are dared to turn away, as if to suggest that not only are the writer and illustrator implicated in the Ripper's misogyny by re-presenting them to us but so are all readers, and indeed anyone interested in the most savage violence committed against women. Moore does not resolve these problems by signalling his awareness of hem but rather turns them out to us: why are so many people still so interested in these crimes? There's no denying how important and substantial this work is... or how troubling it also is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDBONXUOQEXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0958578346#wasThisHelpful","RBDBONXUOQEXT","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time it was produced ""Rome"" was the most expensive TV series ever mounted, and by the second season it was clear it just couldn't continue for a third. Because the very strong first season has concerned itself with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, from his victory in Gaul to his assassination in the Senate, it made sense to end the second series with the defeat of Caesar's assassins, Brutus and Cassius, and then the fall of his lover Cleopatra and his protege Mark Anthony. But the first season covered just five years, whereas the second comprehends twelve, and there's an awful lot to shoehorn into this given that the series is not just concerned with members of the imperial elite (i.e. Caesar's and brutus's family, Cicero, Antony, and Cleopatra), but also the fortunes of two of Caesar's former soldiers, the grimly pious Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and the merry and bloodthirsty Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson). This worked very well in the first season, since we got quite a bot of fascinating detail about Vorenus's family life and both men's exploits in the army. Unfortunately, since Vorenus's wife Niobe died last season, the second season involves her widower going berserk and becoming a bloody gangmaster on the Aventine, which does keep the violence quotient up but which doesn't tell us much interesting about Roman daily life (and which also made the series much too tediously akin to other roughly contemporaneous HBO dramas such as DEADWOOD and THE SOPRANOS).As for its portrayal of the elites, the second season starts very strongly in the immediate aftermath of the assassination conspiracy, with a panicked Atia (Polly Walker) and Antony (james Purefoy) trying to get out of town and stymied by the determination of Caesar's widow Calpurnia (Haydn Gwynne, excellent again in her smallish role) to do everything correctly and not be rushed. Though the major rivalry from last season between Atia and Brutus's mother Servilia (the superb Lindsay Duncan), and a new one between Antony and Octavian, also start well, once Brutus is defeated at Philippi everything in both cases runs out of steam: the Atia/Servilia rivalry has a disappointing go-nowhere ending that is not even true to history (well acted, however, by both women), and when Octavian comes back from Philippi played by Simon Woods rather than Max Pirkis something seems to be lost, especially when he marries Livia (who is portrayed here as a rich twit). The final episodes are especially disappointing because the entire romance between Antony and Cleopatra (Lynsey Marshal, not charismatic enough) is so rushed that the two seem fatally unsympathetic: you get tired of the debauchery and want Charmian to bring in that asp. The general sense of rush also means that major historical players in these events get excised from history altogether, including both Lucius and Gnaius Ahenobarbus, Octavian's first and second wives Clodia Pulcra and Scribonia, and Livia's husband Tiberius Claudius Nero. As before, the series is stunning to look at, with the visual climax, the Battle of Philippi, as spectacular as Caesar's triumph over Vercongetorix was the season before.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8NAI3EQWF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ42Q38#wasThisHelpful","R3O8NAI3EQWF8","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Ackroyd has written many glorious and erudite works in his long career, but this is one of his most disappointing. Why this book could not have been a section within his long ""biography"" of the city of London (published several years ago) is not clear: its short and could have been even briefer given how much padding is in the writing. All kinds of fascinating facts about the networks of tunnels, ruins, and sewers under London are loosely strewn together here, joined by random quotations that often have nothing to do with London, or by what, I am sorry to say, is really just blather. ""The idea of secret passages, of mysterious entrances and exits, of retreat and concealment, possesses an incurable charm,"" writes Ackroyd in one such instance, ""Yet if we are not found in the game of hide-and-seek, what then? What if we are left alone in the darkness, our companions gone into the light?"" (What then, indeed!) It's hard to reconcile such a drippy passage with the writer who crafted his magisterial Dickens and Blake biographies, or his beautiful early novels (like HAWKSMOOR). Peter Ackroyd has become a profitable cottage industry in his later years, where once he was a careful writer and scholar. It's been a disappointing change for what seemed in previous decades such a tremendous career.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6GNX4ZT8W19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPM16M#wasThisHelpful","R2G6GNX4ZT8W19","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eleanor Catton won the Man Booker Prize with this novel in 2013, and in the process won all sorts of superlatives. Catton is the youngest novelist ever to win this prestige award, and THE LUMINARIES is the longest novel ever to take the prize. It may also well be the most enjoyably readable Booker prize winner since A. S. Byatt's POSSESSION in 1990, which (not coincidentally) was also in part a Victorian historical fiction and was also written in densely lush prose. Catton's novel echoes the sensation fictions of the decade in which it is set, the 1860s, but the scene here is New Zealand: in a boomtown near the famous gold fields, a large assortment of characters (including two Chinese men and one Maori) attempt to piece together the events that have led to a disappearance and to a death. Since sensation novels were predecessors of detective fiction, the reader must also figure out the determining narrative that involves gold smuggling, murder, prostitution, mutilation, opium addiction, and a very dramatic seance. Catton's larger point (revealed almost wholly in the novel's final fifty pages) is that mysteries and fates are often predetermined by parties outside our ken, as her complex plottings both narratological and astrological underline. Whether or not these tricks are ultimately mostly a lot of fuss and bother for diminished intellectual return, THE LUMINARIES is still a great deal of fun, with rich prose, fine characters, and an enjoyably complex plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AIQ8GN81WO2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316074314#wasThisHelpful","R3AIQ8GN81WO2K","A106016KSI0YQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A106016KSI0YQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of all the different options there are for foil, the heavy duty is my favourite. It is sturdy, and actually lets you cook food in various ways. Great on the baking pan to prevent it from sticking. Perfect for lining the freezer, so that it's easy to remove when there are spills.

"The mop head is the softest thing you've ever touched. I almost didn't want to clean. Almost.THE GOOD- Two separate chambers means that when you are cleaning up a wet spill, you can dunk the mop into the spinny chamber, let it loose, and rinse it off before giving it another spin. Great!- It's super duper soft, so you don't have to use it just for your floors. This would be great for those people who like their cars to be hand washed, but don't want to grab a ladder to reach the hard-to-reach spots. If you have delicate or finicky floors, this mop is your jam.- The mop spinning action is to pump the handle up and down. It takes a minute to learn to use, but once you have it, you're golden.THE BADAnd this is why I'm docking a star. No matter how good the design of the buckets, the overall beauty of the product, or the softness of the head--if the mop doesn't absorb water, we're going to have problems. There are times when I'm clumsy, and spill water on the floor. Rather than wasting a paper towel, I'll reach for a dry mop to sop up the spill.I don't expect the mop to get the floor bone dry. Quite the contrary. I just want the large majority of the water to be gone. Whether the mop was dry, or spun dry and merely a little damp, the water just doesn't come up as fast as other mops I've used in the past. Heck, I've taken to keeping an old cotton T-shirt around for this sort of thing, and that works pretty great!Were it not for the less than optimal absorbency, this would get the full 5 stars, because it really is a pleasure to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MD7DQAYLEN0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","R2MD7DQAYLEN0W","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the thing. The sound quality is superior to the earbuds that came with my iPhone. But then, that's like saying that an activity is more fun than watching paint dry. It's true, but it doesn't tell you very much, because so many MANY headphones are superior to the stock iPhone earbuds. I haven't owned terribly expensive headphones in the past, so I couldn't tell you whether or not these compare.I have owned a lot of middle-of-the-road headphones (between $30 - $75 a pair), and the sound quality on these is comparable to those for sure. Phone calls sound good, and the other party says they can hear me well. I like the pause and volume buttons on the remote control thing. Audio that sounds SSSSSSSOOOOO SSSSSSSIBILIANT and pierces my eardrums with the iPhone earbuds will turn into just sssssssslightly tinny on these. I'm emphasising the s because they sound ear-splitting with anything less than good headphones.If you're using these for anything except running, they're an utter waste. Why? The design of the wire that comes down one side makes it awkward for it to use when sitting down at a table (for example). The particular way that the band wraps around the back of your head makes it impossible to lie down with it. The reason I mention all this is because if I am spending this much on a pair of headphones, I'll want more than to be able to say that I can use them for one purpose alone: workouts.For comfort, these are terrible. In any configuration I put them on, they don't feel comfortable in my ears. After a fairly short amount of time, they grow painful to wear. I managed the first day to wear them for about an hour, with no problems. I'm not working out for an hour, but I wanted to wear one pair of headphones for the commute and for the session. After about an hour, my ears started to hurt from how hard the headphones were pressing against them. THAT SAID, they did not budge or fall off. That was probably because they had my head in a vice-like grip, but there you go.These aren't /bad/ headphones, but for what they cost, I'm not sure that it's a great purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AGUTI7Q1QX9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRRTO5O#wasThisHelpful","R2AGUTI7Q1QX9J","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great water bottle overall. It's got a straw in, so that you don't have to tilt it upwards to drink. It fits perfectly into the bottle holder compartment of my backpack. The carabiner on the lid makes it possible to clip onto a bag strap if needed. It looks pretty nice too. It also sits comfortably in my hand. There is a vent hole up on the top so that when you're drinking from the straw, pressure won't build up in the bottle. Unfortunately, it's not as effective as it could be, which means that after the first sip or so, it becomes more difficult to drink from.

"I don't like to buy perfumes, because I find their scent to have things that I don't want in there. Most men's perfumes and colognes have this overwhelming musky undertone, which I hate. I find it harsh and unpleasant. And don't even get me started on Axe. Ew. I like to use essential oils to change up my scent (when I feel like wearing a scent at all, which is not a daily thing). So far, my favourites have been sandalwood and rose. A tiny bit behind the ears, and a tiny bit on my throat, and I'm good. I don't want the scent to be strong enough that you can smell it on me when I come near you. I want you to discover it if you come really close, and like whisper in my ear or something.What does all that amount to? I want the essential oil to have a strong scent, but it needs to smell like it's supposed to smell. Those ones with other things in the essential oil tend to turn me off, because the thing it should smell like only lasts a short time. Then the ""other"" smells take over and you're left with a scent you didn't sign up for. I also want the scent to be strong enough to last through the day. Colognes tend to fade with time, so I don't really bother using them that often.The scent should be strong, so that I can use the smallest amount possible. Everything else that I smell like should smell like me. It should enhance what I smell like normally, not mask it.That's the reason that this oil has my full 5 stars. It hits all my requirements quite nicely: it's strong, it's not overpowering, it smells like itself, and it lasts for a full day without having to reapply. A tiny bit goes a long way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IHHEC3OU5N5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X47GZOG#wasThisHelpful","R3IHHEC3OU5N5B","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The colour is bright and vibrant. I have yet to bother with throwing it in the washing machine, because they don't seem to get that dirty that quickly. Why? They're not terribly absorbent. They'll clean off your mouth from BBQ sauce or something, but they're not going to do that well with mopping up big spills or something. A quick rinse under tap water, and they're clean. Then just hang them on the oven door or something and they dry pretty quickly. (It'll drip dry.) Rather nice feature to have.You /can/ put it in the dryer, but at low.

"This laptop has some features that are excellent, and others that make it difficult to use.Touch ScreenPROS- Highly responsive overall.- Because of how good the touch screen is, I find myself using it quite frequently.CONS- Because of how much I use the touch screen, the screen looks horribly smudged all the time.Quality of 4K ScreenCONSI use a Macbook Pro retina, an iPad with retina, and the iPhone with retina. Websites looked terrible in the first few weeks of using the computer, because their images were all pixellated, and the layouts didn't quite have the same responsiveness that the websites of today have. On the XPS, however, the amount of pixels on the screen means that the entirety of the computer looks ridiculous.Websites have text that looks like ants on the screen. ""Oh but you can zoom!"" I can zoom on any computer that I own. I don't want to have to do that, because zooming the text breaks layouts of some websites, and overall just looks dumb. This same issue shows up on the start menu. You go to the start menu, and the icons are freakishly tiny.I have used Windows 8.1 on other computers with smaller monitors. This isn't an issue on there. This looks like it's partially a Windows issue, and partially a Dell issue. Why am I blaming Dell too? Because they have created software to add functionality to the trackpad (more on that in a moment). When you're charging over $2,000 for a laptop, it behooves you to take a look at something as basic as how things on the screen look to a user before you send it out, and create a thing to address that issue if indeed one exists.PROSMovies look gorgeous. Whether it's iTunes HD or other companies that offer HD moves on their site, the movies look absolutely stunning on the screen. Yes, I'm aware that I can hook up the computer to a flat screen TV, and really see it in all its beauty, but when I travel (frequently), it's nice to have a screen upon which anything with high resolution is going to look good.When you're in the middle of editing photos or videos, the extra pixels really help. You can see the whole thing on the screen, and have at it. The Adobe suite of products run on it just beautifully. Because of the sheer width of the screen, I can have my InDesign document sitting on one side of the screen, while I'm in the process of editing the images on a Photoshop window right next to it. My mac screen isn't nearly as wide as the Dell screen is. Also, because of the touch screen, I can very quickly organise windows or icons on the screen. This goes much faster than when I'm using the mouse. Why? Because the mouse is pretty awful.TouchpadHoly cow, this touchpad is awful to use. I've messed around with the sensitivity settings, and the speed settings until I'm blue in the face, and no luck. It's still horrible to use. If you're getting this computer to mostly use the touch screen, and use the mouse on the rare situations that you're doing businessy work, like a giant Excel spreadsheet or something, then this won't be an issue for you. When you're doing video or photo editing, you're probably better off using the touch screen in any case.However, for long-winded business style applications, you're going to be frustrated.When using the touch screen, I feel like the mouse doesn't want to respond to my moving it around. It's reason enough for me to hook up an external mouse. It was this usability issue and the squinting to see the screen that I docked a star.Startup SpeedThis is absolutely awful. Between the solid state drive, the masses of RAM, and the processor itself, the startup should be very quick. It's not. I've used Desktop computers with a fraction of the tech specs of this one, and with regular hard drives, and they start up faster. Don't know what's up, but it's a major issue.Battery LifeUnlike the mac, this one doesn't do too hot with having the lid closed. As I mentioned before, the startup from shutdown is really REALLY slow. To counteract this, the startup from sleep is freaky fast. You open the lid, and you're flying again immediately. Unfortunately, this sucks down battery. An average day of typing documents, checking email, organising my calendar (again, the touch screen makes this a pleasure to do), getting online for a spell, and even watching a movie for a bit, will give me a good solid 4 hours or so. Why?I tend to turn off the wifi when I don't need it. I'll also dim the screen as much as I can, and turn off the illumination from the keyboard. That way, I don't worry about the amount of power I need to do something frivolous, like play a movie or something. However, if I put the computer to sleep, it doesn't freeze the battery level like my mac does. It continues to take up battery life. Not as much as if I had the computer flipped open and was using it. It's definitely slower to drain the battery. But drain the battery it does. It's not good at standby.WeightThis thing is /heavy/. My similarly sized Dell 17"" is heavier than this machine, because it's got an optical media drive, and is a few years older. However, this is heavier than my MacBook pro (which does weigh a ton too). If I'm going on a quick trip, I'll reach for my mac, because it's lighter. For longer haul trips, where I want the touch screen, or want to just watch movies, I'll reach for the Dell, because it's really good at playing my Blu Ray discs (on an external drive that I own).Overall, if you need a nice computer and aren't just using it for email, watching YouTube, and the occasional MS Office document, get this. It has the power to handle those resource heavy Adobe applications, and will keep up with your multitasking needs.

"Does not dissolve in water. When the weather is dry, or I'm taking a bath and really giving myself a thorough scrubbing down (like on those hot summer days when I feel all gross and sweaty and greasy from running around all day), my skin tends to feel particularly dry. I want a lotion that I can put on right after my bathing routine. This is ideal, because it's very rich and doesn't just turn to nothing on wet skin. Short of straight up coconut oil, I've yet to find another lotion that will behave itself when you jump out of the shower.I do ignore the instructions. I don't want to towel myself off right after putting on lotion. That'll end up with me having the lotion all over the towel, and having to use more. Instead, I'll lightly dry off the bulk of the water, and immediately moisturise afterwards.

"This is not going to replace maple syrup for your pancakes. Don't expect it to. However, it will make your life easier on recipes that call for palm sugar. Generally, palm sugar comes in those giant lumps that are a huge pain in the neck to have to scrape bits off of, and add to a recipe. For example, when you're making a Thai curry, and it calls for a tablespoon of palm sugar, just throw a tablespoon of this stuff in, and it'll get you there with regards to flavour and sweetness. The taste is much more intense than brown sugar. Much more earthy, but sweeter than molasses. Definitely a neat option to have on hand if you like playing with different sweeteners in your recipes.I find it has too much flavour for things like iced tea or coffee. Unless it's a really bitter, strong coffee, the natural taste of the syrup interferes with the taste of coffee.

"Cleans right down to the bone. OK, not literally. I'm exaggerating. I used these pads after doing some deep frying, and having my entire face feeling like a grease ball. The pad was disgusting to look at even after I washed my face with my usual face wash soap. Seriously gets down into the deep spots on your skin, and clears you right up. I tend to have oily skin, so this wasn't drying to my face at all.THAT SAID, I'm docking a star, because I haven't had hugely visible results. Yes, some of the very fine lines aren't as pronounced as before, but the wrinkles along the nasolabial folds, and the forehead are still crevices. Looks like I'll have to suck it up and deal with those, or go sort out a plastic surgeon, because they're stubborn.In other words, expect this product to clean really deep. Expect it to exfoliate a bit too, because the texture of the pads themselves is fairly rough. It's not as rough on your face as those face scrubs with giant honking chunks of stuff in them, but that's a good thing, because those things seem to take off layers of skin, and that's kind of concerning.

"It works on my iPad, and my iPhone. It lets me hook it up to a charger in the wall, next to my bed, and still play with whatever device is charging. This is excellent for when I've let the battery get too low (which is an almost daily occurrence, to be honest). There are differences between this cable and the ones bought via Apple. The one from Apple is more springy, whereas this one is more stiff feeling. The material coating the wires is not as soft. However, these are considerations that aren't that big a deal, because I wanted a cord long enough to reach from the wall to my pillow, but not so long that it gets all tangly. Best part is that the colour coding helps it stand out from the myriad iPhone cables at work. Everyone knows that the purple one is mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XZH9ZJ7YN7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJLEEI2#wasThisHelpful","R30XZH9ZJ7YN7C","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The paper is good quality, and has plenty of room for writing down quick notes. Each day, INCLUDING Saturday and Sunday have a full 1/4 page devoted to them. That means that you get 7 days on a 2-page spread, along with an extra box for notes. Solid. The tabs for the months are on both sides of the divider, meaning that you can see which months have passed, and which ones are coming up, regardless of where in the book you are. At the opening of each month, you have a full month view. In fact, as daily planners go, this one is a king amongst planners. So why the docked star?The spiral binding makes it difficult to finagle the front and back covers. When I fold the thing flat open on my table, it sits flat gorgeously. When I try to close it back up, the pages go back into configuration no problems. The cover, however, sticks. Pound for pound, this has ALL the features that I could hope for in a daily planner, but opening and closing it is a pain. If it weren't for that one major (it's not a minor annoyance when you're opening and closing the planner multiple times a day) annoyance, this would get 5 out of 5 stars. If it's not enough of an annoyance to you, because you just need one place to archive all your dates, you'll be fine.BONUS: If you use fountain pens, this will be a good choice for you. I used Noodler's Baystate Blue in a Platinum Preppy on this planner, and it didn't bleed through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVO9WUF0DLK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC4WUA#wasThisHelpful","R2MVO9WUF0DLK8","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could go on for ages on how much I love tea, but then you'll be bored. Suffice it to say that I will drink tea if it's on offer, especially when I'm wanting a bit of a relaxing moment during a busy day. However, when I'm at work, I don't have my little gong fu cha tea pot, or any of the other paraphernalia that I generally keep at home. This leaves me with two choices, both of which are terrible: bagged tea, or those Keurig tea pods. Bagged tea that's of quality will generally be good for one steeping, because the bag is barely 1/4 full. Basically, I've just spent a fortune on a single serving of tea. The Keurig stuff is terrible tasting, and also obscenely expensive.Why is this one different? Each tea bag is LOADED with tea. When you pour on hot water, the bag inflates to its full size, and the bag is crammed full with the tea leaves and rose petals. This is the same effect that I get when I make the Chinese tea at home. It means that I can steep quite a few times out of one amount of tea, and share it with my friends. Granted, this is not a tea I'd be sharing. It's too delicious.This is a decidedly floral tea. If that's not your bag, keep looking. The brand offers plenty of other choices. I actually really enjoy floral tea (Jasmine being a favourite), so this is right up my alley. THAT SAID, bear in mind that this is a flavoured tea. It's not for those who are tea purists, and need for their tea to be straight up tea leaves and nothing else. For me, it's a question of context. If I'm going to be with friends who enjoy a cup of tea, I'm going to break out the full shebang, and have a tea ceremony situation going on. If I'm on my own, and in the middle of a work day, I'll reach for these tea bags.The flavour of the green tea itself isn't too grassy. It's more of a mild green tea that's eminently drinkable. The rose comes through nice and clear. This needs no sweetener at all, because it's got a natural sweetness from the flowers in there. All in all, the product does everything right: plenty of tea for your bag, so that you can steep more than once, high quality ingredients, and convenience. The design of the pyramid shaped bag lets the tea bag get completely surrounded by the hot water, rather than having blind spots in between. Also, instead of floating on the top of your cup, this one sinks right down. It's costly, but compare the price of this to the price of a bag of garbage tea at a diner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IR5HZUP7YZRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBI3UKW#wasThisHelpful","R2IR5HZUP7YZRR","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOTS of power. So much power. My husband charged his android phone to 75% (because he then had to use the thing), I charged my iPhone 5S multiple times, and we're still on the first charging. It managed to charge overnight. I had my iPhone going at full tilt (Waze was running, as well as YouTube, and LTE turned on) on my trip on the bus. I was teetering on 20% battery life. In an hour, while using my phone with all the things running, I managed to get back up to 75% battery while plugged into the 2 amp side. The battery amount left over display is really helpful, because those freaking dots that other battery backups have don't tell you anything.We own a External Battery, New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, iPhone 6, Iphone 6 Plus, S5, Nexus 6, Note 4, Tablets, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, and more (Now w/Micro-USB charge port) that I've had for a couple of years now. Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge.It is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you? Either you sacrifice the amount of charge you get, or sacrifice having a heavy little brick in your bag.This is thicker and slightly larger than my iPhone, but it's small enough to fit into a regular sized handbag or backpack. It does fit into my pocket for those times that I want to talk on the phone while having the phone charge, and walk around (you'd be surprised how frequent that occurrence happens). When I do so in my pyjamas, it will bang against my leg, so I make sure to just slide the battery thingy into the pocket of my hoodie or something.For what you're paying for the unit, this is a very slick little device. It's got sensible features that you will find yourself wishing in all your other devices. It's also pretty enough that other people comment on it. Very much worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIK9EWNSO13Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN9BYHQ#wasThisHelpful","RPIK9EWNSO13Z","A3J3OCM6PPWNRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J3OCM6PPWNRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did enjoy the story.  There are some lol descriptions of feelings about your spouse when you've been married for a few decades.  The story centers around Lisa and Joe Stone, two very intelligent but by their choice small town lawyers, and their wacky client Lettie VanSandt.  Lettie is a regular ( almost weekly) client who often changes her will and wants to engage in all manner of lawsuits agains just about anyone for anything.  Joe isn't quite sure why he tolerates her the way he does. Lettie is also big on creating potions.  Low and behold one of them actually works and could be worth a fortune.  This part of the story takes off with Lettie's death, her nervous son Neal claiming her estate after Joe signs off on it and something fishy comes out.  This something involves a huge pharmaceutical and it's young magnate.  Interesting legal drama ensues.  However I didn't buy the actions of Lisa Stone - the decisions and actions she took to try to save the case when it looks as though the Pharmaceutical may win.  I don't believe anyone would do what she did and risk what she did, so that was a little off for me.There's a sub story about Lisa's discontent with her marriage, her actions and her constant - and somewhat annoying,  self recrimination and fear of discovery by Joe.

"Vinnie's Diner isn't your typical diner.  Apparently it appeared because the main character Allie needed a place to assess her life before moving on.  Allie has been in a life threatening auto accident.  She is helped to the diner by Vinnie and it is there where she reviews her life before making the ultimate choice of staying or moving on.  As with all of us, there are things that Allie would rather not 'replay' . There is a cast of characters in the diner, which serve no purpose and don't expand the storyline.

Depending on your age, this could be a very thought provoking story.  If you really reflected back on your life, would you like what you see?  Would you take an opportunity to change?  Would you see that holding grudges has no meaning and could you let go?  Could you forgive so you could move on?  Would you change now, while you have life left and could make a difference in your life and others?  Interesting questions.

"The chaise and table were delivered a couple days ago.  I finally made myself get up out of the chaise and write a review - the chaise is THAT comfortable!  Anyone who sits in it does not want to get up.  The items were packeged very well with no damage at all.  Heavy duty cardboard, foam sheeting around the arms and back of chair and the legs encased in bubble wrap.  Cushions in heavy duty plastic.  I'm not sure what 'assembly required' means to the manufacturer.  In this case it included tying the bottom cushion onto the back, cleaning the glass for the table and placing it on the table.  The set is made of plastic rattan which is nicely woven and smooth to the touch.  The cushions are a nice oatmeal shade, and the included lumbar or head pillow compliments it well, as does many other outdoor pillows I happen to have.  The set is supposed to e weatherproof, is intended for outdoor use and I may put it outdoors at some point.  After we unpacked the set it looked so nice in our great room we are just using it there.  The back of the chaise has 4 adjustable settings from fully upright to recline...and oh is it easy to fall asleep on this plush cushions!  The bottom pad is almost 6"" thick.  It's really a great set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NY7EZ7FUQRIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOFA6AQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NY7EZ7FUQRIG","A33UZDO4KB4S0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33UZDO4KB4S0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great work glove.  They arrived just in time for cleaning a gas grill in which a grease pan caught fire, leaving alot of baked on charred debri.  I used alot of soapy water, sponge and scrub brush and the grip from these gloves was great. No sliding or slipping.  Much easier to work with than my kitchen rubber gloves!  Also used with Roundup while spraying bug spray...usually not a problem but I felt better having my hands protected ( for once)  Again, firm grip, no slipping.  These were also used for repair on a bike chain and had great grip and allowed me to keep the dexterity.  I agree with other reviewers that you can reuse these gloves provided they are not filled with oil or yard chemicals.  I thought these were alot easier to put on than the Costco latex gloves I have been using.

"I own a Weber Smokey Mountain smoker.  I thought the intro about various woods used in smoking, charcoal and the basic operating procedure were helpful for beginner smokers.  The Minion method of lighting the charcoal briquets is described, along with the comment to experiment with this method as there are a few variations. This is what we did- hey it's smoking, you're not building a nuclear reactor.  There are many ways to achieve the end result.  The food photographs are amazing, you'll want to tear the pages out and try to eat them.  Certainly an incentive to try the recipes!!  I didn't find the layout confusing as some others did, it was obvious that he was giving you the rub and barbeque sauce he used on the item he just gave the recipe for.  There are all kinds of recipes from basic smoked items such as pork butt, ribs, chicken etc to some more uncommon items like poppers ( several varities) and pizza.  The author also tells you how to use your smoker as a regular grill and there are several recipes for that - what he calls a high heat option.  Overall, I thought it was a great book and can't wait to try the recipes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ND1M6TIK5NZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624140998#wasThisHelpful","R1ND1M6TIK5NZA","A33UZDO4KB4S0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33UZDO4KB4S0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works as advertised.  Once you download the Seek app, sign in etc...you simply attach the camera and go 'seeking'.  I had no connection issues, it worked immediately on a Samsung 5s and I did not have to remove my case.  I set it to see the temperature, and I had no idea how hot my modem or cable box got!  Both were close to 100 degrees F.  The color shades worked best for me from about 15-20 feet - very close and of course it wasjust the one color but also more blurry.  I was able to see someone walking around the house in the dark - my husband who volunteered.  That was pretty cool.  Take a picture quickly which would probably be useful if you had a problem and were talking to a contractor about it.  Took the camera to a few construction jobsites to check hot/cold spots.

"I've been using Neutrogena sunscreens for years as they were recommended by my dermatologist.  Neutrogena has a broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection which is marketed as 'helioplex'.  This is basically a combination of certain chemicals which when combined prevents the sunscreen from degrading rapidly, hence the 80 minute reapplication recommendation.  I used the cool dry sport 30 on a hot, humid Florida day. It's thick and when you apply it the whiteness of the sunscreen takes a few moments to fade as the product is absorbed into your skin.  It definately stayed put on my face and the perspiration came out through the suncreen.  It took several swipes from a towel before I felt like I had wiped off the sunscreen. So - it lasts.  I applied it, waited about 15 minutes ( sweat test) then went in the pool for a time.  When I came out I could still feel the lotion on me but less than when I went in, so it does last in the water.  That being said, I prefer the Neutrogena sport for face sunscreen and the Neutrogena Beach Defense sunscreens.  Although the cool dry sport sunscreen did preform well, it was not any different than the Neutrogena products I already use and like.  This sunscreen is just thicker than the beach defense.  This is personal preference.  This product did work well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0NHMBZQ44K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YLLI#wasThisHelpful","R2T0NHMBZQ44K3","A33UZDO4KB4S0H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33UZDO4KB4S0H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used the product on 2 leather reliners.  One recliner is beige and about 10 yrs old with light use.  The cleaner immediately lifted the light ""dirt"" stains where your hands commonly rest on the arm rest.  Likewise light 'dirt' was lifted from the recliner portion where the feet rest.  I used the green bottle, cleaner and conditioner on this recliner.  The other reliner is taupe/grey, 3 yrs old and the leather color was already worn through on the recliner where your foot rests.  Also there were a few minor ink stains on the arms.  The spray on leather cleaner lifted the ink stains right off.  Didn't do much for the footrest where the color of the leather was missing.  Applied the conditioner and it immediately darkened ( naturally) and sealed the worn through areas so they are no longer obvious.  In all cases the product did not feel oily or greasy.  There was no real odor.  Now, the ""leather scent"" was hideous and got thrown in the trash right away.  There are pretty extreme warnings on all bottles, don't expose to skin, eyes, flush out eyes, don't inhale, give oxygen...I mean are these leather cleaners made of nuclear waste by products or what?  I went to their website to see list of ingredients and none is offered.  My opionion is that this leather cleaner was no different than another brand I used in the past, which also worked the same and actually listed the ingredients.

"I run about 20 miles a week in a variety of conditions. I also am a bit of a sneaker/running shoe freak and own about 50 pairs. I can honestly state that these are my absolute favorite. As a result, I end up wearing many of my other shoes in casual settings but use my Puma Radius when I want to run a great time. Here's why:- Extremely comfortable. Seems to have just the right about of padding (not minimalist but not bulky) to make my feet happy.- Very breathable. Even in 90+ degrees, my feet don't feel stuffed up.- Incredibly durable. My Radius has been through about 100 miles and the only wear and tear visible are a few loose strings on the stripe.- Versatile usage. I can wear these in all temperatures and road conditions. I actually feel more comfortable in these than any of my trail shoes.- Good design. Looks nice with high socks, low socks, calf sleeves, etc. Also looks nice while wearing jeans or other casual wear.Overall, I love these. This includes all the other Pumas that I have as well. I plan on buying several more colors and hope Puma continues to make this version of the Radius for a few more years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9XVRY4V1B0GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZRI9O8#wasThisHelpful","R9XVRY4V1B0GV","A37XQ1R7WFPXXP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37XQ1R7WFPXXP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned several pairs of Kinvara 3 and just started wearing Kinvara 4. I use them to run about 20 miles a week on paved roads and my feet thank me for it. These running shoes are extremely breathable and comfortable that I wear all year round except during the harshest part of winter.If you've never worn Saucony before, I suggest going up half a size. For example, I wear size 10 Nike but 10.5 Saucony. This applies to all my Saucony shoes.The only problem that I've had with any Saucony was that one of my Kinvara 3 shoes makes a snapping noise. This is not a problem when I'm running outdoors but no way I'd wear them at a mall or airport since it's incredibly embarrassing. I actually spoke with a Saucony rep and even shared a video but they were unwilling to swap the pair out with me unless I paid for shipping. Boooo!

"I used to crawl around my flowerbeds using small hand tools to loosen weeds and pull them by hand. Some of these weeds were sharp (thistle) and had really deep roots. I got tired of the hours this would take so I looked around for a better solution.Glad to say that I found this Fiskars weed tool! It works as advertised. I simply step on the tool into the weed, tilt the handle toward me, and the weed pops out of the ground with its roots. No bending over (literally and figuratively) and no strength involved.Just a final note, you will still need to spray weed control.

"Fine Art Photography GuideThis book will give you the facts on how to earn art gallery representation. The author has interviewed numerous high level galleries. She presents the most common roads to success such as portfolio reviews. She also profiles several currently famous and gallery represented photographers and explains how they reached stardom.I learned so much by reading this book. For instance, one of the galleries said that some photographers are overdramatic when they show up with white gloves for their artwork. Fine art galleries know how to handle artwork, and donât need to be handed white gloves. I found that funny because I saw a famous fine art photographer do a presentation at Imaging USA, and he specifically recommended taking two sets of white gloves, one for the photographer and one for the curator. Myth officially debunked.I bought both the paperback and the Kindle version so I could easily reference it when traveling, but I also wanted a hard copy I could highlight and dog-ear. This is my new favorite reference book.It is also a great inspiration to get out of my comfort zone, try some of these approaches, build several bodies of work, and hopefully hang on the walls of the most beloved galleries.I will recommend it to all my photography guild friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTHL5UBJPCVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=151462642X#wasThisHelpful","R2PTHL5UBJPCVI","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is so inspiring. Scott Kelby has the ability to make the complicated simple. In this book he used a formula that I love! Every two pages he starts with a behind the scenes shot, then he gives a brief description of where they are, sometimes why, and any light modifiers or other gear needed.Next paragraph he gives you his actual camera settings, even if they weren't ideal, and he explains why he selected them, including his lens.Next page he shows you the final image, which is absolutely beautiful, especially now that you've seen the behind the scenes shot.Third paragraph (of the 2 page spread) he tells you his thought process on the whole image and capture, like why he would put a second diffuser in front of a softbox.Fourth paragraph he touches on any special retouching.I'm going to take the hot-shoe chapter, and work through every example like a workbook. See if I can recreate the essence of what he's teaching but with my locations.He has a chapter on:* Natural light portraits* One light setups* Two or more lights* Hot-shoe flash* Weddings (ugh, not my thing but still worth reading and studying)* Travel* Landscapes & nature* Other stuff (like product photography)* Post productionHe is also a talented photographer himself. Now that may sound like a requirement to be a photography author, but it is not. Many writers have a lot of technical complicated knowledge, but no artistic vision. This writer has really studied the craft and acquired the skills both technical and has a photographers eye.He his hands down my favorite photography how-to author because he makes everything look easy, and I think to myself, ""I can do that!"" And you know what, I usually go out there and do get it right with his help.I have gone from a mom photographer to recently making the list of Top 10 Indiana Photographers, and I attribute a ton of my success to his books, seminars, and podcasts. Thank you Mr. Kelby!!!If you haven't read his other books, Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Boxed Set, Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4, Updated Edition, I recommend you do so.

"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this short story about the purpose of life! The mystical nature of it reminded me of The Alchemist.It starts with Davita realizing that, although she has died, her life is not really overâ¦yet. Simoni greets her and tells her she can choose between life and death, but she only has an hour to make her choice. Talk about pressure! Davita asks Simoni various questions about life, and I found myself wondering what I would want to know if I could have a Q&A session with an all-knowing being. That is one of the things I liked about the book; it makes you think about your own life.After Davita asks about things like happiness, religion, childhood, and other things she never completely figured out, she eventually asks about the purpose of life. After discovering her purpose and the five practices to help her fulfill that purpose, Davita is in a better position to make her decision. The story has an interesting twist near the end. I donât want to give anything away, but I will say that Simoni doesnât exactly make Davitaâs decision easy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCVAE4Y7C9VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0OMSMC#wasThisHelpful","R1TCVAE4Y7C9VH","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was a quick read, and it follows the clean, concise, visual, to the point pattern set out in other NAPP (National Association of Photoshop Professionals) books. There are images to demonstrate practically everything he describes. His instructions are clear, and thankfully lack the ad nauseam detail that bores me to tears. He tells you what he's doing, and shows you, including before and after. That's what I need.While I found the whole book valuable, my two favorite chapters were Chapter 2, the 26 Piece Tool Set, and Chapter 7, A Dream Within a Dream. In Chapter 2 there is a subsection where he takes a plain brown graphic, sort of fleur de lis-ish, and with layer style turns it into a dramatic, metallic, three-dimensional image (without using real 3D techniques for CS5 Extended). It was a very impressive transformation.Chapter 7 is about 3D, which requires Adobe Photoshop Extended CS5, and given the fact it is written by Corey Barker, the Photoshop TV (podcast) 3D guy of course it's great. He explains in the book that he also has a video demonstrating the topic on-line; I personally like the print version. I've see him demo 3D numerous times on the podcast, and seeing it is print, where I can internalize at my speed what he is doing is more concrete. I can then refer to it when I'm actually in front of the computer, turning my company logo into a cool 3D image.He also utilizes the define brush command, which granted, I've done, but really rarely use. He refers to it a couple of times in the book, to again create these  3D type effects, (again without using real 3D techniques for CS5 Extended) like lightening, or a blood splat, and I think to myself, ""Now how can I work in lightening?"" Because it looks so great. From the Photoshop 3D guy, 3D effects without CS5 extended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LMC4P2ZLEIDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321820495#wasThisHelpful","R3LMC4P2ZLEIDK","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just ordered my second copy of this book because I want to have one at work, and one at home. As I was reading it, I felt like I was highlighting every page. There was so much useful information, it was almost overwhelming. I could hardly wait to finish and get to my computer to try out my new skills.I have been using their complete collection, including the new Color Efex Pro 4, and was very happy with it. But now I know so much more about each program and the submenus. I also have a much better grasp of the control points, and when to use each program. It's so good, I (factiously) wish no one else would ever read it.Here are some examples of why it is so great from chapter 9 on Silver Efex Pro 2:* Find more Nik Software presets at [...]* The brightness control slider controls the overall brightness in the image, whereas the highlights, midtones, and shadows sliders only control the brightness in their respective tone range* Dynamic brightness (available only in Silver Efex Pro 2) uses software to decide how much brightness to apply to each area of the image, and can be less muddy, say than decreasing the brightness with the brightness slider* Soft contrast is another slider unique to Silver Efex Pro 2, and it seeks to ""emulate the look and feel of film noir movies, with dark moody contrasts and soft transition.""* Structure applies contrast only in areas of the image that are not an edge.* Selective colorization is also available only in Silver Efex Pro, and people tend to have strong opinions about its use, usually negative ones.* The color filters seek to emulate glass filters. Landscape and portrait photographers often use a red filter to ""darken skies (which are actually cyan, not blue) and increase separation between the clouds and sky."" The same filter also lightens the skin, and reduces appearance of blemishes.* The Color Sensitivity section allows you to further darken skies by reducing blue and cyan, and you can also target skin tones or any other color in your image* The Silver Hue and Strength sliders allow you to change what would be black to a specific color. They are called that because the replace silver from the film days.* The Vignette and Burn Edges both darken the edges, but the Burn Edges is preferable if you have some edges you would like to darken more than others.* In the Loup and Histogram section is the Zone System Map, based on the work pioneered by Ansel Adams. Hovering over one of the 11 zones causes color hatch mark on the image so you can see which sections of your image are in that zone. Zones 0 and 10 are pure black and pure white respectively.* The History Browser is also exclusive to Silver Efex Pro and relatively newAnyone that uses Nik software absolutely must have this book. And of course, if you don't already have Nik Software Creative Efex Bundle Consists of HDR Efex Pro ,Color Efex Pro 3.0 and Silver Efex Pro 2 - FREE UPGRADE TO COLOR EFEX PRO 4.0 this is a must have for the serious photographer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMFZZGV8RZL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111802222X#wasThisHelpful","RLMFZZGV8RZL6","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well done, visual, and detailed, book. He shows and tells everything. There are photos for every aspect of the shot, from every angle, including from the ceiling looking down, so you can really envision how the set was constructed, how close the lights were to the model and each other.He shows you the back of the camera, his exact settings including: aperture priority, ISO, f-stop, shutter speed, lens and focal length. He explains, and shows you where he focused his lights, what light modifiers he used, his power settings, and how to adapt that to your lights.On the retouching, he takes you step-by-step through the camera raw and photo process. Each step is accompanied by a supporting photo of the screen, I would say screen grab, but it looks to be higher quality. He includes keyboard shortcuts and explains why he is making a particular adjustment. For instance, he takes the recovery slider to the point where the model's face is properly exposed, but doesn't worry about the reflection on metal, or the light bulbs being blown out.He demonstrates many different photographic/ lighting looks, and they are all very different:* A classic high key beauty shot* An edgy rock-n-roll shot, this one had some cool photoshop techniques I hadn't seen, and am looking forward to trying* A dramatic beauty shot, with lots of contrast and shadows* Three light lens flare. I would call this one a slightly over-exposed with cool image in sunglasses shot.* Ring light with another cool sunglasses effect* 3-light sports setup (masculine edgy lighting)* 1-light full-length fashion shot, to name just a fewI like the fact that he explains how you can do this without spending a fortune, and that he includes several male shots, and doesn't limit himself to just polished female model beauty shots.He even includes a separate chapter where he explains how to do all the exact same shots with speedlights.He includes a gear guide that shows the exact tools he used in the book with pictures and descriptions, right up to the adapter rings and transmitters.Kelby salts the book with his usual off the cuff humor, which I enjoy. The book, amazingly, moves very quickly, is an easy read, and will be an excellent reference book. He has the uncanny ability to make everything seem easy. And, if you follow his instructions, it probably will be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8V3RN55B8DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321786610#wasThisHelpful","R1R8V3RN55B8DQ","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know these memory cards are expensive, but memory cards are not an area where I am willing to cut corners. I need my camera to be fast for numerous reasons. When I shoot HDR, I'm really testing the buffer. Or when I'm shooting an event, I do not want my buffer to get full and prevent me from getting that great shot. I am super careful about making sure I've downloaded my images so that I don't accidentally format I card with data on it, and that does require an extra set of cards.

"This book came Highly Recommended by my photography mentor. As a photographer, we look for people like us to be assistants and photo editors. Well the person you need sitting behind the computer all day is not the same type of personality as you need behind the camera going out in the world and connecting with people. If a person is happy sitting behind a computer all day, you need someone who doesn't require constant human contact. Big difference from the extroverted photographers I know.This book reminds me of the carpenter's moto, measure twice, cut once. The book's point is figure out what the job description is, in detail, spend you time finding the right person, so you don't have to fire them. Get the right person in the beginning.There are forms on the disk, and that is actually why I didn't give it 5 stars, I think including them on the disk is a plus, but I would have liked to have seen them in the book too, so that I didn't have to go to my computer (which I spend wayyyyy too much time on anyway), and I could continue reading the book in bed. Then, later I could download the forms.Other than that, I thought the book had a great message, and material to support you search for the best employee possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CYYGUXJA3VB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071664882#wasThisHelpful","R3CYYGUXJA3VB6","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw this 3TB hard drive at the Apple store I was so excited! A complete nerd moment, and then when I found it here on Amazon I was even happier.I've tried the 3TB Western Digital, and the 3 TB Passport, and I really dislike them both. They cause problems at boot-up, so I have to remember to unplug them before I turn my computer on, and then plug them back in after I boot up. They disconnect all the time, and I haven't even touched them, it drives me insane! I am neurotic about backing up, I even rotate my backups off-site. With my previous backups, I was really nervous moving them because the boxes say they shouldn't be used as a portable hard drive. When I asked about that at the store the gentleman said the disks move even when they aren't plugged in, great, so how are you supposed to rotate them, and get them off-site?Well you don't have to worry about that with this hard drive. It has never caused my computer to lock-up when I boot-up, it has never dismounted, and I feel safe rotating it to my off-site back up.

"I love this book. Combining images, and making it look believable is hard, tedious work. In this book Matt Kloskowski lays out exactly how he does it, and actually makes it sound easy, hopefully I'll get to the point where it is.Some of it was familiar from watching Photoshop User TV, but much of it was new. In one example he explained how he kept track (on his phone) his lens, and focal length, distance from the subject, and how high the camera was from the ground when he photographed his main subject. He then replicated all of this when he photographed the background so the subject would look right when put in that atmosphere.He covers the shadows (super important to making it look real), the filters, the clipping masks, layer blend modes, and a couple of ways to get rid of that nasty fringe quickly to name just a few of his helpful tips. This is a book that I will keep right next to my computer and refer to any time I am doing a composite.If you like this book, I also recommend his earlier book Layers: The Complete Guide to Photoshop's Most Powerful Feature (2nd Edition) which was absolutely wonderful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NA1HZ2M5BIAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321808231#wasThisHelpful","R2NA1HZ2M5BIAG","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this program. If you are new to HDR, I recommend you read The HDR Book: Unlocking the Pros' Hottest Post-Processing Techniques. In the book, RC discussed three software programs to create HDR images, and explains that the Nik version is his favorite. I agree! I've tried using Photoshop to do HDR, and Nik does an immensely better job.The program comes with presets that you will see on the left hand side. They are a great starting point. If they need adjusting, you can fine tune with the sliders on the right, in particular I go to method and strength.I've read on Flickr that HDR is addictive and I totally agree. With it you can get images that you just can't get in any other way, at least not without spending days in the digital dark room doing tons of complicated masking.If you like this program, I also recommend Nik Software Color Efex Pro 2.0 Standard Edition, 19 Filters, Plug-in Software for Macintosh & Windows. Free upgrade to Color Efex Pro 3.0 Standar which I use all the time. I in particular like the filters Tonal Contrast, and Sunshine. Nik has a podcast which I also like, it will give you some good ideas, inspire you, and lead you to some great artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YD4QM3ALV24T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YUN49C#wasThisHelpful","R2YD4QM3ALV24T","AKEZ5LBU48M63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKEZ5LBU48M63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a little hard to describe, but it's enough to put a rubber band around.  So in other words, it will not lay flat on the top of your head.  Even putting on a wig head, the extra material is there - - so the picture shown on the package is misleading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZDCBMMBZOVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO6DE8O#wasThisHelpful","R2YZDCBMMBZOVS","A288D2R9WAJBZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A288D2R9WAJBZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to give my dog a variety of raw foods.  THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS RAW.  How do I know this?  When you feed your dog raw, the body uses most of that food.  The waste that comes out is very minimum, no matter the size of the dog.  I am used to picking up about 2-3 tablespoons full of waste when my dog poops.  Also, the smell is not as strong with real raw.I mixed this with warm water, then warm goats milk.  My dog did not want either.  But finally, around midnight, when he realized he was not getting anything else, he ate this.  I woke up to a PILE OF POOP in the kitchen.  Now mind you, my dog has NEVER pooped in the house.  From day one when I got him from animal control; not a single poop in the house ... now this.Real raw does not react this way.  This brand has been pulverized to DUST and is unappetizing to a dog who is used to real raw food.  There are NO CHUNKS OF MEAT, NO BITS OF VEGGIES ... simply dust.Hoping I can return.

"I am hoping that my pooch will come to like this, as it was an expensive purchase.  I bought from another website.  Surprised that it was mostly crumbs; with very few chunks.  My dog is used to raw, but the texture is so unappetizing.  It suggests you mix with equal parts warm water.  I tried that and also used warm goats milk; as my dog has stomach issues.  He justs sniffs the food and walks away. I leave it in the dish and he nibbles on it when he gets so hungry he'll eat anything. I even put in a Stella and Chewy patty, breaking it up and mixing it in.

"Just used to wash my pooch in the kitchen sink. Had a bit of a problem attaching the plastic piece to the metal one.  But finally did. Will not look forward to disconnecting and reattaching again. I love the blue switch to turn the water off and on. The flow of water is also acceptable.  No leaks or squirts coming from the attachments.  Makes bath time so much easier.  Bought a cheaper hose on Amazon for around $7, but had to toss as the rubber connector was too small for a standard USA sink.Note: instructions mention 2 size washers when it only comes with one. But you only need one. Also, remember to shut the water off at the source before disconnecting the hose!>>> Also, the other reviewer was correct.  When you shut off the water with the blue flip, then turn back on; the water temperature changes.  Mine went from warm to cold.  My dog wanted to jump out of the sink.

"So excited to receive this as I chipped a front, lower tooth (inside of the tooth, not outside) and needed a temporary solution until I can get an appointment with my dentist.Perhaps if you have a missing filling, this will do the trick.  But for my purposes; it did not hold up.  My lower front tooth (flat ones) got chipped in the inside.  I rolled up a little bit of this as per instructions (which I had to read with a powerful magnifying glass as the print is probably a 1 font!) pushed it in the tooth; patted down with a damp q-tip, then went to bed.  It says you should not eat for 2-3 hours; so doing it just before bedtime gave it 8 hours to harden.When I awoke and brushed my tooth gently with an electric toothbrush, IT CAME OUT.  Even if I used a hand brush, I believe I would have had the same result.I replaced it the next night and avoided the tooth with the brush, but some of the material has loosened after eating.Maybe this was not made for my particular type of chip.

"I love this Nulaxy Business Pro Rechargeable Bluetooth Keyboard! It works on my Kindle Fire HD. As Amazon's Silk is similar to Android I used that as the system it works under.

The manual that comes with this unit is very detailed and easy to understand. I like the way the keys seem to ""click"" when you use them, I was afraid because it was so slim, that I wouldn't be able to feel the keys. No problem there.It took little time at all to charge this unit. I plugged it in and came back in an hour or so and it was charged.I did have a question for Aerb about the keyboard and they were prompt and clear on the explanation.

"I love these  Proimb Heat Resistant Silicone Gloves! I am an owner of the one ""ove glove"" and it was stiff and you only get one! This pair of gloves are more flexible and have little bumps everywhere to give you a better grip on anything you are taking off the grill or out of the oven.They are rated up to 425 degrees which is fairly hot. I have had no problems using them when baking or even taking things out of the microwave. It's so much easier than fumbling with a potholder or two.They are a nice red silicone and are BPA free.

"âWhen the chronicler Matthew Paris reflected on the fate of Johnâs soul twenty years after his death, he famously declared that âEngland reeks with Johnâs filthy deeds; the foulness of Hell is defiled by John.âââNo clause of the charter mentions or was intended to promote anything that we would today consider âdemocraticâ; indeed, the idea of democracy was alien and would quite possibly have been offensive to the wealthy, oligarchical, and largely  self- interested barons who opposed King John in 1215. ââMagna Cartaâ by Dan Jones continues his stories on the Plantagenets with this non- fiction book on King John and the Magna Carta. Mr. Jones writes in a way that immerses you into the past and makes it come alive.Even though the Magna Carta is looked up to around the world as a tool of democracy, Mr. Jones points out that it was not that way at all. It was so the rich barons and the church would not have to pay exorbitant taxes to the monarch.Another great tidbit I learned is that the original Magna Carta was not successful and King John after being forced to sign it continued his war with the Barons. The Pope at the time Innocent, condemned it. The barons decided the French King Louis would be a better King and joined him in trying to take over the country. King John died before the war ended and his young son took over as Henry III.  William Marshall took over as regent and was able to get the barons back on the young kingâs side. I think William Marshall was the real hero of this book and one who was steadfast in his support.I really enjoyed this book about King John and his reign. There is a lot of pre-John information and loads of stories on the Magna Carta today around the world.I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and the true stories of  governments and how they evolved.I received this book from the Penguin First to Read program for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKEK1XHKA39P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025YI#wasThisHelpful","R1PKEK1XHKA39P","A12HCPXHTX8QJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12HCPXHTX8QJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"âWe all make mistakes, but starting the Third World War would have been a rather large one. To this day, I still maintain it was not entirely my fault. But Iâm getting ahead of myself.âI have never read any of Frederick Forsythâs books but I think I have seen all the movies based on them. Having read this delightful biography I have started searching for his books to read.Mr. Forsyth has lived a life that is exciting and intriguing. The adventures he admits to and the people he has met in his life make me wonder if being a journalist was a cover for some Intelligence work. I wouldnât be surprised at all.He came from a middle class family, but his parentâs wanted him to have a well rounded education so as a boy he was sent to France to stay with a friend. By the time he got back he was able to speak fluent French and not the French taught in schools. He knew the slang and this was able to help him when he joined the RAF as the youngest pilot at age 19.He participated in wars, espionage and journalism. When he decided he really wanted to be his own man, he proposed writing a book, which became âThe Day of the Jackalâ. The publisher liked his manuscript and signed him for three more books. The rest is history.I enjoyed his story very much and found him to be self-depreciating and full of humorous stories of his own foibles in this world. Itâs refreshing to read a biography that isnât written as a canonization attempt.I highly recommend âThe Outsiderâ by Frederick Forsyth to anyone who enjoys his books and to anyone who loves a good biography warts and all.I received this book as part of the Penguin Books First to Read program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHBPPFYJZJE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZODM#wasThisHelpful","R3BHBPPFYJZJE0","A12HCPXHTX8QJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12HCPXHTX8QJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"âAlong the way, Iâll hope to convince you of a simple claim: in an increasingly complex, unpredictable world, what matters most isnât IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. Itâs how we deal with what we donât understand.ââBelief,â Flannery OâConnor once wrote, âis the engine that makes perception operate.âThe premise of this book is that while having knowledge and ability are important the most important thing is to have a thirst for more information. We must never think we know it all or we are a dead race. We must continue to strive and hunger for more breakthroughs in science, humanity and even political thinking.Just because it seems that we are doomed to repeat history doesnât mean that eventually real change can occur.I especially enjoyed the chapter on the Hand to Hand schools in Israel. There are several branches and these schools strive for diversity. They have Jews and Arabs enrolled and the students are taught Hebrew and Arabic. In a country where marrying outside your religion is not allowed this is a remarkable school.I also liked the story about Chekhov who wanted you to imagine your own endings to his stories because that is what he was trying to do. Broaden your outlook and you will continue to grow all your life.The author writes engagingly and what I was afraid would turn out to be a dry story instead got me thinking and agreeing with him along the way.I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who thinks we know all we will know, or who simply wants to learn all they can.

"âI sincerely believeâ¦that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.â Thomas JeffersonThe above quotes show why it took so long for America to have a central banking system. No one wanted to tackle the problem and this book explains the reasons behind the establishment of a banking system that would regulate and establish rules for printing money and creating credit.This is a very dry book and I found it hard to follow sometimes, but I also understand that the Federal Reserve does work and we need it to continue to be a world power and a nation that other nations look up to.This book is great for anyone interested in the history of the banking industry especially the governmentâs involvement in it. I was amazed that we had such a mickey mouse system for so many years. The Federal Reserve did not come into being until 1913.

"Rape. Execution. Blackmail. Prostitution. Comedy, thy name is Shakespeare!William Shakespeare's late-period comedy, written and staged around 1604, presents serious themes under the flimsiest gauze of humor, yet the humor oddly finds way of prevailing. With its themes of political corruption and sexual desire, ""Measure For Measure"" has a decidedly modern quality to it that gives the play more resonance today than it perhaps had when Shakespeare first wrote it.In Vienna, a duke of a decidedly pious bent leaves his city in the hands of a zealous lieutenant, Angelo. Angelo decides it's good to be duke, not only when passing death sentences to punish non-marital relations that offend his morality, but when offering clemency to the virgin sister of one of those criminals in exchange for a night of sin. Isabella must decide what is more precious, her brother's life or her own soul? And who is this strange friar with all the questions?Actually, you know pretty early on that the friar is the duke in disguise, perhaps the only card in this particular deck Shakespeare reveals early on. Most of the time, ""Measure For Measure"" has a way of surprising you, both with its sharp humor and uncomfortable subject matter. Take this reflection on the nature of death:""Thy best of rest is sleep,And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st/Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;For thou exists on many a thousand grains/That issue out of dust. (III.i.17-20)Funny? No, unless you think of the context, which is a pretend holy man offering what he imagines is succor to a condemned man, in which case it is pretty funny, in a black-humored way. ""Measure For Measure"" has a lot of black humor, and even more context-driven humor, as when we watch the Duke in his disguise hear himself described as a lech by a nobleman who can't stop himself from talking until it's well past too late.The main focus of the story, on Isabella and her devil's bargain with Angelo, is less a comedy than a satisfying dramatic treatment of true faith coming into conflict with false piety, with a good deal of exploration on the subject of love as grace or folly. One way ""Measure For Measure"" is a modern play is the way it plays this matter as ambiguously as it does, with no clear answers given, however satisfying many (including me) find the ending to be.My Signet edition comes with a useful if tendentious essay by G. Wilson Knight on ""Measure For Measure's"" Christian message, one I would agree with more if Knight didn't see the Duke as so much of a God figure. The themes of forgiveness and mercy certainly derive from the Gospels (where the title comes from), but the play is at times too dark and at others too determinedly silly to bear this point too strongly.I found it a great play, enjoyable as a comedy and gripping as a story, with some of Shakespeare's finest lines. It may be known best today for its title, but take it from me, there's a great deal more going on here than what's on the cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QOMCQAW5MXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451527151#wasThisHelpful","R27QOMCQAW5MXB","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The usual Edgar Rice Burroughs formula of solitary men carving a path through an exotic location is in play in this satisfying fantasy-adventure set in ancient Cambodia.Gordon King is a young American doctor who comes to the Cambodian jungle in search of exotic illnesses to cure. King suffers himself from wanderlust; trekking deep into the jungle, disregarding the warnings of his guide, he finds himself lost not only in space but time, to a place somewhere in Earth's past where peoples from walled cities do battle on elephants and a fearsome leper king lusts after a woman named Fou-tan whom King desires for his own.""It is hard to know where dreams end and reality begins,"" King utters at one point, trying to make sense of his new situation.That's pretty much all you know about King's situation, and all you need to. Burroughs wrote this story, originally for a pulp magazine in 1931 and later known by the title of its first novelization, ""Jungle Girl,"" as an apparent exercise in boiling down his approach to fantasy fiction in one fell swoop, rather than a series like ""Tarzan"" or ""John Carter, Warlord Of Mars."" King is a lot like John Carter, a very capable fighter both brave and crafty, except he is thrown back in time rather than out in space.It's not a great story, rife as it is with repetition and coincidence, but Burroughs does keep things moving forward. King's standoff with the leper king, Lodivarman, bristles with energy and menace, as do his encounters with a jealous lord in another city-state later on. Various twists and turns, including some exploration of secret passages, manage to keep one in suspense even if the final outcome is never in doubt.I don't think Burroughs studied up much on Cambodia before he wrote this, as his references to such things as ""howdahs,"" ""apsaras"" and ""mahouts"" definitely suggests India, as does the widespread worship of Shiva. This didn't bother me, though; at least not nearly as much as the constant tiger attacks King must fend off, four in all. None, by the way, are referred to simply as a ""tiger;"" rather, it's ""My Lord the Tiger,"" an affectation in speech used by everyone in the book which soon wears out its welcome.One thing I liked about the book is how most of the characters in it manage to be likeable in sometimes offbeat ways. When King kills a member of a war party only to be captured by his comrades, they actually compliment King on his skill and show themselves to be just men doing a job, rather than cold-blooded adversaries. This sort of sympathetic treatment of the novelâs various red-shirts throughout adds a strain of humor as well as empathy to what otherwise might have been a dry book.Overall, I found ""The Land Of Hidden Men"" an easy read and Burroughs' way with storycraft rather engaging, despite some thinness in the plot and in the lead characters. Clearly Burroughs was an author who could take a familiar idea and breathe something fresh into it, enough to pass one's time if not to be remembered long after.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVFUWI09KQ7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XT3QZG#wasThisHelpful","R1QVFUWI09KQ7V","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world of broadcast sports changed utterly on September 7, 1979, when a rough beast slouched towards Bristol, Connecticut to be born. For going on four decades, ESPN has defined how sports is processed by television viewers. Its legacy is pondered by hundreds who contributed to the network's rise in this 2011 oral history.Less a finely shaped cultural history than a compendium of colorful complaint, ""Those Guys Have All The Fun"" is a lot like the network itself: Fun for a while, then repetitive and more than a bit obnoxious. Writers James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales are more interested in spending time with the stars than using that access to tell engaging stories.The one strong takeaway you get from reading ""Those Guys..."" is that while ESPN may look like a fun place to work, the reality is that of a hard-nosed testing ground with a high body count.""ESPN is really a mentality, and unlike any other place I've ever seen,"" says ESPN executive producer Michael Mandt. ""As soon as you start out, you have to make it, either you're good enough or you don't have a job.""That the testosterone flows thick at the male-dominated network is no surprise; that it once extended to routine sexual harassment and even airings of the Playboy Channel in common offices will no doubt surprise and offend many readers. More subtly upsetting is how Mandt's quote of Darwinian certitude is borne out by the ruthless testimony of others who worked at the network. Most pride themselves on careers they personally helped end, one way or another.Even the seemingly pleasant SportsCenter anchor Chris Berman is exposed in ""Those Guys"" as a brittle egomaniac, unable to get along with those who fail to proffer the proper respect. Others snipe about how they pushed out someone who didn't fit with the elbow-heavy Bristol culture. Themes of egos amok and games-playing of a kind that has nothing to do with sports are ever-present, and offer a classic example of why visiting the kitchen of your favorite restaurant may not be a good idea.While the content is a bit monotonous and dry when you get beyond the blood trails, ""These Guys"" really suffers as a structural exercise. Nearly 750 pages of text is broken up into just seven chapters, with long sections of narrative focusing as much on personality clashes as management decisions in a fashion that sometimes breaks off roughly from one subject to the other. The worst mistake the authors make is in giving their interviews such length to explain their viewpoint, which seldom makes them likable but too often drains reader interest a page or so in.As someone who has watched ESPN most of my life, and even visited the place and talked to people there, I didn't feel like ""Those Guys"" told me anything I didn't know. A solid book as much in terms of bulk as information, it does sate the hungry appetite regarding what ESPN is all about. After reading it, you may find it harder to care about those four letters than you ever imagined.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CJ1WZZTYI95O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031604301X#wasThisHelpful","R2CJ1WZZTYI95O","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Graham Greene was deep in another book project and popping pills for the only time in his life when he dashed off this soporific spy tale in order to make some money on the side. If ""The Confidential Agent"" doesn't read like a labor of love, that's because it wasn't one.What it is is hard to say. The story concerns a character called ""D.,"" who represents the government of an unnamed nation trying to put down a rebellion. To that end, he journeys to England to sign a deal with coal-mining concerns in order to prevent rebels from doing the same. The rebels have their own agent in England. A cat-and-mouse game ensues.At the root of Greene's 1939 novel is a meditation on war and peace, as seen by someone who only can imagine the former. Travelling to England, the battle-ravaged D. imagines himself carrying the contagion of war to a nation which has only known peace for 20 years.""Wherever D. was, there was the war,"" Greene writes. ""He could never understand that people were not aware of it.""As the novel progresses, we discover D. has a point. Bad things tend to happen to those with whom he associates. The problem with ""Confidential Agent"" is twofold. Greene never makes the situations seem plausible, and he never makes you care.The central character who emerges in the narrative, other than D. himself, is spoiled rich girl Rose Cullen, a 20-year-old who falls in love with the middle-aged D. after meeting him while the two wait for a train. That may seem implausible enough, but not as much as the subsequent discovery that Rose happens to be the daughter of the British lord with whom D. hopes to sign that coal contract. D. seems an especially unlikely recipient for her affections, being fairly dour and lethargic, but he also manages to win the romantic affections of a 14-year-old hotel maid, whom D. isnât so much in love with but wants to protect.The more the story goes on, the more coincidences pile up. He keeps meeting the same people over and over, no matter where he goes. There's a modest sense of paranoia in the way the usual suspects keep cropping up which is faintly stirring, but since D. takes it all in stride, so do you. He's a character that can't even get energized at the possibility of his own execution. If he can't seem to care, why should you?Greene seems to be using the Spanish Civil War as the basis for D.'s situation (he would be serving the Loyalist, anti-Franco side), though it's a mystery why he doesn't name the country or use presumably Spanish names for his lead character and others he knows from the old country. Greene didn't name the key characters in the novel he wrote in tandem with ""Confidential Agent,"" ""The Power And The Glory,"" though at least there he named the country.Greene wrote later that he was using Benzedrine for the only time of his life, and consciously aiming for a popular success, when he wrote this. It's easy to see the former, and hard to imagine a less likely stab at the latter. What action there is is very confusing, especially as all experiences are channeled through D.'s detached perspective. Long sections at love-pitching by D.'s two female admirers are long on passion and short on sensibility. We never have the slightest clue what drives their interest.The book has a nifty feeling to it, of continuous mystery, of London presented as a kind of subterranean pit of mild depravity, and of D. as a bringer of bad luck despite his decent intentions. But ""Confidential Agent"" never coheres into anything involving. It just runs on for a while, throws a few turns at the reader, before dropping you in a sudden jumble at the end.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLH83BYG6BAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140185380#wasThisHelpful","R1GLH83BYG6BAV","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fair-minded yet highly critical account of Ronald Reagan's presidency, ""President Reagan: The Role Of A Lifetime"" presents the story of a man who manages some good things despite a disengaged and ideologically blinkered mindset.For some, the clear liberal perspective of Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon is enough to downgrade ""The Role Of A Lifetime."" It's their loss. Cannon does focus on the negative, for example giving over a fifth of his book to the ugly if cosmically insignificant Iran-Contra scandal, but his approach here and throughout is less biased than it is factual. Heâs not trying to tar Reagan with the Iran-Contra case as much as establish what he knew and understand how he could have let such a thing happen.While the two Iran-Contra chapters are overlong and repetitive, taking up a fifth of the bookâs 800-plus pages, they do get to the bookâs thesis in explaining how Reagan went ahead with an idea that seemed clever, even moral on the surface (using Israeli arms to free kidnapped Americans, and reaching out to Iranian moderates in the process) but fell apart because it was mishandled by subordinates Reagan trusted too blindly.""On balance, Reagan was a strong man, but an extraordinarily weak manager,"" Cannon writes. ""He restored public confidence in the presidency without mastering the difficult art of wielding presidential power.""Essentially thatâs the message of âThe Role Of A Lifetime,â that Reagan was less a leader than a showman propped up by his entourage, reading off index cards while conducting high-level talks and telling funny stories when he lost focus. Cannon does have positive things to say about Reagan, too. It's just that the positives always come with caveats. Factually accurate caveats, but matters of interpretation, too.Published in 1991, when Reagan was still alive and his legacy less than it has become since his death, ""Role Of A Lifetime"" is not a conventional biography or even history. It's a set of long essays, each encompassing a different aspect of Reagan as man and as president. Most focus on the problem points, such as a bungled trip to a cemetery in Germany where SS troops were buried and a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon which left 241 Marines dead and Reagan in retreat.Cannon is not a relentless faultfinder. He credits Reaganâs economic policies for whipping inflation and helping Americans across the board earn more, even at the cost of a higher national debt. Most notably, Cannon makes a strong case for Reagan's anti-nuclear vision informing the way he negotiated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, firmly but flexibly enough to reap world-changing results.Whether you share Cannonâs view of Reaganâs legacy, or whether you think he was a great president no matter what Cannon says to the contrary, âThe Role Of A Lifetimeâ puts the case against on paper in such a way you will learn from it and be entertained, maybe even inspired by a man whom you didnât think youâd ever like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMBGNIWNK51F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1891620916#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMBGNIWNK51F","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Weak in execution, flailing in resolution, and unengaging overall, ""The Afghan"" is an example of a thriller in which the author forgets such key ingredients as believability and suspense.A laptop taken from al-Qaeda's finance leader suggests a plot is in motion to rival the destruction of the World Trade Center; the challenge is finding it out before it becomes another milestone of terror. To gain intelligence, a British soldier who grew up in Iraq is given the identity of a captured Taliban leader and sent to Afghanistan to infiltrate the terrorists behind the operation. Can Mike Martin discover the nature of their operation before the terrorists discover this spy in their midst?Frederick Forsyth has been writing smart thrillers in which desperate people play for high stakes since the early 1970s; his prior novel before this 2006 effort also dealt with the realities of 9/11, and did so effectively. So I can't really understand why ""The Afghan"" fails so dismally, except maybe he's been at it so long now heâs become prone to shortcuts. Everything about ""The Afghan"" suggests a novelist in a hurry.Other reviewers point up the amazing and ridiculous coincidences that pile up in this book, as well as the odd research gaffes and the basic idiocy of the situation surrounding Martin's infiltration. They make great points, and rather than dance around spoiler alerts in echoing them, I'd like to call attention to problems I had in the way Forsyth delivers his story, which was where I think he really fails to live up to his reputation.The focus on scene-setting is entirely too heavy, with lengthy descriptions of places and people that have little bearing on the plot. One senses Forsyth padding like mad to bring his book up to the required length, and not really sweating the relevance.Where Forsyth could be filling out his pages instead is in explaining how Martin manages to get where he does, how he beguiles his enemy into thinking he is one of them. This is where the suspense of the book lies, I think. Instead, Forsyth handles this issue in a breezy, backhanded way: ""With his dark looks, full black beard and the repeated references to Allah of the truly devout, Martin convinced his host that he also was a true believer,"" is the sort of passage that crops up a lot and bespeaks laziness.The resolution of the story is where ""The Afghan"" fails most egregiously. It's a downbeat ending that accomplishes next-to-nothing, either on geopolitical terms or the book's own. The revelation of the nature of the al-Qaeda operation comes too late, is handled abstractly, and makes little sense after. The wind-up is clearly rushed as if Forsyth found he had reached a target word count and was in a hurry to get his manuscript out the door.The beginning of ""The Afghan,"" involving the al-Qaeda finance officer, does pull you in; Forsyth also has the smart idea of bringing international shipping and piracy into the mix, and develops this with flair for a chapter or two. But the slackness in the overall narrative too quickly becomes contagious. Some reviewers fault those who would look behind the curtain rather than read what's on the page. But ""The Afghan"" is the kind of book that's all too easy to second-guess, given the apparent absence of any first-guessing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCSDPFMFASSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451221834#wasThisHelpful","R3BCSDPFMFASSA","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the 1959 edition edited by Charles Neider.Mark Twain didn't exactly invent American fiction; rather he made it both marketable and respectable. It's a shame that life deprived him of the chance to do the same with his autobiography.Reviewing ""The Autobiography Of Mark Twain"" is a challenge. There are multiple versions out there, including two that predate Neider's edition and a fourth, three-volume set just recently published. Neider would seem to get the nod on the basis of digestibility (it isn't a stack of phone books like the three new volumes) and narrative flow (Neider reworked the book to follow a semblance of chronological order, which none of the others apparently do.)But it's scant pleasure reading. Some of this is on Twain, who was a sharp critic of cant and superstition and tended to harp on his bleaker views, especially late in life, where most of the material for this edition finds him.""It has always been a peculiarity of the human race that it keeps two sets of morals in stock â the private and the real, and the public and the artificial,"" he notes.Twain had some outstanding successes in his life, enough so that he could justifiably refer to himself here as the most important American author of his time, yet he seems hellbent on accentuating the negative. He frequently dwells on people who let him down. It's fun reading about Twain's disgust with Bret Harte, a much-celebrated fellow author whom Twain describes as a narcissistic deadbeat. But Twain, at least here, offers little on other luminaries he knew, like Ambrose Bierce or William Dean Howells, apparently as he can't say anything nasty about them.Sentiment is reserved here for Twain's wife, Livy, and their three daughters, upon whom Twain dotes in print. The book become choked with anguish as it finds Twain near its end mourning the loss of three of these four women, which while interspersed over a period of 13 years comes at you in rat-tat-tat fashion here, as if Twain was in limbo between their deaths.Much of this is in fact on Neider, who seems to have struggled to find a way to link up what Twain wrote in non-chronological fashion, random observations for the most part jotted down as the mood hit. The result is a book that drably itemizes boyhood classmates, but spends no time on the writing of ""The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn"" or ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.""You do get some powerful passages, Twainâs thoughts on immortality and imperialism (each in the negative) and death (which he describes several times as lifeâs only gift). He discusses the import of humor: âHumor must not professedly teach and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever.â But there are long stretches of bracken between quotable sentiments.Twain wrote an autobiography on his own subjective terms; Neider deserves credit for trying to meet readers halfway. But in its final form, this is a frustrating read.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BIU33PWU46LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060955422#wasThisHelpful","R2BIU33PWU46LZ","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tom Wolfe's ""A Man In Full"" is both an invigorating and disappointing read. Invigorating, because it brings Wolfe's gimlet eye and viscerally descriptive powers to bear on the modern American South. Disappointing, because it's less a novel than a series of clever vignettes cobbled together to create an unremarkable story.The ""man"" of the title may in fact be one of four characters, all of whom seek to attain some greater whole. They include a politically ambitious lawyer, a weaselly bank executive, a scrappy warehouse employee, and a good-old-boy real-estate tycoon who falls on hard times. The latter character, one Charlie Croker, a. k. a. ""Cap'm Charlie,"" is the fulcrum of the story as it unfolds, deep in debt yet trying to keep his house, his plantation, his hot young wife, and his exalted place in Atlanta high society.""It's a great life if you don't weaken,"" says the city's mayor near the novel's end. If there's a point to ""A Man In Full,"" beyond showcasing Wolfe's justly legendary powers of description, I guess that would be about it. Croker may be an unreconstructed bigot and a self-interested scoundrel, but he is also a force of nature, a football legend in his youth known as ""the Sixty-Minute Man"" for playing both offense and defense, and as Wolfe gives us a sense of his struggle we are meant to pull for him as a ""man in the arena"" who doesnât know when to quit. I write ""meant"" because it's not an easy thing, not until late in the book where Wolfe introduces a literal deus ex machina in Charlie's world that may work for some more than it did for me.What works for me is the chance to see Wolfe practice his legendary ""new journalism""-honed style on a new set of characters and settings, after the rousing show he made of his prior novel, ""Bonfire Of The Vanities."" If you enjoyed that novel's sensory swirl and anything-goes humor, crossed with such live-wire issues as race and sexual misconduct, well there's plenty more of the same to be found here.The best way to look at this novel is as a series of carefully-thought-out, scrupulously-researched snapshot examinations of American culture circa 1998, when ""A Man In Full"" was published. Each of the 32 chapters has its own point-of-view, its own focal points and takeaways. They don't cohere, and the whole thing gets out of hand by novel's end, with Wolfe even quoting extensively from a Stoic philosopher to explain irrational turns of plot and character. But the novel is fun most of the way through.I love how one character, the lawyer, processes such things as the gaudy ""Pizza Grenade"" neckties then favored by men in power, or how Croker ponders the overuse of the word ""paradigm.""""The damn word meant nothing at all, near as he could make out and yet it was always 'shifting,' whatever it was,"" Wolfe writes. ""In fact, that was the only thing the 'paradigm' seemed to do.""If you venerate Wolfe as one of American letters' true originals, and don't mind his brilliance put in service of a thinnish story, you will enjoy ""A Man In Full"" well enough to recommend. Just don't be expecting another masterwork.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XE106C3ODKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553381334#wasThisHelpful","R23XE106C3ODKB","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of World War II is told through detailed overviews of more than 20 of the war's most singular and decisive battles in this lavishly illustrated, full-color book.Published in 1986, the book was designed to take advantage of then-novel advances in computer graphics, especially in regard to topography. As General Sir John Hackett points out in his introduction, a flat, two-dimensional map never tells the whole story when it comes to the challenges faced in particular battles.To this end, ""Great Battles"" features illustrations such as a representation of the steep, angular mountain in Cassino, Italy which Allied forces fought to capture for months in 1944. At Kursk, we see how German tanks went into battle in an axe-shaped ""panzerkeile"" formation, which maximized firing power instead of the speed favored in their earlier, better-known ""blitzkrieg"" attacks. At Kohima, near the India-Myanmar border, British troops found their hilly redoubt shrinking against repeated Japanese attack, yet managed to hold on despite losing the highest ground, a fact clear from seeing the topographical map in this book.The most notable technological devices employed in this book may well be watercolors and paintbrush. Each battle comes with at least one, sometimes two splashy illustrations of this kind showing forces in action at key moments. While no doubt compressed and somewhat romanticized (they look as exciting as they do brutal), the depictions (by Harry Clow, going by the credits) are the book's key takeaway and do give you a sense for how the battles might have went down.The narratives are a bit lacking when it comes to nuances. We learn something about the friction among the British high command during the Battle of Britain, though its only glanced upon. The chapter on Arnhem concentrates almost exclusively on that battle, between British paratroopers and German panzer forces, rather than the surrounding campaign, Operation Market-Garden.The book has a clear English focus, being a British publication, which isnât a problem at all. The British did fight through more of the war than the Americans or even the Russians, and figured prominently in a lot of different battles. The one pull-out four-page illustration in the book does depict Omaha Beach, however.There is an impressive range of conflict contained in this book, everything from convoy attacks in the North Atlantic to the defense of Malta to the battle in the skies over England, not to mention land battles around Moscow, Guadalcanal, and El Alamein. Each chapter (some of which detail more than one battle) includes a solid textual overview explaining what happened and why it was important. Also, there are sidebars on key leaders; on the tanks, planes, or ships involved; and such fascinating secondary subjects as the layout of Hitler's bunker during the final battle for Berlin and how a British biplane managed to sink Germany's greatest battleship.There may be a case for calling ""Great Battles Of World War II"" a fine book for 12-year-olds, but if so, I was a happy 12-year-old while reading it; learning once again, in a curiously immersive way, just how terrible a conflict World War II was and how magnificently brave were those who fought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJB78CNB2NQ5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785830979#wasThisHelpful","RJB78CNB2NQ5Q","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take one dead president, add three historically-inaccurate but politically-correct protagonists, a couple of Bondian super-villains, throw in a lot of half-baked plots and counterplots, and stir until all is an impenetrable mess.This is the recipe for Timothy L. O'Brien's history-mystery novel set in the days after the American Civil War and the killing of President Abraham Lincoln. Temple McFadden is a Washington, D. C. police detective, haunted by a grim Irish childhood among other things, who interrupts a deadly assault at the B & O Railroad station. He takes custody of a package containing two diaries, one kept by Lincoln's widow and the other by his killer. He also takes on a bevy of deadly and ruthless operators who want the diaries. Can McFadden, his devoted wife Fiona, and their friend Augustus solve Lincoln's murder?After finishing the novel, I can't say I know the answer. I know how the book ended, but I'm not at all clear on what happened or why. Things happen in ""The Lincoln Conspiracy"" less for reason than for effect.A number of historical figures make their way into the pages of the book, including the famous detective Allan Pinkerton; photographer Alexander Gardner; and Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's secretary of war oft-speculated to have played a role in Lincoln's death. Unfortunately, they are cardboard caricatures seemingly plucked from their Wikipedia entries rather than developed as human beings of depth and feeling.Without revealing too much, Temple discovers that Lincoln was a victim not of desperate terrorist fury but corporate greed. This doesn't make sense considering Lincoln's pro-wealth economic policies (which O'Brien acknowledges), nor especially when the chief villain is finally revealed at the book's end. I suspect O'Brien meant the conclusion as a parody of the Lincoln-as-vampire-killer subgenre making the rounds, but it doesn't come off either for laughs or for raw excitement. It just feels wrong.Characters speak in clichÃ©. Temple is warned: ""You're putting yourself in a very perilous and untenable place."" Later, when he has a chance of killing one of the bad guys, Augustus cautions: ""Don't turn yourself into him. Don't turn yourself into a murderer.""Much dialogue consists of clumsy exposition designed to showcase O'Brien's research, rather than life being lived either then or now. The political correctness of Fiona, a liberated doctor who sees through the ignorance of her chauvinistic colleagues; and Augustus, a black scholar and codebreaker who points out such injustices as the White House being constructed by slave labor, too obviously cater to 21st-century sensibilities.There are many clams in O'Brien's storycraft, too. Pocketa Queep, in a November 2013 review, points out a couple of egregious ones, but there are many to confuse and befuddle. One Union soldier killed in the opening battle turns up later so he can be killed again. The many shifting alliances get out of hand, as do the ridiculous coincidences and mistakes that help Temple and his friends stay ahead of the odds.âLincoln Conspiracyâ left me feeling not just disappointed but cheated.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCP09HJGDD79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PFDLTK#wasThisHelpful","RJCP09HJGDD79","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A 14-year-old orphan's chance at enjoying a rare carefree summer at a boys' camp comes horribly undone in this 1989 suspense novel.All Leo Joaquim wants at Camp Friend-Indeed is a chance to belong. But his awkward background combined with bad luck quickly land him on the wrong side of most of the others in the Jeremiah cabin, including counselor Reece Hartsig. Others find things to like about Leo, including cabinmate Tiger Abernathy. Can Leo find his way into the good graces of Friend-Indeed's social order, or will the highly-competitive atmosphere keep him on the outs?âDonât screw up,â is how one of the other campers puts it to Leo. âWe donât want any more spuds in Jeremiah.âWhile likely written with younger readers in mind, ""The Night Of The Moonbow"" will resonate with adults who recognize in Leoâs experience their own adolescent difficulties fitting in to a demanding environment. As Leo tries to find his way around camp, Tryon employs details from the sleepaway camp experience of a bygone era, such as snipe hunts and talent shows, and draws from them moments of compelling angst and crisis.Leo is a protagonist you canât help but root for, especially as Tryon presents him in such an empathetic and subjective way. Thereâs tragedy in his story, with a strain of black humor, too. Just about everything the kid tries to improve his stock among his fellows backfires.Hartsig, nicknamed ""Heartless"" by the campers (though seldom to his face), makes for a marvelous heavy, so caught up in his cabin winning a trophy that he can't see Leo as anything other than a millstone. Reece has a slick manner and knows how to impress the people who run Friend-Indeed (having a rich father whoâs a camp benefactor doesn't hurt), yet there is a darker element to his personality he either can't or won't contain. His dealings with Leo give ""Night Of The Moonbow"" much of its power.There are some minor missteps. At several points, Tryon draws tangents between certain characters and the rise of Nazi Germany, which may be true to the time (there was such a thing in the United States as the German-American Bund), but deprives the narrative of some needed subtlety. The characters are pretty squarely drawn in the main, registering more as types than as people.But Tryon brings Camp Friend-Indeed to life by alternately lighting upon particular characters and camp locations in a way that creates a sense of a symbiotic whole. In some way, the camp itself may be the most compelling character in the book. It is a place of bucolic beauty, which Tryon limns with touches of nostalgia and warmth in his smooth-flowing prose. Yet it proves a cruel testing ground.Childhood canât help but summon rosy memories, but for those who recall the thorns, âNight Of The Moonbowâ is a novel that will connect on multiple levels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PIFNGUVUA2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039456006X#wasThisHelpful","R20PIFNGUVUA2E","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The fact that William Shakespeare's already got one of the most formidable bodies of work in literature doesn't stop people from wanting to add to it. Charles Hamilton uses his background as a handwriting expert, as well as his deep interest in the Bard, to advance his case for Shakespeare's authorship of a 1611 play called ""The Second Maiden's Tragedy."" My short take: It doesn't wash.The play, included in full along with various scholarly essays by Hamilton, is a bizarre story about an usurper named ""Tyrant"" who tries to win the love of a woman named ""Lady"" even though she prefers to stay with the man from whom Tyrant took the throne. Tyrant's machinations run from bribing her father to sending a force of desperadoes to abduct her back to his palace. Meanwhile, a subplot presents a man who distrusts his wife and charges his friend to prove her unfaithful.Shakespeare was guilty of a few dodgy plots, but none sink near the level of ""The Second Maiden's Tragedy,"" which is really more of in the line of Jacobean Grand Guignol than anything one might consider classical. The most memorable dramatic moment involves a lengthy love scene between Tyrant and a corpse. Killing is the main order of business; only three of the 11 main characters live to see the end of the play.Admittedly, this makes ""Second Maiden's Tragedy"" sound like perverse fun. Take it from someone who liked ""Titus Andronicus;"" it's not. The play unfolds in an artless, clumsy style. Characters change personalities on a dime. The language is rude and plain, not like Shakespeare at all, like when Tyrant, secure on his throne, bemoans the lack of the woman he loves.""There's the kingdom/Within yon valley fixed, while I stand here/Kissing false hopes upon a frozen mountain.""Hamilton's essays draw a link between the play and a rumored lost play of Shakespeare's, ""Cardenio,"" taken from a story found in Cervantes' ""Don Quixote."" Even though the play is not at all like the Cardenio story, Hamilton draws some tortured parallels in explaining how ""The Second Maiden's Tragedy"" uses ""Cardenio"" as a jumping-off point.To a matter more at the center of disbelieving a Shakespeare connection, ""The Second Maiden's Tragedy"" is really, really bad. Hamilton offers a feeble excuse: ""Certainly, 'Cardenio' is a rough tumbling from the high peak of 'The Tempest,' only a year or so earlier and one of Shakespeare's sublimest plays. Perhaps 'The Tempest' was the brilliant flare of the candle just before it gutted.""Or perhaps ""The Second Maiden's Tragedy"" is just what nearly every other scholar of the period says it is, a crude sex tragedy written by Thomas Middleton in the kind of tawdry, cynical style with which he is commonly associated and which Shakespeare wouldn't have touched with a bargepole.Even when Hamilton goes to his area of greatest expertise and shows how handwriting from the ""Second Maiden's Tragedy"" manuscript matches writing in Shakespeare's will, it's impossible not to think of some other possibility, like a common scribe. The play itself is just too poor a work, lacking even the faintest echoes of humor, tragedy, and/or subtlety to suggest the work of the Bard.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S72Y5REYFOTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0944435246#wasThisHelpful","R2S72Y5REYFOTK","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frank Sinatra wanted people to love him, but those who got too close could get burned. This 1976 biography takes stock of Sinatra's problem personality from one who experienced both the good and bad Frank yet couldn't help but care about him, warts and all.A longtime Manhattan nightlife columnist, Earl Wilson saw Sinatra when he was just starting out, singing at New York City's Paramount Theater with Tommy Dorsey's band in 1940. Wilson recalls Dorsey's road manager describing Sinatra: ""He's smart. He's human. He's a sweetheart, but he's also got a temper.""That he did, as Wilson quickly discovered. With success, Sinatra became quite demanding and high-handed. Yet he could also be generous and kind. For a time, Earl was one of Sinatra's favorite members of the press, a recipient of Sinatra scoops and gifts. Then came a sudden falling out, over something Wilson says he never understood.What he did understand was Sinatra's hard-nosed mindset, which didn't do apologies. Taking stock, âSinatraâ is less bio than character study, largely ignoring the music to focus on the personality and the people around him, including, when Sinatra would have him, Wilson himself.""Yes, Frank, unable to forget all the hurts he suffered in his down period, had developed a defiance of society that reinforced his childhood thinking and influenced the rest of his life,"" Wilson writes. ""He would forever after be the little guy fighting the system.""""Sinatra"" is a decent early examination of the title subject when he was still alive and making headlines. Except when it gets to situations involving Wilson himself, itâs not very compelling. Wilson's gossip-columnist writing style drops a lot of famous names and clever quips, which gives you some feeling for the world Sinatra moved in. It's interesting stuff, if shallow.Wilson does better work recalling Sinatra's famous romance with the tempestuous Ava Gardner. Both she and Sinatra spoke freely to Wilson about their relationship. At one point, he puts you in a hotel room with the couple circa 1953 as they cheerfully discuss Frank's prospects for a big comeback in the movie ""From Here To Eternity,"" Ava barefooted and Frank ""docile and under complete control."" Just a short while later, Frank and Ava were splitsville.Wilson's own issues with Sinatra occurred much later, in 1967, when he wrote about the latest of many Sinatra altercations in a way the singer did not like. Wilson owns up to being hurt about the cold shoulder he got as a result, which lasted the next few years. While others in the press liked to ding Sinatra; Wilson presents himself as an earnest champion, the sort of observer ready to take Sinatra's side whenever others accuse him of Mafia ties or a poor attitude.Even on the outs, Wilson makes clear here he sees Sinatra as a noble man, if brutish. In that way, ""Sinatra"" offers something of a counterweight to the more lurid bios that push Sinatra's darker side, even if it doesn't quite convince you to see the singer in the same forgiving way.""He has more likability than anybody I ever met,"" Wilson writes. ""If there's such a word as 'unlikability,' he has that, too, but when he turns on his likability, you think you must have been wrong about him ever being unpleasant.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN59MVR2I63D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451074874#wasThisHelpful","RHN59MVR2I63D","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the foundational writers for spy fiction, Eric Ambler still can grab you. This 1940 novel showcases his well-regarded strengths in establishing mood and building suspense around a deer-in-the-headlights protagonist.Graham is an easy-going English ballistics expert who finds his career in armaments on the upswing as war settles in over Europe in 1939. While on assignment in Turkey, he discovers himself at the center of international intrigue. Turkish agents desire to keep him alive. German agents wish otherwise. Can Graham make it back home on a clanky steamer amid a suspicious lot of fellow passengers?The opening chapter demonstrates just how good Ambler was at establishing character and setting. We see Graham in his opening moments aboard the Sestri Levante as it cruises along the Black Sea. A lengthy flashback leisurely introduces his situation, including the mystery woman he met at a nightclub and a bullet wound in his hand. ""All that had happened to him was that he had discovered the fear of death,"" Ambler writes.This offhanded tone becomes one of ""Journey Into Fear's"" most characteristic features. Whether it is a Turkish ally, a German adversary, or a potential love interest, Graham's situation is met at every turn with a kind of jaded indifference that actually adds to the suspense of the situation. Ambler builds interest in Graham without much apparent effort, expending more obvious energy on detailing the people around him aboard the steamer. They are a colorful lot.Mathis is a Frenchman with socialist sympathies and a shrewish wife. JosÃ© and Josette are a couple of apparent convenience, with Josette seemingly the fairest and friendliest face to the married-but-still-interested Graham. Haller is an old German scholar who is stoic and surprisingly understanding at the hostility his nationality provokes from other passengers. Kuvetli is a Turk with a noticeable interest in showing Graham around. Mavrodopoulos is a sullen, menacing character who perversely smells of roses.At bottom, the story presents Graham as a kind of everyman thrust into a dangerous situation much like everyone else would be with the coming of World War II. ""Journey Into Fear"" appeared just a year into the war, the product of a time after Germany invaded Poland but before it had invaded France. There was still a notion that World War II might not be as violent as the prior world war, but Ambler seems to have known better. In Graham, he presents us with a case study for the fragility of life to come.""He had to die sooner or later, and a bullet through the base of the skull now would be better than months of illness when he was old,"" Ambler has Graham reflect late in the book. ""Forty years was not a bad lifetime to have lived. There were many young men in Europe at that moment who would regard the attainment of such an age as an enviable achievement.""The book also holds its value as a suspense story, even if it is more in keeping with a locked-door Dame Agatha mystery than the sort of spy fiction presented in cinemas today. Every chapter leaves you impatient to start the next, with Graham's difficult situation seemingly becoming more hopeless by the minute. Yet there is a shaded humor around the edges of the book that keep matters from becoming too grim, whether it be the gruff ally Colonel Haki or the Mathis' stateroom arguments Graham hears behind a thin wall.The ending of the book comes with surprisingly suddenness; it felt almost too sudden. Perhaps that was because I was enjoying the story too much to want it to end. Regardless, I was disappointed by it, particularly a couple of loose ends. But it was a fun journey getting there, one I'd take again and thoroughly recommend. Spy fiction has changed a lot in 75 years, but ""Journey Into Fear"" remains an enjoyable hallmark.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2RN4QLM2RNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375726721#wasThisHelpful","RZ2RN4QLM2RNE","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1980s, Thomas Boswell was one of baseball's most important scribes, capturing with wit and grace the sport as it underwent a Wild-West-style makeover of growing revenue, outsized personalities, and expensive free agents. Why then is ""The Heart Of The Order"" such a disappointment?Published in 1989 and collecting pieces Boswell wrote for the Washington Post and others from 1983 to 1988, ""The Heart Of The Order"" gives you close-ups of some of baseball's biggest stars and situations during the decade which introduced the sport to cocaine trials, collusion, and lights at Wrigley Field. For this, and other things, the book should be more fun than it is.An autumnal quality is apparent immediately and runs through the pages of this book. The first item, an interview with the man known at the time as ""baseball's greatest living ballplayer,"" Joe DiMaggio, offers little substance beyond the fact that the Yankee Clipper is surprisingly modest about his long-ago accomplishments and finally content to enjoy them in public, more or less. Later pieces, particularly those in the second half of the book, spotlight other ballplayers as they get ready to say goodbye to the game after lengthy, successful runs. Some cry. Others play golf. Age claims them all.A series of short profiles on established stars and a quintet of longer pieces that sum up each season from 1984 to 1988 make up most of the rest of this book. The profiles are engaging if surprisingly shallow, testament more to Boswell's predilection for front-runners and underscoring his own relationships with them than his ability at getting something revealing.The season summaries vary in quality, with some spotlighting ephemeral social trends over the game milestones of a particular season. His 1984 write up skips over that year's World Series, for example, to question whether we have seen the end of ""a decade of romantic good luck,"" which he spends most of the piece elaborating upon.The 1988 write-up does give you some of Boswell at his best. Writing about Kirk Gibson's famous home-run in Game One of that year's World Series, Boswell notes its growing mythic quality, such as whether Gibson really hit it with one hand and how far it travelled: ""There's a palm tree, about 500 feet from home plate. If it ever dies, folks here will swear Gibson killed it.""Boswell can be fun like that, sometimes for long stretches. His famous list of 99 reasons baseball is better than football is still a hoot, even if it is outdated in places. I really enjoyed his prescient reporting on the 1986 Boston Red Sox and the heartbreak he knew was coming (he even correctly identifies from where) as well as a profile on Doyle Alexander that shows Boswell smartly dealing with a more hostile interview situation than was apparently normal for him.But overall, I was too burdened down by somber retirements, painful deaths, and an absorption for left-field trivia like newfangled exercise machines and cricket. Maybe Boswell wanted to showcase his softer, sentimental side, but I found ""Heart Of The Order"" surprisingly hard to bear.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCMLB1CRXR17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140129871#wasThisHelpful","R1SCMLB1CRXR17","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is the summer of 2011. A crushing debt crisis is about to engulf America. The brightest minds on both sides gather come together to answer the question on everyone's mind: Who gets blamed?Presenting the story of the Great American Budget Battle of 2011 even before the dust cleared, Bob Woodward provides a highly-detailed, minute-by-minute account. While impartial in most key respects, this 2012 account is notable among Woodward's many inside-the-Beltway books for its tone of incredulity, as reflected in the title.Could Republicans really have stiffed an opportunity at long-desired tax reform because they didn't want to raise income-tax rates on the upper class? Were they more willing to stick it to the poor by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits? Why didn't Speaker of the House John Boehner take an 11th-hour call from President Barack Obama if he was sincere about making a deal?Could President Obama really have thrown away a chance at a ""grand bargain"" out of a last-minute whim to make Boehner tack on $400 billion more in new revenue? Why did he go to the mattresses without a ""Plan B"" when Boehner pushed for another deal to prevent default? And why did Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid say he was willing to work on a package with the Republicans they could then take to the President if he really wasnât?The fact that everyone is party to some epic mindflusters is the ongoing theme of the book. As a series of profiles of the politically powerful, presented in stark contrast as they clash and argue, ""The Price Of Politics"" makes for an vivid read. As a case study in how government works, or doesn't work, it both infuriates and frustrates. Infuriates, because you see these people across the spectrum more concerned with scoring points off each other than accomplishing anything substantial and risk offending their bases. Frustrates, because Woodward himself is more caught up in detailing the ego games than the underlying issue of a nation hurtling toward bankruptcy. He doesn't really tell a story so much as summarize meetings and off-line discussions.The text gets crowded with the jargon of the moment: ""decoupling,"" ""unbalanced trigger,"" ""firewall,"" ""OCO,"" and ""bonus depreciation."" Woodward enjoyed access to key players on both sides, and shares their thoughts with us liberally, but a sense of context is missing. How close were the two sides, really? What was the final cost of their failure, beyond bruised egos?âThese Washington leaders were risk adverse,â Woodward sums up after 380 pages. âThere was so much effort, most of it sincere, but so little result.â I canât say I learned much more in the end than that.As usual, Woodward is writing history's first draft here. A useful exercise, but as Woodward drills down to the passions of passing moments, more ephemeral than it could or should have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA4MVXQLO09S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451651104#wasThisHelpful","R1DA4MVXQLO09S","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two best-known works by one of American fiction's least-known masters, ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" & ""The Day Of The Locust"" present a double-barreled portrait of life in a budding media age. If they put cancer-warning labels on cigarette cartons, they should put suicide-warning labels on books like this.On the East Coast, a nameless New York City newspaperman finds himself falling into a pit of despair as a ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" columnist, trying to offer pearls of consoling wisdom but coming up with only stones. ""He had given his readers many stones; so many, in fact, that he had only one left - the stone that had formed in his gut."" Trying to remove this stone with booze, sex, and Christianity only drives it deeper.On the West Coast, Tod Hackett is a scenic artist in Hollywood's dream factory, but the only dream inspiring him is his lust for a 17-year-old bit actress. She doesn't want him because he's neither rich nor powerful nor handsome, but he is persistent, and immersed enough in his sordid surroundings to mistake his rape fantasies for genuine concern.As a one-two punch, it's hard to beat this compact collection of two short novels. The one thing I might change is that they are in the wrong order. Even though ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" was published in 1933, and the much longer ""The Day Of The Locust"" six years later, I'd actually read them in reverse order. Both carry the same bleak punch, but ""The Day Of The Locust"" reads more like a conventional novel, with recognizable characters, settings, and a plot. ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" is more of a surreal depiction of philosophical despair, harder to read in many ways but somewhat prefigured by the crazed riot of people in pain that overtake ""Locust"" in its final chapter.I found ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" bracing, often powerful, yet ultimately confusing, as much in tone as in anything else; probably because I read it first.""The Day Of The Locust"" is the brighter gem. It presents us with Hollywood in its Golden Age, but focuses on the dregs: prostitutes, con artists, bookies, pimps, and crooked layabouts. It's a riveting read, in part for the way it refuses to give us anyone to root for and in part for its merciless depiction of Hollywood as a kind of wreck-filled ocean: ""Just as that imaginary body of water was a history of civilization in the form of a marine junkyard, the studio lot was one in the form of a dream dump."" Yet West's real target throughout this book is the human heart, the source of these lurid, unrealistic dreams that drive people to ruin.You want to tell yourself while reading that West was just a nattering nabob of negativism, that life can be a place of goodness and hope. Yet while you are under his singular power, you cannot quite convince yourself of this. As nihilistic probings into the heart of humanity, you can't go much deeper than these books. Or, perhaps, want to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFQ8WOA9HNW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811218228#wasThisHelpful","RZFQ8WOA9HNW5","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edgar Rice Burroughs must have been recharging his batteries when he offered up this tired, by-the-numbers effort at jungle fantasy in the midst of his run of Tarzan novels. Tarzan is remembered for the ages. Thandar, hero of this novel, is not one to remember four minutes after finishing this.He starts out one Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, a sickly young man sporting white ducks and a hacking cough. Marooned on an island civilization forgot, he connects with a beautiful native woman, gets tough, and finds new life as a panther-killing he-man. Can he adapt to his primitive jungleland, beat off savage adversaries, and lead his beloved back to his Massachusetts home?Actually a pair of linked novellas, ""The Cave Girl"" (1913) and ""The Cave Man"" (1917) read more like rough outlines than the more fully-formed work Burroughs made of Tarzan and John Carter. Instead of putting us in a setting rich in detail and character, ""The Cave Girl"" sticks us on this lush but empty-feeling island where the only humans other than Thandar and his beloved, Nadara, are nasty Neanderthals who kill on sight and utter little other than boasts and threats. Burroughs doesn't care about them; why should you?The book starts out with left-field promise. Waldo, we are told right off, is no man of brawn or action: ""He had been reared among surroundings of culture plus and ultra-intellectuality in the exclusive Back Bay home of his ancestors."" When Nadara first brings him to her village, to fight her burly, unwelcome suitors to the death, Waldo's understandable reaction is to run away, fast and far. It has the makings of a mildly fun Monty Python sketch.But then Waldo feels shame, and undertakes a six-month physical self-improvement regimen. ""It was too much to expect, he told himself, that a man should be entirely metamorphosed in a brief half year,"" Burroughs writes. But thatâs what happens. No longer Waldo, he becomes Thandar, who kills easily and often, levelling all adversaries like a Conan in tattered white trousers.The book is rife with conveniences like this, such as Waldo and Nadara overcoming their language barrier in a few paragraphs, and having detailed conversations thereafter. Or the way the only protective member of Nadara's tribe stays alive just long enough to impart valuable information about the girl to Thandar; information, it turns out, that reveals her to be as white as he, and thus okay for him to love.""The Cave Girl"" is dated like that, and in other ways, but I was mostly put off by the formulaic aspects. You feel the scene-shifting apparatus clinking into place with each fresh chapter. Worse, what happens to Thandar and Nadara doesnât thrill. Mostly it is a repetitious series of killings, broken up by an earthquake and a pirate abduction. It's the kind of book where, when the heroine is spirited off-island, the hero sails off after her with no idea where to go, gets lost at sea, scooped up by a hurricane, and dumped on an island that, as it turns out, is exactly where he needs to be.There was a moment in the middle of the second book where it seemed the story might pick up. Thandar takes command of a tribe, and introduces the concept of ruling by consent. But this is abandoned for another cheap abduction ploy, and the tribe is effectively thrown away thereafter through another of the book's many odd, cruel twists.Burroughs never excited me, or made me care. I don't think he cared, either, and wonder whatever possessed him to come back to this Waldo and his dull environs a second time, when he was doing so well with the rest of his fiction.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23JUNMQV1AQ9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZG6R4I#wasThisHelpful","R23JUNMQV1AQ9Q","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A disappointing continuation of the best-selling ""Killing"" series of popular history books co-authored by Bill O'Reilly, 2014's ""Killing Patton"" suggests that the series, profiling famous historical personages and their legendary deaths, may have run its course.George S. Patton was the hard-charging commander of the U. S. Third Army as it rolled through Western Europe and helped speed Adolf Hitler's Third Reich to its doom. His style of leadership impressed some but bothered others, especially when he groused about his superiors or his Soviet ""allies."" So when he was fatally injured in a freak accident after the war, shortly before he would have gone home to civilian life, it had the makings of a suspiciously convenient death. At least that's the contention of this book.""The two-and-a-half-ton GMC army truck that collided with the general's touring car suddenly and inexplicably veered from the opposite lane and into Patton's â as if intentionally trying to injure the general,"" O'Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard write. ""Both the man driving the truck and his two passengers quickly vanished after the incident. No criminal charges were ever filed. No accountability was ever recorded.""Was it murder? O'Reilly and Dugard suggest so, with some hedging. In addition to bringing up the famous killing methods of Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and his subordinates, they also spend quality time on the founder of the American Central Intelligence Agency, Wild Bill Donovan, who reportedly signed off on Patton's killing according a decorated war veteran who claimed to be the trigger man in a report published in the 1970s.I wasn't convinced. Worse, I was bored. The thinness of the facts presented is exceeded only by their lack of connection and the failure of the authors to present any clear, compelling reason for anyone to order the killing of a soon-to-be ex-general, however outspoken.It would be somewhat unfair to criticize wholly ""Killing Patton"" for floating the idea of Patton's assassination, since it doesn't spend a lot of time on the topic. This is odd since it supplies the book's title. Instead, the authors detail the last year of World War II in Europe, from Patton's perspective as well as a slew of other people, including Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Erwin Rommel. So much time is spent on Adolf Hitler I wondered whether the book started out being ""Killing Hitler"" before someone realized how a portrait of Hitler with OâReillyâs name over it might play on MSNBC.In earlier ""Killing"" books, there is a fair amount of rambling, but also a unique take on the subjects involved, call it ""spin,"" that makes each engaging in its own way, especially âKilling Jesus.â At their best, the ""Killing"" books cover a lot of territory in a sharp, breezy way that grips you like a good airport read, going down easy while giving you a sense of history's sweep in motion.Here, the book pings back and forth between cock-eyed conspiracy mongering and various pieces of war narrative that never cohere, everything from Hitlerâs bunker accommodations to Eisenhowerâs mistress to Franklin Rooseveltâs famous last headache. By the end, it gets like reading Wikipedia on a tequila bender. Patton himself never emerges from beyond the famous film character played by George C. Scott; he even seems to be quoting several times from the ""Patton"" movie script.I wanted to like this book, if only to annoy the right people. But I couldn't. If there was a point to ""Killing Patton,"" other than selling merchandise to a ready audience, it is not apparent.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GYV1IGQ76S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080509668X#wasThisHelpful","R24GYV1IGQ76S0","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having focused on perpetual outcasts in earlier Albany novels, William Kennedy in his 2002 novel ""Roscoe"" introduces us to a powerful figure in the city establishment. Roscoe Conway has never held elective office, but very little in Albany, New York happens without his okay.Kennedy's Albany circa 1945 is a city crammed with incident. There are police shootings, bordello busts, cockfights, blackmail, bondage and all kind of corruption which Conway in his unruffled way must sort out and keep from upsetting the gravy train Albany has become for him and his Democratic Party apparatchiks. When his best friend suddenly turns up dead, an apparent suicide, Conway must work out why it happened and what it could mean for the friend's wife, whom Conway has always loved and who is locked in a custody battle for the boy she raised as her son.""Roscoe"" is wholly sympathetic to Roscoe's outlook no matter the graft he collects or elections he steals. Basically, we are meant to see him as a good man, ""Falstaffian"" as he is described on the dust jacket. Sure, he lies like the devil, but as presented by Kennedy he's on the side of the angels, or as close to the angels as it is possible to be on this earth.""A lie, after all, is only another way of affirming the desirable,"" Conway affirms near the end of the novel. ""A live lie is better than a dead truth, and there is no ultimate wall that the creative individual cannot breach through deceit.""Or as he puts it earlier: ""Life without gravy is not life.""I wanted to like this novel more than I did. Alas, it has a few strikes against it. One is it's less self-contained than earlier Kennedy novels like ""Ironweed."" Much of the backstory requires knowledge of Kennedy's other Albany novels, particularly ""Legs,"" which dealt with the life and death of 1920s gangster Jack ""Legs"" Diamond and who pops up here basically as a flashback device.Another, the biggest as I see it, is the story goes too far along various tangents, like the threat of investigation from state Republicans, brothers whose feud over cockfight chicanery threatens the power structure, and two police officers who have a bloody falling out. There are a slew of other minor characters who make ""Roscoe"" as crowded as a Dickens novel. Kennedy can't help but entertain you with all the balls he keeps in the air, but all that you really need here in the way of story is Conway's investigation of his friend's apparent suicide, Conway's working out of his feelings about the friend's widow, and his handling of the custody case of the widow's son.When Kennedy is focused on one or more of these three things, he's brilliant, amusing, and romantic, sometimes all at once. When he's filling out another corner of his Albany portrait, he's less on point.One problem that may not be a problem is the way Kennedy embraces Conway's lifestyle of ""wretched excess,"" suggesting it is a life well-lived because it is being lived on his terms. Kennedy brings us around to Conway's way of thinking through stream-of-consciousness narratives, including a brief dream sequence that opens every chapter.

"The final book in Bob Woodward's four-volume account of President George W. Bush's wars in the Middle East is the most disappointing, both for the story it tells and for Woodward's way of telling it.The book opens in 2006. The U. S. invasion of Iraq is going badly. More than simply kicking up a hornet's nest of terrorists, the invasion has unleashed long-festering sectarian strife, particularly between the Iran-enabled Shia and the once-dominant Sunni peoples. Years of trying to get the two sides to play nice and help beat the terrorists have resulted in more bloodshed and confusion as to what the United States wants, even within the Pentagon and the State Department. Rejecting advice to pull out, Bush opts to send more forces in for one last attempt to stabilize Iraq.""I'm not a textbook player, I'm a gut player,"" Woodward quotes Bush saying, more than once.If there's a message in this book, and it's certainly there and all-but-underlined, it's that working from the gut is a bad idea, and sticking with that gut even worse.Woodward enjoyed decent access to Bush, which resumed in 2008 after Bush declined interviews for Woodward's prior volume. Others participated, too; many off the record. The result is a minute-by-minute recounting of key meetings, off-line discussions, and occasional heated confrontations. The idea of a surge, initially pushed by a former Democratic senator, Charles Robb, faces huge opposition not only from Congress but the military, who describe Iraq's combat-ridden capital, Baghdad, as ""a troop sump"" and counsel against committing what reserves they have left. But Bush takes to the idea, and drives it against fierce resistance.The story Woodward tells isn't about the surge, or its overall success. It's the process that interests him: How did decisions get made, and why weren't adjustments quicker in coming? This was the same tack he took in the prior Bush book, ""State Of Denial,"" where it was much more effective as an indictment of overall groupthink. Here he focuses on the meetings, and the disagreements. When the surge begins to succeed, it's not so much explained as acknowledged, with caveats.What ""The War Within"" needs, and doesn't get, is a view from the ground in Iraq. The only time we see anything happen there is when Bush officials visit for a dunning session with Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice warns his fate may be ""hanging from a lamppost"" if he doesn't get serious. But why did the surge, basically the insertion of five combat brigades, succeed after everything tried before failed?Woodward wants to emphasize as much as he can the basic wrongness of the initial decision to go in, and Bush's failure to recognize it as such. It's hard to argue with the point of view, especially as the undeniable success of the surge in placating Iraq's sectarian strife has proven temporary. But the book doesn't really work with the open editorial slant Woodward chooses to take. It's not his style, and it shows.The result is a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion to what remains one of the most useful multi-volume examinations of a U. S. presidential administration going through ""interesting times."" Long after the verdict of history has been rendered, Woodward's books on Bush will provide an engaging, illuminating and sobering take on one of America's most divisive presidencies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URSRC1Q1F199/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416558985#wasThisHelpful","R1URSRC1Q1F199","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know reading Shakespeare isn't supposed to be easy, but this was ridiculous.Dense Elizabethan wordplay, obscure classical references (many in Latin), a small cast of largely indistinguishable characters, and a thin plot that ends with unfunny historical-comic soliloquies and a left-field bolt of sadness, ""Love's Labour's Lost"" presents more labor than love, and left me lost.In medieval Navarre, King Ferdinand and three of his lords take a vow to self-improvement for three years, through study, fasting, and the avoidance of sleep and especially women. Just then a princess from France arrives with three ladies-in-waiting. Upon learning of the king's vow, the women opt to lay waste to the men's plans by making them fall in love and abandon their vow. Hijinks become more pronounced as the men undertake to hide their feelings from each other.The Signet Classics edition includes an introduction by John Arthos calling this ""one of Shakespeare's earliest and happiest comedies."" I get the earliest part, as it apparently was written between 1588 and 1594 and preceded only by ""A Comedy Of Errors"" in the output of the young Bard. But ""happiest""? It's not just a downbeat ending, but the stubborn obscurity and sense of Shakespeare as a young man showing off his dexterity with verbiage rather than involving himself more viscerally in the situations of his characters.It's hard not to concur with that famous Shakespearean scholar, Roger Ebert, who in reviewing a rare film adaptation back in 2000, called this ""probably the weakest of Shakespeare's plays"" and concluded: ""It's not about anything."" More friendly scholars have noted a revue-show quality to the way the play works, its various scenes designed chiefly to amuse like âSaturday Night Liveâ blackout sketches while kicking the can of the plot a few feet further. This could be okay; the dense rhyme schemes and pleasant scene-setting offer brilliance in composition if not in structure. There are wonderful lines, like when one of the lords, Berowne, extemporizes on love late in Act IV to bring his comrades to their collective senses.""It is religion to be thus forsworn/For charity itself fulfils the law,/And who can sever love from charity?""Alas, what follows in the next act makes a hash of all the good that came before. Act V, taking up nearly half the entire play, is basically where Shakespeare spins his wheels and tortures all the good will he developed, with a lot of silly word play, role reversals, and a sudden tonal shift that leads to a surprising downbeat ending where the women decide to put off the men for a year and a day to test their worthiness as mates.As one character puts it, breaking the fourth wall: ""That's too long for a play!"" Especially when it's now Act V, scene ii.Shakespeare wasnât always at his best in the final act; arguably âThe Tempestâ presents the biggest such letdown in his canon. This time itâs hard to be so put out given how uninteresting the storylines are. Except for Berowne and a Spanish lord Armado who makes for the butt of some good jokes early on, none of these characters make an impression. The women serve no driving purpose other than infecting their would-be mates with desire and then leaving them flat. The whole point of romantic comedy, at least this time around, seems to be giving Shakespeare excuse for bawdy jokes largely obscured by the mists of time and some high-toned ruminations about mortality that feel more labored than heartfelt, especially when used as an excuse to deny the audience a happy ending.I get that some people find this play compelling, though more for subtext than what's on the page directly. The problem is the business on the page repels all but the most ardent student from giving it the kind of chance it needs to get that subtext across. This is one play of Shakespeare's that seems unlikely to have reached us had another writer's name been on the title page.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0HUUJ22Z6RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451529502#wasThisHelpful","R2W0HUUJ22Z6RK","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The return in 1981 of spy fiction's biggest hero was a cause for rejoicing. But was James Bond ready for the eighties? John Gardner took a stab at updating 007, and it kinda, sorta sometimes works.The new Bond drives a SAAB, drinks Perrier, and jogs before missions. Instead of bantering with his armorer, Bond sleeps with her. His license to kill is suspended, but his old boss M makes clear he wants Bond as lethal as ever as he takes on a Scottish laird with a dangerous sideline in nuclear fission.""License Renewed"" was published in early 1981, just as Roger Moore had settled into the role of Bond on screen. That Bond's influence is visible here. Unlike the literary Bond Ian Fleming developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and more like Moore, this Bond is heavy on the wisecracks and getting busy with the ladies, even when locked in a cell with one. Gardner pushes technology to the forefront, like in a seduction scene where Bond's lover employs an erotic hologram to set the mood.As a story, it's less gripping than satisfying. While Gardner introduces his villains effectively at a posh horse race, there's no mystery for Bond to plum. The laird, Anton Murik, basically lays his plot out for Bond and the readers; the challenge becoming whether Bond can alert his superiors to the details of the threat.""Government agencies have tried, again and again, to muzzle people like me,"" Murik tells Bond. ""Now they deserve a lesson.""To supply the suspense, Gardner gets a bit too cute. Bond has a device to signal for immediate help, so naturally loses it at the critical moment. When he goes to a phone booth, one of Murik's henchmen happens upon him just as he is about to make contact. Bond's on his own, as he should be, but more from his own incompetence. Bond's entire strategy seems to involve being captured and told what the villain is planning from the villain himself, then affecting a left-field escape or two.The pluses of ""License Renewed"" include Gardner's facility with the subtleties of Bond's character. His Bond is as enjoyably fetishistic about his pleasures and hidebound in his worldview as Fleming wrote him. Like Fleming, Gardner takes some engaging descriptive detours, especially when writing about the southern French city of Perpignan where Bond finds himself on the run. At times during this part of the story, the book's highlight along with the horse race, you recall that famous ""Fleming Sweep,"" where action, real suspense, and description blend masterfully together.But the story peters out fast after that. You know that Dr. Evil line about never just shooting the hero when you can lecture him instead about the all the nuances of your diabolical plot? Well, in this case the villain even arranges for Bond to have a ringside seat. Maybe Gardner was doing his own parody?This is better than a couple of Bonds Fleming wrote, namely ""Doctor No"" and ""The Man With The Golden Gun."" The update is fun, and Bond is reintroduced effectively. The weaknesses are there, and strong enough at times to cancel some of the good feelings, but ""License Renewed"" has its pleasures, and like the Fleming Bonds, serves as an entertaining time capsule all its own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R254R2ZR6ATU0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399901183#wasThisHelpful","R254R2ZR6ATU0C","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an era where organized religion is often reflexively frowned upon, it's uplifting to read a novel presenting a priest in as positive a light as ""The Keys Of The Kingdom."" But a heroic protagonist can also be a dull one, and too often that is the case here.From a Scottish fishing town, Francis Chisholm journeys to a Spanish seminary and then the hinterlands of China, imbued with the call of his Catholic faith and employing a non-doctrinaire approach that often draws the scorn of his church superiors.""Like a blade thrust into the warmth of his life came a dread, a shrinking from that word 'religion,' a chill bewilderment that men could hate each other for worshipping the same God with different words,"" author A. J. Cronin writes of Chisholm.That dialectic between actively practicing a faith, and converting others to the same, while simultaneously avoiding excess zeal and arrogance, makes for the key struggle of this 1941 novel. Cronin finds in Chisholm a vessel for exploring his theme of humanist ecumenicism, and it is certainly a worthwhile subject...for a while.Then the reader wants for something of an engaging plot. What one gets instead is a series of incidents, capturing Chisholm at various points in his journey. He struggles with doubt, and with people who are at best sordid or base, and at worst outright villains with no redeemable characteristics. There are plenty of points of action, starting with a strange accident that deprives Chisholm of his parents, but the novel lacks for a compelling interior story to match it. Chisholm believes, because that's the way he is, taking terrible setbacks as welcome tests of faith. One seeking a bridge of understanding to who he is and what he's about will find it hard, even if they share his faith. All-too-often, he's too good to be true.Cronin's writing style lacks for engagement. It's very dry, reminding me a lot of Hermann Hesse on the other side of the theological divide, except of course Hesse is only readable to me via translation, where you have to allow for an etiolated quality. Cronin's prose feels like a translation in its flattish way, coming to life only when he describes scenes of natural wonder. Fortunately this happens fairly often, whether our hero is tending a garden or enduring the impact of a hellacious flood.At the midpoint of the novel, Chisholm arrives in China. Here, the story kicks into a higher gear. There's infighting with a proud German nun, and real fighting with a robber baron terrorizing the countryside. Chisholm struggles with one rich-living bishop, a childhood acquaintance named Anselm who lords over his professed superiority. Chisholm finds himself on better terms with an atheist doctor who joins him in serving a plague-infested village, and later by a Protestant couple who are as sincere in their faith as Chisholm is in his. This will go down well with modern readers, surely, but the question of why Chisholm still hangs in there as a Catholic is something for which we don't get the same type of compelling insight.It's a worthwhile novel, with an admirable message, but something seemed to be lacking for me. Maybe the various episodes described felt too much like set-pieces, like New Testament parables rather than recognizable steps on an immersive journey.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GB5FGWPS3GXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0829423346#wasThisHelpful","R1GB5FGWPS3GXJ","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Late in this biography of Frank Sinatra's early life and career, arranger Nelson Riddle discusses his method for recording Sinatra in the studio.""First, find the peak of the song and build the whole arrangement to that peak, pacing it as he paces himself vocally. Second, when he's moving, get the hell out of the way.""This was good advice for everyone dealing with Frank Sinatra. As James Kaplan makes clear in this 2010 account of the singer's first 39 years, which takes you from Sinatra's birth to capping one of show biz's biggest comebacks with his 1954 Oscar win, Sinatra was less a man than a force of nature, made callous both by the circumstances of his upbringing and an unquenchable desire for the spotlight and for love on his own terms.Kaplan's thesis is that Sinatra, while honorable in intent and too sensitive for his own good, didn't really care about anyone other than himself. Even the great love of his life, Ava Gardner, whose marriage to Sinatra dominates this bio's second half, was equal parts sexual narcotic and ego sop with whom true happiness was impossible. Underneath it all, it seemed, lay Sinatra's unresolved issues with his equally vital but much nastier mother, Dolly.This reeks a bit to me of dime-store Freud, which Kaplan doubles-down on by ascribing a compulsive need for projecting toughness to his henpecked father. There are times when Kaplan gets too reductive in this way, pushing oft-told anecdotes to fit his set conclusions, and even injecting some novelistic mind-reading at points in the narrative where Sinatra clearly wasn't sharing his feelings for the record.But the pluses of this book are much stronger. For one, it's a brilliant read, sweeping you off your feet from the moment you read of Sinatra's bloody birth all the way to his Oscar-night reverie. Other reviewers note a tendency toward Kitty Kelley dirt-dishing, and they are right, but Kaplan really likes his subject, too, even with his overarching thesis being what it is. The biggest negative for me is too much Ava, although Kaplan may be just reflecting the bias of his subject.With other problem personalities, it's just a matter of it being easier to ask forgiveness than permission. But Frank didn't even do apologies.""When Frank felt humiliated, his first reaction was to bark commands,"" Kaplan writes. ""If others were humiliated in the process, all the better.""I'm not quite sold on Kaplan's thesis, but it does focus the narrative quite well. The thesis of Sinatra the narcissistic user meshes with the way his career continually reinvented itself, such as the way he shed arranger Axel Stordahl - who gave the young crooner a touch of class in the 1940s but whose violin-heavy style Kaplan labels ""somnolent"" - for Riddle in the 1950s, who knew how to make Frank swing.This is a great book for someone laid up with a cold, and not for an insomniac, as it has the enviable but annoying habit of keeping you reading. Even the footnotes are like potato chips, as Kaplan drops fact nuggets like the fact his birth certificate has him down as ""Frank,"" not ""Francis,"" the latter apparently being Ava's idea. I had fun reading it, and think you will, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DDT5PKJ7WQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767924231#wasThisHelpful","R24DDT5PKJ7WQK","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Allied troops were landing in France in June, 1944, partaking in the greatest amphibious assault ever known, a key German unit was held up by French resistance forces and their English commando supporters. Max Hastings' 1981 account shines a light on that fight, and its terrible aftermath.The 2nd SS Panzer division, known as ""Das Reich,"" was one of the most fearsome units ever put into combat. After years of hard fighting on the Eastern Front, where no quarter was asked or given, nor civilians respected, their officers were put out when they found themselves relieving a besieged German garrison in Tulle, a town far from Normandy. There German soldiers and French Milice collaborators had been killed by communist French partisans, the FTP. Das Reich retaliated after the town was recaptured by hanging 99 men, all but one non-combatants.Later, after one of their senior officers was captured by another group of partisans, soldiers of Das Reich moved into the village of Oradour-sur-Glane and killed every man, woman, and child they found, 642 in all, most forced to die in a church set afire.Hastings doesn't try to excuse the Germans, but he does seek to understand the motives behind these and other killings committed, many against civilians like those at Oradour and Tulle who had nothing to do with the Resistance. War is never kind; after all, Hastings asks, how could the slayers of thousands at Dresden judge those who similarly burned just hundreds in France? Das Reich was battle-hardened by war in Russia and led by men who goaded others to show as much zeal as they did. Zeal was one thing the SS never had in short supply.Finally, it was an effective means of curtailing resistance. After Oradour, the Germans didn't have to fight through the rest of France to get to the battlefield. ""Painful though it may be for humanitarians to accept, a policy of unlimited repression can be formidably effective.""Yet also ridiculously wasteful. One of the points Hastings raises is however much the French uprisings slowed Das Reich down, it was that same policy of unlimited repression that cost the Germans where it most counted; at the front lines in Normandy. Division elements took nearly a month getting to the front lines; Hastings' book reveals how the blade of war can cut both ways when wielded improperly.""Das Reich"" offers a vivid portrayal of the French side of the conflict especially, noting myth and reality where the Resistance is concerned. The book shines brightest in delineating the tensions between the communist FTP and Gaullist forces, as well as the varying levels of activity during different points of the German occupation. Much attention is also paid to the interaction by these and other rÃ©sisants with British special forces, where larger-than-life personalities weighed heavily on the success or failure of a mission.The book doesn't cohere as well as I'd like; the path of Das Reich especially is not well described. For long sections of the narrative, its progress is left untracked. Published in 1981, when Hastings had access to several SS survivors, he admits to not pressing them too hard on who was responsible for the fates of Tulle and Oradour. Understandably, he says, they weren't that forthcoming.Were the Germans wrong for doing what they did? Hastings suggests they were, if for the logistical holdup if nothing else. Looking for a more definitive moral judgment, it's a frustrating experience that way. So, I'm sure Hastings would argue, is war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VYVOEZM0MYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760344914#wasThisHelpful","R15VYVOEZM0MYM","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If life is a game where those who meet the most interesting people win, Dan Jenkins has been running up the score for some time. One of the most unique and recognized writers of American sports, Jenkins looks back over the decades in this 2014 memoir, telling tales that often amuse though fall short on insight.The early part of ""His Ownself"" is the best; writing about growing up in Texas during the Depression, a product of a broken home. Jenkins didn't suffer much, he notes, raised as he was by an extended family that included a bickering aunt and grandmother. Jenkins presents an amusing transcript of one of their conversations, complete with stage directions.""If you don't like football and golf growing up in Texas, they drown you at an early age,"" Jenkins writes. As it turned out, those were the two sports that interested Jenkins most as a writer, becoming his main beats when he wrote for Sports Illustrated.Jenkins was one of the few writers who could talk to golf great Ben Hogan, a tough Texan if ever there was one. Jenkins devotes a couple of chapters of ""His Ownself"" explaining how the public misread Hogan's shyness for arrogance, and the facts behind Hogan's mythic comeback from a devastating auto accident in 1949.The negative on Hogan may have been that he spoiled golf for Jenkins when it came to anyone else. Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus get positive if less starry-eyed treatments. By the time Jenkins gets to Tiger Woods, he's quite withering about golf's first rock-star celebrity, taking him to task for a phony marriage and eating Fruit Loops when depressed.Jenkins doesn't have much use for today's sports heroes, and ""His Ownself"" is less fun the more he dwells upon that fact. He also blasts political correctness, unleashing a few salvos in the direction of various minority groups that made for more fun when channeled through third parties in one of his Billy Clyde Puckett novels, when it could be laughed off as good-ole-boy mimicry. Here it comes across too often as a lack of caring about anyone's feelings but his own.The biggest turnoff of ""His Ownself"" was the feeling Jenkins, for all his access to the world of sports at its highest level, lacked for curiosity. Most sports are turnoffs for him, to be dismissed with a one-liner. He didn't even like football, at least at the professional level, saying it lacks for the passion of the sport at the college level. His short takes on various Super Bowls showcases a writer limited by his own casual attitudes, even as his humor and talent for pungent observation keep you reading.The last third of the book is the worst part, as Jenkins self-consciously drops a lot of names and quotes himself saying funny things that probably were a lot funnier the first time. He does talk about his dedication to the craft of writing, even dismissing the ""casual"" tag as applied to him by one Sports Illustrated editor. But ""His Ownself"" doesn't do a lot to buttress his claim. A good memoir provides context and a sense of personal development. Reading ""His Ownself,"" you get the sense that Jenkins sprang from the womb with a lit cigarette and a martini in hand, asking when the next foursome teed off.I was amused, but disappointed. I suspect Jenkins fans will enjoy it, but like me will be left wanting for more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPO3YUCO33PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532253#wasThisHelpful","RLPO3YUCO33PH","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a fine wine, ""Proof"" requires patience to appreciate.It's no thrill ride. It takes its time spinning a rather involved case. Younger readers may find it plodding, with reason, but if you are on the other side of life like me, you may find rather stirring the perspective of a middle-aged man widower who finds in a strange case involving counterfeit booze a chance for a new lease on life, even if he has to die in the process.Those expecting another journey into the lethal world of the horse-racing set when they pick up this Dick Francis novel, be advised: There's murder in ""Proof,"" and horses, too, but the plot centers on a man with a haunted past whose involvement in a mysterious case is driven more by internal issues than anything else. Published in 1985, just after Francis had fully emerged as one of the tentpoles of his genre, it shows him willing to work away from his usual format.When we meet liquor merchant Tony Beach, he is catering at a garden party for a racehorse trainer and his wife that suddenly turns deadly from an apparent accident involving a trailer. Helping victims as best as he can, he meets a detective who eventually recruits him for help solving a case. Someone's stealing cheap whiskey from trucks, and apparently reselling it as mislabeled single-malts and premium brands. Beach knows the business, and has an educated palate. Could he help?""It's on the very edge of consultancy, and maybe beyond,"" the detective admits. This turns out a classic bit of British understatement.Francis works hard to bring out Beach's character, making it a story as much about him as about the case. It never becomes too closed-in, but it's more intimate than I expected. Beach's self-isolation, we learn early on, is not only the product of a lost love but a troubled childhood, of finding himself lacking in comparison to the war heroes and horse-riding legends in his family. Beach has grown up thinking himself a coward by comparison.""Any son, I supposed, was loved when small, before he grew up a disappointment,"" Beach tells us.This basically becomes Beach's excuse for involving himself in a case that is really none of his concern. It seems to work for the story. At least it works for me.The case itself is certainly different. Francis takes us into a world of bootleg booze, where inquiries lead to out-of-the-way establishments and racetrack caterers. It's set up well, both in terms of novelty and credibility. Most important, you are rooting for Beach all the way, and enjoy looking on as he uses his observational talents to help find leads.There is suspense, and some moments of deadly action, but for the most part ""Proof"" is a quiet mystery. Like I said, this may not be for everyone, but it worked for me. What didn't work so well is the criminal element. They are a trifle too dastardly and thick to really work in concert with the realistic structure Francis builds around them. The chief heavy employs plaster-of-Paris in Auric Goldfinger-style.But such things bothered me more after I finished. Francis wrote his books to be read in a gallop, not a canter, and that holds true even with this gentler, less-quadruped-focused entry. I think it's a fine read, an engaging mystery, and a character study to be remembered long after the whodunit part is forgotten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAED75NI2J4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042520393X#wasThisHelpful","RAED75NI2J4N","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The movie ""Metropolitan"" has a scene where a college kid explains to someone with whom he is discussing classic literature how he never reads the actual novels. Rather, he reads commentaries about them. ""That way I get the views of the novelist and the commentator,"" he explains.I thought a lot about that reading this 1988 examination of history's most famous execution before Christ. Make no mistake: ""The Trial Of Socrates"" covers the title story in depth, but the philosophy Stone draws upon, for better and worse, is most often his own.Part of the problem, as Stone points out early in the book, is no one can be exactly sure where Socrates stood, philosophically speaking. He died in Athens in 399 BC, well before the era of mass communication as Tim Rice would say, and no writings of his survive. Those second-hand accounts that do are often contradictory. Stone nevertheless comes down strongly on the idea that Socrates was an elitist enemy of democracy, and thus earned prosecution for attacking civilization's earliest exemplar of such a political order.""The dominant Greek view gave dignity to the common man,"" Stone writes. ""The Socratic view demeaned him. This was an irreconcilable divergence.""While Stone doesn't come out and hail the decision to put Socrates to death (""When Athens prosecuted Socrates, it was untrue to itself"" he avers), Stone nevertheless finds creative ways to blame the victim, noting for example his apparent sarcasm at trial. He even suggests Socrates tricked the Athenians into executing him because he hated their society so much he wanted to embarrass them.It all reads a bit like piling on, especially as the historical record on Socrates is not only unclear but sometimes contradictory. Some say he was an elitist, while others point to him as a champion of the common man. Both sides may have a point; playing with contradictions is the essence of a Socratic dialogue, after all. Besides, what comes across as anti-democratic two and a half millennia later might have been rather liberal then. Finally, if you are being put to death by citizens of what was then championed as a free and liberal society, maybe a little sarcasm is in order.What Stone does well in the book is use his argument against Socrates as a means of drawing you into the world of classic Greek culture. He tells a good story, from multiple angles, however fixed the perspective. I wish he had taken some time to present the basic facts of Socrates life and what is known in a detached, neutral way before jumping into the prosecution, but that wasn't Stone's approach to writing. He pushed arguments, and in a book about ideas, it's a useful means of going about it. Stone takes his point of view pretty far at times, even denouncing Plato's ""Gorgias"" as ""poisonous nonsense."" Yet he's never intemperate, and despite what some reviewers say here, doesn't push any then-modern political points into the equation.That was something that surprised me, actually, that Stone took the side of the state in one of history's most infamous prosecutions, given he was something of an underdog champion in his career. The book offers much food for thought that way, which is fine, provided you don't mind thinking about Stone's ideas at least as much if not more than you do those of the guy who actually drank the hemlock.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59LZHR2IZF55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B714QM#wasThisHelpful","R59LZHR2IZF55","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian character had always rested on the impact of fantastic visual presentations. This, the ninth collection of stories from Marvel's ""Savage Sword Of Conan"" magazine, offers some sumptuous eye-feasts but also reveals too much of a good thing can be bad for even the mightiest Cimmerian.Michael Fleisher was in his third year writing ""Savage Sword"" by the time these issues were originally published, November 1983-July 1984, and his once-original take on Conan was getting tired. Though Vol. 9 shows signs of fresh perspective, it also continues Fleisher's overreliance on superhero tropes and magic, not to mention convoluted storylines. Much of Conan's comic greatness had rested in the pencils of lead artist John Buscema, and four of Vol. 9's main stories include Buscema on the script side of the equation for the first time, providing plots Fleisher fleshed out into fuller stories.The Buscema-plotted stories not surprising employ brilliant visuals, like seaweed-choked ships adrift in a foggy sea, a giant vivified idol pulverizing the jungle temple where it is worshipped, and lust-filled revelers at a palace orgy presided over by an evil, nearly naked queen. With splash pages like these, you want to forgive Fleisher's tendency to lose Conan's vitality and grounded personality and lapse into goofiness.The first story, ""Death Dwarves Of Stygia,"" presents Conan with the challenge of saving his latest woman from the clutches of an island enchantress by taking on the title characters, three dwarves that by sitting on each other's shoulders transform into a hulking djin, as well as a second magic-user who can will himself to take possession of other people's bodies. Like too many of Fleisher's stories, there's nothing organic to the story, just random encounters designed to make full use of Buscema's pen. When Conan and his woman need to be shipwrecked, why settle for a simple storm when a kraken attack will do instead?""Night Of The Rat"" employs an exotic, quasi-Asian setting to good effect, and there are some good story moments mixed in that reveal Fleisher's high imagination. Here as elsewhere, the story elements often don't cohere, and there are some head-scratchers. Why would a king agree to rule under a system that places him in constant fear of sudden death, and why would a kingdom put its ruler under such constraints before he could even produce an heir?You try not to sweat stuff like that and enjoy the ride. But it adds up.There's also the reintroduction of Wrarrl, the soul-sucking humanoid with the bat-winged helm introduced in one of the issues featured in Vol. 8, back for a second crack at his least-favorite ""manling."" Wrarrl's a great visual but a pretty dull character, pretty much just defined by his lust for vengeance and his hunger for souls. Not surprisingly, Fleisher uses him as a secondary character in a predicable mystery story about an ape-bat which Conan takes on for the sake of another lovely lass, pushing him in the foreground only for a climactic battle with Conan that proves too much even for Conan to handle without the help of some timely magic.Fleisher's willingness to push the boundaries of Conan comic stories presents some striking moments. In ""When A God Lives,"" he finds himself pursued by a dogged captain of a city guard which he must make common cause with when both find themselves set upon by a savage jungle tribe. ""The Siren"" starts out as a story of Conan helping out a besieged castle, then does a nifty one-eighty into being a ghost story at sea.Several stories similarly pull the rug out from under you in Vol. 9. You even get an unusual high percentage of stories with unhappy endings. Yet Fleisher writes too much for splashy effect and dazzling visuals. Gone is the more grounded Hyborian world of Conan as created by Robert E. Howard and carefully elaborated upon by prior Marvel scribe Roy Thomas. Fleisher's Hyboria is a setting where anything can happen, and probably will. It's sometimes exciting, but hardly ever satisfying.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLH2BZUZ5MMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595826483#wasThisHelpful","RLH2BZUZ5MMN","A1NT7ED5TATUAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NT7ED5TATUAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book evaluates the artistic elements in the archeological and ancient artifacts of Bronze Age discovered in Mesopotamia, Persia, Eastern Syria and Indus Valley. There are several artifacts shown in this book with very intricate carvings and some them range from household items, figurines, jewelry, tools and inscriptions.  The carvings in chlorite or stone steatite have some unique features and they were either discovered in monumental temples or palaces or in the graves of royal families. Some carry dedicatory inscriptions to royal or divine personages. These findings demonstrate significant interest in the field of art in ancient civilizations, which thrived in Indus Valley and across Eastern Persia, and Western Central Asia. The life in each of these regions had its own distinguishing features with its organization and material culture. The author observes that some of the objects belonged to early Dynastic II and IIIA of Mesopotamia, from about 2600 to 2500 B.C. The style and iconography are consistent with that time. Despite their unique cultural identities, they also had a strong sense of trade and commerce. Trade was far and wide between Rome, Greece, Mesopotamia, Western Anatolia and the Indus Valley. Minerals, alloys and agricultural products were bought and sold. Mesopotamia imported substantial amounts of stones and other precious metals such as gold, silver and copper from Iranian plateau and Indus Valley.It is a fascinating read and I recommend this book to those readers interested archeology, ancient artifacts and early civilizations of Central and South Asia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMTB02G629TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870993658#wasThisHelpful","R1QMTB02G629TZ","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a collection essays written by American academics specializing in the history of Hollywood. It looks at the careers of several stars of the twenties and it reveals a range of social, institutional and aesthetic issues they faced. The authors illustrate strong connections and dissonances in storytelling and style of this era when movie business was still at an infant state.A brief summary of this book is as follows: Transitioning to sound movies which occurred around 1927/28 was especially hard for both studios and stars. Studios worried that the artistic element of silent movies will be lost in the sound version, and several stars lost their careers since they could not adjust to the new trend of recording their voices. Actresses like Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo made successful transitions into the sound. But Tallmadge sisters, Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Colleen Moore, Lillian Gish and Al Jolson are a few who almost lost their careers. Ramon Novarro and Marie Dressler were moderately successful. Historians often describe twenties as a decade of great affluence and hardship for varied reasons. Beginning with the end of WWI and the beginning of great depression, the decade sustained a dizzying array of changes and conflicts in American life. The constitutional amendment that granted women the right to vote, prohibition, consumer rights, and changes in dress, social behavior and sexual attitudes that clashed with traditional values. It opened a liberal culture as commercial venues, from speakeasies in Manhattanâs Greenwich Village, night clubs in Harlem, cabarets in Time Square, and Jazz clubs in Chicagoâs south side gave some visibility and acceptability of gay and lesbian life styles among rich and famous. Most studios and gossip columnists knew about such behavior among leading stars of the day but the publicity departments of major studios worked hard to keep this from pubic. It is a long list of names that includes; Alla Nazimova, Rudolph Valentino, Ramon Novarro, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Anna May Wong, Lilyan Tashman, Delores De Rio, William Haines, and many others. Lavender marriages were common and often performed with the blessings of the studios. Sensational murder cases like that of Virginia Rappe and William Desmond Taylor for which Roscoe âFattyâ Arbuckle and Mabel Normand were respectively implicated. The public perception of the movie industry grew bad and it regarded the film colony as immoral, generally corrupt and bad for families. The movie industry set up a trade association called Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) headed by Will Hays to self-impose moral clauses in the films to prevent government instituted censorship.  But this and other efforts failed since there was already a cultural and social revolution underway. Unfortunately racism was also rampant in American society and Hollywood did not abolish institutional bigotry by offering menial roles for African American and Asian actors. Al Jolson, a Jewish actor played the roles of back man on screen and limited the opportunities for black actors. Josephine Baker and Anna May Wong left the country in disgust.Despite all the negativity of film industry, Hollywood eschewed any explicit representation of sex, but remained strongly erotic and ethnocentric. The American movie industry spread rapidly across the globe and literally defeated the European film making machinery. The success was attributed partly due to some key strategies developed in Hollywood that included importing many talents, both in directorial and acting categories, from across the Atlantic. The combined effect of American and foreign talents made Hollywood a great global success. It tackled a wide variety of stories and social issues and numerous stars glamorized the success. The careers of those explored in this volume includes: Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Buster Keaton, Talmadge sisters, Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson, Clara Bow, Colleen Moore, Greta Garbo, Anna May Wong, Emil Jannings, Al Jolson, and Marie Dressler. The chapters look at some key moments in the life and works of these actors. There a great many books written exclusively about these stars but this book does a reasonable effort and cites many references to academic and non-academic publications to illustrate the factuality of the cases discussed. This is a good book and it is recommended to readers interested in silent movies and Hollywood history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13RGB0AZG3FXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UES262#wasThisHelpful","R13RGB0AZG3FXI","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little devise is amazing, it can charge two devises at the same time plus you can charge this power bank using the micro USB cable supplied with this product.  Using this gizmo is straight forward. Just plug into your computer/laptop that has a USB port. This is the16,100 mAh Amazon Basics portable power bank, currently the largest capacity battery available. You can charge any devise that has a USB port. I have charged my Chromebook, iPad, Amazon Kindle, smartphone, and my tablet. The power bank gets fully charged within couple of hours and I usually keep it connected to my laptop when I am working. It has four LED lights, and if all four are lit up that means it is fully charged. When the power is less than 10%, the LED light flashes to indicate it needs to be recharged. I have a 9W adapter which I bought from Amazon previously to charge my Kindle Fire. This adapter also charges the power bank pretty quickly, since it plugs into the mains and the output of the adapter is at 5V and 1.8A current. But this adapter is not necessary; you can use your laptop/computer that has a USB port.The product measures about 5.9 x 3.2 x 0.8 inches and weighs only about 12 ounces: This is very light and portable. I usually keep this in my laptop carrying case. Unfortunately it doesnât come with a pouch which was supplied with all previous Amazon Basics low-capacity chargers.

"The story of the lost river Sarasvati is still being debated by scholars. The current discussion includes evidences from several disciplines; archeology, hydrology, satellite imagery, geology, history and the Vedic literature: Most notably the Rigveda. Brahmanas and itihasas, particularly Mahabharata also offer additional evidence.A brief summary of the book is as follows: Geological survey in the early 19th century in states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Cholistan where river Sarasvati is known have flown during Vedic times revealed numerous ruined settlements that belonged to either the Harappan civilization or a period prior to, or after Harappan era. The author reviews tremendous amount of literature and discusses all aspects of Sarasvati; where it flew and how it may have vanished. The overwhelming evidence suggests that ecological and environmental factors led to years of drought that drove the river to complete dryness. The Vedic literature and archeology have been combined to construct the best picture for lost river Sarasvati and other tributaries that watered and gave life to Indus civilization. It is on the banks of this river where great Vedic sages may have found solace, serenity and creativity that may have transpired into the hymns of Rigveda.Rigveda showers praise in 45 hymns on Sarasvati, her name appears 72 times and three hymns are wholly dedicated to her.  She is often invoked in the company of two sister-goddesses Ila and Bharati. The waters of river Sarasvati is said to be âgreat amongst great,â âthe impetuous river,â âcreated vast,â âlimitless,â âunbroken,â âswift-moving,â and âshe surpasses in majesty and might of all other rivers.â And Sarasvati is indeed is the âmother of rivers (Sindumata).â One of the Vedic clans, the Purus, is said to have dwelled on her grassy banks during the Vedic times. In RV 2.41.16 she is called Ã¡mbitame nÃ¡dÄ«tame dÃ©vitame sÃ¡rasvati, ""Best mother, Best River, Best goddess"". RV 6.61.12 associates the Sarasvati River with the five tribes; and hymn 7.95.6 with the Paravatas and the PurusSome scholars suggest that the Vedic Sarasvati River is the same as Ghaggar-Hakra River. Rigveda 10.75 mentions Sarasvati River flowing between the Yamuna in the east and the Sutlej in the west. According to the Mahabharata, the Sarasvati dried up in a desert (at a place named Vinasana or Adarsana) after having disappeared in the desert, but reappears in few other places and finally enters into a communion with the ocean. Many legends have been woven with respect to these descriptions of Sarasvati in Mahabharata and Puranas. Several Puranas describe the Sarasvati River, and also record that the river separated into a number of lakes. In the Skanda Purana, the Sarasvati originates from the water pot of Brahma and flows from Plaksa on the Himalayas. Though Sarasvati initially emerged as a river goddess in the Vedic scriptures, in the Puranas, she was rarely associated with the river. Instead she is described as an independent goddess of knowledge, learning, wisdom, music and the arts.Currently, there has been a surge of activity due to renewed interest in finding the trail of Holy Sarasvati. In 2015, the Indian government has set up a Sarasvati Research Institute in the state of Haryana at Mughalwali, near Adibadri. A channel of about three miles long has been marked out as Sarasvati Marg. The digging at Adibadri has resulted in some positive results and raising the hopes that Sarasvati flows underground.This work is an exhaustive review of available literature and I very much enjoyed reading the book. The maps showing the path of ancient rivers and how it evolved over centuries with prehistoric settlements is nicely illustrated. Most notable settlement on its bank was Kalibangan where numerous archeological expeditions have yielded voluminous data on this mature Harappan civilization. The last chapter summarizes the book very effectively. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the trail of lost river Sarasvati, Indus valley civilization, and Rigveda.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UR1QWD7Q73L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIWTCTO#wasThisHelpful","R38UR1QWD7Q73L","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a 50-Pint electric dehumidifier that is good for an average sized basement or a large garage. The approximate coverage is about 3,000 square feet and it measures approximately 11 x 15.5 x 23.2 inches and weighs about 37 pounds. I use this machine in my basement. The setup is easy and no tools are required to get this going. This is great product to control humidity; I usually set it at 65% humidity. It has auto shut-off feature, that is when the desired humidity level is achieved it will stop, and resume automatically should the humidity level diverges from the set percentage level.The electronic LED display is neat and clear. The bucket capacity is about 12.7 pints and the LED display indicates when it is full. I empty the bucket manually and restart the operation. Another feature of this machine is that it can operate at a lower temperature of up to 41F. The noise level is acceptable, but I recommend putting it on a stable flat surface to minimize noise due to vibration. The quality of this product is good compared to other dehumidifiers I have used in the past.

"This is a major movie of the Universal Studio and it was well regarded upon its release in 1925. It was showing twice a day and packed every showing with reservations running for months. This Chaney vehicle was a big success financially for Universal Studios. One of the greatest horror-films ever made and certainly it remains at the pinnacle of all films produced during silent era. Chaney was on loan from MGM and he shattered audienceâs threshold for fear with his most grotesque face. His existence in the catacombs and dungeons beneath the Paris Opera not only terrified audiencesâ but also the pretty young actress Mary Philbin. The actual Opera House was constructed at the Universal City containing five tiers of balcony and seating 3000 extras. Norman Kerry played Raoul, the fiancÃ©e of Philbin. It was brilliantly directed by Rupert Julian, but he had to depart for the last scene since lead actor Lon Chaney did not agree with the director about the finale of the story. Edward Sedgwick was called in to shoot the final chase scene which totally engaged the theater audiences for the ultimate demise of the ugly and terrifying creature.Lon Chaney charms as a super star and the movie itself is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this to all fans of Lon Chaney and horror films in general. Anyone interested in the silent era movies and in golden age of Hollywood would also appreciate this work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UQOSQEZZ9IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CG18X6#wasThisHelpful","R25UQOSQEZZ9IO","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a big fan of Irene Dunne, but this is a lack luster movie. The highlight of the story is that Irene Dunne takes a crack at some glorious Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II songs. The movie is set in the gay 1890s in Hoboken, N.J. Dunne plays the daughter of a tavern owner, and Donald Woods plays a song writer with whom Irene Dunne gets romantically involved. In supporting role are Hugh Herbert, Ned Sparks and Louis Calhern. Bobby Connolly wrote the dance numbers and Melvyn LeRoy directed this movie.  The songs of this film are; Here am I, Why I was born, Donât ever leave me, âTwas not so long ago, We were so very young, and Out of the blue.

"This book documents the census data of about 2,200 celebrities as of April 1930. The data pertains to home address, the list of family members, age, rent or amount of purchase and if they owned a radio. The book also has information about the servants in the family. The author focusses on the personalities of entertainment industry. Others included are; sports personalities, politicians, religious leaders and other major figures during the depression era. Some individuals could not be found in census, they were gangsters, mobsters, vaudevillians, and some politicians.I was mainly interested in the address and family information of well-known Hollywood and stage actors of 1920s, but it turns out that many of them were young and lived with their parents; hence their names appear with the census information of their parents. Some actors avoided being in the census perhaps because they did not want their age listed. Examples include, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Billie Burke, Greta Garbo and a few others.The U.S. Congress violated the constitution under Section 3 and Article 1 in 1920s. They were supposed to use 1920 census data to distribute the congressional seats for each state but they had used the 1850 census data. With significant increase in population, the new apportionment to congress was conducted on 1930 data and it yielded interesting results. The house delegation of 11 states increased by 27; and 21 states lost about 21 representatives. CA and MI were the big winners, but MO lost three seats. This book is of no value to a modern day enthusiast of celebrities, but useful for someone interested in history and the beginnings of Hollywood.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFV9BCPMWS96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786434112#wasThisHelpful","RBFV9BCPMWS96","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a two-stroke gas powered machine over the last ten years and I was a bit tired of making the gas mixture, and the pull starting system was always a pain. This electrically operated system is a welcome change in this routine. Starting the machine is effortless, and it is equipped with a reduced vibration handle that minimizes operator fatigue. The 12 Amp motor is powerful enough to finish many average jobs in the yard. It measures about 19 x 9 x 12 inches and weighs less than 10 pounds.With regards to assembling the parts, you need to get the 16"" bar and chain mounted on to the machine. Then add the bar and chain oil into the oil chamber for lubrication. It is a bit of pain to get the bar and chain mounted on to the machine for the first time, but no biggie!

"Ancient India evolved in many stages, and in this book the author discusses the very early stages from 7000 B.C. to 1200 A.D that includes the earliest known human settlements in the Northwest frontier. An examination of their society, the development of early Indo-European language and a proto-Vedic culture that grew into modern Hinduism is a fascinating story of human evolution. The book discusses social, political, and religious activities during various periods in India in separate chapters for a more focused discussion. This book also documents very recent discoveries about the origin of ancient Sanskrit, the Vedic Aryans and the beginnings of the earliest writings of the sacred scriptures of Rigveda in the cradles of Indus Valley Civilization. It is fascinating to read some of the proudest moments in the history due to its success in the development of religious, spiritual and metaphysical ideas. There was also a tremendous contribution in the area of business and economics, international trade, arts, sciences, mathematics, astronomy, and literature. In ancient world, most religions, like Vedic Brahmanism were polytheistic with the exception of Buddhism and Jainism.The first section is devoted to the discussion of the history of Vedic Aryans and evolution of ancient Sanskrit and revelation of Rigveda to sages and rishis. In recent years, multidisciplinary studies in archeology, anthropology, genetics, classical philology and linguistics have shed much light into the origins of Indo-Europeans and the parent Indo-European language from two distinct groups of people; the hunter-gatherers, and the farmers/pastoralists. The author discusses some recent discoveries with regards to the origin of the Vedic Aryans and Rigveda.A brief summary of this book is as follows: There is a general consensus among archeologists that the mature Harappan period (known as Indus Valley Civilization) lasted from about 2600 B.C. to 1900 B.C.  The period 4500 to 3500 B.C is an age of transition; and 3500 to 2600 B.C is regarded as early Harappan period. The Vedic â Hindu culture began around 2000 B.C and spanned for about 1500 years unhindered, but then Buddhist and Jain teachings came to dominate the Indian society. Buddhism offered a serious challenge to the Vedic-Brahmanic culture until Adi Shankara appeared (788 - 820 A.D.) to reform and revive Hinduism from possible extinction. In spite of religious and cultural tensions between various indigenous belief systems that sprang on Indian soil, the classical civilization grew unimpeded. Much of this was as a result of the partnership of Vedic-Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, the dissenters and atheists. In fact there were plenty of atheists in Vedic India. Dissent and atheism helped intellectual progress in a purely academic fashion that helped to strengthen various schools of Indian philosophy.A decline around 1900 B.C. in the dynamics of Harappan economic system ended the civilization, and after 1700 B.C little remained of this culture. Until recently it was believed that invading Aryans destroyed the Indus culture but scholars now consider a combination of natural and socioeconomic factors led to the decline of Indus cities. This conclusion is based on geological and archeological studies. Rivers shifting the course and severe draught may have resulted in total collapse of the agriculture and affected the livelihood that depended on it.The earliest hymns of Rig-Veda were written in 1700 B.C and it was orally transmitted with extreme fidelity. The caste system helped in this practice since the upper caste Brahmins passed on it on to their children. It was written down after 500 B.C. The sixth century B.C was a period that was watershed in the history of speculative ideas. By then the Vedic society had become highly stratified and gross inequality pervading its structure. There was a sense of injustice and dissent among ordinary populace. The emergence of Buddhism and Jainism is what was necessary to combat the growing power and authority of the priestly population. Both these religions rooted in renunciation of the worldly pleasures and wealth, was trying to bring justice and social equality among sudras and vaisya population of Vedic caste hierarchy.With the fall of Mauryan Empire was accompanied by the loss of pan-Indian authority exercised from Pataliputra to Magadha. A number of competing power centers in different regions of India came into existence. The political diffusion in the post Mauryan period and the emergence of monarchies with foreign roots is interesting since historians have a huge scale of available evidence. From Royal inscriptions, the shastras, the secular literature, Buddhist religious and secular texts and the Tamil anthologies, foreign literary sources from China, Syria, Greece, Persia and Egypt gives credence to the political and commercial setting of this period. From about 200 B.C. the transition from proto-historical to historical period is clearly evident. Kushans maintained a powerful dominion over North India until at least up to 250 A.D. and their trans-Asian empire, from Aral Sea to Kashi, Eastern Iran, Afghanistan and North Western part of India, was great expanse of land and the great conduits for Indiaâs international trade.During the post-Mauryan period, in several kingdoms, Vedic Brahmanism was brought back but with some reforms in its teachings. This led to the beginning of two forms of modern Hinduism in the form of Vaishnavism and Saivism. They centered around three concepts; the supreme deity is either Vishnu or Siva and the salvation is through Lord Vishnu and Siva respectively. This is said to be achieved by the intense devotion (bhakti) of the godhead. The two traditions did not break away from Vedic Brahmanism but rejected some practices such as animal sacrifices and expressed more tolerance to lower castes.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient history, Indus Valley Civilization, the beginnings of Indo-European language and evolution of modern Hinduism. It is fascinating to read about the vast period the author focuses in his discussion with significant details. You will come across some of the proudest moments in the history of India.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMVFZLZ2JVTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMU73XY#wasThisHelpful","R3GMVFZLZ2JVTO","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 251 million years ago, life on planet earth was almost extinct. Most species were lost in a catastrophic event along with the loss of habitats for of most land and marine creatures. It took almost 100 million years for life to return to pre-existing level, and the biodiversity returned in the form of diverse marine creatures, insects, dinosaurs, mammals and plants. In this process, animals and plants took various shapes, sizes and habitats. In this book, University of Leeds professor, Paul Wignall examines the environment of Pangea when the planet was fused into one single super continent. Atmospheric and geological conditions were vastly different with few coastline habitats, limited rainfall, and the deeper part of the land uninhabitable. Huge volcanic eruptions resulted in catastrophic events that filled the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and covered the land with lava. Changes in atmospheric temperatures, acidification of the ocean and depletion of life-supporting oxygen made the planet very hostile for life. Eventually a slow and steady separation of the single land mass into five continents changed the planetâs atmosphere and created diverse environment. Species evolved in the reformed planet with a tremendous increase in diversity.Recent studies have suggested that the asteroid that hit Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago also intensified volcanic eruptions in the Deccan Plateau of India. Volcanic eruptions became twice as intense, throwing out a deadly cocktail of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The shockwaves produced at this time shook up earth and its volcanic âplumbing systemsâ around the world, creating larger magma chambers that spewed out more material. This âcombined effectâ is now believed to be responsible for wiping out dinosaurs.Sir Charles Lyell was the first geologist to propose, in the first half of the nineteenth century, that earth was formed after cataclysmic events on giant scale in the distant past. He observed that the earth was shaped by slow-moving forces still in operation today, but acting over for a very long period of time. This idea still holds good and it was quite bold for his time when it was believed in the idea of abrupt planetary changes that conforms to beliefs of the Book of Genesis.While geological and paleontological studies have been helpful to understand the formation of a habitable planet such as earth, we are still a long way to account for all factors that shaped our world. This is especially critical when NASA is investigating life on exoplanets with vigor and enthusiasm. Professor Wignallâs seminal work in this area is fascinating and should encourage readers to get interested in this field and learn more about the ancient history of our planet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18MFWYBXS9N6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD9C2S8#wasThisHelpful","R18MFWYBXS9N6R","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is full of magnificent images of butterflies and caterpillars in color, and the text is scholarly and very educational for both school children and also adults. The photographs offer a close-up view of these remarkable creatures adored for their beauty and variety. The authors explain the latest scientific discoveries on a variety of topics that include the impact of the global warming on their population; widespread use of insecticides and pesticides on butterfly and caterpillar habitat; annual migration; the evolution of beautiful patterns of butterfly wings; why male and not female suck mineral from the soil; biological features that help them navigate across continents; and how to care for the butterfly population around the globe. While stressing the biological importance, we also learn some fascinating features about them; they have eyes that can look in all directions; taste with their feet, and can migrate as much as 3,000 miles every year.This book is discussed in several chapters and one chapter is devoted each of the six families of butterflies; the swallowtails, skippers, whites and yellows, metal-marks, brush-footed butterflies, and gossamer-winged butterflies. Other chapters deal with anatomy and biology of butterfly wings, their life history, their food, the habitats of butterflies, and the ecology of moths. The book is not technical but is written for all readers interested in the biology and ecology of butterflies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM0E1A1QNENT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770855807#wasThisHelpful","R2HM0E1A1QNENT","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The film stars Joan Crawford as a wild lady Sadie Thompson and features Walter Huston as a conflicted missionary who wants to reform her, but his own morals come into question. The role of Sadie Thompson was written for Gloria Swanson, but director Lewis Milestone, relied on his instinct to cast Joan Crawford. With her curly blonde hair, thick make-up, large beauty-spot, gaudy dresses, jingling bracelets and high heels she accepted to take a shot at it in this Joseph Scheck's production. Incidentally Crawford was loaned out by MGM to United Artists to do this film. It didn't help; Rain was not well received critically or financially. The unglamorous role for Crawford, and bold story about religious hypocrisy caught depression-era audiences off guard. The film earned $538,000 in the US and Canada and $166,000 elsewhere resulting in a total loss of $198,000. Years later, critics looked at the artistic elements of the movie and began to appreciate the efforts of Joan Crawford and Walter Huston. Maxwell Anderson wrote the screenplay for this story from Somerset Maugham.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2BKAT13T3R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MDN2NCA#wasThisHelpful","R1R2BKAT13T3R4","A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a physician, I've always enjoyed reading about the journeys that people take to become doctors. Sacks, the author of Awakenings, has written a book unlike his others. This book doesn't deal so much with his patients as it does his own life. As you can see by the man sitting on the motorcycle on the cover, his story isn't what you may expect. His recent announcement that he has terminal cancer makes the book all-the-more affecting and eye-opening.Sacks vividly describes his younger years, before medical school, where he rode his bike through California valleys, tried various drugs, and struggled with his mother's issues with his homosexuality. The scenes are brilliantly described and, at times, painfully poignant. Often lonely and nomadic, the young Sacks displays the introspective and sympathetic traits that would ultimately (I believe) push him to become a ground-breaking physician, but also damage his psyche in ways I had never realized. He struggled with being falsely accused of having inappropriate relations with patients, causing him to be celibate for 35 years, and feels slighted by peers for not supporting his writing.Overall, ""On the Move"" is a fascinating autobiography by one of the greatest physician authors of our time.  If this book interests you, then I highly recommend two other books by physicians. Anthony Youn's In Stitches is a riveting memoir about medical school, at times hilarious, touching, and inspired. Sampson Davis's Living and Dying in Brick City: Stories from the Front Lines of an Inner-City E.R. is a fascinating look at medical care in the inner city.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWAPBPG1A8Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352549#wasThisHelpful","R3VWAPBPG1A8Y3","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many of us have been there. ""If I don't get into this school I will not be able to be a ----."" My parents raised me this way, as have many of yours, I assume. That is the subject of New York Times columnist Frank Bruni. But does getting into that prestigious, Ivy League school really make a difference in who you will be? Will not getting into that school prevent you from reaching your dreams and potential? Too many parents (and young adults) have believed in this faulty premise, resulting in unnecessary stress, heartache, and psychological trauma.Bruni tells the stories of many young men and women who, despite graduating from 'middle-of-the-road' schools like Arizona State University, become extremely successful adults, both personally, socially, and professionally. Story after story supports the idea that you don't have to get into 'that school' to achieve your dreams. He supports this with admissions statistics and surveys and also tackles the subject of the importance of athletics and athletics scholarships in molding a young person's future. This book roundly disproves that belief that Amy Chua's parenting style in Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is necessary to make your child successful. Far from it.I recommend this book strongly to parents of school-age children and high schoolers who are trying to decide what to do with your lives. It just may change the way you think. Reading this book made me think about Dr. Anthony Youn's In Stitches a memoir of a young man who goes through college and medical school 'mania' to become a doctor. An eye-opening and enjoyable read, especially for people interested in this subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGG136UPNLDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455532703#wasThisHelpful","R3IGG136UPNLDT","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of essays and short stories runs the gamut from laugh-out-loud hilarious to touching to exhilarating. If you are looking for a quick, light read that will get you chuckling and spitting up your drink, this is it.My favorite chapter is called ""The Original Catfish,"" and details how he decided to get back at some kids who kept making fun of him. At one point he's so upset at their teasing that, ""I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in the stall. I cried for a good ten minutes and then took a s***. There's nothing more depressing than crying while you are smelling your own s***.""Shane decides to get them back, by posing as a woman online who is interested in them. Hijinks ensue, and young Shane is then, for once, given the power to shut them down.Shane covers so many funny stories from his life, including his first kiss (at age 21 to a girl), his three year job as a salesman at a weight loss center(!), and even his experiences with astral projection.  His writing is witty, irreverent, sometimes filthy, and always inspired. I especially loved all his pop culture references, from Saved by the Bell to Gary Busey to 7th Heaven to even Sizzler and Nutter Butters.Throughout his stories, his rampant self-deprecation all-but-covers-up his underlying issues with self-image and self-esteem.  Reading ""I Hate Myselfie"" made me remember another book that's also about a young man who struggled with being considered different. Wade Rouse's At Least in the City Someone Would Hear Me Scream: Misadventures in Search of the Simple Life is quick, fun, hilarious, and, at times, touching read. It's worth a look if you like Shane.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QST4649YSEWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK38YEO#wasThisHelpful","R2QST4649YSEWQ","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadnât heard about Dr. Joseph Mercola until I was encouraged to read his newest book to read by another physician. For those of you who donât know, Dr. Mercola is a family physician and founder of the wellness website Mercola.com. Heâs been in the forefront of wellness medicine for years, and has written this book as a summary of his beliefs on how to be healthy. He gives nine simple rules for causing your body to heal better, age slower, and lead a healthier and happier life.Some of his rules include: getting more direct sunlight to combat Vitamin D deficiency, drinking more pure water (and avoiding sugary drinks), exercising in short bursts vs. long cardio marathons, eating more vegetables in all its forms, and eating more high quality fats (like lean meats and olives). The rules are simple, easy to follow, and (for the most part) have a scientific basis.  It truly is amazing how the foods we eat and the drugs we take can have a profound impact on our physiological well-being. However, if I had one (tiny) complaint about the book, itâs that some of the recommendations are actually too simple (like laughing).For those of you who are looking for an easy-to-read guide to living a healthy life, while limiting the use of prescription medications and avoiding environmental toxins, this is a good book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVPOTF8CRFSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553417975#wasThisHelpful","RXVPOTF8CRFSM","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jauhar is the author of Intern: A Doctor's Initiation, a classic memoir about residency in a big-city hospital. In his latest memoir, Doctored, Jauhar is now an attending cardiologist. He quickly learns that the actual practice of medicine in today's society is nothing like he (or we) imagined that it was, should be, and could be. The issues of practicing medicine in today's rapidly evolving climate are neither simple nor have obvious answers.Physician income issues are prominent in this book. Doctors are paid less than they were paid ten years ago, causing many to even moonlight to make ends meet. The incredible advances in medical technology, which save countless more lives today than 50 years ago, also are a part of the rapid increase in health care expenditure. The reliance that today's physicians have on testing has caused many of them to lose the art of being a physician, the laying of hands to diagnose.Throughout this book Jauhar wrestles with the various complicated issues that today's doctors face in the practice of medicine like those above. With the massive overhauling of the health care system today, his book comes at a very appropriate time. Medicine is changing, whether physicians like it or not. As a practicing physician, I highly recommend this book for medical students and physicians, in addition to anyone interested in today's medicine and medical memoirs.Two other recent medical memoirs to check out are Dr. Danielle Ofri's fantastic Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue and Dr. Sampson Davis' affecting Living and Dying in Brick City: Stories from the Front Lines of an Inner-City E.R.. They will also open your eyes to the psyche of today's doctors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2ITOJ277F1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHCC5T2#wasThisHelpful","R3J2ITOJ277F1R","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time author Peter Levin has written an enjoyable, thoroughly engrossing novel that spans continents, generations, and major worldwide historical events.  Beginning with the murder of Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Levin exposes us to a story of intrigue, lost love, and mystery.  True events are melded with fictional ones to create a story that I found informative, fun, and interesting.  It was obviously a 'labor of love' by the author, and surprising that a book of its caliber wasn't published by a major publishing house.  But I suppose the readers are the real winners here, as the Kindle book is a real bargain.  Fans of Tom Clancy, Eric Larson, and Laura Hillenbrand will enjoy this one.  I look forward to Levin's next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0R9XNZJ1S60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YH9KIO#wasThisHelpful","R3K0R9XNZJ1S60","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Good Talk, Dad"" is a very well written book (composed in a inquire-and-respond style, like letters or emails back-and-forth) that covers many topics between father and son Bill and Willie Geist, both TV hosts and best-selling authors.  These topics range from summer camp, sex, sports, food, religion, and even (one of my favorite subjects) professional wrestling.  I found myself laughing out loud at many of the funny details of their family stories.  As both a father and son these stories really struck a chord in me.  It made me think of my own father, who lives quite far from me now.But, like life, it's not all laughs and fun.  The book does get serious and quite poignant when Bill (the father) reveals he has Parkinson's.  His tales about Vietnam were quite sobering as well, but effectively balanced out the lighter stories from Willie.  Even if you haven't seen either of the Geists on TV, this is a great book to buy for your Dad for Father's Day.  One small warning: there are a few mild off-color jokes, so be aware.This book follows in the footsteps of one of my other favorite father-son books, Sh*t My Dad Says. If you haven't read this, it's a riot.  A short, quick read, it will have you laughing within minutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OK1YZUOOFGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455547220#wasThisHelpful","R5OK1YZUOOFGP","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Dr. Scott Rivkees' describes his many experiences as a resident at Mass General Hospital, possibly the most famous (and intense) hospitals in the country.  Throughout his narrative, he introduces us to many of the patients who touched him and taught him how to be an empathetic, caring physician.  It's basically The House of God for today and a great read for anyone considering becoming a doctor.  Whereas many medical memoirs are overly serious and refuse to see the light side of medicine, Rivkees deftly balances humor and seriousness, just like medicine in real life.

"Dr. David Agus, a professor of medicine and engineering at USC, is also the author of the best-selling but controversial book The End of Illness.  His latest, ""A Short Guide To A Long Life,"" is best-described as an easy-to-read, cliff-notes version of his recommendations for improving your health.  A pioneer in cancer research, his tips have a heavy bent towards preventing cancer, but also cover general wellness.  If you've read his first book but found it a bit dense, then you will gobble this book up.As a physician, I agree with most of his recommendations.  While some of his tips may be controversial, for the most part Agus stays in line with current medical thought.  Most of his recommendations aren't ground-breaking but make sense.  Drink a glass of wine with dinner. Eat cold water fish at least 3 times a week.  Practice good hygiene. Get a dog. Avoid sunburns.  Smile.  That being said, some of his recommendations regarding medications (like fat-reducing statins) should be discussed with your doctor first.Like Dr. Oz on TV (and his books), Agus does a fantastic job presenting medical advice in a fashion that is easy for any reader to understand and appreciate.  That is where this book really shines.  I plan to have copies in my waiting room for my patients to digest since it's such a quick, easy read.Another quick and extremely enjoyable read by a physician is Dr. Anthony Youn's In Stitches. This memoir shows what it's like to go through medical school and become a doctor, in eye-opening detail.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in medicine and health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2NK6KNM7DWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBVDCO#wasThisHelpful","R2R2NK6KNM7DWX","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was always a fan of Jimmy Connors when growing up.  Jimmy was, as he titles his book, the consummate Outsider.  After reading the memoirs of both Andre Agassi and John McEnroe, both of which didn't present Connors in the best light, I was very interested to read Jimmy's side of it.  This book doesn't disappoint in that Jimmy lays it all out there.  He describes his thoughts during various matches, both big and small, and his opinions of players such as Agassi, McEnroe, and Lendl.  He doesn't pull any punches, and even explains why he was the only person in the locker room who didn't clap for Agassi after his last match.  If I have one complaint about this book, it's that the writing (I assume by a ghostwriter) isn't the smoothest.  It's full of clichÃ©s and choppy sentences.  That being written, if you are a fan of tennis in the 80s and 90s, you will enjoy this book immensely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0GQ4AFFFVIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061242993#wasThisHelpful","R2P0GQ4AFFFVIP","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a physician, I'm always interested in reading books by other doctors.  Dr. Jessica Wu is a prominent celebrity dermatologist based in Beverly Hills.  I've seen her on several television programs, and thought I'd pick up this book.  Dr. Wu basically gives a very detailed description of how you can look younger, healthier, and improve your skin by changing what you eat.  She explains the glycemic index, and how eating foods too high in sugar can result in inflammation, leading to acne, dry skin, and wrinkles.  Throughout the book she includes celebrity stories, and how certain celebs have improved their complexion and appearance by following certain dietary guidelines.This book is complete, well-written, entertaining, and chock-full of useful information with a scientific basis.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and am going to rethink how I eat as I continue to get older.If you enjoy this book, I recommend that you consider 7 Years Younger: The Revolutionary 7-Week Anti-Aging Plan, a recent best-seller by the editors of Good Housekeeping.  It's an information-packed reference full of tips to look younger, be healthier, and reduce aging.  It's very easy to read, and a great resource.I also recommend Dr. Jennifer Ashton's Your Body Beautiful: Clockstopping Secrets to Staying Healthy, Strong, and Sexy in Your 30s, 40s, and Beyond.  It's a great guide for my women patients to be healthier, look better, and reduce their risk of age-related medical problems.

"I was really excited to read this book, given my recent interest in The Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season.  So I tore into World War Z with a lot of interest, buying it on my Kindle and reading it on a vacation.  The first part was definitely interesting and kept my attention.  It covered the beginning of the Zombie plague, with scores of interviews from people who experienced it, in their words.  Then I kept reading and reading.The book is a collection of interviews, all about different people and how they witnessed parts of the Zombie apocalypse.  As I read on, I figured out that the entire book is interviews.  There is a distinct lack of continuity because of this.  It basically feels like watching dozens of small news interviews, where people tell their side of the story.  Because of this, it's very difficult to actually connect or care about the people in the book.  There are so many characters, that don't return, that it almost felt like reading a bunch of news reports.It got old so I quit reading.  If he had written a coherent narrative, with recurring characters, I bet I would have really enjoyed it.  Instead, I think I'll try The Walking Dead:  Compendium One.  I know the character development there is really good.

The book starts out well, with a good amount of action and suspense.  The story begins right away, with the history of Masada and the hiding of a secret gospel.  Fast forward to the present, with archaeologists and military personnel, earthquakes and priests.  Things were chugging along, very interesting and entertaining.Then came the outlandish stuff.  Hyena-people, werewolves, and priests that grow fangs.  It was too out-there for me.  Too much fantasy.  I'm ok to suspend disbelief for a while, but this wasn't what I was looking for.

"""Parenting: Illustrated With Crappy Pictures"" is an absolute blast of a read.  For those of you new to Amber Dusick, she's a mom who writes and illustrates the wildly popular Crappy Pictures website, where she shares candid, pull-no-punches, funny stories about parenthood, complete with crude drawings.  She's taken about 30% of the classic old material from her site and combined it with 70% new material for this book.  And let me tell you: It's a hoot.I devoured this book in one sitting.  As a parent myself, the stories made me laugh-out-loud and remember those times when it seemed that poo, pee, and feeding were the three most important things in the world.  As parents it seemed our entire lives revolved around them.  I believe Dusick's stories will resonate with parents everywhere, with subjects like trying to juggle feeding an infant while eating your own dinner, sleepless nights with nursing children and snoring husbands, and trying to regain some intimacy with the kids nearby.The drawings are crude, even by South Park standards, but enhance the stories since it's obvious that the person who experienced the story is actually drawing it.  Interestingly, the drawings and stories can each stand on their own, but create such a better hilarious portrait when combined.  If you'd like to get a preview of what her style is, I strongly suggest that you check out her blog online.  You just might get hooked and keep coming back for more.Let's Pretend This Never Happened, written by the Bloggess Jenny Lawson, is another book worth looking at.  This best-seller is also based on a wildly popular blog and is a fun, fast read.  Fans of Crappy Pictures will probably enjoy this one too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IO5ML5TFKQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892748#wasThisHelpful","R2IO5ML5TFKQU","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a physician who's read Dr. Parnia's other book What Happens When We Die with great interest.  Dr. Parnia is the director of the Awake study, an intriguing and ground-breaking study of Near Death Experiences.  Basically, he sets up posterboards pointing upward toward the ceiling in patient rooms to find out if the people who claim to have an out-of-body experience can recall what was on the posterboards.  The idea is that some people claim to float upwards as they see themselves being worked on by the doctors and nurses, and even claim to recall actual events while they were being resuscitated.  So it makes sense then, that if this really occurred they's be able to recall what was on the posterboards pointing up at them, right?His previous book was disappointing because he was so early in the study that they didn't have results.  It was filled with filler about NDE's and various people's experiences with them.  So it was with great interest that I picked up this book, written several years later with a plethora of findings, right?? Wrong!Spoiler alert!  Although he put up 1000 posterboards in various hospitals across the country they had ZERO patients who had an out-of-body experience in one of the rooms.  Zip.  Nada.  So I felt the book was basically filled with filler about CPR, NDE's, and his personal experiences.Nothing groundbreaking here.  I'd like my money back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QB4S10E6FFVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062080601#wasThisHelpful","R1QB4S10E6FFVY","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlie Leduff is a former New York Times reporter who decided to move back home to Detroit, Michigan and become a writer for the ailing Detroit News.  This book follows his journey back to the city he grew up in, and exposes so many of the terrible things happening in the Motor City.  LeDuff follows several threads, including the city's neglect of their fire department, the Kwame Kilpatrick scandal, the Monica Conyers scandal, the killing of a local imam believed (erroneously?) to be a terrorist, and many, many sad stories of poverty and hopelessness in the city.  Throughout he intersperses personal stories and his family history.  While the stories are indeed heartbreaking, they don't come across as exploitive.  Also, LeDuff doesn't get on his high horse and pretend he has the answers.  Overall, this is a very well-written book by a reporter to reports what he sees in Detroit.  And it ain't pretty.  A must read.If you read this book, check out Andrew Moore: Detroit Disassembled for a photographic view of this broken down city.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PH13QPHSZ915/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205345#wasThisHelpful","R1PH13QPHSZ915","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Heart and the Fist"" is an interesting memoir by a Navy Seal and self-described humanitarian.  It tells his story about growing up, progresses to college, then military training, and finally war.  The unique thing about this book is that he focuses on his belief that proper compassion sometimes must include use of might.  Overall, I'd say I agree with his beliefs.  The writing is crisp, yet somewhat simple and easy to read.  It's a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the military, especially the Navy.If you enjoy this book, I also recommend No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden, the memoir about one of the Navy Seals involved in the Osama Bin Laden raid and killing.  It's also a quick, easy-to-read book that should interest anyone interested in the military.  A more gritty read is Sebastian Junger's WAR, a journalist's view of the war on terror as fought in Afghanistan.  Both of these books are worthwhile reads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0ALEFOI7HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SLWOSY#wasThisHelpful","R2R0ALEFOI7HC","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Living and Dying in Brick City"" is an eye-opening book by Dr. Sampson Davis, previously best known for co-writing ""The Pact.""  In ""The Pact,"" Dr. Davis described the bond that he made with two other kids with whom he grew up in the inner city.  They decided that they would all rise out of their difficult surroundings and become physicians, and all three have lived up to that promise.  In ""Living and Dying"" Dr. Davis returns back home to Newark as an Emergency Room attending physician, where he works in Beth Israel Hospital, a tough inner city hospital that sees its share of drama and tragedies.  He tells the gritty and affecting stories of many of his memorable patients.  Their stories are at times uplifting and at times sad reminders of how our society sometimes fails its least fortunate.One fascinating story involved a young man who arrived in the ER with critical gunshot wounds.  He was transported to the ICU where he died.  Dr. Davis recognized his name on the patient list as a kid who accompanied him when they committed an armed robbery at the age of 17.  Unlike Dr. Davis, who went on to success as a physician, this young man went in a completely different direction.  It's stories like these that make one realize the small forks in the road that can determine our lives.Unlike most other medical memoirs, this book also gives practical advice to people who are trapped in the difficult situations of many of the patients in his stories.  It's a wake-up call for people to learn about the difficulties and failings of health care in major urban settings.  I really enjoyed it.This book is the latest in what I consider a recent renaissance of medical memoirs.Twelve Patients by Dr. Eric Manheimer tells the stories of patients at the famed Bellevue Hospital, written by the former medical director there.  The author pulls no punches in describing these affecting and often unusual patients in sometimes terrifying detail.  Very recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2052XXCZ3IU5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069947#wasThisHelpful","R2052XXCZ3IU5D","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched the first season of ""Falling Skies"" and was hoping to watch a series that would grip my attention like ""Lost"" did.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  While the idea of the show is interesting, a post-apocalyptic world where aliens take over the earth, the execution of the story isn't necessarily riveting.  The acting is OK, scripts are OK, which combines to a so-so show.  I recommend that you catch it on free On Demand if you want to try it.Instead, try checking out The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season.

"Ever since the series ""Lost"" concluded several years ago, I've searched for another show that could grasp my attention and interest in the same intense fashion.  Until now, no series I've watched has held a candle to that classic show.  ""V"", ""Flash Forward,"" ""Terra Nova,"" and most recently ""Revolution"" have all failed to live up to (any) hype.  Then came ""The Walking Dead.""  Out of nowhere this series grips you from the first episode and doesn't let up.  It's suspenseful, harrowing, emotional, and absolutely riveting.  I can't stop watching.If you buy the first season, be warned that it's only several episodes long.  Do yourself a favor and purchase The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season too.

"Written as a work of fiction, ""Total Frat Move"" tells the story of Townes Prescott III, from his arriving to college as a freshman and moving into his dorm room, through pledging and rush, and then becoming a college senior and fraternity star.  It's based on the wildly popular website which bears the same name.  TFM can be best-described as the newest entry of fratire, a genre most well-known by the Tucker Max book I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell (movie tie-in): with 16 page photo insert.  Fans of Tucker will most definitely enjoy this one.  It's full of drinking, womanizing, debauchery, and other pursuits that may be offensive to the timid, but a blast to read for others.  Fans of ""Animal House"" will also enjoy it, as it is a modern re-telling of the tale of college fraternity life.I never lived the insane lifestyle depicted here, but always envied the fraternity studs like Prescott becomes.  For that reason, I've really enjoyed books like TFM, since it opens up a world of male debauchery that I've never really experienced.  The action begins in the first chapter, where Prescott, literally six hours into his college experience, get loaded on Keystone beers and shots, then is blindfolded and brought to a massive toga party.  The chapter includes sex, drugs, and even the cops, in a story that is every college male freshman's dream (but not often the reality). Each chapter also includes anonymous hilarious photos of college kids involved in the same activities of that chapter.The writing in this book is fast, easy-to-read, and does contain a good amount of cursing.  Be warned.  Overall it's a fun read and worth picking up for anyone who's been through the college fraternity experience or wishes they would have.If you like books like TFM, I would also recommend one other that is a great companion.  Neil Strauss wrote The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists, which tells the absolutely fascinating story of how he went from being a loser with women to the ultimate pick-up artist.  It's a classic, especially for guys like me who could never figure out how certain guys are so successful with attracting women.  This one holds the key.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5XIP1VG3XP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455515035#wasThisHelpful","R1G5XIP1VG3XP8","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fan of Marvel comics, I was very excited to read this book.  I read most of my comics back in the 80's and have lost track with what's happened in the Marvel universe since then.  This book was helpful in informing me on major storylines, but does not give the reader insightful knowledge of the actual events in the Marvel universe. It more covers the behind-the-scenes stuff, like writers or artists coming or going.  That being said, it is a beautiful book that is great for a coffee table or to display.  As long as you don't use it to get re-acquainted with the Marvel universe, it's a great buy.I bought this book with Marvel Encyclopedia, another large, hardcover book that is great for the coffee table.

"I was a big comics reader when I was younger.  Although I don't read them all that often anymore, my interest in Marvel Comics has persisted into my adult years.  For this reason, I was interested in reading this book.  I remember many of the old names, not just Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  There are significant sections on Jim Shooter, John Romita, and John Buscema, among many, many others.  The author is so complete with his research, that my only critique is that the book is quite long and maybe even over-detailed.  He mentions many of the personal issues that certain writers and artists had back in the day, and other details that may have been left out.This is a great read for the big fan of Marvel Comics.  I'm not so sure it would appeal to a casual reader, though.  If you were a big fan of Marvel comics and would like to reread some of the old books, I highly recommend that you check out some of the Omnibuses that Marvel has put out.  Here are some good ones: Uncanny X-Men Omnibus (v. 1) The Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus - Volume 2 . The Omnibuses, unlike the old ""Essential"" series, are in color on nice paper.

"Erio Weiner is a 'seeker.'  Although he was born into a Jewish family, he never really considered himself having a relationship with the divine.  After a minor illness lands him in the hospital, a nurse asked him, ""Have you found your God yet?""  This drove him onto a journey to discover other faiths, as a way to find 'his' God.  Suffering from a deep depression, Weiner travelled throughout the globe to learn about other religions, hoping that one just might 'stick.'He commits a chapter to each of several religions, including Sufism, Buddhism, and even the obsure Raelism.  While I believe that much of his journeys are serious spiritual quests, he never hesitates to insert his self-deprecating humor into it.  Overall, I found the book to be light, interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying.  I wish he would have delved more seriously into some controversial arenas like fundamental Islam.  But the aim of the book is more entertainment than education, I suppose.If you are a seeker, I recommend that you consider reading Rob Bell's Velvet Elvis.  It's a groundbreaking book about the new directions today's Christian churches are taking.

"""Food, Inc."" is a very interesting documentary that examines the current state of mass-produced food in today's society.  We eat every day, but do we really know where our food comes from?  This movie explores how government supported mass-produced food is making us all less healthy, in addition to negatively impacting our environment and the animals that become our hamburgers, sandwiches, and steaks.  It's an exhaustive (but not exhausting) documentary that should be viewed by everyone.  My only complaint is that the movie could have been edited a little bit, as it got a tad long in the end.If you enjoy this movie, I strongly recommend that you read Fast Food Nation.

"""On Call"" is a very good memoir about residency by Dr. Emily Transue.  As a physician myself, I found that it faithfully depicts the world of the resident with meaning, empathy, and compassion.  The patient stories are interesting, including both good and bad medical decision making.  The reason why I don't give this book five stars, is that it seemed to be missing something. It's a solid read, but not an instant classic, like some others of the genre.  I give this book a good recommendation for anyone who is considering becoming a doctor.If you are considering buying this book, I would also highly recommend two others that do have that extra special 'something.'  Complications by Dr. Atul Gawande is a classic set of essays by one of the best medical essayists ever.  It's a must read for anyone interested in the surgical profession.God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine is also a very worthwhile read for anyone interested in the medical profession.

"I read this book on the advice of a friend.  Now, I'm a happily married professional, but had heard that this book was fun.  I bought it used off Amazon, since I didn't want to spend the money on a faux-leather version of it.  I found the book to be a very interesting read.  It tells the story of Neil Strauss, a ghostwriter and magazine writer, who never had a way with women.  He decided to look into the underground world of pickup artists, and eventually transformed himself into Style, one of the best pickup artists in the world.  He gives the juicy details behind his encounters with normal women and celebs like Courtney Love and Britney Spears.  I wish I would have had a book like this when I was much younger.  It gives pointers on how to talk with women and meet them in bars.Overall, though, it's an eye-opening look at how well-educated men can use tactics of manipulation to get women to sleep with them.  You may not like what they do, but apparently it works.  Not that I would know.If you enjoy the Game, then I recommend that you read Tucker Max's I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell (movie tie-in): with 16 page photo insert.

"PHI is a wonderful book by Giulio Tononi that explores our consciousness.  Told as a story with Galileo as the main character, PHI reveals the secrets behind our consciousness, as if exploring unknown worlds.  Along the way, Galileo meets many wise people who explain to him the origin of consciousness, how our conscious mind works, what happens to our consciousness while we sleep, and even explores the question of whether animals have conscious minds like humans.The biggest surprise in this book is the multitude of gorgeous painting, photos, and images spread throughout.  These images really make the book stand out from anything I've read recently.  As a physician, the anatomy lessons brought me back to my neuroscience course in medical school, and the many paintings harkened back to my art history classes back in college.

"I'm a big fan of Saturday Night Live, especially the era when I grew up in the 80's and early 90's with Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley.  I really enjoyed a lot of the insights in this book about all the backstage goings-on at this amazing show.  This book was written as a series of quotes from various performers and writers involved with the program.  Because of this, the narrative was somewhat disjointed, and never achieved a level where I just couldn't stop reading.  I found myself skipping sections from writers whom I had no idea who they were.There is a lot of good information here, but like shopping at T.J. Maxx, you have to sift through the unnecessary stuff to find the occasional gem.This book reminded me of the very similarly written book by former NBC President Warren Littlefield Top of the Rock: Inside the Rise and Fall of Must See TV.  Both are written as a series of quotes from many interviews, and suffer similar faults (in my opinion).

"I was very interested to read Zuckoff's ""Lost in Shangri-La.""  I'm a sucker for non-fiction accounts about people doing things or surviving experiences that are foreign to me.  For this reason, I picked up this book with a great deal of excitement.  I was sorely disappointed.I was looking forward to reading about how a group of plane crash survivors braved through a foreign jungle, fighting animals and cannibals, to eventually make their way back to civilization.  The reviews and book jacket made it read like a thrilling adventure in the heart of the jungle, with lots of action and suspense.  What I got was something much different.Spoiler alert!  Do not read on if you don't want some of the book spoiled for you!The survivors don't have to trek that far before they make it to a clearing. They basically stay there until they are rescued.  The natives are not restless, nor all that cannibalistic.  Basically, they are simple, kind people who take an interest in helping the survivors.  They are eventually rescued by a daring glider-related escape.  This was one of the only truly entertaining parts of the book for me.TThere was also too much background information on people that didn't need to be told.  We didn't need to know all the background info (birthplace, former jobs, marital status, etc.) on the press corps that covered the story, or other characters that weren't survivors.  I ended up skipping through much of it to get to the end.If you are really into true-life adventure stories, I highly recommend that you check out Jon Krakauer's books Into Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) and Into the Wild.  They are gripping, tightly told, and exhilarating reads.  Another interesting read is The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, about a man who journeys into the Amazon.  I recommend these much more than Zuckoff's book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11CRJAXT0MD2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061988359#wasThisHelpful","R11CRJAXT0MD2O","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monkey Mind is a memoir written from a person who suffers terrible anxiety.  Although I'm not a really anxious person, I'm a physician who treats many anxious patients.  Reading this book gave me some insight into how some people really suffer from anxiety.  The inability to react calmly in situations that others might just blow off was eye-opening to me.  Overall, a well-written book filled with self-deprecating humor.I enjoy reading books where people can poke fun at themselves.  For this reason, Drop Dead Healthy: One Man's Humble Quest for Bodily Perfection is a great companion to this book.  Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity is another recent funny one.  Stein, a writer for TIME, may be the best writer today at self-deprecating male humor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFSAWOZF608A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439177309#wasThisHelpful","R2KFSAWOZF608A","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Twelve Patients"" is an engrossing book written by the former medical director of Bellevue Hospital, one of the most famous (and oldest) public hospitals in the country. Manheimer details the lives of several of his most interesting patients, in often lurid and terrifying detail.  He pulls no punches in his descriptions of these patients, and doesn't flinch in his portrayal of the often depressing social situations involved.  Many of these patients have tragic background stories that have lead them through the doors at Bellevue, sometimes their only refuge from horrific circumstances.  Through these stories, Manheimer also tackles the subjects of hospital politics and our country's broken healthcare system.As a physician I found his book fascinating and truthful.  Those of us in the medical field all have our own stories of patients who've left their marks on us, some good and some bad.  Manheimer's great strength is that he doesn't try to sugarcoat the stories or his feelings about his patients.  One patient was described as ""evil.""  How often have you read a book by a physician that described a patient this way?Medical memoirs appear to be in a renaissance.  Manheimer's book joins several recent physician memoirs that I've really enjoyed.  The most recent one, God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine is a fine read that really gets to the heart and soul of medicine.  It's touching and thought-provoking.Confessions of a Surgeon: The Good, the Bad, and the Complicated...Life Behind the O.R. Doors is a controversial book where a surgeon reveals his true feelings about his field, good and bad.  After reading this book, you may not like the doctor, but you'll see his point of view.  I highly recommend all these books for anyone interested in medical memoirs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUH3OMI9UFYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455503886#wasThisHelpful","RJUH3OMI9UFYA","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished reading Ready Player One and absolutely loved it. The book is a definite departure from anything I've read, probably since Cormac McCarthy's The Road (Oprah's Book Club). I really enjoyed both of these immensely.Ready Player One follows the story of Wade, aka his avatar Parzival, a video game playing nerd who spends most of his life in the Oasis, a virtual world of the future. Young Wade, like many of his peers, spends more time in the Oasis than in real life, since in the Oasis he's not an unpopular and poor nerd, but a somewhat powerful virtual being.Parzival then undergoes a quest for treasure, that takes him on many twists and turns, including falling in love with another avatar whom he's never actually met in real life. The book contains tons of references to movies, video games, computers, and television shows from years ago. Some of these had previously been lost in the back reaches of my memory, like the old Ultraman Japanese TV show.If you were a computer and video-game playing nerd like me, then you will love this book. It's a fast, fun read that is completely unexpected. I look forward to a movie adaptation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PY8ZA2BTU4D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307887448#wasThisHelpful","R1PY8ZA2BTU4D4","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tarascon Pocket Pharacopoeia is a must buy for all medical students and residents.  It is a guide to all the major medications on the market today, and a great quick reference for both trade and generic names.  I bought this as an intern and used it virtually every day.  It's very easy to look up any medication to see the dosing, other names, and category it fits into.  As a practicing physician, I use it every day even now.  Very highly recommended.The other handbook that I recommend, that fits great in your pocket is The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy 2012 (Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy (Sanford)).  This is a great guide to antibiotic dosing and choice.  I have used this nearly every day both as a resident and practicing physician.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FDT973UV11D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449624243#wasThisHelpful","R13FDT973UV11D","A3QRBGBSCXV1GH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QRBGBSCXV1GH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These sunglasses are super cute and unbelievably lightweight. When you open them, you'll definitely have a hard time believing that they are wooden because of their look, feel and texture. They have that classic 1985 look that all the hipsters will love. They'll go great for just about any outfit and have lenses that are dark enough to block out not only the sun but the haters too.

"This thing looks like a space alien but it runs like a dream so I named it Magic Mike and it has it's own compartment in my vanity now. It's made of see through, soft jelly like latex for ease of use and is a good job for toy beginners or old pros. It's just for the G-spot, so don't throw away King Kong just yet, you're going to need that later. This bad boy is completely waterproof (as I would imagine it would have to be) so you can take it in the shower with you. This massager takes one AA battery and the bottom screws onto it where you can switch it on and off.

It's made of silicone so it's waterproof EXCEPT for at the bottom - that 36 frequency switch will not take immersion of any kind, and since it charges by USB port for convenient internet porn viewing, it's probably not a good idea to get it too juicy or you might get a vibration you won't enjoy.I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIG448YEZQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V8COY8#wasThisHelpful","R3VIG448YEZQT","A2WDV8ACOG5LSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WDV8ACOG5LSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a seven inch toy, this thing is a classy little beast. It came in a nice box to start with and didn't have a rubbery odor when I opened it. It's not veiny and gross like some vibrators that I've seen. It's nice and smooth and conforms nicely, but the shape can be slightly intimidating although the soft casing is a plus. The bottom piece snaps off easy and the vibrator takes 2 AAA batteries. I like that it's quiet, but some of the settings are louder than others.

"My a-hole cat gets litter everywhere and while I suspect he's doing it on purpose, I hadn't found a good way to stop him till this bad boy showed up. The mat is huge - about 36x24 so it fit very well leading up to the covered box with the lip just underneath.The Ultimate Large Cat Litter Mat went right under the box and immediately in the box went the cat. He sprayed his litter out of the box and anything that landed on the mat was trapped right away. He scratched at the litter on the mat and got upset when the litter stayed so he pissed on it and I had to take it out to clean it. It was easy to clean, I just hosed it off and it didn't hold the spray odor. When I replaced the mat by the litter box, the cat tried to paw the mat away from the box and couldn't because of the heavy rubber backing that's on it. After hours of scratching at the mat he finally gave up and went away, and the problem has been solved!I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion; these thoughts are completely my own.

"These types of rings have been all the rage lately. I can see why because they serve a unique purpose for the person wearing them and they are an affordable way to still wear a ring without worry of losing an expensive wedding ring.  I like these because I can wear them in place of my wedding band set when I go out and work in the yard or other activities that I think I might either injure myself from wearing the ring or lose it.I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBSX96W6788G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MT93SI#wasThisHelpful","R2XBSX96W6788G","A2WDV8ACOG5LSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WDV8ACOG5LSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the better device vehicle mounts I have used. It doesn't utilize a suction cup or your air vents in order to mount. Instead it uses the CD slot in your vehicle, which is great because who listens to CD's anymore anyway? That little slot in your dash was just taking up space you weren't using anyway right? It comes with extra pads of different sizes to make it more sturdy when installing. The installation is pretty simple though, you just fit the appropriate end into the CD slot and then use the lever on the bottom to easily tighten it into place. It's a one button mechanism that locks the device into place. It sits at the right height for me and the device operates well while the vehicle is in motion.

"This Aloe Vera gel is just the ingredient I needed to add into all of my home made skin care concoctions. Aloe is known for its healing properties, have you ever had a sun burn? Try using some Aloe Vera gel, it will cool the sensation of the burn and promote healing without blistering and peeling. A sunburn causes the skin to literally burn and then fall off. Sounds pretty gross but it can also be pretty painful as well. Using this product can significantly reduce the pain and promote the healing process.

It's difficult to feel comfortable with BIG companies' brand name cough and cold meds that have changed, been removed from store shelves or placed behind the druggist' counters because of ingredients that can cause side effects.When I think of my reliance on those popular brand name cough and cold formulas during my kids' childhood, I'm wondering what their future holds in their later adult years.

"Newest addition to the family, Pappy, is a rescued stray older Papillion recovering from significant dental surgery provided by the Humane Society. The brand name food samples provided by the local shelter were his recent diet there and highly recommended. He wasn't impressed and I was distressed because he wasn't eating and losing weight. His mouth was still tender and refused to let anyone near it.I fed him home cooked food, wet food and wet food mixed with kibbles to get him to eat and regain some of the weight he lost since dental surgery.  I jumped at the chance to try the 4 pound sample of  Wellness CORE Natural Grain-Free Dry Food. It's made in the USA, has an excellent positive record without recalls which put my mind at ease.The vet recommended keeping kibble in Pappy's diet despite the number of teeth removed to preserve the few remaining ones. She recommended the same brand name food the shelter uses that Pappy doesn't like. This made trialing a sample a win:win for us both. Pappy LOVES these kibbles dry or mixed with wet food. He eats heartily without digestive issues, his demeanor is upbeat as he regains his health. I can't ask for much more than that.UPDATE: I really like the small triangular kibbles.

"I was provided a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Inside Game by Collette West is the latest story that takes us inside the world of the New York Kings. This time around, superstar Drake Shultz has been popped for PEDs. As a result the team forces him to work with a professional who can help him with his condition. Eva Sloane is the sexy substance abuse counselor who comes into his life and from there the sparks fly.I really enjoyed this story. The dynamics between the bad boy and good girl were exciting, but the story delves deeper into the problems we all face when avoiding issues from our past and the consequences they can have in our future. Overall this was an engaging love story filled with heat, laughs, and a few tears that kept me invested through the end.

"What a terrific case. My Samsung Galaxy S6 fit perfectly into the Fascination case. It's a little on the bulky side, but it provides superior protection, which is excellent for me as I have a tendency to punish my phones. I've tested it on several various situations such as dropping it on the ground and soaking in water and each time its made it through unscathed. The design itself is bright and attractive.The thing I really liked about this product is the Touch Pen that comes with it. It minimizes my need to use my fingers and makes everything easier to navigate.Five stars for a a great product that delivers in all areas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNUK4PINVG8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8I89UI#wasThisHelpful","R2PNUK4PINVG8D","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided a free version of this product in exchange for an honest review. I've tested a number of selfie sticks overs the years.

Secondly, the QuickSnap has a perfect range to get quality pictures with the added bonus of being able to adjust the head by up to 270 degrees. This give you a superior chance to get pics from just about every angle. I also appreciate that it folds back up easily and can be easily tucked away for lightweight and non-bulky transport.

"We have a playful Akita German Shepherd mix who gets excited a little too easily. At the same time, we also live in a strict HOA that frowns on dogs that make too much noise. After some complaints, I had already been looking into different options that might help her curtail her excessive barking, when I came upon the Petiner Electronic No Bark Control Dog Training Collar.I'm thrilled to say that within the first week, we noticed a big difference. She's a good-sized dog, and the nice thing about the Petiner product is that it has an adjustable sensitivity range that fits dogs of varying sizes. The collar itself is also lightweight and not bulky, so it really doesn't add any additional strain on Shadow. Overall, this is a tremendous product not only for the quick results, but the value you receive with the price.

"I was provided a free product in exchange for an honest review. My son and I love to work out together in our garage. In the past we simply used one of our phones to play music during the workouts, but it was never really the most satisfactory option. The Roverbeats T3 model has been a tremendous upgrade! The product seamlessly connected with Samsung Galaxy 6 and immediately we were enjoying a highly-upgraded sound experience. While the product itself is small, the sound quality is high and it is easily portable to take with you on the go or move into different room as needed. Its also lightweight weighing only 6 ounces, so its pretty handy if you wants to pack it in a backpack or a purse for music on the go. I also like the fact that if I'm streaming music and a call comes in, I can take my calls from the device by using the built-in microphone. Finally, off of a single charge, I got a little over six hours of battery life from the product, which was more than enough. Overall, this is a small, but powerful product that will truly enhance your audio pleasure.

"In the first book of the Universe Eventual series, the authors deliver a well-written sci-fi story that sets the stage for an even larger epic. Set on the remote space colony of Stephen's Point, the story follows a pair of young protagonists,Theo and Selena, who will play important roles in both manning the crew of the Chimera and saving the dying colony. While each character has a unique journey that brings them to the Chimera, both face tests and trials along the way that help to flesh out why they are so important, even though both are seemingly misfits. With a strong sense of both plotting and character development, the writers keep you engaged throughout the story with excellent pacing, witty dialogue, and imaginative scenarios. I was thoroughly immersed in the story and invested in the characters who I wanted to see succeed. Perhaps the one drawback I had was with the storylines that the book would alternate between Theo and Selena, which didn't seem to be happening in the same real-time. However, that was only a minor quibble and one I understand the authors probably made to keep you engaged in both characters' drama. Overall though if you are a fan of YA science fiction, you will certainly enjoy this tale. Five stars for a fun and creative adventure set in outer space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2CP656PYNOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXOLP40#wasThisHelpful","R3A2CP656PYNOL","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the OXO Good Grips Magnetic All-Purpose Clips for my wife, who is a teacher. She always has a variety of school reminders, paperwork, artwork, bills, etc that often ends up strewn all over the kitchen or office. Now though, she can keep them neatly grouped in an easy to remember place like the fridge. The grips themselves are large and attractive ranging in a colorful assortment of blue, red, green, and yellow. They are powerful enough to clutch a good-sized amount of papers, bills, or documents in a single clip. However, as mentioned in several of the other reviews, the magnets are quite weak and if you try to use them to hold anything with any significant amount of weight, they will not stay in place very well.

"As a disclaimer, I will first say I was provided a free month's sample of the HCF product in exchange for an honest review. With most types of supplements, it's easy to tell if you are getting results. For instance, with fat burners, you can clearly judge the results in a tangible way. When it comes to so-called ""brain supplements"" though, the results can often be more subjective, so I tend to fall on the skeptical side with these products.. The claims made by F & Q are that the HCF supplement naturally nourishes your brain and is different from other similar products which are basically glorified multivitamins. I'm not someone who suffers from depression or needs any kind of happiness boost, however, I do work in a stressful and demanding industry that often can leave you feeling dazed or frazzled after a hectic day. So being able to improve mental acuity and focus is something that would be extremely helpful. I took the supplements for a month and here is what I can honestly report. I do feel like I have been more focused with a heightened level of concentration since taking the supplement. Perhaps  a big part of this has been that I've slept better over this period of time which in turns leads to a feeling of overall refreshment and clarity. Therefore, I would have to conclude that HCF is a very helpful brain supplement. Since I can not 100% report that it delivers on all it claims is possible, i will refrain from providing a five star review. Still, an honest four star review for noticeable improvement in more restful sleep and mental clarity seems to fit. I will continue to evaluate this product in the coming months to see the long-term results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36T4V6U759DAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAIY5US#wasThisHelpful","R36T4V6U759DAN","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hoard by Neil Grimmett is tense and detailed thriller that bounces between eras to tell the story of the consequences of a horrifying accident and the ramifications it has on those involved and various family members. Set in the world of the Royal Ordnance Factory, the story follows the lives of characters involved in a tragic explosion in 1951 and how it affects them decades later. Though the story is slow-moving and the pacing could use some work, Grimmett masterfully paints the picture of a grim and dangerous world of those who perform work of this nature with his descriptive language and ability to set the scene. The author is also skilled at evoking a creepy feeling of dread with the situations he places his characters within. I would highly recommend this book for fans of historical fiction who enjoy moody thrillers filled with intriguing characters and situations. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and have no problem offering a five star rating for quality storytelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZMA8DIW5WL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLPNF8#wasThisHelpful","R1GZMA8DIW5WL3","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are a fan of the GoT series, this is a must have volume for your collection.  It offers a lot of background information about the history of Westeros, as well as the various Houses and Kingdoms. In particular, I most enjoyed the in-depth history of House Targaryen and how they came to rule Westeros. Must of this information had previously been presented in the short stories, but I liked having it all in one cohesive volume. Overall, if you are looking to get more of your GoT fix, while waiting the agonizingly long wait for the future books to hopefully arrive, this is a great read. It will offer a lot more to flesh out the various backstories of your favorite characters and families, while also fleshing out the various rivalries that exist and how they came to be.

"Overall, this is an exceptional battery case for the IPhone 6 Plus. With a phone this big, it can burn through battery life quickly, but with the addition of the Trianium battery case, you can effectively double your battery life. To me, that is a huge asset! However, it's also important to have a durable case that offers some modicum of protection and this delivers on all counts. It feel solid and has even endured some ""abuse"" from its owner already and come through with flying colors. Sometimes when you slip your phone into a new battery case or protective sleeve, you run the risk of a poor fit that obscures access to buttons or the camera, but this is not an issue with the Trianium product. I would give this the highest possible recommendation for anyone who needs a superior battery case for their IPhone 6 Plus.

"One of the best books I have read all year. Not only does the author provide a look at the origins of Amazon and how it came to be one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world, but it also provides a glimpse into the origins of Jeff Bezos. I was fascinated to see what made him tick and impressed by the insight into his enduring vision for Amazon and how he handled the obstacles that stood in his way. I was particularly captivated by the ruthless tactics the company employed to both survive against the likes of Walmart, Apple, and the giants of the book publishing industry.

While I cannot state for a fact that this product will regrow lost hair, my hair feels fuller and thicker, and I notice much less lost hair in my tub. So any product that can help me combat the ravages of time is one I will continue to stock in my arsenal. Five stars for a noticeable improvement in the thickness of my hair over the course of one month.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LMXV3QZV9FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYXSF00#wasThisHelpful","R37LMXV3QZV9FC","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm someone that has always been self-concious of my teeth. Unfortunately, years of drinking soda have taken their toll. I decided to try out the Shine Whitening system to see if I could get some results without having to resort to costly dental procedures. I used the first round of treatments for almost two weeks and I'm happy to say that I have seen some definite improvement. The tray itself is comfortable and easy to manage, while the gel does its work. I have heard that whitening systems can often result in tooth sensitivity or soreness, but so far I have experienced none of that. Overall, for the price and the quick results, I would rate this an excellent product that will help you improve your smile in a very reasonable time period.

"I was provided a sample of the product for an honest review. Though I'm not a huge tea fan, I have long heard of the benefits of Matcha as a nutritional superfood. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, when using this product as a tea, the flavor is on the bitter side and not the most useful way to enjoy it. Instead, the best uses of this product seem to be as a food additive or as a key ingredient in healthy smoothies. After using it for a few weeks, I do notice an uptick in my energy levels and metabolism. While I can't speak to the claims of increased memory and concentration, it seems to have been a positive supplement in all other regards. Going forward I will continue to make this a staple of my healthy supplement regimen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZRCYMXRQXGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O41OKEI#wasThisHelpful","R3AZRCYMXRQXGU","A30ZTNVTWKNLPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZTNVTWKNLPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had long heard of the nutritional benefits of seaweed as a purported superfood, so I decided to try One Organic's Premium Roasted Seaweed. The pack comes in easy to use sheets of fifty. Overall, I was most surprised that the seaweed was surprisingly tasty, while at the same time possessing no fat, sodium, or sugar. This makes for a great and healthy snack. I don't eat sushi, but the seaweed sheets can easily be rolled into a full-fledged meal. In the end, I give this products high marks for being a quality food as a reasonable price.

"For some, losing weight seems to come easily. In my case, that was not true. I work out a lot and have a voracious appetite. So I was hoping to find something that could help suppress my hunger pangs.

In two weeks, Iâm down about five pounds, which is exactly what I was hoping for! Additionally, I feel a noticeable improvement in my energy level, which helps with my workouts.

"Satisfied with the digitizer. As noted, the tools are useless and there are no instructions on where to apply the adhesive. Could have also come with a home button, but thats no biggie. I pretty much did everything though with a spudger I already had, hair dryer, and toothpicks, and used my old digitizer as the guide for the adhesive. The upper right corner of my screen was shattered (where the guide I used had me start) so there really wasnt a clean way to disassemble it anyhow, just have to watch out for the wifi antenna and digitizer ribbon mainly. I used a free guide from iFixit which explains the DIY steps (35 of 'em), and was fairly spot on.Overall, no, it isn't gorilla glass and doesn't have the same exact feel, but for a quarter of the price it's pretty darn good.UPDATE: nearly two years later, the screen is holding up great.

"I have included the model number in the title because there seems to be reviews for multiple units on this page and I want to help you avoid the confusion.Remember 10 years ago in the golden age of DSL? People were switching over in droves from their dial-up and ISDN services to the new DSL.Back when 2Wire still put out cutting edge product and the only way to do better was to buy a Belkin. Both companies have stagnated over the years and are notorious for churning out masses of junk. (2Wire is still cranking out 802.11g units!)Well...I don't hold out too much hope for 2Wire, but Belkin seems to have made a comeback to quality with this device.While this router works great with your older wireless N and G devices, it is ready to take you to the next level for gaming and media streaming over your network with the newer wireless AC protocol.I get a strong signal strength all over my house and I spend much less time with my video buffering than with my previous Linksys unit.Setup was quick and easy and for the price you can't do better in moving into the AC revolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRMAAQ5XECCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U6NS5Y#wasThisHelpful","RSRMAAQ5XECCT","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put the router model in the title because this page seems to mix reviews for several different units. Very confusing without some additional information.This is a decent router for your home network. If all you do is connect laptops, tablets, and phones to the internet for browsing then this will serve you very well. For G and N wireless networking this unit does exactly what it says it will do. However you should keep in mind that this is last year's tech. The AC protocol is what you are looking for if you game or share media over your network. Keep in mind your connected machines will also need to have AC adapters, either installed or attached in order to take full advantage.The main drawback of this perfectly capable device is the price. You can get the same features for much less. So the bottom line is, if you only do basic Internet surfing, look for something cheaper, and if you are looking for the cutting edge speed and tech, you also want to look elsewhere. So that said, I am not sure who the market would actually be for this device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RTW9UBATIAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4D1V9U#wasThisHelpful","R23RTW9UBATIAH","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The size and number that come in a box makes it a great snak to toss in your pack. My primay concern with the product is the sugar content. Having said that, the serving size is appropriate for a cookie bar.Make no mistake, this is a semi-soft cookie bar. It has that subtle flavor quality that will remind you of a fig newton. Sort of a cakey cookie sort of thing, sweet but not overwelmingly so.I wouldn't buy this for ""health reasons"" but I do like it as a cookie bar. Fig bars are still a better value though, and probably every bit as healthy as these minus the protein that the soy brings. As a product, I feel like it either didn't live up to its goal as healthy or that the healthy is pushed forward in the marketing to throw you off the scent of it being a cookie bar.I like them. They are okay. If this were a stocking stuffer, I wouldn't throw it out.

"This is a very beautiful piece value priced.Here is some advice for all jewelry you buy online: Read the size description and if you are unfamiliar with measurements, get your ruler out. When you buy online it's hard to tell the size that the picture represents. Getting a better picture in your mind before you purchase will save you from buying something you don't like and set a realistic expectation for what will be shipped.Second piece of advice: When you have a listing that shows a range in color or clarity, do not hesitate to use the free return offered if what you get doesn't look like the picture. That's why they offer it.The only drawback to this piece is the packaging. You might want to pick up a premium box separately if you are trying to make an impression. It comes in a plain black box. Inside the box is a black felt drawstring bag. It's sort of like the packaging you expect to find at the flea market, so by all means upgrade by buying a nice box elsewhere.The ""room for improvement"" piece here is the backing. It should have been a solid backing or a solid inlay of some other material. As it is you can see the shape and tiers from the back which is where you see why it is priced the way it is.All in all, for the money spent this is a great value and the perfect stocking stuffer for the beauty in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2DTY8AOQND7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHQGXGO#wasThisHelpful","R3N2DTY8AOQND7","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quick to install. Very convenient and cost efficient solution for a dry erase board.We have looked at and tried many alternatives. Most of our training rooms have a board backed dry erase board hung on the wall.We have also tried the paint on product, which was very unsatisfactory. Maybe the maintenance guys didn't ""paint it on"" right.While I wouldn't use this as a replacement for the classroom, it's a perfect dry erase board for my office.One problem is that there were no markers. So it isn't a complete kit, just a quick to install dry erase surface.Improvement ideas:* Include markers (sold separately)* Include a border (I think this would just make it look smarter where installed)* Include a stick-on-the-wall holder for markers (sold separately)The box is a little tricky. It shows both markers and a holder. But they are just telling you that you can buy them in addition to your shiny new dry erase surface.The real key is to follow the installation instructions that come with the product. They don't come right out and say it, but clearly you are going to want this mounted to as clean and SMOOTH of a surface as possible. They mention drywall in the documentation but if it is at all textured, I would think twice.All in all it is what it says it is and does what it says it will do. If you want to get fancy with it, that's going to be on you and your own ingenuity to accommodation markers and make it look like part of the environment that you are installing it in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RJ175UPQRUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5QU#wasThisHelpful","R33RJ175UPQRUR","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you will pick up about this book is that it isn't just a technical list of distilleries with some side bars on their history and an overview of their product line. This book gets into the heads of the people behind the distillery, their phillosophy and mission. I have visited the three Texas distilleries, most recently Garrison Brothers in Fredericksberg. Having read their entry in the book before the visit added depth and meaning to the tour of the facility and gave me a chance to formulate some questions before my arrival. If you are going to visit any of these places, I highly recommend you pick up a copy of this book before hand. And here is a great idea, have some of the employees, if not the founders sign you book in their section. You will find that it will greatly increase the sentemental value of your copy and really motivate you to go see more of these distilleries in action.One thing you walk away from this book with is an understanding that much of what is marketed as ""craft"" is all flowing out of a couple of huge distribution centers. So it really pays to go check out where your whiskey is purportedly made. On the other hand you start to appreciate the struggle that the authentic craft distillery is up against. It is very similar to the stories you read about the early craft beer innovators.You are going to pick up on some of the inside issues that you might not think about with bottle in hand. For example, a startup distillery making aged whiskey doesn't really have aged whiskey to sell for a long time. So they may be paying utility bills, employees, purchasing supplies for five years or more before their first sale is even possible! There are some ways around that. Selling to the novelty ""white dog"" crowd for example, while you wait for your real love to quietly age in an oak barrel.You also pick up on some of the things that make these places unique to themselves. Garrison Brothers for example have the benefit of the Texas sun. So they age their barrels in metal shipping containers that get aired out every other day. That high daytime temperature GREATLY accelerates the aging process without adding years of storage cost.If I were going to dock this book for a star it would be for how few distilleries were included. There are some great ones out there that didn't make the cut. But when I think about it, maybe I am wrong and THOSE places are among the crowd reselling whiskey under their own misleading label.In any event, adding more content would be more pages and a more expensive book. I am confident in my five star rating and I will keep my fingers crossed for a sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKY4JX5AQNDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1454905336#wasThisHelpful","R2AKY4JX5AQNDV","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fast close shave. Not a fast close shave ""for an electric"" this gives you a comparable shave to a regular three blade stick razor.I will be honest. I have used an electric for some time. And in the past it has been a trade off. Convenience for quality. I love the convenience of shaving dry while waiting for my bus. But it wasn't always the best or smoothest shave. It's like you start your day every day about an hour away from 5 o'clock shadow.Specifically, I am talking about this unit:Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Shaver 2100 (Packaging may vary)It's a $30 model and it shaves like it.The compromise is over. This model may be more expensive but it really shines in the shaving department.What makes it better?* Only half as loud as the Norelco 6948XL* Smooth close shave that feels like a razor* Half the shave time over the Norelco 6948XL* It does a great job of getting into those hard to reach places like under the jaw* Feels more comfortable against the faceThe comfort is huge. It took me a shave or two to get used to it, but it feels different than the Norelco 6948XL because all three heads have much greater maneuverability to get into places like under the jaw and around the Adam's apple. With the older unit you have to jam it in there with a constant pressure and really work it.The only thing I miss is the simple charging cable. This unit has a charging stand which is great and most people will prefer it, but I travel often and I appreciate the simplicity of a compact cable that just folds into a wrapped coil. They do make up for that though with the great travel bag. Even the bag is great quality. The zipper clasps are metal and there are compartments both pocket and mesh on the inside.This would be a great gift for the man in your life, or if you are like me and are going to always choose the convenience of electric, do yourself a huge favor and end the compromise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CT6OQIXZMJ7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBZQ6YA#wasThisHelpful","R1CT6OQIXZMJ7E","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a new wave of devices that are going to change the way we talk to our doctor and the way we think about our own health.Having real-time access to health markers along with a history of past benchmarks is going to allow us to fully realize the state of health over time. I think it is very likely that these types of devices are going to cause a conciousness shift making us all more health aware and promote better lifestyle choices.Unfortunately I can't use the most intriguing part of this device (yet) as there is no app for Android devices. This is on the way however.As for the device itself, it's the best home blood pressure devices I have tried.My typical experience is that home devices vary wildly from one reading to the next. Even if done back to back. I feel that most of the devices on the market are more like electronic mood rings. The first time you experience this you might wonder if you are dying with your readings going back and forth. It's not you, it's the machine. This unit however is very consistent.As for ease of use, it's pretty much a no-brainer. If you are thinking of getting this for your parrents, it won't confuse them. Luckily you don't need a smart phone for the basic features you would attribute to a traditional device.The price is a steal for the quality. I mean, this one WORKS so being priced competitively with devices that don't work, well you can go wrong there.Bottom line, the advantage of tracking your data over time, accurate readings, ease of use and value for your dollar, this is the unit you are looking for.If it came to market with an Android app I would have given it five stars, but that's a big blank for a huge piece of their potential market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3823OJADO2EOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTE7CS#wasThisHelpful","R3823OJADO2EOM","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cedar went on a round of antibiotics a year ago for a gut infection.The vet sent him home with some probiotics to put in his food after he was off the meds to rebuild his gut microbe count. It was only a week's worth. His stool since has fluctuated between normal and very infirm on a seemingly random basis, in spite of his food being fairly consistent.After two weeks on this product he has had a consistently firm stool which is a great indicator of gut health.More and more research points to the population of the microbiome as being linked to all facets of health.

"This is a much more cost effective liver support than what your vet will offer. If you are open to herbal remedies this might be something for you to try.My dog loves these. As he is getting older this is probably something he is going to continue to receive on a regular basis.The ingredient list of this product is quite impressive. I normally expect a canine remedy to have one to three potentially active ingredients. This one has 14.It may be a little early to completely summarize the tonic effect on Cedar but he certainly seems to have more energy while at the same time giving me a much less manic greeting upon my return home.The single drawback is the smell.

"Wonder Woman is a multi-generational icon. Here you begin an understanding of her story, her impact on feminism, politicical thought, gender equality and more. Also in this book we get one of the best looks at where she came from. Where and how Wonder Woman was born and how she developed.Maybe this level of background is only interesting to a geek like me. But I dout it. I think anyone who has ever been touched by her stories and mythology, would enjoy exploring in greater detail her genesis and the complex factors that shaped her.The book has nearly 100 pages of notes and other back matter for those, like me, interested in deep trivia.To compliment this book, I also suggest:Wonder Woman Unbound: The Curious History of the World's Most Famous HeroineWonder Woman: The Story of the Amazon PrincessWonder Woman: The Complete HistoryThe present book is written from the point of view of an historian, by an actual historian.If you love history as much as you love comic books or Wonder Woman in particular, you are going to love this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9OJI0HB4NR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354045#wasThisHelpful","R2L9OJI0HB4NR7","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victoria Boutenko uses her latest book to continue the global phenomena she and her family started way back in 2004. Since then ""green smoothie"" has become a nearly household word. Certainly there had been previous advocates of blended greens and green salads, but Mrs. Boutenko's charm, style and approach really brought it to the mainstream consciousness.Now I don't know about you, but I really hate it when a book doesn't have a ""look inside"" option. I always feel better buying a book when I know more about what's inside.Here are my thoughts on the book and its various sections.The book is divided into three sections:1. A guide to your own retreat.This section is all about creating your own health retreat right at home. Way cheaper than traveling to a remote location. Everything you need is all laid out in a logical order. All of the planning has been done for you along with specific guidance and encouragement.2. Letters from our retreat participantsThis section is testimonials, examples and heart moving stories of healing and success. You could make an argument that this is a commercial, but why make a commercial for something you already purchased? I think the value here is that you get some of the interaction that you might see on an actual retreat.3. RecipesThis section is a little light compared to previous works, but the focus of the title is a retreat. If the book were called Green Smoothie Recipes, then I suppose that would be a bigger gripe. The recipes are broken out into the following catagories:* Sweet green smoothie recipes* Green soups* Green puddings* Soups and salads popular in my familyYou will probably want more variety than is offered here. I suggest:Green for Life: The Updated Classic on Green Smoothie NutritionGreen Smoothie Revolution: The Radical Leap Towards Natural HealthOverall this is a great book to have your own in-home retreat. You even get some aspects of the social group by being able to share their stories of healing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UXGZYBNO2K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583948600#wasThisHelpful","R19UXGZYBNO2K2","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first question that comes to mind when one sees yet another ""Goetia"" on the market, is obviously, ""Why should I consider this edition?""In this case the answer is a little too complex to sum up in a single tag-line.The first thing I want to make clear is, this isn't just the Goetia, as the title would suggest, but rather the entire Lemegeton! Further, it is based on the previously unpublished manuscript version compiled by Dr. Thomas Rudd. (Harley MS 6483)While Joseph Peterson's Lemegeton is clearly the definitive version, Skinner and Rankine use this book as an operating table on which to discect how this material was used by actual working magicians of the 16th and 17th centuries. The process, according to the authors, is one of dualism, where the magician controls base entities by use of their matching divine counterparts. That is a concept that is alluded to, but never fleshed out in the Lemegeton itself. This volume goes into a great deal of detail on the use of the 72 Names of the Shemhamphorash to bind and control the 72 ""demons"" of the Goetia. This concept is not only spelled out, there are illustrated in these pages, the actual double-sided seals as employed by Dr. Rudd and presumably his contemporaries.Other details that have not been previously published such as the proper use of the brass vessle and the breastplate, will be enough to get even armchair Goetic theorists off the fence, to make this purchase.Enochian magicians may be interested in seeing Dr. Rudd's verion of Dee's Tabula Sancta cum Tabulis Enochi.This massive 448 page work is heavily footnoted, and the student of Solomonic Magick will enjoy the ample back matter.The contents are broken down as follows:Front matter - 14 pages, including the introduction.History and origins - 43 pages of it.Evocation Methods - 24 pages exploring bindings, names, adversarial angels, invocations, equipment, and ceremony.The Manuscripts - 241 page treatment of Dr. Rudd's full Lemegeton, which he himself called the Goetia for reasons that escape me. It should be understood that in actuality the Goetia is just one of the books of the full Lemegeton.Appendices are broken up as follows:Appendix 1 - Theugia-Goetia in Sloane 3824Appendix 2 - Tables of demons from the Lemegeton (24 pages of tables!)This is a dream work of comparitive study on the Goetic entities, and their rank. Also included are Hebrew spellings of the names, alternate spellings, what if any stead ridden, other qualities, ruling angel, number of legions, planet (based on the metal associated with the spirit's rank) evoked appearance, and attributed powers.Appendix 3 - Thomas Rudd's synthesis of Goetia and EnochiaAppendix 4 - Rudd describes 61 demons.Appendix 5 - Sources for the material in the Lemegeton.Appendix 6 - Seals from Sibley's Goetia.Appendix 7 - Shem ha-Mephorash AngelsAppendix 8 - Ecclesiastical Planetary HoursAppendix 9 - This is an odd piece but it really speaks to the 16th century mindset of Goetia and self justification. It is an explanation of names used in the Goetia, with some other random Kabalah thrown in. But if you ever need say, the consecrating prayer of Venus, well, there you go.Appendix 10 - A study of some of the words used in evocation. This section is a Greek and Hebrew list of derivations of words used in Goetic evocations.Appendix 11 - Narrative of Dr. Rudd, Sir John Heydon and a spirit ""How a man may have the continual Society of a Guardian Genius""Appendix 12 - Variant forms of Heptameron style circles.Appendix 13 - Observations of metals and times of bindings.Appendix 14 - Equipment diagrams. I was hoping for more here, but it serves its purpose.Appendix 15 - Scot's form of commanding spiritsIf you want to have a complete curriculum of Solomonic study, I suggest that you purchase this volume along with Joseph Peterson's Lemegeton. The Peterson edition is a scholerly comparitive work, while the present work is a snapshot of Solomonic Magick being put to practical work. These two volumes not only complement each other, but they are both equally vital to building an accurate picture of the scope and impact of this cycle of magick.Mr. Skinner and I have discussed the theory of Goetic workings in the past. It should be noted that the authors not only report the dualistic model of Goetic workings, they champion the theory behind it. I myself have a different view, seeing the Lemegeton as a ""Book of the Dead"" for the living, moving High Shamanism into 16th century Europe (not to mention 21st Century Americas). Consider how many of these beings start out as a spirit-animal, only putting on a comely human form after a battle of wills with the exorcist of the Art. Never the less, I could hardly put this volume down. There are many pearls in these pages for any student of Solomon.On a final note, the author pulls back the veil a bit on why there are no Goetic spirits associated with Mars, and raises the question as to there being a single demon attributed to Saturn. I had made a similar comment in my review of Runyon's reworking of the Goetia some time ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUOP66JCJE5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073872355X#wasThisHelpful","R1VUOP66JCJE5D","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That's a deluxe towel right there.These towels do a serviceable job. As a towel, it is certainly in working order, doing what a towel does, which is make a wet thing less wet than it was just prior to its application. For the price, these are STILL a great value. No two ways about it. As a purchase, I endorse it.But see, here's the thing. I feel like I need one and a half of these to complete the operation with the same level of efficiency as those overly plush towels at the spa. In other words, like any other regular towel I have applied to myself with determination.A better name for this towel might be ""Divatex Home Fashions 10-Piece Completely Serviceable Towel Sets, Cream"".Don't get me wrong. These towels will go into rotation between the water closet and hamper along with all of the other towels currently in my employ. They did the job. But I have used a luxurious towel before and this falls short of the dictionary term deluxe. Now, that being my only gripe, that they have overstated, to a moderate degree, the actual quality of the textile in question, I only removed one star. I mean, they do perform the process of removing most surface moisture from your skin as you would expect.It's simply that I expected that firm fluffy experience of an overly plush towel, drying me as only they can. And that isn't what's for sale here.There must be some towel tech, some manufacturing process, loop count or thread count, or maybe a weave that gives a more absorbant and plush towel experience like at the spa.

"I am probably just going to switch this over to an auto-ship product to be honest.After dropping coffee due to anxiety, I lost that spring in my step. I had tried some B-vitamins and parsley in my smoothies but I wasn't getting my energy back.Part of that was likely due to the fact that I had overtaxed my energy system with all of that coffee. I was exhausted and needed some time to rest. But even after a rest and a detox I felt sluggish and tired.This stuff kicked me into gear without any ""speedy"" heart racing jitter-fest.

Combined with video capture devices such as a Dazzle Dazzle Digital Video Creator DVC-90 Video Capture Device and Movie Maker you can even convert all of your old VHS tapes into electronic media files...which I have done.The ability to import projects from your iPad's Avid Studio is a huge plus as well. You can even creat custom-fit soundtracks.

"The premise of the book is great. Review different fasting protocols and then leave the reader with enough information to give it a go. However there is a strong bias toward a Paleo Diet that isn't evident from the title.This bias is particularly evident in the section that covers the Warrior Diet. The Warrior Diet is an Intermittent Fasting protocol that gives you a four hour eating window every day. In the famine part of your day you can have an apple or two to tide you over. In Fast Diets for Dummies the raw vegetarian part of the day is turned on it's head without any indication that this is the authors own change and not part of the original Warrior Diet. Instead of apples (raw, whole food, vegetarian) now you can have whey protein (processed, heat damaged, fractional food). The point of the Warrior Diet could not have been missed to a larger degree unless it included candy bars and heroin.I gave it two stars, because if you ARE Paleo (and there is nothing wrong with that) then this book will be exactly what you are looking for. Packaging a stealthy payload of biased information however has never been the way to win me over.Here are some choices that might serve you better if you are not Paleo inclined:Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor's Program for Conquering DiseaseThe Warrior Diet: Switch on Your Biological Powerhouse For High Energy, Explosive Strength, and a Leaner, Harder BodyThe Every-Other-Day Diet: The Diet That Lets You Eat All You Want (Half the Time) and Keep the Weight Off","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCV5P7HPHRZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118775082#wasThisHelpful","R1VCV5P7HPHRZ2","A1L8PL08LOYO9L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L8PL08LOYO9L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The main floor of our house is primarily hardwood and tile, partially covered with area rugs and runners, an ideal situation for this vacuum.  The Alize canister does an excellent job on these surfaces, quickly picking up the ubiquitous pet hair and everyday dirt that accumulates on the floor.  The suction is outstanding, especially  for a small, lightweight machine such as this one.  It features six separate power settings including an automatic one that you can just set and forget.  On some of our rugs, the higher settings are just too powerful and make it difficult even to push the vacuum around.  That's why it's great to have so many options.  On the lower settings, it's so quiet that you could literally use it when everyone is asleep and not risk disturbing them.  Even our normally noise-averse cats don't react to it and they usually run for the hills when they as much as see a vacuum.The Miele Alize is compact, light and highly maneuverable, making it easy to navigate and to carry up and down the stairs.  Its 36 foot long cord offers great range without requiring frequent searches for fresh outlets and its cord retraction system is simply awesome, the best I've ever seen.  The three included attachments (dusting brush, upholstery tool and crevice nozzle) store neatly inside the canister so there's no worry about losing them.  The telescoping stainless steel wand easily adjusts to the proper height befitting the user and the job to be done.  And if you're vacuuming under dim light conditions, the handle comes equipped with a battery powered LED light that illuminates the area and turns itself off after 30 seconds.As much as I appreciate the relative ease and economy of bagless vacuums, there's a lot to be said for Miele's AirClean filtration system.  When used properly, the filters and the bags capture 99.9% of all damaging particles and prevent their release back into the air, a nice feature for all of us and a must for allergy and asthma sufferers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFAS9AZ48AFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGLTA#wasThisHelpful","ROFAS9AZ48AFK","AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of things I like best about this small device aside from the fact that it takes up very little room in my overcrowded kitchen, is that it requires no external power.  You can take it virtually anywhere: camping, picnics, the office lunch room and enjoy freshly cut vegetables wherever you go.The spiralizer itself is well designed and constructed of BPA-free ABS plastic and includes two very sharp Japanese steel blades.  It's a simple device that seems built to last.  It's very easy to use and for me, the results have been picture-perfect.  That it encourages us to eat more vegetables isn't a bad thing either.Another important consideration for me is that Kitchen Supreme is very responsive and sincerely concerned with customer satisfaction.  Other reviews have mentioned this as well and I experienced it myself as I had occasion to email them after I purchased the spiralizer.

"Heating and air conditioning tend to lower the humidity and really dry out the air in a room, wreaking havoc on dry skin.  I've tried many creams and lotions over the years and while I've liked some, none has really stood out as a favorite.  The ones most effective at dispelling the dryness all seemed to leave a greasy residue so I was loathe to touch anything until all the lotion was finally absorbed or wiped off.  Although it moisturizes very well, Eucerin doesn't present that problem.  Immediately after applying it to my hands, I can pick up a book or my knitting without worrying about leaving stains behind.  Of course, it's not just for hand care.

"This slim, compact hub doesn't take up a lot of room but offers the convenience of seven 3.0 USB ports in a single device.  Plug it into a 3.0 USB port on your computer and you'll enjoy truly fast transfer rates, about 10 times faster than 2.0.  It's also backward compatible so even if your computer doesn't feature 3.0 technology, this will work with 1.0 and 2.0, albeit at slower speeds.  The power and indicator lights are a nice feature, allowing you to check your status at a glance and unlike most other hubs I've used, the TP-LINK has a switch so you can shut it off when not in use.  Simplifying things even further, it's truly plug and play with no drivers to install.I've got four of the seven ports in use already and everything's been running seamlessly.  I'm delighted to be able to run ancillary equipment such as external drives simultaneously rather than plugging and unplugging them into my computer individually.

I don't find that it leaves a residue, nor does it weigh down my hair as some other products have done.

"As pretty much anyone knows, evaluating a particular fragrance is entirely subjective and personal.  With that in mind, I quite like Rochas Eau Sensuelle and find it pleasantly fruity/floral with an appealing hint of spice to counteract and balance the sweetness.  The bouquet which is comprised of Rochas' signature white flowers plus mango and a smattering of dried fruit, is neither overwhelming nor cloying but as fresh and clean as a warm spring day.  And while its complexity certainly makes a statement, it's not so heavy that it can't be worn during the day as long as you take care not to apply it too lavishly.To avoid over-application when using a spray bottle, rather than spraying it on myself directly, I prefer the old trick of lightly spritzing the air  and then walking into the cloud of fragrance.  I've never gone wrong with this technique.  You derive the subtle benefit of the lovely scent without stopping people in their tracks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQVE11L4MD1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044VO9YO#wasThisHelpful","RWQVE11L4MD1U","AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pouches feature UV protection to prevent fading and color distortion due to light exposure.  It's a very useful feature which I've not seen on any of the other pouches that I've used.  The 3-mil thickness is ideal for most of my laminating needs although for more durability, they're also available in a 5-mil version.I use them primarily for document and photograph preservation, recipes, knitting and crochet patterns, anything I wish to protect from dirt, dust and tearing, etc.  A look around your house will probably give you many more ideas but in case you're stumped, Fellowes has a helpful site with suggestions and downloadable templates for laminating projects for home, work or school.  You can find it at Fellowes.com/ideacenter.Recently, I laminated a multi-page knitting pattern.  For half of the pages, I used the Fellowes ImageLast pouches and for the other half, another well-known brand also in 3-mil.  All of the laminated pages turned out well with a good seal and no waves or air bubbles but the Fellowes pages were slightly heavier and stiffer and didn't show any tendency to bow as the others sometimes did.  Fellowes makes a good quality product which I am happy to recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZDD776GP6BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAPL1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1EZDD776GP6BJ","AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lightweight case perfectly fits the 12.2 inch Galaxy Tab Pro with ample room for the extras that you might want to bring along.  On one side, there's a large pocket which extends from one end of the case to the other. It's secured in the middle with a velcro tab.  On the other side, that same area is divided into two separate pockets.  The messenger bag is well constructed with neat, even stitching and a soft microfiber lining to prevent scratching.  There's ample padding to protect your delicate electronics from life's inevitable bumps.

"I've owned an older model of this oven for the past 3 years and it has seen almost daily use and is still going strong.  It's turned out an endless array of food and never given me a minute's trouble.  It is, without a doubt, the most versatile and reliable countertop oven I've ever owned.  This one is virtually identical but for a few minor changes such as an updated handle and sleeker dials.While compact, this Hamilton Beach oven is truly useful and capable of much more than merely heating up frozen entrees.  Certainly, it can do that and make toast too but it can also produce a crusty loaf of French bread, a succulent roast, a freshly baked homemade pizza and so much more.  Since we've had this countertop, we rarely use our full-size oven.  It saves on energy costs and it's quite a boon in the summer since it doesn't heat up the whole kitchen.The oven ships with rotisserie equipment, two metal shelf racks,  one large enameled metal baking pan and one smaller aluminum  broiler or baking pan with a rack that fits inside.  The enameled pan is a shelf unto itself and it fits into the rack slots whereas the smaller pan sits on one of the supplied shelf racks.  You may never need anything else but if you do, Amazon sells many other accessories which will fit the oven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKEWLNCZ4RSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M39MPP4#wasThisHelpful","R1BKEWLNCZ4RSZ","AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ6H9ZV7TJUUT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clifford Simak is one of those authors whose stories I remember decades later.  Way Station captured my imagination at least 40 years ago and I recall it fondly.  I'm never a big fan of short stories but Simak was often featured in the pulp scifi of yesteryear.  This is a collection of short stories that show how the old guard authors imbued their stories with a sense of hope.There were a few occurrences that showed the dated aspect of the story.  Not the plot or character motivations but references to current technology or prices.  One story actually referred to a million dollars as an astronomical sum.  Not the mere pittance of today when it can't approach the cost of one of the ubiquitous and extremely annoying repetitive political TV smear ads.The book was a trundle down to the SciFi of yesteryear and well worth the trundle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQ9IPG6GBJGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EMZW06#wasThisHelpful","RVQ9IPG6GBJGP","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Third Degree by Greg IlesI said Greg Iles was a master of tension in my review of Dead Sleep.  I  may have to upgrade that to an elite master of tension.  Tension in this book was beyond palatable it was visceral.  This is a tale of infidelity, disease, distrust and an assortment of unlikeable characters.I have mentioned before how likeability of characters can impact the enjoyment of a book.  Iles has a bunch of unlikeable people making horrible choices and the book was still enormously compelling.  Two marital cheaters reap the whirlwind while law enforcement is portrayed as less than professional.  Iles did offer up an apology for his law enforcement portrayal in the afterword of the book.This was an excellent mystery, a quality plot and nothing remotely predictable.I strongly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JS2O1HEU6TA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743292502#wasThisHelpful","R2JS2O1HEU6TA1","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The watch is beautiful.  The three things my wife didn't like are it is too heavy.  It is too hard to get on and off and too big.  The size makes her think it looks like a man's watch.  In fairness that may be age related as the younger women do seem to wear much bigger watches.This is the second Invicta watch I have reviewed.  Both of them should have had a diagram on how to use the watch band.  Keep in mind I'm a technut and can get a hard drive out of a laptop and not destroy anything.  I note that because having issues with how to make a watch band work sounds ludicrous but both bands were difficult to figure out.The hard off and on didn't bother me once I figured it out but this watch fastens in a manner which and I quote my bride, ""will ruin my nails!""The watch was easy to set and the manual did have a clear diagram on that.  So you have a very attractive watch that needs better documentation and a fastener that doesn't ruin nails.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDAE2WNJH9DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5PJN8#wasThisHelpful","RNDAE2WNJH9DC","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SAT seems like a harmless word but it strikes fear into the stoutest hearts of high school students.  I recall concern about the SAT way back in the 60's when the test was printed on papyrus.  Not overt concern because I was luckily or lucky regarding standardized tests.  I had class mates that quite literally threw up due to stress over the SAT.  Colleges are finally realizing that the overemphasis that has historically been placed on tests such as the SAT has blithely ignored more accurate and reliable measures of potential academic success.  However digression is doing ill service to a review of this product.The first word that came to mind when I picked up the 1336 page behemoth of a book was hernia.  The second, after perusing the table of contents was comprehensive. Not being a teen I was peripherally aware that the SAT has been redesigned for 2016.  (about time)  This book, the accompanying DVD and the Kaplan web site are designed to help the next generation of guinea pigs, I mean students, successfully get high scores on the SAT.  As near as I can tell without taking the SAT this book should provide a measure of comfort for the student that can wade through it.  There is a wealth of material and it should give a close to substantive experience that hopefully will transfer to the actual test.  Traditionally SAT scores have risen as students retake them.  The experience and perhaps the wearing down of anxiety no doubt contribute to that phenomena.Perhaps the best advice I saw in the book was the encouragement to complete the now optional essay portion.  If at the time of testing the student has no interest in a school that requires the essay they may feel why bother with the essay.  Reality is that people change their minds and directions.  The essay portion can not be taken separately.  Imagine a student's frustration if after taking the SAT a school that requires the essay is suddenly leavened into the mix.  The entire test would have to be re-taken.  If a school does not require the essay,  the completion of the essay will not count against a student.  However if it does require the essay, it must be completed.  The simple solution is to complete the essay regardless of it being labeled optional.This book and its five practice tests should allow a student who diligently utilizes all its tools to approach the SAT experience with a modicum of confidence.An editorial aside to this review is that as a high school guidance counselor I saw students who aced the SATs crash dramatically in college.  Conversely I saw  students who despaired over even getting admitted to college after an abysmal SAT experience graduate college with honors.  It is so very difficult to measure motivation, desire and ambition.  This book should provide confidence but please remember the SAT is not in any way a measure of future success in life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NEJVGZOK1AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231539#wasThisHelpful","R30NEJVGZOK1AC","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warrior of Fate by Debra Mullins.This a romance novel with a fair amount of action. Tessa and Adrian are the main protagonist in this story. They are two more of the descendants of survivors of the destruction of Atlantis.  They were in the previous book but have moved to the forefront in this one.The war between the Seers and the Mendukati, two opposing groups from the survivors of Atlantis continues to grow.  Possession of three ancient stones of power is a major theme in the story.  The ancient lie of who brought about the destruction of Atlantis is another bone of contention.Once again the steamy scenes put this book into the romantic category but the action and general story help it to transcend easy categorizing.  Prodigal Son  and Heart of Stone are the preceding books.  As those two books, this  is still a good action/adventure/urban fantasy with romantic overtones.I recommend it.Web site: http://www.debramullins.com/bookshelf/prodigalson.php","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PR44CSPTOATJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE3KNR2#wasThisHelpful","R3PR44CSPTOATJ","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The FBI and New Orleans figure prominently in the story.Jordon Glass is a twin and she is missing her sister.

"This watch looks great.  It is striking in appearance and looks quite manly.  It feels heavy on the arm.  Just for yucks I weighed it and it is 4.1 oz compared to my dress watch at 3.2 oz.  It felt like it weighed a lot more than my very slim/sleek dress watch.  I think that is due to the size.  2 1/8 "" from the 9 to the tip of the middle stem vs. 1. 1/4"" on my dress watch.  With all that said, if you are looking for a diver looking watch this looks the part.  It is water resistant not water proof so it is really a diver looking watch.  The two extra large buttons are for quick correction of date and quick correction of the 24 hour second time zone.  That allows you to fix those without pulling out the stem (crown).  The day and the date are pretty much irrelevant to any one with normal vision.  I guess you  have to have extraordinary vision to use them.  Even with my bifocals, I had to lift them and squint to see the day or time.If you are looking for a smart looking watch that appears to belong on a Navy Seal and you have exceptional vision and don't mind the size and the weight, if may be perfect for you.  I asked my teen age grandson his opinion thinking it might appeal to the younger crowd and he asked me, ""why would I wear a watch when I have my  phone?""  So this isn't an overt criticism of the watch as it seems just fine for what it is.  Apparently it isn't for me though.  Oh and it only has a one year warranty which is surprisingly short for a $100.00 watch.  If you need to send it in for repair you have to include a check for $28.00 for return shipping which is more than 25% of the price, that just seems exorbitant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBBWAKGV96TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y1LY#wasThisHelpful","R3BBBWAKGV96TS","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Runelords by David FarlandThis is the first book in an epic fantasy.  It stands alone just fine but it sets you up to buy the eight current books and wonder when the 9th and supposed final volume will be released.  It is a tale of confused good and conflicted evil.The Reavers are the bogeyman in this tale.  They are large, powerful and inexplicable beings that are referred to more than shown.  Raj Ahten seeks to brutally unite humanity under his banner to supposedly defend against the Reavers.  Gaborn, son of a king, finds himself thrust into an unanticipated role opposing Raj Ahten.The title of Runelord refers to those members of a fuedal society that receive endowments from others.  Those endowments such as brawn, wit or stamina enhance the ability of the recepient by the strength of the one who is giving the endowment.  Conversely it robs the giver of the strength they are giving.  For example a dedicate(the giver) who provides his wit becomes a drooling idiot after giving his wit.Farland has created an interesting world where a person may be ten times as smart or 50 times faster by receiving the endowments of others.  I like the fact that he also shows the negative side effects of the process.  Accelerated metabolism also leads to accelerated aging and earlier death.  The entire concept is intriguing both for its effects and the morality surrounding the societal concept of selling or giving your abilities to another.  I'm no sure that there isn't some social commentary incorporated into the book.This is an excellent introduction to a complex and intriguing society.I recommend the book.Web Site: http://davidfarland.com/","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I643PQF38YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812541626#wasThisHelpful","R37I643PQF38YM","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Under a Tell-Tale Sky: Disruption Book 1 by R. E. McDermottRedundancy is a fact of my life.  I am prefacing this review with a previous preface. I am lucky enough to be an advanced reader for Bob.  This simply means I got the book before it was published and devoured it with rapidity.  I read the book, I received no compensation for writing it and I am giving it 5 STARS because it deserves it.  Feel free to check my other reviews and you will note that I âcalls them as I sees themâ, which means the star ratings are all over the place.  So, in conclusion, this is a darn fine book and if you enjoy action and adventure, you should really buy it.First off this is a scary book.  Not ""what goes bump in the night"" scary but plausible scary.  I recently read One Second After by William R. Forstchen and it detailed what occurred after a nuclear bomb generated nation wide EMP.  McDermott provides a post-apocalyptic tale after some major solar flares.McDermott's books provide a strong plot with excellent character development.  I was chided by an author for my penchant for likeable characters.  I would defend that in that Darth Vader was a very likeable villain.  Likeability provides incentive to continue to see what happens to that character.  Bob provides very likeable characters and in this book, those characters are dealing with some pretty despicable things.This is the first in the series and it makes that clear in the title.  If you are looking for closure, then buy the entire series.  I enjoyed the book and would suggest to the author to get moving on the sequel.I highly recommend it.Body of  work of <a type=""amzn"" > R. E.

"To Say Goodbye by David WiskircherThe first book I read from this author was  A Healing Way .  It is a cathartic angst for pain.  The book provided  a hopeful outlook on love,death, dying and grief.  This is an action adventure book that is nothing like the preceding book.  This book focuses on a strong woman who strives to find her man through political peril and drug corruption.Claire Kittredge is the protagonist in this book although Alex Drew becomes a meaningful friend.  The story encompasses current events by addressing corruption in our own government as well as foreign semi-adversaries.  There  is a distinct distrust of bureaucracy leavened with a good helping of cynicism or a fatal realism, it is difficult to know.There is plenty of action, some violence but not overwhelming to the plot.I recommend this book.Related Sites:  http://thebark.com/content/devotionhttps://www.facebook.com/david.weiskircher","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTACSE2CS8YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFOG8C6#wasThisHelpful","R2CTACSE2CS8YM","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a moving book.  The author shares his personal feelings and grief  over the loss of his own wife through fiction.  A Healing Way was is a cathartic angst for pain.  The book provides such a hopeful outlook on death, dying and grief. I have to admit that I thought about my Dad and Mom's passing as I read it.  I am also fortunate enough to have a soul mate that equally promoted emotions the author shared.  The author has a gift in his ability to elicit thoughts and emotions by the power of his words. Kudos!The story focus is on two wayward puppies helped through difficult circumstances by a coyote.  The juxtaposition of their dire needs and a lonely, heartbroken man is done seamlessly.  Life from the point of view of a dog and a coyote is substantially different from man while sharing similar emotions.I highly recommend this book.Related Sites:  http://thebark.com/content/devotionhttps://www.facebook.com/david.weiskircher","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VAIGR2I0BCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBARGTM#wasThisHelpful","R21VAIGR2I0BCJ","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Birds of Prey by David DrakeIn 262 A. D. the Roman empire was faltering.  One prop on the tottering empire was Aulus Perrenius, Imperial Agent.  Aulus could be characterized as a very early James Bond working for the Empire and not necessarily for the specific emperor.  Aulus is introduced to Calvus, who unknown to him initially was also an agent working for a different time.  Together the two must protect Aulus's empire and time as well as saving Calvus's future time.Drake always does a superb job with historically accurate settings and characters.  His story telling could be done around a campfire or a nuclear pile.  The man has game!  His stories always provide some philosophic head scratching as well as plenty of action and character insights.I really enjoy his work in general and this book specifically.I recommend both this book.Site:  http://david-drake.com/","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWB4OK30BAFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671559125#wasThisHelpful","R1HWB4OK30BAFU","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of the rare individuals who could not get into the Rachel Morgan stories.  Maybe it was my mood or the cycle of the moon or bad karma but I just was shocked that I didn't like those books.  Imagine my surprise when I liked The Drafter!  This book is about time shifting, memory and corruption.Harrison did a very good character portrayal in Peri Reed.  The unrealistic time shifting or drafting was balanced out by the very realistic feelings portrayed by Peri Reed.  My favorite character was Taf.  It was interesting to see the relationship with her mother.  Howard also was an interesting character.  His loyalty and guts contradicted his initial or perhaps secondary description.There is action and intrigue and some confusion regarding just who are the  ""bad"" guys.I enjoyed the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3TOU8X3NEFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501108697#wasThisHelpful","R3S3TOU8X3NEFD","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I characterized The Clockwork Dagger as a Steampunk romance.  The sequel The Clockwork Crown is substantially more than that.  This short story provides some insight as to Miss Percival's actions in the noted stories above.The Waster war is not explained in this short story.  This story merely provides background on the other books.  I think that it might fare better as a preface in one of the books rather than a stand alone story.

"From Russia Without Love by Stephen TemplinOnce again Stephen Templin pulls his plot from current events.  Chris Paladin is the protagonist who is trying to balance his SEAL handle of Reverend with his self image, personal identity and new career when he is called back into action by his erstwhile lover Hannah.  We met the basic cast of characters in Trident's First Gleaming.Russia is rearing it's head with adventurism in the Ukraine.  Russian paranoia is exploited by Tenplin in his plot for the financing of state supported terrorism.  The KGB is dead, long live the FSB.  One of the things about Templin's books is their plausibility.Sonny is also back with his irreverent and sarcastic manner.  The action is paramount in Templin's books.  Once he set the scene you are forced back into your seats by the speed of the action.  Chris's reverence is counterpointed by his lethal behavior.  He searches his soul as he deals out death.  Templin portrays a protagonist torn by his sense of honor, patriotism and religion.I enjoyed the book.Web site:  http://www.stephentemplin.com/","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33YQ805OUW14J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OD5IUE#wasThisHelpful","R33YQ805OUW14J","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zeroes by Chuck WendigThis may have been one of the most frightening books I have ever read.  Vampires, giant squids, Terminators can't hold a candle to the perverse evil in this book.  A group of misfit hackers are co-opt into helping a government black ops program become invasively pervasive.One of the reasons this book was so thought provoking is that after 30 years in the computer business I am conversant with much of the background in the book.  Note conversant, not by any shape or means competent or expert.  Secondly I find that multiple well known savants have decried the development of the type of work described by the author.  Notables as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Vernor Vinge have all weighed in on the topic.There was highlighting of dysfunctional personalities, mood disorders, action and mayhem.  In other words, action abounds leavened with peeks to the conscience and pokes to the IQ.I have not read, yep, just checked my database, I have not read any of Chuck Wendig's work before.

"Update Dateline the Next Day:I got a prompt reaction to my initial lukewarm review.  Due to that prompt positive reaction and assurance I could get local support, I tried setting up the router again today and got dramatically different results.  I ""swear"" I followed the exact same steps but today it was bing, bang and bong.  Everything fell into place. I got great wired speed and was able to see all three wireless bands from a tablet, a laptop and a desktop.  My wifi analyzer shows the TP-Link in green. It is at the same level as my Fios wireless and much higher than my Netgear wireless router. The photo from my yard did not come out but the green signal was 25% higher at a 150 feet.  So ignore what I wrote below, I have to assume I made some elementary error yesterday because today I am very happy with this router.my apologies to TP-LinkI followed the TP-Link Quick Installation Guide and set it up.  My tablet and my three wireless computers saw it and connected and used the Internet.  I tested the signal and it was strong throughout the house and even out in the yard.  I then followed the instructions which led me to the page to change the user name and password.  After I did that, it would not let me proceed to the management page.  I did a factory reset and tried again to no avail.  I called technical support and got a very pleasant but very hard to understand technician.  I am sure the language barrier impeded our progress.  We finally got through to the management screen and I did the quick start setup.  The only unit I had that would address the new password was my tablet.  My  other three devices would not log on to the wireless signal.  The hardwired unit was just fine but the wireless units would not connect.  I did another factory reset and all my wireless units will connect.  I have no clue why it doesn't accept a change of passwords but it doesn't.I tried the USB by hooking up a USB hard drive.  That was not recognized by my network.  This product may be fine but it certainly needs better documentation, a better setup and more English language training for it's support staff.  It works fine and has a strong signal as long as you are willing to run unprotected from someone changing your password as the admin/admin entry that gets you to the setup screen never did accept a change of password.  I'm disappointed in the product, for the price I expected a better implementation.  I'm not even going to bother attaching the screen shots of the wireless signal tests I ran since the unprotected nature certainly precludes the router's use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYYVM05ND7VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","R2UYYVM05ND7VN","A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These have a very good sound.  I tried them on my computer and my phone.  I called and left a message on my land line and the microphone performed just fine.  They were as comfortable as my much more expensive headphones are, which sadly isn't all that comfortable.  I frankly prefer ear buds but you do seem to get better sound out of this style.  The switch or microphone on the line is a bit obscure.  There was zero documentation so I pushed it, I guess that cut out the microphone, I wasn't 100% sure.  I would like a clearly labelled off or on and gasp maybe even some documentation.

"This is really a cute seal.  It seems well made and has a very appealing, gentle expression.  I am not sure how you control the front flippers as I saw no means of doing that.  The mouth is traditional hand puppet controlled.  I have a large adult hand and my fingers were no where near the flippers.  There are minimal insets or pockets at the flippers either so don't anticipate using the flippers regardless of the sales description.  If your hand is low enough to put fingers in the minimal flipper pockets, there is no way it will be long enough to operate the mouth.

"""The Aftermath of Battle: The Burial of the (U.S.) Civil War Dead"" by Meg Groeling, (Nov. 2015); no index; 300+ small b/w photographs within this medium-size paperback (174 pgs) .At the time of this review, no ""See Inside"" viewing option is available.  Normally, I would post the chapter titles, but here, listing the titles would be of little value -- as they don't readily identify the contents of the book.The author is a budding military historian, but without prior military service.  Hence, I believe the author misstated that ""Soldiers got to sleep in dog tents on the ground"" (p. 21).  I believe she is confused with quaint military terminology:  soldiers sleep in ""pup"" tents and wear ""dog tags"" identification tags.More of a civil war ""trivia""-like book.  Not a detailed medical ""how to amputate a limb"" book -- just a picture or two of severed limbs.Lists website addresses for some of the battlefields and the houses that were used as make-shift hospitals and are now museums.  Contains excerpts from diaries kept by grave diggers.  Discusses some of the photographers and their working conditions of working amongst spoiling corpses.Discussion of process how public funding was used in establishing national war cemeteries -- oftentimes several years after the battle, when the dead were disinterred, and reburied in more identifiable unit-cemeteries.Some discussion regarding the difficulty in burying the 1.5 million heavy horses and mules killed in combat (p. 36-39), or letting them simply rot in place, or burning them.Other ""mini topics"" discussed very briefly: Camp hygiene (p. 44)... limited battleifield medical practices ... creation of the Ambulance Corps ... mass casualties... amputations (photo of severed legs) ... [author noted: ""The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion"" and an on-line site] ... embalming (only for 6%) ...  development of undertaking industry ... how Charity Relief groups provided some limited help after battles ... looting of the dead .... how Pres. Lincoln acknowledged the dead during his Gettysburg speech... dead German WWI POWs buried at Chattanooga Nat. Cemetery... the dead from the Confederate submersible Hunley crew ... brief notes about Arlington Nat. Cemetery ... abandoned casualties during ""The Battle of the Wilderness"" ... attempts to identify the dead ... mixing of Union & Confederate graves ...  treatment of the dead at Andersonville prison ... Richmond, Virginia's ""Hollywood"" Confederate cemetery ... the ""Last Civil War Veteran"" ... recounting the Civil War dead ... and five short ""appendices"" accounts written by other contributors regarding some cemetery.Brief highlights, not complexities.  Not a list of all C.W. graveyards.  No footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography.  Not really a ""book"", but a strong ""paperback"" that contains many interesting ""factoids"" about seldom-discussed topics of what to do with the battlefield dead.  Will undoubtedly become a mainstay paperback at many U.S. Civil War battlefield museums.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361S6XDZ2DA4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611211891#wasThisHelpful","R361S6XDZ2DA4Y","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Feet of the Messenger"" by Solomon Blumgarten/Bloomgarten (b.1872-d.1927), wrote with the pen-name of: ""Yehoash"". He was born in Virbalis, Poland (now Lithuania), and later immigrated to the U.S. This book was originally written in Yiddish as: ""Fun Nyu-York biz Rehovotun Tzunik"" or ""Fun Nyu-Yor biz Reovot un Tsuri"".  Translated into English by Isaac Goldberg.  This work (supposedly)  appeared in three (?) volumes about 1923 with a total of 296 pages (80 words per paperback-size page). This book is based on the author's travels throughout Palestine c. 1914 when Palestine was stilled ruled by the Ottomans -- after having lived in the U.S. since about 1900.  The only date I found in this book is when the author noted that he decided to leave Ottoman-Palestine shortly after Russia declared war on Turkey on 2 Nov. 1914.At the time of this review, there is no ""Look Inside"" feature available.  The two ""Contents"" pages list 48 mini-chapters; sadly, their titles give little clue as to what is contained within the chapter; some of which are: Tel-Aviv; Metamorphoses; Dhurl-Khail Khamr; the Hagigah; Abu-Shusha;  El-Kuds esh-Sherif; Mount of Olives; Kiriath Arba; Lehitraoth be-Eretz Yisroel.While in Tel Aviv, the author noted: ""Yiddish here is taboo.  To speak Yiddish in public requires the utmost courage"" (p. 37); the objections came from other Jews who preferred Hebrew to be spoken!No details such as the number of Jews living in any specific cities, or how many children were attending school.  A short comment about the Anglo-Palestine Bank was founded to make business loans only to Jews; which was ""right in the centre of the filthy Arab quarter of Jaffa"" (p. 46).""Two Chicago Jews have arrived to open a ""sweat-shop"" clothing factory in Jerusalem"" (p. 45).Discusses his visit to a local high school:  ""I am shocked by the diversity of the garments.  It is as though everybody had purposely resolved to retain his native garb from Russia, Galicia, Germany .... I was scandalized by two pupils, who were dressed in uniforms of Russian gymnasia"" (p. 55).  But no details as to the number of students; just some comments regarding their looks.There is no breakdown of hours by subject; several involve the analysis of the Torah.  The author talks about immigrants, but doesn't provide any data regarding numbers or country of origin  -- he claims two-thirds of them eventually leave Palestine as they cannot find steady employment.  He discusses some local produce that are grown, but no data regarding quantities nor their market.He briefly discusses home building in Tel Aviv and their rental, but no data about numbers being built.  ""The price of real estate has increased tenfold ... Land is bought for speculation.""  ""Later I learned ... that the agent for American hinges employed only Arab labor on his buildings  Jewish workingmen were too radical -- too radical to work for starvation wages"" (p. 65).The author discusses a ""fight between Jews and Arabs"", an Arab attacked a Jew's son who in defending himself killed the attacking Arab... ""After that the Arabs and the Jews made peace....but should his son appear, nobody could be sure that one of the slain man's relatives would not seek vengeance"" )p. 71).  However, the author does not explain why the attack happened.  Like so much in this book, the author went to Palestine and saw it, but couldn't see it -- the author so frequently fails to provide any depth to what he sees -- he seldom asked: ""why?""Later, when being driven from Rehhoboth to Gezer, they drive over an Arab farmer's land; the Arab pricks up a stone to throw at them, other Arabs see what is going on, they come over to the slow-moving vehicle -- fortunately, an interpreter is able to calm things down (p. 155).He noted that amounted Jewish patrol guarded the city of Rehoboth at night P. 83) -- but why is not explained.The author notes his interest in the zoology of Palestine, but doesn't really provide much in detail of the different plants and animals.

"""Beyond No Mean Soldier"" by Peter McAleese (Oct. 2015), paperback, nice high-quality glossy 287 pgs; publ. by ""Helion & Co. Ltd."" and ""GG Books UK"" in England. In a note apparently from the publishers, this book is a ""completely revised and expanded edition"" of his 1993 classic ""No Mean Soldier"".  This book is essentially the author's biography with many photos of himself in various military-attire settings.The author was born  on 7 Sept. 1942 in Glasgow, Scotland..  At 17, the author joined a Parachute Regiment in March 1960 for a nine-year hitch.  Two years later he joined the SAS (Special Air Service) and went for jungle training in Malaya, and later trained with U.S. Special Forces at Ft. Bragg, NC for HALO training.  During that service he was off-and-on stationed in Aden, Cyprus, Borneo, & Guyana, and provides interesting insights into his tribulations in becoming an exceptional paratrooper.After retiring from the British Army, in 1977 the author joined the Rhodesian army, and in 1980 the South African army.  The author discusses his reasons in fighting for these white-minority regimes:  to oppose the communist-oriented groups interested in taking over these countries.During his African service, he recounts his military shootouts with FRELIMO, ZIPRA and ZANLA units.  He provides MANY very descriptive details of his engagements, which are not for the faint-of-heart.Leaving the South African army in late 1981, the author joined a private-security firm, engaging in protective services in that country.  The author provides many informative insights as to how South Africa's lifestyle changed as white-rule there transferred to a black-majority democracy.The author provides a very bull-dogged recovery story after a May 1984 a parachute jump left him with broken bones throughout his body -- it took several years for him to recover well.The author provides a very informative look at a private-security job in Columbia to attack a drug cartel in Casa Verde in late 1988, but the mission was cancelled.  Several months later, he returned Cali, Columbia to hunt down the drug king: Pablo Escobar (chapter 12).  The author goes into great detail in explaining his preparations in attacking Escobar's well-guarded villa, but while flying in on the initial assault, the pilot of his helicopter flew it into a fog-drenched mountain; again, the author suffered more broken bones, and the mission had to be cancelled.  The author displayed grime determination in making another long recovery to walk and work again.In 1991 the author published first book: ""No Mean Soldier"".  A couple of years later, the author landed a job with a Russian private-security firm, where he recounts what it was like trying to avoid encroaching on Russian Mafia businesses.You have seen many biographies with wide margins and large type with much spacing between sentences.  Well, in this book, there are almost 500 words on EVERY page!A most impressive read; I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in military adventure -- especially the harrowing life of a ""soldier of fortune"" as was the author's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UI37G6E02EM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910294012#wasThisHelpful","R3UI37G6E02EM6","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""PT 109"" by William Doyle, (Oct. 2015), 330 pgs.This book immediately conjures up a comparison with ""PT 109"" (220 pages) written by Robert Donovan in late 1961.I remember reading that book in 1966 and wrote to Mr. Donovan in my search to learn whether or not he had addresses of several of the individuals involved with either the sinking of PT 109 or the rescue of its crew members: Cpt. K. Yamashiro (senior officer aboard the Amagiri that crushed PT 109), Cpt. T. Hara (captain of the Shigure and who directed machine-gun firing at the sinking PT 109), coast-watcher Reg Evans, and islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana (who located Kennedy and suggested that he write a rescue-needed message on a coconut husk) -- all of whom I eventually contacted and receive autographed letters or photographs from (including a 9-page account written by Kumana about his discovery of Lt. John F. Kennedy).Doyle describes well the basic story of PT 109's sinking, Kennedy's swimming in search of help, his encounter with the islanders, and the writing of the coconut message -- all covered well already by Donovan in his earlier book.However, Doyle is able to provide additional details about the ship's sinking and rescue by his recent discovery of several after-actions reports written by Kennedy and others -- that were not known to Donovan.  A reader might ask:  ""Heck, after an event as minor as a PT boat being crushed by a destroyer during WWII, what more could be learned from this six-day trial of sea survival?""  Well, as the book's dustcover noted: ""Drawing on original interviews with the last living links to the events, previously untapped Japanese wartime archives, and a wealth of archival documents from the Kennedy Library, including a lost first-hand account by JFK himself"" author Doyle has enhanced our knowledge of this harrowing military adventure.  Specifically, the author conducted new interviews with Kennedy's shipmates, and the author had his Japanese-speaking wife research and translate a couple of Japanese newspapers that reported on this ""battle"", as well as translate a couple of Japanese naval documents relating to this naval engagement.  More interesting tidbits, but they don't change the ""basic picture.""Doyle notes that Kennedy was upset that no search-and-rescue operations were not immediately initiated --except ""Several New Zealand P-40 fighter aircraft flew in search of PT 109... spotted boat wreckage, but no survivors were visible"" (p. 134).  And his superior, Commander Warfield, believing that all crew members had been killed during the sinking, decided not to send out a search mission that might jeopardize the lives of other PT rescuers (p. 132).Besides recounting how Kennedy joined the navy, became a PT boat commander, was injured during his ship's destruction, and swam in search of help, Doyle expand's upon Donovan's work by noting in more detail how Kennedy used his ""war hero"" survival story to strengthen his bid in campaigning for his future political wins as a congressman, senator and finally President.Although Doyle's book highlights the bravery of Kennedy in trying to organize the survival of his crew after his ship's sinking, Doyle does present some criticism by those who question Kennedy's judgement in idling his boat's engines to quiet them to hear better in his search for Japanese ships.After winning his congressional race, Kennedy tried to contact Cpt. K. Hanami (who had ordered his ship to ram Kennedy's) during a trip to Japan in Nov. 1951, but wasn't successful -- due to perhaps a bout with Addison's disease (p. 218) -- which he tried to keep hidden from the public as he felt it might hurt his political career.While there is no specific ""Bibliography"" section, Doyle has a ""Notes and Sources"" section, whereby he cites his sources.  Doyle also explains that he found new accounts to draw upon to expand our knowledge of the basic event (p. xvi-xvii).If you've already read Donovan's book or Wikipedia articles, you know the basics of Kennedy's PT 109 story.  Nonetheless, while not changing the basic story, Doyle offers new details, but more importantly, provides a most informative analysis how that sinking contributed significantly in developing and furthering Kennedy's political career -- and how his father (Joe Sr.) and his brother (Robert) cajoled others to write ""war hero"" stories to enhance John's political career.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21P0QBJ7BOANY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006234658X#wasThisHelpful","R21P0QBJ7BOANY","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Politics of Social Change in the Middle East and Northern Africa"" by Manfred Halpern, (1963), 431 pages; a Rand Corporation report, w/ fold-out map.From the Rand Corp. about this [pre-1964] book:  ""An attempt to analyze the cause and character of a profound revolution taking place from Morocco to Pakistan. This Report examines the forces, groups, ideas, and institutions now in motion and estimates the direction which politics may take in the future in the area. While the transformation here under study embraces both the pervasive nationalist revolution and the ensuing ""revolution of rising expectations,"" its sources and ramifications are broader and run deeper than nationalism and its discontents: (1) a way of life 1,300 years old is being destroyed by challenges for which it was almost entirely unprepared; (2) a social system with new values is taking the place of traditional society; (3) a different range of ideological choices has opened up for a new kind of elite; (4) new political instruments are at the elite's disposal; (5) the fact that new men are using new means to attain new ends in their attempts to deal with the politics of social change entails widespread revolutionary consequences.""Table of Contents:Part I: The Legacy of the Past and the Claims of the PresentChapter 1: The Inheritance of the Islamic CommunityChapter 2: The Challenge of the Modern Age to IslamPart II : The Changing Structure of SocietyChapter 3: Kings, Landlords, and the Traditional Bourgeoisie: The Declining EliteChapter 4: The New Middle Class as the Principal Revolutionary and Stabilizing ForceChapter 5: Peasants: The Silent Majority at the Threshold of PoliticsChapter 6: Workers: The Growing Tide of the Unskilled and UnemployedPart III: The Range of Political ChoicesChapter 7: Amending the Past: Reformist IslamChapter 8: Resurrecting the Past: Neo-Islamic TotalitarianismChapter 9: Toward a New Age of Certainty: Communist TotalitarianismChapter 10: From Unorganized Insecurity to Organized Insecurity: NationalismChapter 11: Transforming the Present: The Quest for Freedom and AuthorityChapter 12: Transforming the Present: Socialism for the Few, for the Many, or for the Aggrandizement of the State?Part IV: Instruments of Political ModernizationChapter 13: The ArmyChapter 14: Political PartiesChapter 15: Trade UnionsChapter 16: The Civil BureaucracyPart V: The Cost and Consequences of Middle Eastern Choices Domestically, Regionally, and InternationallyChapter 17: The Price of Political StabilityChapter 18: Regional Rivalry and the Prospects for UnityChapter 19: The International Orientation of the Middle EastCritique:  This book pretty well discusses all of the Middle East countries, including Pakistan, in the above chapters.  My disenchantment here is that I believe it would have been better had the author wrote chapters classified by country, and then broken down my the above section-chapters.  For instance, if you wanted to analyze the problems of a specific country, you need to read each of the above chapters and parse out your country-specific interests.The author tries to tie in many countries into one chapter, such as ""Chapter 13: The Army"".  While some countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Syria tried some limited cooperation, not all of the other Arab countries really united their countries militaries into a united force.  This chapter is nice in bring many issues relating to ""The Army"" for comparison between the countries. and while it works on this topic -- I find other chapters seem to ""stretch out"" in a search for joint comparisons.A lot of ""background"" information prior to 1963, and the author writes very well -- I'd say even ""majestically"" as a professional, knowledgeable story-telling researcher -- a fine, talented word-smith.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XACWKEWH3984/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691030510#wasThisHelpful","R2XACWKEWH3984","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Politics of Terror: An Essential Hamas Lexicon"" by Guy Aviad (2014), no index.  This book's title perhaps should have been more direct like ""Hamas Lexicon"" or ""Who's Who in Hamas"".Of the 716 pages in this medium-size paperback, sadly, only a paltry 5% (33 pages) are devoted in explaining the development of Hamas between 1987-2012.6% reprint the Hamas' Charter, while 79% (567 pgs) is a ""Who's Who"" of those involved in the Hamas movement: some 300 biographies of Hamas followers who have committed some militant act (stabbing, killing, bombing or suicide-mission) against Israelis.  After reading about 15 such bios, they begin to blend together: some dude (primarily named Muhammad) infiltrated into Israel to stab or shoot some Israeli.The Hamas bios very in length from a half-page to maybe two pages.  The author provides a few tidbits about each member: name, where born, and what seemed to motivate the Hamas hedonist: he became enraged when back during the 1948 war some battle forced some relative to flee Israel (or he/she got roughed up a bit by an Israeli soldier while throwing stones at the apartheid occupiers), and the Hamas member wants to do his/her part in trying to destroy the Zionist state by committing some relatively small (and usually inconsequential) terrorist attack.  [Inconsequential only in the sense that the attack did not result in some ""decisive"" policy change by Israel.]So, who is really going to enjoy ""reading"" this factoid-name tome?  There is no really great ""operational strategy"" Hamas-attack plan revealed here -- outside of generally individual, one-on-one attacks.  Some policy analyzer could study each bio to see which particular background ""slight"" enraged a Hamas fighter.Appendix C: is a 14-page ""List of Major Attacks by Hamas"", detailing dates, attack method, where committed, and the number of victims killed.Mini-theme pages that are not included in the Contents page are: Hamas founding fathers; Bereaved (Palestinian) Parents; Prison inmates; Prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit deal; University grates by country of study; a list of Palestinian Legislative Council members and short lists of Hamas military squads; Kidnapped Israeli soldiers, Marj al-Zohour deportees,  Hamas explosives experts, Hamas suicide bombers, and major terrorist attacks.Not a captivating or exciting read, but if you want to know the 300 major players in Hamas before 2012, this is your book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLWC5APD2GDVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9655502821#wasThisHelpful","RLWC5APD2GDVU","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Red Circle"" by Brandon Webb.  I read several of the 2-star and 3-star reviews, many of which thought that this book was too long, and/or covered too much of the author's teenage angst years with his father -- who didn't seem to have very great parenting skills in communicating-fathering with this son.  I thought that the author's recounting of his youth years was just about right; they were relevant in understanding his growing up along the California coast and diving -- all of which contributed in preparing him for his Navy SEAL career.Others thought that were would be more shoot-'em-up stories about the Afghan/Iraq wars; he recounted primarily his own battles -- and some involving his buddies or students.  This was the first SEAL book that I have read -- so I found almost very paragraph of interest.

"Partial comments by Wolfgang Schwanitz from the Fall 2015 ""The Middle East Quarterly"":""Ethnographer ÃzyÃ¼rek, born and raised in Turkey and now living in America, explores Muslim life in Germany. She investigates Muslim immigrants and post-1989 East German converts. Her key thesis is highly controversial: that the search by German and other European-born converts for a purified Islam can best be understood in a climate of increasing xenophobia and hostility to Islam. The reader might ask if that hostility is indeed increasing, and, if in a less heated climate, would there be no search for a ""true Islam?""""Religious minorities, ÃzyÃ¼rek posits, cannot fully embrace their minority position, nor entirely abandon it, nor cause it to disappear completely. Politicians insist that Muslims can live in Germany as citizens, but their religion or Islamic identity is often not accepted. In turn, they try to respond to this challenge by showing that one can be, for instance, a conservative Muslim and a good German citizen at the same time. Thus, they willingly let their ethnic identities as Arabs, Turks, Bosnians, or Indians slip into the background, says the author.....""Her field work from 2006 to 2011 included studying lectures and social activities for converts in eight mosques operating mainly in the German language. Additionally, ÃzyÃ¼rek conducted interviews with sixty-six converts and fourteen born-Muslims; these form the most vibrant section of her book.....""Surprisingly, she finds that, for East Germans, becoming Muslim is ""a way of escaping their East German identity"" (although many East Germans Muslims still have a proud identity as participants in the overthrow of a totalitarian regime). Born Muslims, on the other hand, promote a more de-culturalized Islam as a way for them to integrate.""In terms of field research, this book is a trail-blazer. Although not free of stereotypes, including those regarding East Germans, it offers quality food for thought on many of the main issues of Muslim integration and non-integration in Germany, and constitutes a solid base to compare results with other parts of Europe.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CB7U9H9CNKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691162794#wasThisHelpful","R16CB7U9H9CNKZ","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Partial comments by Wolfgang Schwanitz  in the Fall 2015 ""The Middle East Quarterly"":""ElsÃ¤sser of the Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel offers a detailed account of the status of Coptic Christians under Husni Mubarak's regime (1981-2011). The author defines the ""Coptic question"" as a complex of issues ranging from the struggles of daily life to constitutional questions to the problem of political participation.""The author argues that, in the Mubarak era, human rights and civil society groups saw Coptic concerns within the framework of authoritarianism and human rights violations though the rise of public discussion of these issues marked a breakthrough for Coptic grievances. Unlike in previous discourses on national unity and religious patriotism, the debates on citizenship provided a widely accepted conceptual framework in which different problems such as legal and administrative discrimination or human rights violations against the Copts could properly be addressed.....""The author finds that Muslim and Christian religious revivalism appeared simultaneously and share similar ideas and social bases (the educated middle class). He posits that Coptic revivalists have little political ideology, certainly nothing remotely comparable to their Muslim rivals such as the Islamist Sayyid Qutb. Christian revivalism, also, focuses on increased spiritual interest or renewal of the life of the church.""ElsÃ¤sser sees the current volatile state of Muslim-Christian affairs and rising sectarian tensions as the legacy of the Mubarak era. But the 2014 Egyptian constitution for the first time offers a ""democratic system,"" and article three allows Christians and Jews ""their Shari'as"" as the main source of civil legislation to ""regulate their respective personal status, religious affairs, and selection of spiritual leaders.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RP7DBINZ0NZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199368392#wasThisHelpful","R1RP7DBINZ0NZF","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Partial comments by Steven Rosen in the Fall 2015 ""The Middle East Quarterly"":""This thorough and authoritative account assembles the definitive record of Israel's policy toward the Palestinian refugee issue in the early years of the state. Tovy of the Herzl Institute at the University of Haifa examines the origins of Israel's policy toward repatriation, resettlement, compensation, blocked bank accounts, internal refugees, and family reunification, drawing on declassified archives from government meetings, Knesset committees, and files of the prime minister's advisor on Arab affairs.Tovy illustrates how, beginning with Israel's creation in 1949, its first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, came under great pressure to accept the return of large numbers of Arabs displaced during Israel's war of independence. At home, the second largest party in the Knesset, Mapam, a Marxist-Zionist party allied with the Soviet Union, advocated for full repatriation of all Arab refugees. Abroad, the Truman administration initially called upon Israel to accept repatriation of 200,000-250,000 Arab refugees, a number that would have raised the Arab minority in the fledgling state from 13 to 30 percent and created staggering political, economic, and security problems.""The author examines how Ben-Gurion deflected the pressure with a policy that was adroit rather than confrontational....  Ben-Gurion did not, however, declare absolute opposition to the great powers. Instead, he deflated the issue by saying it should be resolved at a peace conference with Israel's Arab neighbors, at which time an appropriate balance between resettlement, compensation, and repatriation would be negotiated. This put the burden on the United States and Britain to bring the Arabs to the table for a realistic dialogue, something the Arabs would not accept.""In Tovy's opinion, Ben-Gurion's approach worked. In just a few months, U.S. policy shifted from pressure on Israel to accept repatriation, to various proposals for an economic solution, to resettlement through regional cooperation. However, this has left the refugee problem unresolved....""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BDPH3CFFJI3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=041565999X#wasThisHelpful","R3BDPH3CFFJI3H","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Partial comments by Michael Rubin in the Fall 2015 ""The Middle East Quarterly"":""The author provides a narrative, both readable and substantive, tracking the major trends in Iran over the past century..... In separate chapters, she explores the major ideological trends that have dominated the Iranian political landscape: communism, ""revolutionarism,"" and ideological Islam.""Shirali displays an impressive ability to describe the big picture and illustrate salient trends, but her consideration of the clergy makes The Mystery of Contemporary Iran path-breaking. Many authors include them among Iran's engines of change. Shirali argues, however, that both liberalism and political reform frightened the clergy, setting the stage for increasingly reactionary behavior not only in the aftermath of the constitutional revolution but also against the backdrop of Mosaddiq's agrarian reforms and the shah's modernization drive of the 1960s and 1970s. One of her most startling contributions is evidence showing how clerical intransigence evolved into support for terrorism decades before Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution took the world by surprise.""With so much new academic work in Iranian studies blighted by arcane theory, apologetics, and a narrow, irrelevant focus, Shirali's work is a breath of fresh air, offering a masterful and must-read combination of political and intellectual history.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D27CZAXQTY20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1412854628#wasThisHelpful","R1D27CZAXQTY20","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Partial comments from a review by Stephen Schwartx in the Fall 2015 ""The Middle East Quarterly"":""Haider's volume is by no means an introduction to the Shiite tradition in Islam. Rather, it is the author's analysis of features of Shiism that have drawn his attention, emphasizing details that for a reader little acquainted with the sect will likely be difficult to follow and of little interest.....Thus, while discussing the transformation over time of the Khoja Shiites and their absorption into Niza'ri Isma'ilism, the reader is forced to suffer through rather predictable but, nonetheless, lamentable quotations from leftist sociologist Frantz Fanon and Palestinian apologist Edward Said, culminating in a sharp critique of the movement's current leader, Aga Khan, IV, for what Haider calls his ""modernist"" ideas and attachment to capitalism.For the author, the ""collective memory"" of Shiites, focused on the legitimacy of Muhammad's son-in-law Ali as successor to the Muslim prophet, his assassination in 661 C.E., and the subsequent battle of Karbala, in which Ali's son Hussein was slain, recede into the background. They serve merely as markers to distinguish between the main Shiite traditions: the Twelvers, the Isma'ilis, and the Zaydis. Comparison of the differences in narratives of Karbala among these groupsâwhich focus on a cosmic significance in the martyrdom of Hussein among the Twelvers and Isma'ilis, and a less spiritual protest over the break in Muhammad's lineage for the Zaydisâprovides a simple reference for scholars.For those who have some acquaintance with Shiism, this volume may prove a useful handbook in sorting out differences within the sect. For most newcomers to the subject, it will likely prove confusing and a waste of time.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUUAOZ8Z9WEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107625785#wasThisHelpful","R2KUUAOZ8Z9WEV","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Partial comments by Alex Joffe from his review in the Fall 2015 ""Middle East Quarterly Review"":""From the creation of the Palestinian Student Association at the University of Cairo in 1944 to that of the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) in 1959, student organizations have been at the forefront of political activism and have provided cadres of leadership to various Palestinian factions. As successive waves of political fervor washed over Arab society, student politics followed suit: revolutionary leftism, pan-Arabism, and Islamism have been prominent themes. Zelkovitz details how Palestinian students, particularly those living far from the Middle East, tended to be more radical and routinely pushed against compromises that could bring peace. GUPS, for example, not only reached out to leftists in Europe throughout the 1960s but provided support to Palestinian terrorists there and in the Middle East.""Zelkovitz provides a wealth of detail regarding student movements, their constant in-fighting, and the ways they were both vied over and, in turn, influenced by political movements. Universities were not only an arena for activism against Israel but also a place for each faction to demonstrate its ability to lead Palestinians.""Universities have also been vital for nationalizing Palestinian society, especially after 1967, when the first such institutions were established in the West Bank and Gaza. According to Zelkovitz, inept Israeli efforts to control them, their staff, and curricula, backfired badly. This helped bolster various nationalist visions on campus, first Fatah's and then Hamas's.""Zelkovitz notes that Palestinian student radicalism now propels North American universities too: Uncompromising opposition to Israel, the baseline of Arab and Muslim student politics, has also become the touchstone there for leftist university politics.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUQ083215W5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R623FPW#wasThisHelpful","RFUQ083215W5E","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""With Paulus at Stalingrad"" by German Col. Wilhelm Adam & Otto Ruhle; translated by Tony Le Tissier; Pen & Sword Books; published in the UK, with 287 pages in English, no index; includes 4 pages of maps, but only 8 pages of glossy photographs; Sept. 2015.Co-author Otto Ruhle, a former soldier and a friend of the author who assisted in the author's research, in ""close working association assisted in the publication of this book""; originally in the German language in Nov. 1965.Col. W. Adam was senior aide-de-camp to German Colonel-general (later Fieldmarshall) Friedrich Paulus during the German 6th Army's ill-fated attempted capture of the Russian city of Stalingrad around Sept. 1942 - late Jan. 1943.After capturing much of Stalingrad, the German army was surrounded by the Russians -- which effectively caused the starving Germans to surrender in Jan. 1943. Following the surrender, the author remained in captivity until Sept. 1948, when he chose to settle in communist East Germany. There he converted to becoming a communist apparatchik -- along with a number of other German officers, including Paulus. Adam eventually rose to become a general in the East Germany army, and after retiring in 1958 began to write this book -- which was first published as ""Der schwere Entschluss"" in East Germany in Nov. 1965.This book is Col. Adam's account of his combat service with Lt. Gen. Paulus after the later became commander-in-chief of the 6th Army in late Jan. 1942 on the Eastern Front, until their joint surrender just a year later in Stalingrad to the Russians.  As Paulus never got around to writing his own account, Adam's book here is the only one I know of that was written by someone on Paulus' staff.  Yes, when you read a typical book about ""Fortress Stalingrad"" you read the same accounts of the final surrender -- this book provides more details.At the time of this review (1 Sept. 2015), there is no ""Look Inside"" feature to this book (I'm sure one will be provided soon). Hence, a brief listing of the chapters and a few limited sub-topics:Chapter 1: Marching to the Volga [Jan. - Aug. 1942] - (Gen. Paulus' assumption of command; discussions with Gen. Keitel; Hitler's attack aims for 1942; Filed Marshal von Bock has to go; Thrust over the Don) {48 pages long}.Chapter 2: The Shattered Attack on the City [Sept. -Nov. 1942] (The 'Land Bridge' between the Don and the Volga; Gen. von Wietersheim is relieved; Gumrak main dressing station; Little success with great losses; The enemy has grown; The tragi-comedy of winter clothing) (40 pages}.Chapter 3: Counteroffensive and Encirclement [Nov. - Dec. 1942] (The storm breaks; Paulus and Schmidt fly into the cauldron {Stalingrad}; Defence without heavy weapons) {25 pgs}.Chapter 4: Between Hope and Destruction [Dec. 1942] (I fly into the cauldron; Breakout forbidden; 'Fortress Stalingrad'; Goring's lie about air supply; Christmas in the cauldron) {55 pgs}.Chapter 5: An End to the Horrors [Jan. 1943] (Fantastic breakout plans; The tragedy of the wounded; the decision to surrender) {45 pgs}.Chapter 6: New Shores [Feb. 1943 - 1958] (Meeting the Russian victors; Discussion about the National Committee 'Free Germany'; Going over to the National Committee's side' Field Marshal Paulus turns against Hitler; the war's end; Nuremburg; Returning home to the New East Germany) {62 pgs}.Chapter 7: For the New Germany (reflections) {5 pgs}.So, what personality/moral traits can we learn about Col Adam?  Well, by serving in the German military during WWII he supported German dictator Adolf Hitler and his destructive goals, and the author seemed to struggle somewhat before converting to support another dictatorial system: Stalin's communist rule -- rather than moving to the democracy-driven West Germany.  We can surmise that he saw a better income in serving in the East German military, whereas as  ""turn-coat"" he probably would have had a difficult time in re-joining the W. German army.As the translator noted: ""Adam's [book] is noticeable for the complete lack of any criticism or adverse comment about the Soviets.""The author, having served on Paulus' staff inside ""The Cauldron"" of encirculed Stalingrad, provides very detailed accounts of the discussions of the staff in how best to defend ""Fortress Stalingrad"" from Russian attack, as well as their analysis leading to the decision to surrender.I'm not going to recount how Paulus made some decision to transfer some unit to some other sector, instead, I'd like to provide some unusual tidbits:Regarding the wounded Adam noted they were ""wrapped in blankets and bits of tent, with sacks and bandages on their frozen feet instead of boots.  They were hardly soldiers any more.  They were a broken, disarmed mob""  (p. 149).One might ask: ""What influenced the author to turn his back on Hitler, his country, his Germany army, to support the Soviet effort in enticing other German soldiers to defect to the Russians.  Addressing this issue would take some time, but it started as the author began reading Soviet propaganda leaflets that had been dropped into Stalingrad  and that urged German soldiers to desert for a safer life (p. 178).In reviewing this book, one needs to contemplate whether or not Adam's conversion to communism influenced his revelations in this book.  I'll let others muse this topic-- but one must be aware of such influence.  Such influences are not blatant: ""Germans bad; Russians good.""  It took about 6 months in captivity, and reading various communist tracts, before the author began to turn against Hitler and develop agreement with his communist handlers.Adam doesn't relate many ""personal"" stories of witnessing some German soldier losing a leg after stepping on a landmine, he wrote more generalized descriptions of witnessing some pack of soldiers freezing along some road.The author explained that he and Gen. Paulus (and most generals) were ""apolitical"", in that they ""followed their orders"".  The author said that he and Paulus didn't really contemplate how the policies of Fuhrer Hitler were hurting German civilians.After their surrender, German communists were able to slowly develop a (for the lack of a better word) ""guilt complex"" amongst some of the generals by pointing out how Hitler really didn't care about the suffering of German soldiers and civilians -- essentially, what was the purpose of the war?After evaluating that Hitler's regime was not only ""bad"" for the Germans, but also ""evil"", the author, Paulus and other German officers joined a movement to publicly call for the over through of Hitler to prevent further destruction of Germany.I don't know why it took so long for this book to be released in English -- maybe due to some copyright issues.  But it certainly is one that is a ""must"" read for understanding the thinking of Paulus' staff during their long refusal to surrender after being surrounded by the Russians.Very BRIEF discussion of his post-war activities in the E. German government.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H21SK9O2DISV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1473833868#wasThisHelpful","R1H21SK9O2DISV","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Stalingrad: The City that Defeated the Third Reich"" by Jochen Hellbeck (April 2014), [originally published in German in Oct. 2012 as ""Die Stalingrad Protokolle""].  There are many photographs sprinkled throughout this book.Essentially, this book is a collection of hundreds of excerpted statements from various Russian sources regarding the horrific battle (Aug. 1942 - Feb. 1943) between Russian and German armies over a Russian city: Stalingrad.  [Its importance was more psychological than strategic: the Germans wanted to capture a city named in honor of the Russian oligarch, while the Russians wanted to defend it for the same reason.]Amazingly, in looking at the ""Look Inside"" option, it appears that the entire book has been made available for reading on-line (so much for trying to protect the contents of this book from free reading).Besides being merely a listing of selected excerpts, the author provides an introduction and analysis of each chapter topic.  Given the readily available ""Look Inside"" feature, there is no need for me to list all of the Table of Contents or themes here.To me, what I found of particular interest, was the section from Chapter 2 regarding ""The Capture of Field Marshal Paulus"" (pages 222-261).  I've previously read several accounts of Paulus' surrender, but I found much new information here.  So it was interesting to learn how many of the different Russian participants commented on how ""dirty"" they found the German rooms to be -- apparently, few Germans were brave enough to try to toss out their human waste while Russian shells were raining down outside.The Russian accounts ring true with my other readings of Paulus' surrender: he was pallid, disheveled, almost totally out-of-focus regarding the conduct of the battle, and almost seemingly uncaring about his appearance or the well-being of his troops.In this book though are the first accounts I have read of Russians killing Germans after their surrender:  ""Prisoners were being brought out with frostbitten feet, bandaged heads...But I did use my pistol to finish off their wounded in the basements"" (p.256) and an account: ""You'd often hear them [Germans] saying that our [Russian] success at Stalingrad was all due to chance...Our commandant grabbed one of them by the sleeve, dragged him off, and shot him"" (p.257).Besides the excerpted comments of Russians who participated in the battle, excerpts from German publications are also provided to portray the experiences of how Germans suffered following their surrender.  I believe fewer than 10% survived to successfully return to Germany after their eventual release in 1956.There will be those who contend that some/much of this book is merely Soviet propaganda, I'll let others debate the validity of the readings -- I'm not an expert in this field.I like reading accounts of ""I Was There"" events -- I like learning of the original observations rather than summarized opinions.  As such, I am very pleased with so many first-hand accounts regarding this battle -- I highly recommend this book.  {As a companion book, I suggest: ""Survivors of Stalingrad: Eyewitness Accounts"" by Reinhold Busch, Oc.t 2014}","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDUK4W6MIUFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610394968#wasThisHelpful","R2TDUK4W6MIUFO","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Panzer Operations: Germany's Panzer Group 3 during the Invasion of Russia, 1941"" by Gen. Hermann Hoth (April 2015), which was originally published in German in 1956.  As the subtitle of this book states, the battlefield scope of this book focuses on Panzer Group 3 during its invasion of Russia between June-Oct. 1941, although the author does review the ""Big Picture"" of the overall invasion..Although this book totals 215 pages, 10% of the book is devoted to appendices & bibliography.  The author devotes 6 pages to his thoughts regarding the viability of tanks during a possible nuclear war in Europe -- which really don't add much to this book.  Fortunately,  16 pages are of nice campaign maps.  The author spends several pages analyzing the differences between ""operational"" versus ""strategic"" goals versus ""tactics"" (p.28) and how such thoughts were contemplated by Clausewitz versus Scharnhorst, and how such thoughts influenced the German military mind during the 1870s, WWI, and Hitler.As the author noted: ""This book does not purport to be a definitive account of the military history of the Russian campaign"" (p.7) ... ""In the first few months of the Russian campaign, [the author's] Panzer Group 3 was the middlemost of the three northern German panzer groups"".The author noted: ""The pros and cons of an attack against Russia are thoroughly described elsewhere"" (p,39), but he does devote a couple of pages reviewing how the German campaigns against England (Operation Sealord), and in the Balkans, influenced Hitler's time-schedule in invading Russia (Operation Barbarossa).Hence, with all of the author's prior-to-battle analysis, his discussion regarding his actual invasion and initial battles inside Russia are reduced to barely 80 pages -- but the author's prior-to-battle reflection is still very useful in understanding some of the battle-preparation thoughts of Hitler's staff as they developed the Russia-invasion plans -- and how they debated how much initial emphasis should be devoted to destroying Russian military units before turning attention to capturing political targets (Moscow vs. Leningrad).As a graduate of the U.S. Army's ""Command & General Staff College"" myself, it was insightful that the author high-lighted some of the invasion problems:  roads were more paved in northwestern Russia than in the south, different terrains (forests versus marshlands) constricted armour-column traffic routes, could bridges be secured before the Russians could destroy them?, where were Russian military units deployed?, how many Russian units were mech verses horse-drawn?, how soon would new and stronger Russian tanks replace weaker under-armed tanks?, how the lack of railroad lines impeded troop advancement?,  etc.The author noted how German generals debated whether or not to allow panzer units to rapidly advance -- as slower-moving supporting units might have to be left behind and play a slow catch-up (p.73).No need here to recount how the author, Gen. Hoth, maneuvered his Panzer Group 3 during the invasion, except to note that he provided nice details as to how he conducted his maneuvers in advancing and encircling Russian units.  He noted disputes between German military commanders, as how some Russian units escaped (temporarily) when Gen. Guderian decided to capture terrain heights to deprive them from the enemy (p.113).  Gen. Hoth also discussed how campaigns changed (usually for the worse) as Hitler changed his mind as to how his units should be deployed within Russia -- even by mid-July (barely 30 days into the invasion).  Besides discussing his own maneuvers, Gen. Hoth also describes how adjacent units were also affected by changes from Hitler's directives.Gen. Hoth limits his book to essentially operational issues, he doesn't comment upon whether or not any of his units assisted in the rounding up of Jews or punishment of captured Russian guerrilla-partisans.I highly recommend this very informative book.[A companion book regarding the harsh treatment of captured Jews and partisans during the 1941 invasion by the German XXXXIII Corps is: ""A German General on the Eastern Front"" by Johannnes Hurter -- being a limited history of German Gen. Gotthard Heinrici between 1941-42.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13PR1J1GRS6MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612002692#wasThisHelpful","R13PR1J1GRS6MH","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cathedral of the Wild"" by Boyd Varty, March 2014; 281 pages.  This is a story written by a 29-year-old male of his experiences growing up c. 1979 on an South African game preserve since the age of 5.He had many close encounters in being killed (let alone being merely badly injured) by the local wildlife (either elephant, rhino, croc or by one of a multitude of venomous snakes) but survived -- despite either his father or uncle who led him into a never ending-series of potentially deadly encounters with ever-hungry wildlife.While he enjoyed growing up in the game preserve, in his early twenties he grew restless and wanted to see more of the world -- so he headed off to India and traveled through that expansive land.Nonetheless, the feelings for his family finally pulled him back to South Africa -- at a time when it was struggling to shove off its white apartheid heritage in favor of, essentially, emancipation for its black majority.One unsolved mystery that tormented the author's soul was the on-going lawsuit between several investors in the game preserve -- the author mentioned it infrequently, but frequently enough to pike a reader's interest, but by the end of the book their is no resolution to the lawsuit: the reader is just left twisting in the wind wondering what was the out come of the lawsuit -- and its impact upon the management of the game preserve.While reading this book, while one admires the author's dad in introducing him to the raw nature of an ""eat or be eaten"" world, at times one is aghast in learning how irresponsible the author's father seemed to be in putting his son in harm's way.For those who enjoy a read that puts them in a sweat in wondering how the author is going to survive some dangerous encounter with ""what big teeth you have"" wildlife -- then this book is for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34WQ62176J3DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069858#wasThisHelpful","R34WQ62176J3DE","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Partial comments by Jeremy Sigler in the 23 March 2015  on-line ""Tablet Magazine""]:..."" A big bunch of Polaroids (over a thousand) that the artist Balthus never intended to show to the world are now ...printed in a book .... And while these rare jewels are being showcased for a few, there is a significant effort being made to keep these pictures out of the hands of the general public.""Balthus ...  went to his grave without ever declaring these Polaroids or anything made with emulsion and light-sensitive paper to be his art, while those of us who have been lucky enough to see these Polaroids now find ourselves reacting to this new unauthorized addition to the artistâ oeuvreâunsure if we are thrilled to be informed or if we are burdened by this new and incriminating visual evidence....""I had not intended to review these Polaroids....Balthusâ photographs are a very soft-core form of, um, well, âkiddy appreciation.â Right on the line of inappropriateness, they could be called âultra softâ core, like the toilet paper. They feel perfectly safe, and perfectly friendly, and are not the least bit seedy.""In this context of epic transgression, Balthus would be thought of as totally harmless. ....Balthus, in other words, was getting in touch with his inner extended puberty.  I like to refer to this as the âeternal coming-of-age story,â and we all have the capacity to live this life.......""The story has it that between 1990 and 2000, Annaâthe youngest daughter of Balthusâ doctorâwas recruited to be Balthusâ model. She began the ritual of coming to the chalet to pose when she was merely 8, and the dance continued every Wednesday afternoon until she was 16!""The critic Ingrid Sischy, who reviewed the Polaroids in their debut show at Gagosianâs New York gallery in 2013, describes the scene well: âAnna is dressed in either a tartan or a white dress when she is younger, typically posing in an armchair, but as time goes on she moves to a chaise lounge and wears a brocade robe that sometimes falls open, so sheâs partially nude.â""And I would add my own observation that the knee of the back leg is usually up and the front leg is usually bent downâextending off the edge of the daybed into the foreground and out of the frame. Thus the picture is open and inviting, but also cozy and nurturing. With each repeating close-up (often completely out of focus), the artist attempts to lock in and stabilize the figure. The back arm is often thrown up over the modelâs head, while the front arm is usually down and relaxed. The geometry formed by the slanted arms and legs is frequently that of the running man symbol or swastika.""One excellent feature of the Steidl book is a short text written by Anna Wahli.......""Now, due to the Polaroids, we get to leave the artistâs primary medium of painting and drawing behind, maybe for the first time ever. We get to âgo it aloneâ without the marriage of his beloved medium. We get to see what he saw (or didnât see; ironically). These Polaroids are suddenly activated by our gaze on the muse and the museâs performance for usânot for Balthus....""By reacting so strongly and with such pleasure to the Polaroids arenât I validating them and thus undermining the artistâs intentions to âsay itâ in paint? And yet, I feel like these Polaroids may be among his greatest achievement, and I am glad that they were put out in the world.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFAPYNIUEOVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3869306858#wasThisHelpful","RSFAPYNIUEOVW","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Lives of Muhammad"" by Kecia Ali (2014).[Partial comments from a review by Robert Spencer in the Spring 2015 ""Middle East Quarterly""]:""Ali's work evaluates and compares biographies of Muhammad, ancient and modern, favorable and unfavorable, arguing that the emphases of these life histories reflect the concerns of the age in which they were written. ...""However, Ali's book is guilty of a grave defect: She is generally disdainful of biographies that are critical of Muhammad while dismissing legitimate concerns about the examples that stories about him set for contemporary Muslims. Her chief complaint, for example, about this author's [Robert Spencer] own biography, ""The Truth about Muhammad"", is that while it provides ""reasonably accurate information,"" it is ""framed and interpreted in relentlessly negative ways."" Conversely, she characterizes authors of positive biographies such as Karen Armstrong and Tariq Ramadan as ""public intellectuals""; this author [Robert Spencer], on the other hand, is described as a ""professional polemicist"" and the ""grand pooh-bah of the legion of American Islamophobes.""""Similarly, Ali's use of the propaganda neologism ""Islamophobe"" to tar Muhammad's critics mars the academic value of her work. Her preference for admirers of Muhammad frequently clouds her ability to evaluate the data. ....""The premise of The Lives of Muhammad is intriguing, and it contains a good deal of useful information. It is, however, marred by the author's failure to take seriously the numerous reasons why Muhammad is so deeply problematic a figure for non-Muslims and secular Muslims alike.

"""The Lost Spring: U.S. Policy in the Middle East & Catastrophes to Avoid"" by Walid Phares, 2014.When I ordered this book, I had really hoped that I would like learning much from Mr. Phares' observations.  I had hoped that it would be better than a speech that I had listened to his about two years ago in Woodinville, WA -- where he spoke about the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions that were then underway in the Middle East.  Sadly, it was a rather disjointed speech, rambling between various topics without really tying them together.This book is a little better, at least he, or his editor, tried to keep each chapter focused.  Sadly, the entire book is overly verbose:  many words were written, but repeatedly repeated.  I believe that this book could have easily been condensed by half or more.I appreciate what the author is trying to do:  alert the public to the anti-democratic philosophy of the Islamists, whether of the Muslim Brotherhood or al-Qaeda ilk.But who is Mr. Walid Phares? While he has a brief bio on the inside of the book's book-jacket -- it is too short to give any credence as to who he is in giving us his thoughts.  In his ""Acknowledgments"" he notes dozens of names that he has discussed his ideas with, but informs us of few of the ideas coming from those conversations.It seemed like in the first quarter of this book the author bemoans that few are interested in heeding his warnings about how either the revolutions were ready to emerge throughout the Middle East in the early 2010s, and he fears that now that the revolutions have broken out, how few are willing to head his concerns as to how the Pres. Obama administration is stifling the pro-democracy revolutionaries in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood that will stifle those yearning to live free of the harsh Islamist oppression.  He wants to heard as a modern-day Paul Revere -- but fears being viewed as more of a William Dawes -- sounding the same alarm as Mr. Robert Spencer (Jihad Watch), but few listening, or worse, remembering him.The author reviews how the revolutions developed throughout the Middle East, but then re-examines  and re-tells us the same descriptions over and over again.  Brevity would have been better, but more importantly, more ""meat"" about those revolutions needed to be documented -- far too many generalizations as to what happened, and too few names of groups and specific details as to how the revolutionaries organized their demonstrations.After trying to stay awake in reading the first 160 pages of this book, I finally came upon what I believe is the best part of this book: Chapter Eleven, where the author analyzed how Pres. Obama essentially ignored the pro-democracy revolutionaries to support instead the anti-democratic Muslim Brotherhood.The author downplays the significance of the split between the Sunni and Shia sects, instead, he seems to believe that ""moderate"" Muslims are somehow going to coalesce in debunking the Islamists.  Too much wordiness and lack of substance in this book.  His heart and mind are in the right, just wish he could be more effective in exposing it in print.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZGYPJ1IB172/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279036#wasThisHelpful","RYZGYPJ1IB172","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Through Bolshevik Russia"" by (Viscount Philip) Mrs. Ethel  Snowden; 1920, 190 pgs.  This book developed from an investigation that she participated in between April-June 1920, at the behest of the British Labor Party.  It is her travelogue of her 6-week trip through a small area of the newly emerging Bolshevik Russia.  Her journey was in part in an attempt to entice the Russian communist government to enter into peace talks with Poland, which had attempted to seize a small section of Russia, as well as entice the British government to end its blockage of Russia -- which was curtailing the importation of goods for Russia's poor.This is not a profound, investigative-journalism account of life under the post-Czar USSR.  However, the author wrote a sympathetic view of the poor Russians that she encountered.  She was ""happy"" for the revolution overthrowing the Czars, but she was dismissive of the Bolshevik coup d'Ã©tat in installing a  non-elective, minority-ruling government.At the time of my review, there was no ""look inside"" feature.  Hence, following is the  Table of Contents:IntroductionChapter 1: A Starving People [""Besides the lack of food there is an almost entire lack of medicines, anesthetics, linen for bandages, disinfectants and soap"" (p.18)]2: Making Our Plans3: Ghosts [when visiting private properties that had been confiscated by the communists, she wondered what had happened to their previous owners; ""When we rode in the czar's motor-car, I did not feel the presence of my fellow-delegates, but the ghosts of the new dead unhappy, little man and his family"" (p.38)]4: Investigating on Propaganda5: The Communists6: The Artists Life of Russia7: The Military Power of Russia8: Education and Religion9: Off to Moscow10: An Interview with Lenin  [from her 1.5 hours interview with Lenin, she wrote ""He impressed me with his fanaticism.

"""Leaves from an Autumn of Emergencies: Selections from the Wartime Diaries of Ordinary Japanese"" by Samuel Hideo Yamashita, (2005), 331 pages.  The author has read numerous diaries written by Japanese civilians and soldiers during World War II, and from them has selected eight of them for reduction to only 20-30 pages each.  The author undertook this reduction to highlight various insights and experiences of these civilians.Most of these ""how I survived the war"" diary entries discuss the difficulty of obtaining extra food, as the rations provided by the government were so meager -- more than just hunger pangs: some suffered outright starvation.Other quotations are about how some believed that Japan was still going to win the war, even as they saw more and more of the cities around them being firebombed into near obliteration.  Others doubted that their air-force could actually sink 20 American warships during a single battle.  Some discussed their doubts about the sincerity of their politicians in being honest in reporting on the outcome of various battles  -- as more and more American airplanes appeared overhead, and how the battle-lines of the war-front continually shrank as Japanese forces were overrun.As at the time of this review there was no ""view inside"" feature, following are the book's chapter titles:""Chapter One: Introduction: The Pacific War and Ordinary Japanese"": a review as to how the author make his selections from various war diaries [48 pages].""Chapter Two: The Diary of a Navy Special-Attack Pilot"": selections from the diary of a kamikaze (tai-atari) pilot who after training to become a suicide dive-bomber had to wait over a year before finally crashing into an American warship.  Hard to believe that this guy so badly wanted to die for his country -- especially after so many of his co-pilots had met a fiery death.  [30 pages].""Chapter Three: Bittersweet: The Wartime and Postwar Diary of an Ordinary Kyoto Person"": details of growing disillusioned with the war effort [50 pages].""Chapter Four: The Diary of a Defeated Japanese Soldier"": a disillusioned Japanese soldier on Okinawa doesn't learn about the end of the War until 30 days later -- he surrenders, but feels ashamed.  His daily comments as to how he held out in small caves while American soldiers searched for him and other stragglers.

"""The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War In Afghanistan"" by Graeme Smith, Jan. 2015.  The author covered the Afghan war from 2005 through 2009 for a British newspaper, then returned in June 2011 for an update to this book he was writing.  The author is to be commended for his bravery in traveling throughout southern Afghanistan for several years -- primarily in Kandahar.  While embedded with Canadian forces, he meet with many NGOs, local Afghans, Paks and a handful of Taliban spokesmen.  Fearing being kidnapped by the Taliban, he recruited  a couple of his interpreters to meet with Taliban spokesmen to arrange live telephone interviews.The author used interpreters since he did not speak Dari or other Afghan/Pak languages himself -- this, he acknowledged, limited him in not fully understanding some of the nuances of a message being conveyed to him by the various speakers.  Nonetheless, with his many interviews and long time in researching the area, he developed some fine insights as to what was motivating young men to join the Taliban movement, as well as evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and failures of the NATO campaign in southern Afghanistan.The author noted that he had to finally leave in late 2009 as he was being threatened by various groups for his uncovering how numerous government officials were raking in revenue from their illegal participation in the illegal opium-drug trade.  Outside of a handful of names, and some very loose data, this book isn't a great expose of the illegal drug trade.The author recounts how he scored a media scoop by reporting that some/many Taliban (and some innocent suspects) captured by Canadian/NATO troops were being beaten/tortured by Afghan officials, after being turned over to them.The author noted that at one time more than 800 international military bases were once scattered throughout the country, and that more money had been spent to rehabilitate Afghanistan than what had been spent through the Marshall Plan throughout all of Europe after WWII.The author opined: ""The insurgents were not defeated.  We killed thousands of them, but their movement would not die"" (p. 1) ... NATO was ""relying on counter-insurgency theories that suggested American soldiers could walk into the world's most conservative villages, make friends, hunt their enemies, and build a better society.  None of that proved successful.  Perhaps it wasn't ever possible, after all.""The author revealed that so many of the local government officials were either underpaid or not paid at all, which caused them to become lackadaisical and/or disinterested in supporting NATO's rehabilitation agenda.  Graft was a bad drug.Despite his 4-5 years reporting from Afghanistan, and almost 300 pages in this book, the author really doesn't reveal a whole lot of interesting battle activity.  Perhaps he saved his more interesting items for his newspaper.  This is not an account of the author surviving dozens of road ambushes, although he encountered many warlord ""checkpoints"" where he had to pay a road-tax to proceed.From his reporting, the author concluded that the Afghan war:""Is a family feud""""Air strikes pushed people to join the insurgency""""Destroying poppy fields makes things worse"", and""Taliban nationalism leaves room to negotiate.""In trying to understand why the Taliban continued their attacks against the popularly elected government, the author recorded one Taliban spokesman as saying: ""When anyone doesn't want to accept the Koran as our constitution, we want to cut their necks ... The northern Afghanistan people, the Kabul people, they don't want our [sharia] constitution and that's why we were fighting against them"" (p. 273).  The author really didn't dive into much research or reporting on the theological Islamic underpinnings of the Taliban.Although the author noted: ""Afghanistan was an unsuccessful laboratory for ideas about how to fix a ruined country"", rather than supporting a cut-and-run solution, the author still asked for ""a plea for continued engagement"" (p. 283) -- but didn't provide a 7-point list in how to find peace within Afghanistan.For all the time that the author spent there, I was hoping for a little more ""meat on the bone"" within this book.  But a good book by one of the few correspondents who stuck around the area, instead of being just a one-night-stand reporter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39UTEBMUBYA2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619024799#wasThisHelpful","R39UTEBMUBYA2E","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
