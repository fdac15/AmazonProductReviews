"I've written before against the attempt to defend Christianity via Natural Theology. Michael Alter destroys it, and along the way refutes the claims of the resurrection of Jesus in his book. Natural theologians claim they can argue to the existence of God and then argue there is sufficient evidence for the resurrection of Jesus afterward. I've argued they cannot legitimately do that. Alter's book is premised on all of the things that the arguments to God's existence grant. And yet, even as a Jewish theist who believes in God, the inspiration of Old Testament, miracles, and certain other things about Jesus, he easily rejects the resurrection. His book is a massive masterpiece at 746 pages of text with 81 additional pages of bibliography!Believing that God exists does not grant Christians any better position regarding the evidence at all. They still must deal with the evidence. For who knows? Maybe God does exist but didn't raise Jesus from the dead. How can they know if God did? They must look at the evidence without any special pleading, the same way Alter does.In my experience most Christians won't read books like this one. They only read the ones that support what they were led to believe from childhood. That's because they don't really want to know the truth. But from skim-reading this book by Alter they should.Alter's book is another example of what I mean when I say believers debunk each other. So I consider Alter an ally in my attempts to debunk Christianity, even though I go on to offer a criticism of his belief in God and the Old Testament as the inspired word of Yahweh.He tackles many details not addressed by other similar texts, like the significance of the name Arimathea (p. 213). He has done his homework even with regard to this small detail. Other small details he discusses are whether Jesus was crucified in the Spring or more likely in the Fall (pp. 52-54), whether the Last Supper was the passover meal (pp. 69ff), whether Jesus was crucified on Friday (pp. 94ff), and whether the disciples had any homes to return to, as stated in John 20:10, when they had previously ""left all"" to follow Jesus as stated in Mark 10:28 (p. 411). Of the claim that the temple veil was torn from top to bottom at the death of Jesus, Alter asks us to ""imagine tearing a cloth fabric the thickness of a good-size telephone directory"" which was the length of 82 feet (p. 141). There are many such discussions in his book. It is a treasure trove of research, including hundreds of important quotes from both conservative and liberal scholars.Alter takes the Christian story as chronologically believed from the beginning to the end of the supposed events, from the Last Supper, crucifixion, death, burial, resurrection, ascension and appearance to Paul. Before each section Alter presents the relevant biblical verses in parallel columns. In the process he finds 120 contradictions and offers 217 speculations that seem to be more reasonable to him than what most Christians believe. He spent eleven years traveling around to different libraries in researching on the issue and writing this magisterial work. It more than rivals any other book-length treatment on the subject. Even as an encyclopedic work it still leaves a few issues unaddressed (like the role of cognitive bias in the minds of the dejected disciples, how to properly do historical research, and a discussion of the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53). Nonetheless, it's the best volume on the resurrection by a single author one can find. It's certainly better than most of the ones coming from liberals and atheists. It's a tour de force. Best of it's kind. From now on Christian scholars don't need to concern themselves with atheist books on the resurrection. Deal with fellow believer and theist Michael Alter's book, if you can. But if you cannot convince a fellow theistic believer against the massive amount of evidence he presents, then you should give up all attempts to convince non-believers.Christians, you're already on the same page with Alter so try to convince him otherwise. My prediction is you can't, and he's a theist of a different stripe very similar to you. Until Christians can convince Alter his Jewish faith is wrong, or until Alter can convince Christians they are wrong, I'll remain a non-believer. The reason neither of them will win this war of beliefs is because of the nature of belief itself. It's because of the cognitive bias of faith that resides in the brain of every believer. It causes them to overestimate the probabilities in favor of what they want to be true. Faith is the problem. Neither side really wants to know the truth. They all defend what they were raised to believe in their respective cultures (however small or large), which in turn is what they prefer to believe.Let the contest begin! I'll be watching. When it comes to the resurrection I'm solidly in Alter's camp. On this issue he's defending atheism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQI6W4FU6G0HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149905405X#wasThisHelpful","RQI6W4FU6G0HQ","A17D8RDGKBZ5TX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17D8RDGKBZ5TX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The Bad Jesus”  is a 461 page monster of a book written by the prolific and indefatigable biblical scholar Dr. Hector Avalos. It's unlike any other scholarly book on the market today. It tells us the rest of the story of the Jesus we find in the four gospels, the dark side, the raw side that biblical scholars try to whitewash over because they think Jesus deserves special treatment.Dr. Avalos, a giant of a man, a scholar's scholar, challenges readers to see what Jesus was really like. My guess is that people won't like Jesus after reading his book. I don't. He's not a guy I would want living next to me, or being around my children, or writing a column in a magazine, or politically involved in America that's for sure. No one should. Let's even have done with the notion Jesus was an over-all good person. I would want little to do with him. You might too after reading this wonderfully researched, one-of-a-kind book on an essential issue for Christianity.In this book Avalos continues with a main theme of two of his previous books, the theological, ethical and political irrelevance of the Bible for the modern world. In The End of Biblical Studies (2007), he masterfully showed how biblical scholars are preoccupied with maintaining the relevance of the Bible for the modern world, even though their own research actually shows the opposite. In Slavery, Abolitionism, and the Ethics of Biblical Scholarship (2011), he expertly showed how modern biblical scholars are still unjustifiably defending the indefensible ethics of biblical slavery. In this new book Avalos takes on the over-all ethics of Jesus himself---Oh My---as represented in the four canonical gospels (irrespective of whether Jesus existed or not, which he remains an agnostic about). Avalos skillfully shows how the Jesus depicted in the New Testament has a bad side, a side permeated by a “religiocentric, ethnocentric and imperialistic orientation.” He reveals the bad side of Jesus that modern biblical scholars try to hide from view.Here is how he states it:“If one relied on most modern treatises of New Testament ethics, Jesus had no bad ideas, and never committed any bad deed. This cannot possibly be sustained if Jesus is viewed as a real historical human figure. If Jesus was a human being, he must have had some ideas that are ethically objectionable, or, at least, morally questionable. If Jesus was a human being, he must have had flaws, inconsistencies and hypocrisy in his moral system, just as does every other human being. If his followers, ancient or modern, believe that those ideas are applicable to their lives and to the lives of others, then it also raises the question of whether any of Jesus’ bad ideas also had bad consequences. If Jesus had some bad ideas, then imitating Jesus’ bad ideas could be a bad practice today. Given how much time historically has been spent on lauding the Good Jesus, this book centers on illuminating ‘the Bad Jesus’.” (pp. 29-30)So why don’t most modern scholars consider Jesus to have done anything wrong or evil? Avalos:“The answer, of course, is that most biblical scholars, whether in secular academia or in seminaries, still see Jesus as divine, and not as a human being with faults. Their Christology is high enough to exempt Jesus from any evil sentiments or ethical malpractice...Most New Testament scholars are affiliated with religious institutions and are part of what I have called an ecclesial-academic complex that has no counterpart in any other areas of the humanities. For example, most, if not all, scholars of Greek religion are not part of some Greek religious movement or organization. Despite biases that always exist in the study of the classics, it is fair to say that few have any personal stake in whether Zeus or Tiberius was good or bad because those entities don’t constitute any sort of authority for their actions. That is not the case with Jesus, who is still viewed as the paradigmatic authority for most Christian scholars. Such scholars are still studying Jesus through the confessional lenses of Nicea or Chalcedon rather than through an historical approach that we would use with other human beings.” (p.7)Dr. Avalos is attempting to change how biblical scholars study the Bible by advocating a secular understanding of the biblical texts. Modern biblical scholars “do not treat the Bible as another ancient document such as Homer’s Iliad or The Epic of Gilgamesh.” (p. 23) But they should. They should do this to see what they get. It’s the only respectable way to study historical documents if we want to know the truth about them.Hector's broader argument in his particular book contains several elements:“1. Biblical scholarship is still primarily a religionist apologetic enterprise despite claims to be engaging in historico-critical and descriptive scholarship.2. A more specific Christian orientation is clearly revealed in the manner in which the ethics of Jesus are predominantly viewed as benign and paradigmatic, even among supposedly secular academic scholars.3. However, many of the fundamental ethical principles announced or practiced by Jesus actually would be antithetical to those we otherwise describe as ‘acceptable’ or ‘good’ by some of the most widely accepted standards of ethics today.4. Accordingly, such a predominantly benign view of Jesus’ ethics signals a continuing acceptance of Jesus as divine or as morally supra-human, and not as the flawed human being who should be the real subject of historico-critical study.”(pp. 8-9)His goal in the case studies he presents is to illustrate ""the extent to which religionism, and more particularly a Christian bias, still permeates what are otherwise supposed to be historical-critical descriptive studies of the ethics of Jesus."" (p. 27).This book should change how biblical scholars view Jesus--many of whom are already liberals. We shouldn't give Jesus a free pass. There's a bad Jesus we need to see. Look and see for yourselves. It could be shocking. In the future when someone says Jesus was sinless, respond by saying ""Bad Jesus."" If someone holds up Jesus as an example of a good life, hold up Hector's book ""Bad Jesus"" in response. If someone asks, ""What would Jesus do?,"" respond by asking them to read ""Bad Jesus."" It is the antidote to people who indefensibly think Jesus was a perfect human being. It is the corrective to believers who think we need a red-letter edition of the New Testament. It tells us the rest of the story, a story that most people and most Christians have never heard before.------------------------------Contents1. Introduction  Basic Elements of the Argument2.

"I am thankful that at a minimum Marshall claims to embrace the Outsider Test for Faith (OTF) against other Christian scholars. However, none of his criticisms nor his alternative reformulations make any reasonable sense at all.I don’t claim to have invented OTF, since it has been bandied about for millennia wherever there were skeptics. I do claim to have defended it better than anyone else, as far as I can tell. Josh McDowell takes it one step further. He travels around the country challenging Christians to refute their own faith. His former protégé, Dustin Lawson, did just that and as a result he no longer believes.Marshall says I present the OTF “as an argument against Christianity.” (p. 7.) Now I do think the OTF is a good argument against faith, but in my book I go overboard to say it's merely a test for faith. My conclusion is that Christianity fails the test, that's all.Marshall also dismisses my understanding of religious diversity as “superficial.” He opines that this is the “most essential problem with Loftus’ version of the OTF.” (p. 10). I’m really at a loss as to why he said this, given what the reader will find quoted in my book.Professor of anthropology David Eller tells us, as I quoted on pages 34-36 of my book, that ""there are many religions in the world, and they are different from each other in multiple and profound ways. Not all religions refer to gods, nor do all make morality a central issue, etc. No religion is ‘normal’ or ‘typical’ of all religions; the truth is in the diversity.""When it comes to belief in god(s), I quote Eller as saying,""Many or most religions have functioned quite well without any notions of god(s) at all, and others have mixed god(s) with other beliefs such that god-beliefs are not the critical parts of the religion. . . . Some religions that refer to or focus on gods believe them to be all-powerful, but others do not. Some consider them to be moral agents, and some do not; more than a few gods are downright immoral. Some think they are remote, while others think they are close (or both simultaneously). Some believe that the gods are immortal and eternal, but others include stories of gods dying and being born . . . not all gods are creators, nor is creation a central feature or concern of all religions. . . . Finally, there is not even always a firm boundary between humans and gods; humans can become gods, and the gods may be former humans.""So I do understand the nature of religious diversity. Marshall does not. For instance, there is nothing when reading Marshall's book where he shows us he understands there are various Christianities, nothing. As far as the reader is concerned he’s defending the one and only Christianity, his, without so much as telling us which one that is. If anyone has a superficial understanding of religious diversity it is Marshall. The only thing religionists all agree on is that there are supernatural beings and/or forces with everything else up for grabs, and that's it.The rule is that people within a given culture will overwhelmingly adopt the religion of their culture, so it depends on the degree they are immersed in that culture. Christian theists respond by asking me to explain the exceptions. I am asking them to explain the rule. Marshall seems to be objecting to the rule by arguing that we're not living in an overwhelmingly Christian cultures. But this objection of his is irrelevant to my main point, and therefore does nothing at all to undercut it. Marshall ends up denying the rule that people adopt the religion of their culture by irrelevantly claiming that western culture does not provide an overwhelming cultural influence to adopt evangelical Christianity. So what if it doesn't? That still doesn't undercut the rule, even if so. It just means religious cultural dependency may be headed in another direction after 1500 hundred years of Christianity or more.But with a sleight of hand that Houdini would be proud of David Marshall says, ""by all means, let's explain the rule before the exceptions! Are boys and girls raised by snake-handlers and bigots in white sheets the exception even in American society, or the rule?"" The rule, he says, is that ""snake-handling KKK home-schooled kids are rare as falling stars."" (p. 23). He completely missed my point. The rule, once again, is that people adopt the religion of their cultures. While snake handlers and the KKK are weird counter-cultural groups within our larger culture as a whole, the children in those families, if kept away from the larger culture, will indeed adopt their parent's beliefs. This represents the rule. No exception here.The fact is that most all of our beliefs are culturally dependent as any others. We're all raised as believers. Whatever our parents taught us we believed. We didn't know not to do so. This is my point. It's not something Marshall can tell me about with regard to atheism, or secular humanism either, since I know this much better than he could ever admit. He cannot remind me of this. I already knew it. Our brains fool us. Our brains are belief engines. Our thinking is irrational much of the time. We prefer to believe that which we prefer to believe, and to defend that which we were raised to believe. It's the reason I proposed the OTF in the first place. We need an objective standard, a non-double standard based on scientific objective evidence and reasoning about the evidence, for determining which religion is true, if there is one. Since we are all in the same drifting rudderless epistemological boat, as I said, we need a test that allows for all options to be on the table, including the non-religious option in which all faiths fail the test.Marshall asks if his belief ""that the earth circles the sun is 'culturally dependent.'"" (p. 26) Of course not. Not in today's world of modern science with space explorations and moon landings. Who would even ask such a question? Is he really serious? He says other such things that are quite embarrassing of his understanding of science here. He cannot tell the difference between objective science and cultural opinions? He doesn't want to be able to do so either, so he can go on defending the indefensible. Here's a hint, Marshall, you can do the experiments yourself, and barring doing them, you can learn to appreciate how the scientific method works and listen to the overwhelming consensus of scientists who all agree. If you refuse to do this you are a science denier. That's what it takes for you to believe, in my opinion. You must deny science in at least a few areas to believe. I can even agree with you when you say believing the earth circles the sun is culturally dependent, if that's what it takes to convince someone like you, and it doesn't change a thing. It's true, not all cultures have accepted the heliocentric view of the solar system. However, it is a fact that the earth circles the sun. A fact! So some cultures have got it right, and the reason we've gotten it right is because of science.On page 29 of Marshall's book he attempts to reformulate the OTF with four theses. Look at them. In every single thesis of his, wait for it, agreement and disagreement do all the heavy lifting, all of it. If a religion has a consensus to it then it passes the OTF. Whoa! Who is really superficial? Where can we find any world-wide consensus? It doesn't exist. Agreement means something, I'll admit, but people who all agree with each other but denigrate or deny observable data aren't being reasonable at all. The OTF leads us to a reasonable skepticism that demands sufficient evidence before accepting a claim about the nature of nature as true. People who reject the need for sufficient evidence when it comes to the nature of nature, don't get any traction at all with me. Reasonable skepticism becomes the default adult attitude, the one the OTF forces upon us all.Given Marshall's four theses there would never have been a time in the past when atheism would be embraced based on cultural agreement or consensus. So Marshall's four theses exclude atheism as an option. Since any real test should allow for all options to be on the table, Marshall is offering a very bad way to find out which religion is true, if there is one. He's stacking the deck just as surely as any thieving dealer of blackjack would. Additionally, I think atheism is the wave of the future, as it marches extremely slow but inexorably over time and place. So let's say in the year 2100 the earth in almost completely inhabited by atheists. The question then becomes what a future David Marshall living in that era would think of the David Marshall of our era, who argued in his book for these four theses based totally on the consensus of majorities of people. My bet is that a future Marshall would sing a different tune and reject all four theses of our own Marshall, just as he would reject them if Islam was the religion of the planet in 2100. So what we have here folks, is an attempt at special pleading. Use an argument that is clearly faulty in favor of your own religious faith which you would never accept if circumstances were different. Typical Christian.On page 11 Marshall provides four tests of his that correspond to the four theses.The first test is that it's to be considered evidence that a religion is true if it convinces many people in many cultures throughout history. Yet, several mutually exclusive religions pass this test. Buddhism (an atheist faith), Islam, Mormonism, Scientology, and even Hinduism pass this test, as even Marshall acknowledges. Here then is a good solid reason to reject Marshall's first test. Any test for truth which allows mutually exclusive religions to pass it cannot be a good test for truth. These religions cannot all be true. Therefore this test is faulty to the core.What Marshall means by the second test of prophecy may stun my readers. He's not using the so-called prophecies about a virgin born incarnated son of God, who resided in Nazareth, and the Messianic Suffering Servant's death on the cross (there was no prediction about a resurrection). No. siree, bob. What Marshall is saying is that the prophecies about the reach of the Gospel to the ends of the earth are evidence of the truth of Christianity since it has reached the ends of the earth. Seriously? Any budding religious movement that has an agenda or a passion to convert others would predict that their movement would grow and grow and be a worldwide phenomenon. All of them. But until these religious groups predict when their movement will reach such and such a place, and it's global reach for a particular time period, along with the circumstances of that growth, it's merely propaganda used to gain more followers, nothing more. And what about new religious faiths who make their own predictions? Shouldn't we give them more time before we settle on the winner of these types of prophecies? A test that offers nothing conclusive while we wait on history is not a good test to know which religion is true, if there is one. We want to know now.The third test is a religion's positive impact on the world. Marshall argues Christianity has bettered the lives of people around the world. Pffft. I have already dispensed with such ignorant and uneducated reasoning in my anthology ""Christianity Is Not Great: How Faith Fails."" Marshall focuses on Yahweh's promise to Abraham, that his seeds (the original Hebrew word is plural, which Paul the apostle fails to get right in Galatians 3:8, and 3:16) would bless all nations. But Jews and Muslims trace their ancestry to Abraham too, and they would certainly claim they are blessing the world and will eventually dominate it too. Listen up people, even if a religion has been good for people this doesn't tell us whether that religion is true in part, or especially in whole. Someone recently argued against evolution by saying that if evolution is true there would be no basis for morals. I simply responded by asking what morality or the lack of it has to do with the evidence for evolution? The answer is nothing. So this third test of Marshall's doesn't help us know which religion is true, if there is one.The fourth test is whether a religion can infuse itself into a different culture and how it transforms that culture with its message. Rather than bother with this any longer I want to refer my readers to David Eller's chapters in my anthologies, who is an anthropology professor and expert in these matters. If you want a definitive answer to this so-called ""test"" then read Eller. The bottom line is that every religion can infuse itself into a different culture. Every major religion has already done so, and by its own standards would say it brought peace and a good life to the people who live there. Or does Marshall not know that many people in different cultures think the capitalistic scientific materialistic militaristic western world is ugly. Many other religions would reject Marshall's religion and say their culture is better for it. Even the Amish people would claim their religion brings a better world than other Christianities. What results when a religion and a different culture come into contact is a different culture AND a different religion. I would think, if anything, that any religion that comes into contact with a different culture and remains the same exact religion would have more going for it, but we never see that of any religion, do we? The Christianities that exist in Russia, China, Europe, America and Africa are simply NOT the same kinds of Christianity.If first century people had actually accepted these four tests of Marshall's then Christianity would have been rejected outright by the people in that era, since Christianity was still in its infancy and had no track record yet. Furthermore, I see no reason at all to accept tests like Marshall's when they cannot apply to non-belief in its earliest historical stages for the same reason. Until Marshall can show how these four tests can apply to first century Christianities along with any new religion, or the rise of non-belief itself, there is no reason to accept them at all.The problem is that Marshall offers nothing in rebuttal to the OTF. He provides nothing as an alternative to the OTF. And his four tests offered in defense of his particular brand of Christianity are extremely lame, a case in special pleading pure and simple. The book as a whole is completely irrelevant to the truth of Christianity and he doesn't even realize it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L73PU1U7IJS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8RARN8#wasThisHelpful","R1L73PU1U7IJS7","A17D8RDGKBZ5TX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17D8RDGKBZ5TX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Carolyn Hyppolite has written what I consider a masterful first person account of her struggles with the Christian faith explaining why she came to reject it. In this intelligent book she highlights the intellectual hypocrisy of Christians, how their faith denigrates women, how it fails to deal honestly with religious diversity, the absence of God in the world, the problem of suffering, and more. Ultimately she highlights the irrationality of faith itself. She is not alone by any stretch. Her numbers are growing every day. She's just sharing what so many of us have concluded on our behalf.

For the price, especially here on Amazon, you probably cannot find a better Vice-Hitch like this one. I just have two small problems with it. The first is that it is made in China. I'll leave that as said. The second is that whether you can use it effectively on your truck depends on how high your hitch is from the ground and how tall you are. Think about that before you buy it. If your hitch is knee level ask yourself how effectively you can use this Vise.

"Since this book came with high recommendations I thought I would take a look. I almost threw it down after the first chapter which talks about the curse of Ham (Genesis 9). Anyone familiar with this story knows what it has done to African Americans, since Canaan and all of his descendants were forever condemned to be slaves. See David M. Goldenber, ""The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."" To say the curse tells us the seriousness of our sin, as Turner does, doesn't change the fact that the Bible says sons will not be punished for the sins of their fathers  (Deuteronomy 24:16; Ezekiel 18:20).But I read on.When it comes to the story of Lot (Genesis 18-19) it only got worse. For God kills all the inhabitants in Sodom and Gomorrah because they were gay, according to Turner. But not before Lot ""rhetorically suggests"" to the men who came to his house demanding sex of the two angels to take his two virgin daughters instead. Rhetorically? How does Turner know this was only rhetoric? The text says he offered his two virgin daughters to the men. Throughout this story Turner does eisegesis not exegesis, the type he would reject when it came to any other religious cult. Turner tells us to look at the consequences. Okay. God got rid of some really terrible people, which shows us his judgment is sure, and that the incestuous relationship Lot ended up having with his two daughters produced the tribes of Moab and Ammon, which in turn produced ancestors to the Messiah Jesus. So God is a consequentialist. The end justify the means. Turner says, ""There is nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, God can't redeem and use for His purposes, not even rape or incest."" (p. 18). But the way Turner writes leaves us with the impression God cannot act in advance of these events to alleviate suffering. We only see him cleaning up the mess. Hindsight is always better. The lesson is better stated as follows: No matter how terrible of horrific the tragedy is, believers will eventually see the good in it. That's the nature of faith. I used to have that faith, but not when I see how apologists like Turner are forced to argue to defend it.Next up was the test of Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac. This one interested me even though I had no hopes the story would be dealt with honestly. Turner: ""Abraham never believed or obeyed perfectly; there was always a little skepticism at work."" (p. 21). This is news to me. I find nothing in the text to suggest this. In fact the faith of Abraham is touted in the book of Hebrews and in sermons from the pulpits every single Sunday. Perhaps preachers should read Turner's version of the events. God must have told him this, or he's a psychic. One thing Turner gets right is this story isn't normal. Nope, ""it's bizarre."" (p. 22). We're told God was just testing Abraham, that Isaac was in no real danger. Really? What if your father heard voices in his head to kill you? Wouldn't you be in danger, hoping the voices would change their minds? What would YOU do if YOU heard those same voices? Think about it. If you would kill your son based on that ""evidence"" you would deserve to go to prison like Andrea Yates and others who killed their kids. Abraham showed no signs he questioned whther the voice was from a god whereas we would, most definitely. Oh, but this is really God, you know, the one true God who speaks in still small voices inside the heads of people only in private. Okay. But it's a bizarre assumption coming from the ancient world where the gods all demanded child and virgin sacrifices. Ancient Hebrews were no exception. Just see, Jon D. Levenson, ""The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son: The Transformation of Child Sacrifice in Judaism and Christianity,"" or better yet, Francesca Stavrakopoulou, ""King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice: Biblical Distortions of Historical Realities."" In any case, Turner offers us a devotional lesson, namely that God tested Abraham and he is testing us too. Apparently Turner would say this is different from ""tempting"" us (James 1:13) or entrapment, but such a God does seem to do this. Just think Job, a story Turner deals with but misses the point of it (pp. 133-139). The point is told to us in the first two chapters not the last five, and Satan in the story represents the ancient thought police who is not doing anything wrong, but rather faithfully doing his heavenly assigned task. Nonetheless, why would God need to test us? It just does not make any sense at all if he is omniscient. Out this same window flies the story of Adam and Eve too.I read the chapter on ""Holy War and the Old Testament,"" where Turner offers a devotional lesson about genocide, saying we're not supposed to identify with the Israelite's but rather with the Canaanites, who deserved to die for child sacrifice and prostitution. In other words, let's forget people were slaughtered, man, woman and child, and make a devotional about it, saying we're all sinners condemned to die. Is genocide okay when Turner's God commands it? Yes he says, because God ""always comes to people just as they are"" (p. 69) and that ""God attempts to pursue justice in an unjust world."" (p. 71) The question is, was, and always will be how could anyone ever come to believe that a perfectly good god really commanded genocide? Genocide is universally condemned by all civil-minded people in our world. Anyone who says God told him to muster up an army to do such a deed in today's world would be considered nuts. We would lock him away if he presented a clear and present danger to innocent non-combatants.I read the chapter titled ""No Good Guy in Sight,"" a chapter about Judges 19-21, where Turner acknowledges ""This is a terrible story, and there's not really a good guy is sight."" (p. 99) Right that! Turner fails to indict God though. Strange isn't it? God never does anything wrong. Yet the text plainly states God authorized the near complete slaughter of the tribe of Benjamin, then the stealing of 600 virgins from others due to the rape and murder of a concubine (see Judges 20:18, 23; 21:10-11, 15). So it is true, there is NO ONE good in this story, not even GOD! The problem with this particular story is that it tells us the barbaric nature of the very people who told the stories we find in the Bible, the ones who believed God told them to do these absolutely terrible deeds. If we reject these deeds then we must seriously question the inspiration of the early stories we read in the Old Testament, and I do, for that very reason among many.If someone wants to read a good book on these and other crazy stories I suggest (not rhetorically mind you) Jonathan Kirsch, ""The Harlot by the Side of the Road."" He's being honest with the text. Turner is not. Faith keeps otherwise honest people from being honest with regard to the Bible and one's faith.At this point I skipped around trying desperately to find one chapter that came to grips with the crazy stories in the Bible. But I didn't find one. I'll read no more. This is the worse book I have ever read. Something is seriously wrong with Christians like Turner and his readers who think this book satisfactorily answers the questions it deals with.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DF8KJSZ76IIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433681285#wasThisHelpful","R2DF8KJSZ76IIF","A17D8RDGKBZ5TX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17D8RDGKBZ5TX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm reviewing every chapter in this anthology on my blog, ""Debunking Christianity."" Just do a search when there for ""God and Evil"" and you will find them. It's an interesting and informative book, but an epic fail.Take for instance Paul Copan's chapter, ""Evil and Primeval Sin: How Evil Emerged in a Very Good Creation"" (pp. 109-123). The problem he addresses is how sin and suffering originated. The possible suspects are Adam, Eve, Satan, the environment, or God himself. Copan argues that he has the answer, Adam and Eve dunit, even though Adam and Eve are two separate potential sources for the origination of sin and suffering. Many sexist and misogynist theologians have simply blamed Eve. Others who only blame Adam deny that Eve could actually make such a choice on her own. If Adam had not made the same choice as Eve there wouldn't have been a fall into sin, they'll say. This is a male religion plain and simple folks. Why any woman would embrace the religion of their oppressors baffles me. Copan ignores this problem saying instead they are both to blame.Those of us who don't have a problem with the origination of suffering (or ""evil"") are reasonable people who accept the fact of evolution. Suffering is part of the process whereby life evolves. The tales of an Adam and Eve are pure myth. On this I recommend the book, ""Evolving out of Eden"" co-written by Robert Price.But it's a problem for believers given their belief in a good omnipotent omniscient God who created the world. In this chapter Copan first takes issue against R.C. Sproul Jr. (yes, the Sr's son) whom Copan describes as an hyper-Calvinist. Sproul argues that God himself ""introduced evil into the world."" Now get this, Sproul argues that the reason God wanted Adam and Eve to sin is because of God's eternal attribute of wrath: ""God is as delighted with his wrath as he is with all of his attributes."" So with this attribute God must create objects of wrath, or as God would say, ""something on which I can exhibit the glory of my wrath."" Without these objects of wrath God would not be able to display his glory in the fullest way. Sproul says, ""It was God's desire to make his wrath known. He needed, then, something on which to be wrathful. He needed to have sinful creatures.""Maybe Copan and Sproul should both listen to biblical theology professor Walter Wink, who informs us in his book, ""Unmasking the Powers"" that,  ""The original faith of Israel actually had no place for Satan. God alone was Lord, and thus whatever happened, for good or ill, was ascribed to God. ""I kill and I make alive,"" says the Lord, ""I wound and I heal"" (Deut. 32:39; Isa. 45:6-7; 1 Sam. 2:6-7). It was not inconsistent, on the one hand, to believe that God might call Moses to deliver Israel from Egypt, and on the other hand, for God to want to murder him on the way (Exod. 4:24-26). When Pharaoh resisted Moses it was not ascribed to his free will, but to God's hardening of his heart (Exod. 4:21; 7:3; 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8, 17; Josh. 11:20, etc). Likewise, it is God who sent an evil spirit on Saul (1 Sam. 16:14-16, 23), and it was God who sent a lying spirit to enter the mouths of the four hundred prophets of Ahab (1 Kings 22:22; see 2 Sam. 17:14)....One possible translation of ""Yahweh,"" God's name, is ""He causes to happen what happens."" If, then, God has caused everything that happens, God must also cause evil. But God was also the God of justice (Gen. 18:25). So how could God be just and still be the one to cause evil? This was the terrible price Israel had been forced to pay for its belief that God was the primary cause of all that happens. Gradually God became differentiated into a ""light"" and a ""dark"" side, both integral to the Godhead. The bright side came to be represented by the angels, the dark side by Satan and his demons. This process of differentiation took a long time to complete."" (See pp. 11-44).So I think both Sproul and Copan are right, and they are both wrong. They both fail to understand the evolutionary trajectory of the texts they are dealing with. Sproul is right that given some earlier texts God does do evil, or cause suffering. He is wrong however, not to see that such a view was eventually ascribed to Satan because an evil-doing God was thought to be irreconcilable with a loving sovereign God. Given the destruction put upon the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanies in the 2nd century BC, they just couldn't understand why a good sovereign God would do this to them. So they concluded there must be another source for that evil and Satan was born. So if later biblical writers had to create (or adopt) Satan because of the problem of suffering then Sproul is out of touch with their evolved moral intuitions, the ones I share without punting to a mythical creature like the Devil. Sproul is out of touch with reality.Copan is right when he argues that Sproul's view is barbaric to the core, that it denies God's goodness, and espouses divine neediness. Copan is wrong however, to argue that Adam and Eve are the culprit (singular) with their so-called free-willed choice in the garden to disobey God. Almost unbelievably all Copan can do is to quote from creeds, Augustine, and other biblical passages and argue for them to support this bald-faced assertion. It's quite obvious that's what he's doing, at least to me. Given the creeds and the Bible, therefore their sin was culpable, avoidable and voluntary. He's quoting myths to explain how the primeval couple was led into sin. He totally avoids questions like: Why were they created as curious people in the first place? Why was the serpent allowed to tempt them, especially if God knew they would sin? Even if God didn't know the outcome with certainty, he surely knew the probabilities were very high. Why weren't they given enough evidence to take him at his word that eating the fruit was a bad thing that would lead to serious consequences for all subsequent life on earth?...and so on. So Copan too is out of touch with reality, not unlike Sproul.What we have in this myth is nothing but etiology. These stories are told for the purpose of helping people know why things are as they are, not how things originated. How did we gain knowledge and wisdom? Why is there sin in the world? Why do men and women marry? Why do snakes crawl on the ground? Why do women fear snakes? Why do men rule over women? Why are women subservient to men? Why do women experience pain in childbirth? Why is it so very painfully hard to work the land? Why are there weeds? Why is there famine, disease, and death? Why do we clothe ourselves rather than run around naked? Why do we die? It's all here. Etiological stories to explain why things are liter the ancient archives. There is no historical truth to such tales at all.If you really want to know what the Jews thought was the real fall into sin it's told in Genesis 6:1-4. It opens up with a description of the evils that had finally taken place on earth. There is a new and horrible evil. The divine ""sons of god"" were having sex with the ""daughters of men"" and producing semidivine offspring giants called Nephilim. This biblical text tells us that divine beings have genitalia and produced offspring, yep that's right, nothing but myth. This was viewed as a deliberate act of rebellion which Donald Gowan tells us was understood by early Jewish commenters to be ""more important than the story of the sin of Adam and Eve....For several authors this was the true `Fall Story,' the account of how evil came into the world by means of the descent of certain rebellious angels."" [""From Eden to Babel"" 1988), p. 82].] The fact is that if the story of Adam and Eve in the garden was that big of a deal there are plenty of places in the Old Testament where it could be used, specifically in Proverbs for instruction, and in Job when dealing with the problem of suffering. But it's not referred to except in a nebulous way in Ezekiel.The truth is that the origin of sin is never traced back to Adam and Eve in the Old Testament. This concept didn't emerge until the intertestamental period, especially in the apocryphal and the forged literature. It is in these texts that we first find this as the point of the story. We find such a viewpoint expressed in noncanonical writings like the Wisdom of Solomon (2:23ff.), where we read, ""For God created man for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity, but through the devil's envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party experience it."" Claus Westermann similarly argues: ""The teaching of the Fall and of original sin rests on the late Jewish interpretation (compare 2 Esdras 7:118 ""O Adam, what have you done? Your sin was not only your own downfall; it was also the downfall of all of us who are your descendants.""). It has no foundation at all in the [Genesis] narrative."" [""Creation,"" 1974), pp. 108-109].","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C5EKNER6TEIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830837841#wasThisHelpful","R3C5EKNER6TEIH","A17D8RDGKBZ5TX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17D8RDGKBZ5TX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Professor Mark Roncace was raised in a conservative Christian church and attended a Christian school for thirteen years. He is now an Associate Professor of Religion at Wingate University in North Carolina who debunks the Bible in this popular level book. The book is bittersweet for me, both a joy and a pain to read, brilliant and, well, ignorant. Yet, I recommend it highly just the same.What Roncace wants to reader to understand is the raw truth about the Bible, its God, Jesus, Christian doctrine and church morality. Unfiltered and uncensored, the Bible ""is just too hard to swallow, "" he argues, so preachers  ""cook the Good Book. They butter it up and water it down to suit our tastes. They distill the Scriptures, filtering out the unsightly and unpalatable passages. Just as processed and packaged foods are barely reminiscent of what first comes out of the ground or from the animal, so too the clean, attractive Bible that they present in the church is a far cry from the real thing."" (p. 3-4) Roncace is not just speaking about one kind of preacher or denomination either. ""They all do it--fundamentalists, evangelicals, Pentecostals, main stream moderates, left wing liberals, emergent church pastors, prosperity preachers, and the list goes on and on. No one serves up the Scriptures uncooked."" (p. 5) So this book represents the Bible served raw ""in a six course meal,"" (p. 13) that is, six chapters.This is something agnostic biblical scholar Bart Ehrman definitely agrees with as he tells us in his book, ""Jesus, Interrupted,"" after being trained in the seminaries to accept the historical critical method for approaching the Bible, graduates who enter the ministry ""appear to put it back on the shelf...pastors are, as a rule, reluctant to teach what they learned about the Bible in seminary."" (p. 13)I find this point to be true myself, which is very significant. Christian students who do not attend seminaries and/or do not focus on biblical studies, who instead focus on other disciplines of learning, primarily in philosophy, do not know much about the Bible because their preachers are not telling them. So these Christian philosophers, being non-specialists in the Bible, go on to defend a Christianity that is not based in the Bible. What we get from them is nothing short of a ""Fundamentalism on Stilts,"" as Professor Jaco Gericke argues, who is both a biblical scholar and a philosopher of religion.In the first five chapters Roncace takes the Bible at face value and shows what it really teaches. Then in the last chapter he speaks about canonical, textual, and translation criticisms, all of which biblical scholars know and teach. Since his book is on a very readable popular level he primes the pump in the first five chapters, so to speak, and then shows a few reasons why we find the kinds of inconsistencies and differences in the Bible in the last chapter.But boy is his book a delicious treat. If anyone wants to know why I have trouble devouring the Bible this is a wonderful place to start. All we have to do is read the Bible and ask questions about what we find in it, the kinds of questions Roncace asks. It's so simple a youth could do it, yet apparently so profound to Christians raised to believe most of them don't even think about them. He asks simple questions like, ""When did God create Eve?,"" ""What did the wise men say to the shepherds,"" ""What happened to Easter,"" and ""Who killed Goliath?"" Do you think you know the answers? Do you? Read the book if you think so. What we find in the Bible is ""a collection of contrasting ideas,"" analogous to listening to a debate or sitting around the conference table as a committee meeting."" (p. 39) That's a more charitable way than I could think of to describe it. I think what we find within its pages is more like a full blown war of ideas, best reflected in Randel McCraw Helms's book, ""The Bible Against Itself: Why the Bible Seems to Contradict Itself.""In chapter two professor Roncace shows us that the God of the Bible ""is not all good, holy, loving, and perfect."" Christians don't know this he says, ""because pastors have nothing to gain from our knowing it."" (p. 42) In fact, the God of the Old Testament ""is not merely a God of justice, wrath, and vengeance, not a God who simply punishes violently when people break his commandments...Rather, he is portrayed as cruel, vindictive, childish, petulant, misogynistic, egotistical, genocidal, and maniacal."" (p. 43). Roncace puts the Canaanite genocide of Joshua in personal terms, saying: ""Envision each person, each little boy and girl and baby, in these towns being impaled by Israelite swords, with God standing by approving the massacre."" (p. 60).In chapter three we see the raw Jesus. He isn't a meek and mild guy, the one we want to find in the mirror. Nor does the Old Testament prophesy about him ""any more than Nostradamus predicted Hitler."" (p. 90). And it ""appears as though Jesus was wrong"" to say the end was nigh (p. 107) What Christians see instead, Roncace tells us, is ""indistinguishable from our own ethnic, cultural, and religious norms and values"" (p. 116) despite the raw Jesus found in the Gospels.In chapter four Roncace shows there is a great deal in the Bible that defies any kind of systematic theology. The three-in-one omni-God of Christian theology? ""Not there. The Bible makes none of these claims,"" he shows. Is God male or female? Does he have a penis, or just the second person of the trinity, or maybe he has a ""spiritual"" penis? Roncace has some fun with these types of questions. Hell? Satan? Slavery? Salvation? The Sacraments? Tithing? The end times? Roncace makes a good case that Christians need to re-read their Bible on these subjects, for ""the Bible does not offer us clear, unambiguous answers to doctrinal questions."" (p. 157)The same can be said about the morality in the Bible, argues Roncace in chapter five. When it comes to homosexuality, pre-marital sex, marriage and divorce, abortion, debt, diet and exercise, and global warming, the Bible isn't much help to Christians, to put it extremely mildly: ""We are not loving, open, and honest when we cherry-pick certain verses to support our own personal agendas. We shouldn't make the Bible say what we want it to say; we shouldn't put words in its mouth."" (p. 191).I think evangelicals should listen to biblical scholars like Roncace, since their own pastors are not telling them the truth, the raw truth about the Bible, God, Jesus, doctrine and morality. Go to the source. Read the Bible, something Roncace emphasizes, but also get and read books like his to help guide you. You don't have to trust a former pastor, a former Bible college instructor turned atheist like me on these matters. Turn to your own scholars. By-pass your pastors. They are more interested in church attendance, tithes, and keeping out of trouble in their churches. Go to biblical scholars like Roncace, especially now that they are writing popular level books anyone can read.What is hard to swallow about his book is that Roncace still embraces some form of Christianity. He's a process theologian: ""God evolves and changes over time as he relates to his creation. God is in the process of learning and growing, just as we are...God isn't in complete control. God isn't perfect. God doesn't know the future. And sometimes God doesn't bother to relate to his creation--he's not involved, he doesn't care, sometimes."" (p. 80). So what does he propose? Rather than excuse God, ""We should hold God accountable. We should protest God's attitude and conduct. We should be bold enough to tell God what we think...Instead of offering God our praises, we should offer our appraisals. If you say God can do whatever he wants because he's God, I say: No way! I am not interested in being a part of a religious tradition in which God can sanction the murder of tens of thousands of people and we don't bat an eye."" (p. 81-82). So he asks, ""Why must God be perfect? Why can't we love a God who is in the process of growing and developing? We show genuine love for flawed people all the time."" (p. 83) So he concludes ""ultimately our faith will be much stronger"" by recognizing the raw truth, which is ""what matters."" (p. 225)*cough*Oh, I'm holding God accountable alright. If he exists then I want nothing to do with such a ""cruel, vindictive, childish, petulant, misogynistic, egotistical, genocidal, and maniacal"" God at all. A process kind of God is also indistinguishable from no God at all. He looks exactly like he was created by the imaginations of an ancient superstitious pre-scientific barbaric people. I will not, I cannot, deny reason by embracing any faith that leads to this conclusion of his at all.Roncace would be better off to be an agnostic like Bart Ehrman. After all, they both debunk the Bible as nothing more than the imaginations of an ancient superstitious pre-scientific barbaric people. Where then is room for any deity at all? The deity Roncace believes is not worthy of anything but disgust and loathing. So he might as well come clean and declare himself an agnostic.Better yet, follow professor Hector Avalos's advice, by helping put an end to biblical studies as we know them. Given what Roncace knows about the Bible that's the consistent thing to do.In any case, I highly recommend his book for people who don't understand the raw truth about the Bible, just as I recommend Thom Stark's book, ""The Human Faces of God: What Scripture Reveals When It Gets God Wrong (and Why Inerrancy Tries to Hide It).""Folks, listen to these biblical scholars. By-pass your pastors. By-pass evangelical scholars too. Then see what you can conclude. One thing is sure. You cannot remain an evangelical Christian. For honest informed evangelical scholarship is a ruse. There is no such thing! It has evolved over the years too, such that the new evangelical orthodoxy is little more than the old Neo-Orthodoxy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEQOQEN52ZZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479214183#wasThisHelpful","R3NEQOQEN52ZZ6","A17D8RDGKBZ5TX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17D8RDGKBZ5TX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read this book I think Dale does an absolutely amazing job of both introducing atheism to the masses and providing an almost comprehensive reference work that people can refer to again and again. When the publisher was looking for someone to write such a book Hemant Mehta recommended they contact Dale for the job, and as far as I'm concerned he was the best choice. Since the potential buyer can look inside the book I won't describe the contents in any detail here. Most people already know that the ""Dummmies"" series of books are easy to read introductions to a given topic (I'm told 1600 of them so far). This one however, goes way beyond an easy to read introduction to atheism. It's very comprehensive and at the same time a reference work I can refer to in the coming years.Taken together with his other books, and his efforts as the executive director of ""Foundation Beyond Belief"" (which is a humanist charitable foundation based in Atlanta), Dale McGowan has become one of my atheist heroes of late.

In it most readers will find some fresh arguments that provoke thought and deserve our attention. Unlike the four ""New Atheists"" Lindsay, who holds degrees in physics and a Ph.D. in mathematics, understands Christian theology much better than they do. In the end, Lindsay is correct; God doesn't do anything because he doesn't exist. Only we can solve our problems.I think Lindsay's book delivers the goods. Get it. See for yourself. I highly recommend it. I especially liked his chapter 7, ""The Problem of a Silent God."" That this is a huge problem for people of faith cannot be overstated, and Lindsay is an expert guide through it.I am also thankful for Lindsay's passion, akin to mine. You will not see him or me having a discussion for discussion's sake. We want to change the religious landscape. There is a sense of urgency we both share. In reading this book you'll see just how bad the case is for religious faith. Hint: it's abysmal.He writes well. He argues well.

"Sweet story.  Has romance and conflict in it.  Very short and we get to read about Winston, the sheriff and Kaylee a damsel in distress!  He's a great guy...but we aren't sure how old he is.  I am guessing around the age of all the other boys we read about.  Kaylee's a great character.  Catching her boyfriend cheating literally in front of her doing the nasty, she packs her stuff and takes off and ends up in Shadow Point.  She realizes Ne-ma lives there and happens to be her Great Aunt.  She comes across seeing a woman being dragged out of a store by a man/wolf at night.  Kaylee refuses to let him out of her sight and follows them.  They end up wrecking but the wolf slinks off.  In comes Winston and they meet and its so cute!  Great little story and I believe we'll be getting Gareth's story next who is Winston's brother!  Those two witches are at it again!  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OHJJHCDATX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0186AA280#wasThisHelpful","R24OHJJHCDATX0","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of Bobbi Ross for sure.  This took quite a bit for me to get into.  I dont even know why.  Now, I have to admit I didnt love it.  I didnt like it as much as her Syalantian series.  It was a decent read though.  It ends on a cliffhanger which I kinda loathe those and tend to steer clear but I am such a fan that I went ahead and read it.  So, yes I was left hanging at the end.  Boo.  I thought that a male pregnancy was really unique.  That her best friend/2nd in Command Jaxx is said pregnant male is priceless.  He's even got pregnancy hormones and cries!  Ha.  This was quirky and had a little humor but not much.  Caspia was really hard to get used to.  Some female leads I can relate to and understand better than others.  She didnt really strike me as a warm person.  She's got a good heart and I am not discounting that just she's a Captain and has to be cold in a way to get the job done.  Thats probably why it was hard for me to connect with her.  Trax was an interesting character.  They had a lot of sexual chemistry but with everything going on not much on the romance front in this book.  All in all a good read but not my favorite.  It was very well written and was well developed.  I await book 2.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVF137C7I0AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AOA6OO#wasThisHelpful","R2MVF137C7I0AO","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I mean you couldnt blame the guy for what happened.  Felt for him.  Dayum was he all sexy and hawt!  Very domineering and take charge and is hurting for money.  He decides to take up the deal to marry River so he can live...its only for a year right?  She needs a husband bad or her father's company goes her to step siblings and lemme say they are biotches!  Geez.  Anyways, she needs a man and fast!  They meet and Taron realizes right off she's his mate.  This was quite a ride...a sexy one.  Can't wait to see whats next.  Maddox and Mari crack me up.

"Well, this was mainly written in Ellie's POV but at the last of it we get Rafe's POV briefly.  I kinda wish that we got a little more with Rafe cause lets be honest we wanna know what he's thinking too!  However, I think she might have done it this way to keep Rafe a mystery.  I think I figured out what he was maybe about Chapter 5 or 6 I mean at that point what I read so far his name kinda gave me an inkling.  I knew there was something about him and he was more than human.  He had a geek persona but the real him there is NOTHING geeky about him.  Wow...he was hot.  All dominant yumminess!Ellie was different.  I'm not used to reading about strong females cause sometimes they sorta turn me off...depending how they are written.  So, I was nervous before starting this book even though its by one of my favorite authors.  I ended up loving Ellie.  She's strong and powerful and she knows it.  Very confident and deadly.  She was awesome though because although she was deadly she had a pretty big heart she hid.  She laughed and cried and got her feelings hurt.  Definitely all woman with the moodiness lol.I dont recall Eve writing about vampires before.  I mean characters yes but having a book based on a vampire characters throughout is different.  I loved the book.  One thing though is that Queen of the vampires Lily she seemed sorta unqueen like when we actually meet her.  She waited too long to get this stuff going.  There was a good build up to her character but once Ellie goes to see her to request she make the announcement about daemons to the public she seemed kinda weak to me.  Ellie acted more like a Queen than she did cause she is very take charge and get it done.  This book surrounds Ellie and Rafe though so maybe Lily is just misunderstood...dunno.  Thats just my take.  I kinda hope she does more and makes this into a series cause those Angels joined them in their fight and that'd be awesome to do stories about them and perhaps Lily.  A recommended read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VJP7FGA9FZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017UZDVW6#wasThisHelpful","R38VJP7FGA9FZU","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awww I loved Phoebe.  I think I enjoyed her more than Vidalia.  However, in this story there isn't any yummy smexy times which was a little disappointing.  There was a kiss or 2 but that was it.  Bummer right?  LOL.  This was definitely a really unique story and I very much enjoyed it.  I love Jax...he was so awesome and cute.  Her best friend since kids.  They were foster kids together and he's a reitred marine.  He's always had her back and she calls him her brother.  So sweet!  They made me laugh.  I wasn't sure what to think of Grant.  I didnt like him at first cause I didnt know his motives and neither did Jax or Phoebs.  In his defense he couldnt necessarily tell her anything until she was questioned and interviewed by the Magistrate.  Wow...what a weird and evil step sister.  Now....one thing I didnt get and I dunno if anyone else caught it.  Her Step-sister Helen was 28, 3 years older than Phoebe but she had Phoebe's mom put to death 25 years ago?  Uhhh she was 3 right?  So, that didnt make sense to me.  Maybe I read it wrong or maybe they age differently...who knows but that didnt mesh with me.  The insta love was really fast with Grant.  Kinda freaked her out and she panicked a little til she calmed down.  I love her....she was hilarious.  Loved that he was a kitty...err....King Lion anyways.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YP7CFKXEHJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01842Z70S#wasThisHelpful","R34YP7CFKXEHJX","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Receiving this ARC in exchange for an honest review.Ok....honestly I enjoyed the book.  Only thing was that there were times at the beginning and middle it moved a little too slow for me.  Typically in her books its just full of stuff happening.  This pace was a smidge slower.I have to say I felt really bad for both characters.  Sympathetic to what happened to Marcus previously and also Eileen because the way she was raised.  She had EVERYTHING done for her.  Never picked out her own clothes.  She was definitely privileged and she yearned for more.  I LOVED her little tantrums.  Mostly it was her being upset at failing not really at anyone.  I honestly ADORED the one she threw on purpose!  HAHA.  She had no self-esteem really.  She in reality felt like a loser who couldn't do anything right or for herself.  She felt worthless a lot of the time.  Marcus wasn't exactly nice to her at first.  Even if she was saving his furry butt!  He pretty much ignored her presence.  He was an ass.  Although, he felt bad and hated when she got upset with him.  Under all that he's a good guy just a little messed up.  His attitude and the way he behaved...there was a reason for it.  He was so afraid he'd hurt her.  Thats what made him likable to me.  He was sweet in his own way.  OMG Chelsea!  I laughed my butt off when she called Eileen and told her Verity was on her way up.  Her and Marcus had sex thinking she was coming to check on them thinking their mating was fake.  Well it actually was at first.  Anyways, it was priceless when Eileen found out Chelsea lied about that!  Made me giggle!  Damian...didnt see that coming!  Will Zeke be next in the series?

"I had trouble getting through this.  I have to agree with another reviewer that this seemed disjointed.  I seemed to move a bit slow for me too especially the beginning.  I also didnt quite understand what it was really about.  Thats what I mean by disjointed.  One thought here but there was no follow through on it before another thing was introduced.  It also ended abruptly.  I wouldnt call it a cliffhanger but some might think so.  I just ended FAST on a thought that she was going with him.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2R0VX46SRHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016PEXFWY#wasThisHelpful","RQ2R0VX46SRHE","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved reading Jackson's story!  I dunno I think this one's my favorite in the series.  It was developed really well and it was a true sweet romance.  Harper was dealt a bad deal when she got pregnant by a lion shifter who was crazy!  Wanting her to abort the baby because it would interfere with his plans becoming an alpha of a pride by marrying the Alphas daughter.  So, essentially Harper was used.  She's young and obviously not experienced with men.  She's also human.  Jackson saves her and her baby.  Its actually a very sweet story.  Kind of a tear jerker a couple times cause seriously Jackson is very sweet.  Great series.  I think she plans on doing Winston though before ending the series totally.  There was a hint to it anyways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23F85L6C4JUIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O3UKKU#wasThisHelpful","R23F85L6C4JUIX","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ohhh I LOVE LOVE Bev!  She is so funny and such a character!  She is uniquely described.  She's really big like 7 1/2 feet and has claws and a tail but is very beautiful.  She has some balls of steel!  Cute story some errors but otherwise I enjoyed it.  I wasnt sure what to expect when reading it.  I THOUGHT it was a romance about Bev and nope.  Its about her new BOSS and his secretary who have crushes on each other but inter office romances are forbidden.  Bev wont take no for an answer and fixes it her way AFTER she takes care of a sleezy jerk after that sweet little secretary!  I want more of this series and just fell in love with Titan's Rising.

"Before I break each story down I have to say that there isn't any real difference between these 4 books with each other.  They kinda all play out the same.  Even some of the wording is the same.  Only real difference is character names and SOME of the circumstances are different.  Everything happens so very fast and there isn't a whole lot of development in regards to the story or their romance.  In a way they are kinda unbelievable and unrealistic if you wanna say it.Alien King's Bride- Your basic King in need of a mate but wanting to wait for his soul mate.  He meets her though as Avia a soldier tasked to guard the Ambassador whose meeting with Rom.  They are both quite taken with each other at first but she's taken aback at his sudden interest in her as a soldier and a woman.  I liked both characters and it was sweet.Alien's Runaway Mate- Sarah's been dealt a really really bad hand at life.  After her father's death she is taken and sold as a slave to pay for her father's debts.  Her master isnt nice to her...beats her and is just so cruel.  She finds a chance at escape and meets Brax who's a dock worker.  He sees the abuse and is mad as hell.  She's his mate but he doesnt force the issue and wants it to be her choice considering her background.  She is scared of Brax and his species because she listens to the rumors aboard the stowaway ship.  How brutal they are to humans etc.  She does make her own judgments at how Brax treats her like glass lol.  She approaches him and wants to stay with him.  Sweet story.Alien Guard's Mate- A socialite is being forced to marry a retched man who's hurt her physically and so has her father.  However, being escorted to said prospective husband her guard wants to believe the worst about her.  Thinking spoiled rich girl who needs a spanking but he begins to see things how they really are with her when she's attacked by her ""future"" husband.  He saves her and mates her.Alien's Little Thief- She's an escaped slave who turned thief to survive.  She is tasked to steal something of value from the King in exchange to remove her slave collar.  She is set up and is caught by Captain of the guard if you will.  He doesn't turn her in right away and as he gets to know her realize she's his mate.  He does get her collar removed and doesnt wanna leave him.These stories are all very similar.  The love scenes are kinda boring and the same.  Its insta love and sometimes those are ok but in this case not so much.  I think my favorite was book one.  Alien King's Bride.  Usually the case that the first one is better than all of em.  The second book I liked as well.  The last 2 were meh.  I cant really recommend this series just for the fact they lack a lot of development.  In character and stories.  Sorry.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGJZ7W5NP8NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R2N2BO#wasThisHelpful","R3BGJZ7W5NP8NR","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok...so Ms. Julia Mills who I am a huge fan of started this new series.  I have to say its unique especially coming from her writing.  I liked it but didn't love it.  It was funny and quirky.  The writing style was different.  She...meaning Vidalia, uses a lot of parenthesis and talks to the reader a lot and I am not sure I like that or not?  I am also not sure about her relationship with Bobby I would have liked to be along for that ride!  She sorta takes us through it but not to my liking.  I'll of course read other like these short stories.  I did like it but I do think it takes getting used to.  If your expecting something like her style with her Dragons...nope.

"Cant tell you how much I loved this!  I'm gonna say that her mother Fang is something else!  I didn't like her and Ling really should have said the word NO to her instead of going along with things.  Odd name also Fang.  Anyways, love Marcus and he was all fumbly sometimes.  It was love at first sight for him but he didn't do anything about it right away.  He was wishy washy but only because he was trying to protect her.  I tell you she had a lot of mishaps!  Covered in green goo and fishy soup?  Poor Ling!  Cute story and thought it was funny and cute.  I don't like all the stories in this series but most of them.  My favorites are book 1, 3, and 5.  Didn't care too much for book 2 or 4.  Wonder who she will do next.  I think I didn't like the other 2 because they were already established mates pretty much, and I like the romance of it all from beginning to end.

He was just unbelievably sweet to her.  Kinda reminded me of hero worship a little.  He found her and rescued her after the bombing.  I agree there wasn't a whole lot of time they spent together and not a lot of time was invested in their romance.  They didn't get together until the end because she was severely injured and then he got badly hurt too.  Not perfectly put together relationship wise but not a bad read either.

This needed more of a back story and I think it would have made more sense.  I did like it once I was able to understand some of it.  Its interesting and kinda sweet.

"This gets a 3 star because honestly the freebie book at the end was better!  LOL...that is so bad right?  Natalie is way uptight and her character annoyed me.  I mean she's not a virgin but acts like it no kiss until like the 3rd date?  She obviously has some issues because of the way she acts.  I didn't like her character.  Kirk...I didn't necessarily like him either...he was kind of a jerk and wasn't exactly nice to her.  Kept calling her idiot and moron a lot.  This whole thing with these 2 left me confused mostly.  This isn't a sweet story and if that's what your looking for move on.  When these 2 had conversations I was left scratching my head like what did they just say?  Uh wha?  Confusing!  Cant seem to talk straight forward.  For example taking a whole page to get something across that could have been done in a sentence or 2.  A lot of needless babble.  This needed development really bad.  Both the story and characters.Trouble was the bonus story and lemme say yummy and hot and kinda funny!  Duke was big and hot and owner of the bar.  Lexi comes from a well to do family but is trying to do things on her own.  He doesn't take her seriously at first and kinda laughs at her and calls her Blondie a lot.  They have some major sexual chemistry and give into it.  Lexi has a rule though.  No repeats.  They both fight it but its just inevitable they try it as a couple.  Sexy story.

"I think this would have been a lot better if we had more of a back story about Connor and Randall.  Just seemed to be so fast and made their coming together unrealistic for me.  Ended fast and left things hanging.  Needs editing and better formatting.  Pages were all weird.  I also couldn't get past the her name.  Connor...I mean that's a male name and I really don't know any girls with that name.  Not saying that it couldn't be Connor its just not typically a girls name.  I read male characters all the time with the name Connor...that's probably why.  I think the author was trying to be different but fell flat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KHLGD28RMIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UWTWC4#wasThisHelpful","R20KHLGD28RMIX","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to read about Caleb and Lia.  I so wanted to know more about Aubrey's brother Caleb...Vampire Master of the city and last female saber tooth tiger.  We got a little teaser in Slade's Feisty Mate.  I really loved it.  It was hot and sexy and sweet.  Caleb's a great guy, powerful and hasn't let it go to his head.  He's smart also and treats Lia oh so well.  We also got insight to his Kiss and what it means to be his mate.  She is Mistress of the city now.  Of course these are short stories and always wish they were longer.  I feel really bad for Galen and I know we'll get his story in November.  I really wanted to pre-order but its not up yet.

"I actually liked this.  It was different and I enjoyed the story as a whole.  Every 5 years 3 random women are chosen to be ""prizes"" for like tournament games and whoever the 3 warrior winners gets a choice of the 3 women.  Aedian chose last and it wasn't a choice really because Roxanne was the only one left.  Roxanne wasn't at all thrilled be a PRIZE.  Hated it actually.  Had a bad attitude going into it.  What made it worse is Aedian has a negative attitude as well.  Detested humans and thought they were weak which they are kinda compared to them.  He did have a misconception in thinking they were worthless until he met her.  What surprised me is that they consummated so fast.  Like the same day as the tournament after dinner.  They weren't even supposed to be married for awhile.  They have sexual chemistry big time.  However, they hated their situation and disliked each other that they both refused to actually get to know the other.  Stubborn.  That was my issue with this.  They didn't know each other and didnt want to, it was hard to root for them.  No emotional connection.  Very little even at the end.  Still they didn't love each other.  Its like a marriage of convenience type of thing but never loving that person EVER.  That was disappointing to me and really sad.  I guess that the way Ms. West wanted it written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYB3Z6ISMPSIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N92YBA#wasThisHelpful","RYB3Z6ISMPSIY","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well....I am sorta on the fence about this short story.  I liked it but didn't for various reasons.  Ok, I get that these Watchers are aliens and came to Earth to save it more or less.  Not like Earth had a choice or anything.  Anyways, in return for their protection a lottery is had and every 5 years 3 women are taken either as slaves to work wherever or as breeders.  Now breeders haven't survived the pregnancy because the child growing takes pretty much from these human women and the child doesn't survive either.  So, if your chosen as a breeder you are pretty much a dead woman.  Slavers at least are given a chance to survive but CAN be killed by whoever is their owner.  So, its rather harsh this whole situation either way.  In Maggie's situation she is chosen as a breeder so she is naturally terrified.  These Watchers aren't all very nice and their human forms are the only forms that have been shown to this point.  However, once she is tossed in a room she sees their true form which is a nasty looking big spider who proceeds to force/rape whatever you wanna call it.  I mean she's chosen but not necessarily on a voluntary basis so it can be construed as rape to some people.  Although it sticks its pointy thorns in her thighs and legs and causes her injury she ""sorta"" enjoys it and does have completion but in essence it is rape and some readers will find offense and there is a warning in the title but it says force not rape which is the same thing just a nicer word.  Then she meets Prince Urieal who is nice and isn't happy she was injured and takes care of her and cleans her up and tends to her wounds but he likes her a lot.  She likes him too because he's nice and has promised it wont happen again well the thorn in the legs thing.  Now, I am not sure but he might have been the spider who has sex with her its not really clear though.  However, she DOES consent and they do have sex with each other later but its rather sweet and he's good to her.  The story ends when she's become pregnant but she doesnt even know it but he does.  It just ENDS!  Urieal wants her for himself but its against their laws or something.  I really wish this was a complete story but the end is confusing and left as it was.  I hope its continued because if not its not worth it to read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RIOL28TR2PPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UIOK3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1RIOL28TR2PPZ","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This moved slow a little.  Its a different story and I was confused at times.  The microbiology thing didn't come up until well after she was abducted.  There needed to be a backstory and not spoken after the fact.  The way things went she was just expected and forced to be a Queen.  He didn't have the decency to explain anything to her.  He only did after she refused to do anything else.  This was choppy at best.  They really had no chemistry that I felt.  She didn't feel attraction to him for awhile.  She also kept going back and forth whether she wanted him or not.  This world was really different and that's a good thing but there was no in depth story about the alien world and there needed to be.  This seemed really far fetched even for me which I am an avid sci-fi romance reader.  It was ok but needed just a bit more explanations to understand this alien and his world and we don't know much about Mary either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397CT51HDJ6UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IR8IKC#wasThisHelpful","R397CT51HDJ6UG","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a pretty decent read.  I really think this would have been a 5 star if all the gaps were filled.  What was with the dragons?  What are gatekeepers?  Why was Marcus such an evil jerk?  Also, the fight at the end what the heck happened?  One thing the evil dragon is in front of her and then nothing and it was all over?  Uh how did he die?  What about those ""premonitions/visions"" she had?  Since she's half vampire now does that mean she is immortal?  Also, from what I understand the whole reason they take a woman from the village is to have sex and possibly see if the woman a candidate for a child?  Those who aren't the one who can conceive are paid after so long and move away?  In exchange they protect the town.  I cant understand why that would be a huge secret the town wouldnt know?  Doesnt seem to be a big deal to me.  Why make the town think those women died?  So, as far as characters go they seemed decent.  Now, I have to say I wish their ""relationships"" was more in depth.  Michael was kinda out of it mostly though.  Valad was an ok character but I felt I really didn't know him or Michael very well.  They seemed to keep Siona in the dark a lot which she should have demanded knowledge of stuff.  Sexual chemistry was off the charts.  Emotional connections were there for the most part.  I think this story and characters needed a little more background for it to work well.  Its not a bad story and I did enjoy it but I did have questions and I was confused a lot.  Siona seemed to accept things awful quickly without many questions or concerns.  Especially the pregnancy.  I think with so much going on in this story it was too short for what needed to be developed to make sense.  This so didn't feel like 196 pages but maybe it was.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZ4LOP2ZXCQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WOU8GY#wasThisHelpful","R3PZ4LOP2ZXCQH","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its a pretty cool case and exactly what I thought it was.  Unfold it to do whatever and talk or text.  Its pretty easy and I know some reviewers might be confused on what your actually getting.

"Not sure what it is about her female characters lately but they just kinda annoy me.  Sandy was ok at first until about towards the end.  She had every right to be upset with Josh with what happened and he held her like a prisoner.  Then again she went into someones house uninvited and started to look for him?  Boss or not or Assistant or not...total idiot.  LOL.  At the end she makes it seem like he held her prisoner for like months instead of a few days.  Then shes all over him and once everything is all said and done she refuses to see him or be around him for the dumbest reason ever.  Cause she didn't wanna work with him?  Uh?  Whats that gotta do with anything?  If her reason was she needed some time to herself to think that's fine but because she didn't wanna work with him or his company...I am just drawing a blank.  I think the story was interesting and sorta off the wall but not too bad.  Just Sandy's character rubbed me wrong.  Josh was fairly decent as a character.

"To be honest the story was interesting but the characters leave a lot to be desired.  I found Stacy wishy washy and annoying most of the time.  If she actually took some time to think about things and talk to him instead of ""trying"" to escape the whole time I think she would have been better off.  I have a hard time believing she went from being a total pushover from her previous relationship to someone who tells Ash to f off.  I found Ash cold and unfeeling most of the time and they were seriously oil and water and couldn't get along.  Its hard to believe they just turned a switch and boom loved each other or liked or whatever.

He did so to protect her but I don't think it was the right choice but I can understand why he did it.  He was actually sweet and really sexy and a good guy.  She was just funny and really stubborn and a strong woman to deal with what she had.  Look forward to reading more and dude...his brother has a fetish for stuffed animals?

"2 things that stopped me from giving this 5 stars.  At the beginning Ellie is said to have blonde hair, but right before they do the horizontal tango she is described to having brown hair.  Then I didn't like the ending for Ellie and Kanatel.  Part of me thinks she is a little selfish because she seemed to go on about not being able to make it as a couple.  Yeah he was exiled and they SHOULDNT go to earth because he IS an alien.  He gave up quite a lot for her.  What about the planet he took her to?  That was beautiful and they could start over.  After him rescuing her and him taking such good care of her you'd think she'd compromise on that.  Kanatel was as sweet and can be.  Took things slow with her.  They didn't even do anything until close to the end.  He's a gentleman for an alien and never overstepped with her.  Never treated her poorly.  I dunno I just didn't like ther ending.  Otherwise, I loved the book.  Developed nicely and seemed complete.  Likeable characters.

"I was excited to read this and kept waiting for the release.  I was kinda disappointed.  The pace seemed awful slow to me.  It was a short book but took me all day to read and it only should have taken me 1-2 hrs at most.  I put it down constantly and sighed.  There is a lack of depth in parts of the book and with the characters.  The whole Weatherly guy thing just seemed a little out of the blue and could have done without it.  I don't think making him a antagonist worked well.  Obviously if it hadn't been for him she would have never got turned but I think with that whole situation we needed more development.  Their pasts and needing to know more about Colt and Jericho.  I felt I didn't know them as much as I knew Red.  I also think it highlighted too much of the sex and manage thing for anything else in the book to survive.  Yes, I am saying there IS a such thing as too much sex lol.  I wanted them to form a relationship and although I felt them caring for each other I didn't feel anything else.  Also, I felt they dived way too fast into sex.  I mean she went there to think and like 30 seconds from knowing Colt she does the horizontal tango.  Then 2 minutes later his friend Jericho comes along and boom again so fast.  Made it not believable for me.  That's something I would expect from a short story or even erotica or erotic type of books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FHLMJGPDKNFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153VNL2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1FHLMJGPDKNFP","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that all the books I've read of hers this wasn't exactly my favorite.  I was anxious to read it because it sounded awesome and I enjoyed the others.  I just couldn't get past at how Kendrick and Joel treated her and how they regarded her as a chubby girl or too many curves and not in a good way.  Is it no wonder she had low self esteem before and how they have made it worse for her.  No wonder she didnt believe them when they told her she was beautiful.  Sorry...she isn't stupid either she knew they were talking about her not the crocodile.  Ha.  Sorry they even still thought that about her after they discovered she was their mates.  Kendrick was a real dick to her and disrespected her a lot for about 3/4 of the book.  Ordered nobody help her and she's constantly falling and hurting herself and has trouble getting her tent up and other things.  I get she needs to prove herself but still someone needed to show her how and then let her do it on her own from there on out.  Joel was a little better but not by much.  So, I wasn't a big fan of Kendrick and Joel.  Joel you can kinda understand his nasty attitude and its more of a defense with him because his mother left him and his dad treated him like a leper.  Kendrick though?  No damn excuse for his behavior.  Just sayin.  The story with Carlie, Ruth's sister was a little unorthodox.  That led me to believe she was forced at everything.  So, I dunno if I even wanna read her story or not.  Gah!  I dunno!  This book had its moments and I enjoyed some of it.  I loved the ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFP45E4GUEO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5Q78WM#wasThisHelpful","RFP45E4GUEO2","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, sexy, sweet, hot, cute and oh so yummy Alejandro was perfect!  He was so supportive of her and although it took him some time to work out what he was feeling for Francine was genuine and they were mates it was all bets are off!  He was protective and just a great guy...yeah he was a manwhore before but he was reformed after he met her.  I loved how they met!  That was so funny.

A lot of these stories were parts of a series and I just skipped right over those and didn't bother to read.  I would have if they were all complete books.  3 of these books I read already previously.  Dark Love seemed to be pretty good til I got about halfway through and I rolled my eyes cause it was SLOW and gave up....NEXT!  Honestly, I think my favorite out of the whole thing was You Lucky Witch written by Marie Mason.  That was actually really good and hot and sexy.

He's wanted her ever since he laid eyes on her while working at his club.  She's drawn to him and wants him too but doesn't think someone like him would want someone curvy like her.  She's got a relationship with a white tiger she speaks to and has no idea its Vax!  That tiger is her best friend and confidant she spills her secrets to.  She's so mad when she finds out its Vax lol.  Great story and oh so yummy!Territory is about Lila, one of Vaxs' sisters.  She's had a relationship with Gavin who's the head of security but they aren't mates and things didn't work out.  Gavin has trouble getting over her a little.  She meets this tiger shifter Cy who's on a mission to find his missing/kidnapped sister.  Lila and Cy are mates.  Lila feels she's got something to prove and tries to solve this on her own.  Cy kinda messes up and doenst trust her to NOT get hurt.  Ohhh is she mad or what!  Has every right to be.  Their journey is an interesting one and loved it!Adversary is an interesting story about Veila another of Vax' sisters.  We meet Mark Martinez who's family of had a feud with the Teiro family for years.  Its a Romeo and Juliet sorta.  This is a heartbreaking story in a way with how Vax was forced out because he chose to take a human as his mate.  His father is old school and refuses to ""dilute"" the lines but Vax didn't give a crap and loves Callie.  Veila stands up for her brother and herself because she sides with Vax.  So family drama aside her and Mark are mates and although its rocky they get their HEA.Last but not least is Sanctuary.  We get Gavin's story and a little artic fox named Laila who knows she's his mate but because of his past he avoids her and refuses to be with her.  After she is more or less scared because of a note she received while working...Gavin's mating instincts kick in.  LOL.  He isn't able to fight it.  He still kinda does but after his fox isn't having it!

"This is a good story don't get me wrong.  I like the characters.  Well developed as well.  I will say in the beginning I think it was a tad too descriptive.  I had trouble continuing after Chapter 12.  Not sure what it was maybe it was the flow.  I read other reviews and they sorta said the same things.  She would have one thought and then start something else without really finishing and there was some repeating as well but by other characters.  I have to say though for a debut this was really good.  I have to admit I skimmed because I had such a hard time continuing.  I even skipped to the last chapter to see if there was a difference.  I did find out that there is a cliffhanger which I don't like those types.  So, I put it down to read some reviews on book 2 Fight For The Fae and also a reviewer mentioned that book ends on a cliffhanger as well.  I'm not a fan of a series that goes on and on with the same 2 characters.  There has to be an ending or I get bored with the story.  I enjoy a series that ends with the first book and then writes about another couple.  I am not saying that the conflict should just end and start another.  For instance you can continue the conflict but maybe highlight another couple like her brother Keegan and a prospective mate for him and continue to have all the secondary characters still in this.  Its done all the time and I guess its what I like and am used to.  Or even having stories about Colin's brothers and a woman in their life.  This just seems like one HUGE never ending conflict but is spread out in at least 3 books which comes out soon probably.  I am sorry to say after finding out that book 2 ends on cliffhanger also and a third is planned with the same things going on that I decided to stop reading it and not continuing.  Maybe I'll give this author another try with her next series.  Just not my thing.

If you are expecting that don't bother.  It was really bad and the wording she uses.  I've read her before and she doesn't get any better unfortunately.  I don't know what it is or lack of caring maybe.  Her stories are choppy and all over the place.  She cant write scenes well either.

"Well...this is one of those stories that you feel your missing a lot of information.  Apparently he's already saved her from whatever it was he saved her from.  She's working for him but has feelings for him.  He does too.  Then we are whisked away to his ""tribe""...didn't know dragons had tribes but more like clans but oh well.  They paint her up and make her walk naked in front of them all.  Take a step off a cliff without knowing someone will save you.

Development is a big issue apparently along with no real characterization with these 2.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R238J6R1FKOO3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0139Q21BM#wasThisHelpful","R238J6R1FKOO3O","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, the main reason this is getting 3 stars is because its not as long as its made out to be.  I'd say each of the 3 dragon stories are about 35-40 pages TOPS!  The rest of this includes different stories and excepts from other authors.  Some are short stories and some only give you part and you gotta buy the rest of the stories.  I get this is a box set and its not by any particular author.  So, apparently its published by a company or set of companies with all these partial books in it.  Nothing but a ploy to get you sucked in to buy.  Pretty good Amazon lol.  It SAYS its 675 pages but at the top it says 22,000 and I seriously doubt anyone is paying attention to that part cause I didn't.  I fell for it.  Well...at least I didn't buy it...Kindle Unlimited baby!  So perhaps I got the last laugh.  I am kinda ranting but apparently this is a new thing now.For the stories themselves though, they were shorts yes.  They were fairly decent but editing is a problem and some of the plots weren't exactly believable and I think one story I felt was missing a bunch of stuff.  Like I got in the middle of a novel and just started reading...so yeah I missed a lot.  That's the feeling I got reading.  No more box sets for me unless its more legitimate like well known authors.  I hate to be that way but otherwise we are wasting our time on this twaddle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VHIUDUE97U64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N9OFO4#wasThisHelpful","R2VHIUDUE97U64","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its ok.  I've not gotten box sets for quite awhile because they all seem the same kinds of stories and always have cliffhangers and want you to buy a ton of other books as well.  Or they only contain part of the story but in order to get the rest you gotta purchase it.  Stories weren't all that interesting to me but they weren't bad.

"Well, I was really into it until the end.  Ended so abruptly and all there was in it was a kiss romance wise.  Really disappointing actually.  I was expecting more.  It would be one thing if it was a series but it isn't.  Just a short.  Never read this author before but I have Calista Skye so I was kinda surprised it was a little boring in the romance part.  There really wasn't any.  Its your basic forbidden love thing.  Also, I thought he was an alien and he was basically a bear shifter.  So a little strange there thats why we needed to know more.  We also need more information about this new world and his.  I liked both characters it just seemed incomplete to me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHU7EDASS4IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W4K01M#wasThisHelpful","RAHU7EDASS4IA","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could have been a series I believe.  It was really a decent read.  Not too short and not overly long.  Intesting characters and world building.  Vampires exist and are part of society.  Seb is King of the Vampires and is quite old.  He's used to taking what he wants whenever he wants it.  However, he is bored with that and needs to take a mate.  However, things change when he meets feisty Rachel who is a Jr. pastry chef.

"This actually wasn't bad.  Most types like this don't impress me.  They are usually in need of editing and more development.  For what this is I enjoyed reading it.  It was an interesting read.  Madison is kind of nave and doesn't always listen to her instincts meets Damian which he means well but kinda messes up.  He's followed her and watched her for years.  Fell in love with her and tries to impress her and talk her into mating with him to be Queen.  Yeah...uh no.  He's a Prince yes but doubtfully will he ever be a King because he's 4th in line.

"This was quite painful to read actually.  Not the whole book.  The beginning was perfectly fine.  Seemed to also take them forever to get to Maine.  The book moved a little slow.  There were so many different things going on it ended up being choppy and not flowing well.  There were 5 women and men being paired up.  I think that's a big reason this book didn't work.  That's just too many to deal with all at once.  We saw no relationship or romance development at least not much.  Sex scenes were either skipped over or were written poorly and rushed.  Unanswered questions remained.  We would be focused on one thing happening and then something else would be the focus and it left me scratching my head sometimes.  I got about halfway when I started to doubt I should finish it.  I'd say I got about 3/4 the way through before I called it quits.  It was just confusing and burning and slow!  I really think this book should have been split up or maybe not split the focus so much.  I also didn't care a whole lot for the women's attitudes and their way of thinking.  Zoya comes to mind.  Just didn't like her.  She seemed to want to cause waves if I am quoting her.  She seems a little jealous of Alex because she got Boyd and tries to make a play for him at the start.  I dunno I just dislike women like that.  Its an ok story just couldn't keep the right flow and delve into one or two things at once instead of throwing all this information at the reader and expecting us to just understand it all.  Doesn't work that way.  Sorry.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KV0JBR1HZBA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D1DNK4#wasThisHelpful","R3KV0JBR1HZBA6","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh holy heck!  I don't know...I think this might be my favorite!  I love them all but damn....Damon and Clara!  Just started this afternoon and I could NOT put it down!  Just had to keep reading.  Damon has been through some awful things in his long life.  He's felt that he had to be cold and let nobody in because he loses them anyways because he's immortal and the only one.  Clara has been through some awful things too.  Losing her whole screw and 2 men she loved and tried to be a family with and have kids only to lose them.  Clara is the spitting image of Damon's love from eons ago and Clara comes from the same line.  She's different and I believe all her headaches and dreams she has is because that woman's spirit is in her.  She's got a task to complete, a promise she made to Damon before she died.  She takes over long enough to complete it.  He's not exactly receptive of Clara at first but he can't help himself.  She's vibrant and funny and really sweet.  Feisty comes to mind as well.  They are good for each other and it doesn't take long for them to fall in love.  They do get their HEA but I cant give everything away.  Its a great ending and its all summed up as well to end the series.  Will there be more?  I don't know what she'll get up to or these bears!  LOL.  We've learned so much about Damon that we constantly wondered about.  I cant get over how much I loved it.  T.S.

"Wow...yum!  This was a great book 2!  These are so short and I just wanted them a little longer!  Slade was sweet and hawt!  Gretchen was great!  I loved her and she is feisty and sweet as well.  These are fast stories which actually are written well for their length.  I can't wait for the next book which is Lia and Caleb.  Which at the end of this one I was like nooooo I wanna read more!  Dammit!  :)  I must wait I guess for a couple weeks til the other book is out.  I am surprised a little at how well Jonathan is taking losing 2 of his fighters so quick.  I mean they had a contract and everything but still I imagined he'd beg them to stay on.  He seems to let them go without a big deal.  Also, Gretchen's old pack...really?

"*****Received this ARC in exchange for an honest review. Contains Spoilers!!!!!I enjoyed reading the story about Knox and Lilly.  Its a little bit different than a ""normal"" shifter world...if we can say normal shifter!  Ha.  Anyways, Lilly's lost her parents at a young age and was raised by her best friends parents who love her like a daughter.  She has an Uncle but he's so busy with being Captain of the Guard he has no time.  However, he's always been there for her at birthdays and important stuff like that.  She's kind of a complex character.  She feels like she isnt good enough because her parents were kinda poor.  So, she wants to prove to others and herself that she CAN do this and be a Guard.  She's taunted by a lot of her peers and doesnt have the best self confidence.  She meets Knox who is The Prince of the Wolves and future King.  They end up being mates but when he hears she's going for the Guard he puts a stop to it and breaks her heart and she runs away and leaves town.  Not the most mature thing to do but I understand why.  She feels so out of control that her one dream was stolen and her life is ruined.  Their mating is definitely off to a rocky start.  She doesnt even know they are mates until he locates her later.  I wont give away everything but lots of twists in this book.  He does end up supporting her and agrees to let her compete.  Ends on a HEA.  Had great secondary characters and hope to read more about them.  Holden and Sloan for sure.  :)This was written well.  I had only had 2 issues with the book.  Some editing errors I found when reading it.  Just small ones and there was a typo when her father, Marcus is described and he was still referred as her Uncle.  Just little things like that.  My other issue was that there were a few times that Knox and Lilly acted a wee bit juvenile a little too much emphasis like stomping ones foot and pouting.  It wasn't a lot but usually at the most high stress situations in the book.  They are in their low to mid 20s and acted 17 once or twice.  Have to say I've witnessed it in her books before and its actually gotten way better but still there every so often in her characters.  Definitely a recommended read for me and I really loved it actually.  I smiled a few times and thought Knox was sweet and protective.  Lilly had a tendency to run away instead of facing some issues but I found her sweet and shy and definitely innocent in many ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RUVA45ZN23WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01600NDIE#wasThisHelpful","R2RUVA45ZN23WU","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, the difference with this book is that it was released in one book instead of broken up.  Considering its Mina Carter it doesn't matter which way because when she does serials she puts them out pretty quick.  However, I did like that this was all in one book.  I liked Jane and Karryl from Tarrick's books.  I thought it was funny that he wanted a nice and meek woman who obeyed him.  Ha.  He so didn't get that!  Jane is tough and she's an older woman and knows what she wants.  She's totally independent and kick ass.  I liked her but she had SUCH a stubborn streak!  Karryl was just sweet and VERY persistent on wanting to mate her.  This was interesting and both actually kinda got in trouble.  Jane because she was caught as a spy which actually hurt him and changed his view of her.  He thought her as a soldier and someone who was honest and honorable and that kinda changed after he found out it was true.  I felt bad for him.  However, he got in trouble with her because after they crashed after escaping she lost her memory and he used that to mate with her.  They were perfectly matched and the sex was scorching!  Dayum!  I wonder who is gonna be next?  Laaryn maybe with Jess?  Hmm...I wonder who would get lucky enough to have Kenna for a mate lol.  She's a chatterbox!

"This is a very much loved series for me!  She did this awesome box set and revised and re-wrote and edited the first 3 which is awesome!  Thank you Julia!  I got this at such a great deal!I have to say to date my favorite book is For The Love of Her Dragon.  Its so awesome and heartbreaking.  Heart wrenching and I cry every time I read it!  Darn dragons!  Love Kyra and she's such a great character!  She cracks me up.  Love her.  Now I've read all in this series.  She's written a book 8 and 9 as well.  I know she isn't done even after that.  There are more beloved dragons to write about.  :) The other favorite is Fighting For Her Dragon.  I know its Andrew's story and everything he's done.  Still though its very emotional as well and Emma sweet Emma is awesome!My reviews haven't changed in these books you can catch my reviews on the individual books on Goodreads and here on Amazon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4KMZJSFU7QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105AGPYE#wasThisHelpful","R1V4KMZJSFU7QY","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yeah...I read these a long time ago and purchased.  However, she's doing more books in the series FINALLY!  No that's not subtle!  LOL.  Anyway, box set came at a great deal and I snagged it.Knight Protectors is a different kind of vampire story.  We have Nibbled By The Vamp which stars Wren and Griffin.  Wren is all kinds of hilarious and very fiery and feisty!  She gets into a bit of trouble at night when she heard screams and being her she couldn't not try and help but alas it was a trap by some vicious pixies!  Yeah not so nice kind with teeth and poisonous venom!  Griffin saves her and after healing her he JUST cant help but want her and has her he does but later after the help of some fellow Knighters she's his ""fire"" which is like soul mate.  So, this is a crazy tale of their rocky but oh so sexy and funny lovedom!Then we have Big Bad Vamp which has Wren's roommate Tory and Griffin's fellow Knighter Liam who is such a man*hore and flirt!  Tory cracks me up because she is kinda paranoid but in a good way.  She's got all these escape plans like 52 1/2 I think?  She's got purple hair and is kinda different than what Liam normally goes for.  He knows she's his fire but considering she isn't all the ""experienced"" in the ways of sex he goes slow.  Which hey she is sorta freaked still cause she is more or less a vampire but cant make the conversion because she's his fire and he changed her to save her or she'd die.  Lots of cool things happen and I don't wanna spoil everything but you'll love this tale.  :)I SOO look forward to book 3!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26R6UW066LURD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HMX3EU#wasThisHelpful","R26R6UW066LURD","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, of course I've already read these books all separately.  I was excited to get them in a box set.  Its a different alien world than I have read.  It took getting used to after I read the first part.  It was released in different parts at the time.  However, it grew on me and I ended up loving it.  Tarrick and Cat are awesome characters.  They are sorta alike but not.  She fights him at first but ends up not being able to keep her hands off him.  She makes the ""sacrifice"" to mate Tarrick to save her fellow human women who were also captured.  Yeah its a real sacrifice for her too!  LOL.  Anyways, read it cause you'd love it too!  Cat totally has him wrapped around her finger so to speak.  These aliens are big but they value women who don't really exist where they come from.

"Loved reading about Carter and Bethany.  Carter is a wolf/tiger shifter.  He shifts into his tiger but takes on attributes of a wolf as well.  Bethany is a rare white rabbit shifter.  She doesn't have a lot of self esteem or believes in herself all that much.  Her family adopted her and they happen to be lion shifters but love her so very much.  Her fear comes from the other groups in her pride not her family.  Her family doesn't know all of what happened to her throughout her childhood and even adulthood.  They know some but not all.  Her mom and dad are very protective of her as well as her annoying sisters lol.  Love her dad...sweet protective daddy!  Ha.  Anyways she moves from her pride to a new town Deal's Gap, Tennessee which is a shifter town.  She first meets Greer who's the Alpha's right hand and he's charming and SUCH a flirt.  I'm new to the Kindle Worlds so this should be interesting!  Carter couldn't be more sweet and hot and charming and hawt...yes I said it twice!  Cause yeah he is!  He wouldn't change a thing about Bethie...love his nickname for her.  She actually runs when she figures out he's her mate...so cute she ran off.  He thought so too he found her later and coaxed her out of her house with the help of her sister Hannah on the phone.  This is really quite humorous and that's to be expected with Celia Kyle right?  Love her stuff!  This is a different shifter town there isn't an ""alpha"" per se just someone who oversees and keeps things on the up and up.  We don't get to meet him in this book.  Just his second Greer.

"Well, I did like it but I do wish it were longer so we could get into the relationship part of Hale and Renae.  I have to admit its not as good as some of her other work, but I still enjoyed it.  It didnt flow as well and when things were happening it wasnt always clear what the big picture was.  He's supposed to be a total jerk but he really wasnt.  He was supposed to have all this magic but I only saw a trick or two.  He turned into a bad ass werelock for sure at the end but otherwise I wasnt all that impressed with his capabilities.

"To give Ashley props this was a big improvement in her stories.  They are getting better but I do find some issues.  Not sure I read the same book as the other reviewers.  It was a good story I do admit that.  Just the banter between characters and things like that just made no sense sometimes.  The parentheses thoughts were confusing and seemed silly.  She talks to her deceased family as well like they are right there.  It was just strange and I wasn't sure what Ashley was going for there.  Christian was a complete douche to her through most of it.  I get trying to keep her at arms length but this kinda went over and beyond and really bordered meanness.  Calling her garbage?  Really?  Wow!  Her co-worker Stevie who is supposed to be her friend wasn't exactly supportive of her either.  Saying she would get more people to like her if she lost weight.  Uh way to be supportive there dude!  Rick the werebear who she patched up no less basically blamed her for everything.  Just some of the parts of the story I didn't care for.  They all treated her like crap!  It was REALLY hard for me to root for anyone other than Veronica and yes later I rooted for Christan when he got over himself and did a 180.  I think the ONLY one nice to her from beginning to end and he didn't even spend that much time with her was Argo I think his name was.  He was sweet.  Also this wasn't 166 pages.  It was half of that because there was another story included which I have read before.  Don't like when authors add extra stories to make books seem longer.  Honestly that's what it was whether it was intended that way or not.  I do continue to read her stories because they are good stories.  Just the conversations, editing, and development can be off putting at times.  :)  This was a solid 3 stars for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZI2NR8XLGMDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K47ZO4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZI2NR8XLGMDP","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.  Contains spoilers.  Faith is a young woman in an abusive relationship with a man named Wolf who’s a leader of a violent gang called Los Lobos.  She’s desperate  to get away from him and his abuse.  She learns he plans to lock her away in a compound of his and refuses to be his slave so she escapes.  However, a few days prior to her escaping she meets Jackson who was supposed to be meeting Wolf for information.  Something about Faith that draws Jackson in and he wants her.  He’s not exactly sweet to her and she’s wasn’t nice either more like a defense mechanism.  Jackson isn’t a nice guy but he’s not abusive like her ex.  He’s rough around the edges for sure and is part of a gang called The Brotherhood.  Difference between these groups is Los Lobos are killers plain and simple.  The other is not.  They steal basically and that type of deal.  We never really know much about them in the book.  Anyways, Faith goes to find Jackson and found him she does.  He offers her protection at a price.  Her surrender and he wants a son out of her.  He wants her total surrender and wants to be her Master and Owner.  He wants to dominate her.  After spending 3 days together doing the deed he ups and leaves her to go after this gang to kill them all.  By himself and alone and risks his life.  Of course she ends up pregnant and has a son, Sam.  However, this goal of his takes him 12 years.  All that time and Faith raises their son for almost 12 years all on her own.  When he comes back its not all roses.  She never stopped loving him and having hope he’d be back.  They both stayed celibate through the 12 years which is unheard of.  Things get to a rocky start when he does come back.  Eventually though things work out and he meets Sam and they just hit it off like buddies.  So, through everything Faith and Jackson get their HEA.My opinion is this is a good first book for Chance.  Not a bad job at all.  I could tell it was written by a man but I can understand how difficult that can be.  I have to be honest though that when I read what it was about I was excited.  However, as I went along its not really what I was expecting.  The timeline just didn’t work for me.  12 years.  Hard to wrap my head around you know?  There were a few of things that bothered me.  The whole “I wanna own you and be your master and I want your surrender and I wanna dominate you” is like a BDSM kind of thing.  That was nowhere in this book.  It was explained way later what he meant by that.  In a nutshell its marking his territory plus having sex with her in all her *ahem* places.  Best I can describe it on Amazon.  So, I get the total surrender thing and even possibly dominating.  Master and Owner thing just didn’t jive in this book though.  Never came up.  I’m an avid reader of BDSM so I fairly know what dominating, owning, surrendering etc is.  I also think there needed to be more information about Jackson and Faith.  We really don’t know them.  They spent so little time together that there was no real relationship there.  Not that I expect a big one or even one so in depth.  I just think throwing in the being apart for 12 years messed it up for me.  We don’t know much of anything about where they come from.  Also, we needed a little backstory about the Los Lobos and The Brotherhood.  I THINK they might have been MC’s but I don’t know for sure.  Its so vague.  We don’t get to know Faith and Jackson’s age until almost half the book.  I am also surprised there was no interaction with this Wolf guy or their gang except that one guy and it was like a sentence saying he’s a dead man.  We get no interaction between Faith and Wolf either.  Seems underdeveloped character wise and I mean all of them.  Its like the story was between Jackson and Faith and The Brotherhood which consisted of 4 people.  I KNOW Chance is doing more book in this series and maybe we’ll get more character development.  Even after everything I mentioned I still thought it was a decent read with a lot of potential.  It just didn’t quite make it for me.  I needed more background and development in the story and characters.  I think the biggest hurdle for me was the 12 year block.  I do look forward to reading his next book though.  So pretty good job Chance.  :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9OBAFCSDN0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1927947529#wasThisHelpful","RE9OBAFCSDN0I","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really loved the story BUT I think Ellen's self worth needed to be addressed.  I mean she had a low self-esteem.  Thought she was so plain and boring and she's also a bbw.  Kinda felt Mix didn't want someone like her because she wasn't as pretty as he is used to being with.  Felt because of fate he was forced to take her.  I knew that really wasn't true.  Yeah he didn't necessarily assure her he thought she was beautiful and he wanted her.  I think that's what was missing from it.  Although he was drawn to her from the beginning although he fought it til he scented her.  She really was funny and sweet.  Its a shame those other 2 witches were you know....*itches.  :)  Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.  It really was a great story.

"I really loved this.  It was a little darker and different.  Jackson and Alex are mates but she is leaving because of the violence all the time.  His clan are rough around the edges and have issues controlling their bears.  That is the reason primarily she is leaving although there is another reason.  An abused ex-husband who is bat***t crazy.  She ends up hurt and Jack comes to her rescue.  Its actually sweet and she gets to know the real him instead the fighting all the time she also gets to know the other guys.  They stop fighting long enough for her to breath and relax and get to know them all and to heal from her injuries.  Great story and look forward to the other bears finding their mates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LIPWHGANLNZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QRVP3C#wasThisHelpful","R1LIPWHGANLNZ5","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people might get mad at me but there are some issues that need to be addressed.  There are issues with this story and the previous few.  Lack of romance between characters.  In this one everything was rushed.  She seemed to hate him at first in the diner but then boom she's had a crush on him for 10 years.  That just didn't make any sense.  She knew who he was and she was kinda hostile towards him.  I realize he was an idiot at first trying to flirt with her but still.  Then he yells he loves her as he skedaddles out her apartment for an assignment and she says nothing?  She doesn't even think anything of it at the time.  So, I dunno it was missing something.  These are great stories but I think compared to what we are used to reading from her these aren't as good as others.  I thought a demon this time was an interesting touch.  Seems like there are very good stories but its the romances themselves that aren't as good.  Ms. Kristen's Mate series were awesome.  Just wondering how it can be the same author?  These are short stories and I get that there isn't going to be a lot of details but I think I agree with another reviewer that how they ""sense"" their mates are inconsistent.  We need a bit more.  For instance, Liam Skyworth's story was way better than the ones that came after his book to be honest.  His came in parts but still I felt the romance and connection between the characters and the story was great too.  Not that I'm gonna stop reading just hopefully she'll read the reviews and maybe take our suggestions.  :)  Maybe Dylan or Luke will be next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LL7ODWEQ8GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QGEMWO#wasThisHelpful","R37LL7ODWEQ8GS","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Contains some spoilers!!!!I'm a fan of Lynn Cooper and this was way different than what she normally does.  This is a very dark tale.  It doesn't necessarily have a HEA.  Maybe not even a HFN.  Its a weird situation and if you read it you'd understand what I mean by thats.  I will say this is a dark romance book and not for the faint of heart because it included kidnapping and holding a woman captive and some abuse.  We meet Amara who is a young woman who's had a sheltered life and religious one at that including still being a virgin.  She was abandoned by her hippie parents and left to the care of her Grandmother who raised her to be a Godly woman.  Well, after she passes it doesn't take and Amara goes out on her own and ends up at Myrtle Beach.  She is alone and gets her wallet taken and after almost collapsing of heat exhaustion she is found by a seemingly nice guy Colt.  However, she comes to find out not everything is as it seems and nor is everyone.  He drugs her and kidnaps her and puts her in a cell in the basement of his home in the mountains.  When she wakes that's where her nightmare begins or so she thinks.  She is confronted by a man who looks exactly like Colt but is way darker and meaner.  His name is Slade and they are twins.  Light and dark and good and evil.  She can't help but be afraid of Slade but is also intrigued by him.  He's a dominant and he's not gentle or nice pretty much brutal.  When I was reading this it was little things and I discovered that early on that Slade is both Colt and Slade not 2 people.  So we got split personality going on.  Amara doesn't find this out until she is able to escape but is found by a sheriff and told of Colt and Slade and indeed there WAS a Colt but he was killed recently and Slade didn't handle it well.  Had a psychotic break because they were twins and inseparable.  I felt a lot of pity for him.  Slade forced her to choose between Colt and himself because the other person would have to go.  Yeah its a crazy kind of deal and Amara knows that if she chooses Colt it would end Slade and be so much worse.  So, she chooses Slade but he doesn't take it well because he doesn't wanna let go of his brother.  He eventually accepts it and accepts her as his.  Now that's pretty much where it ended after they did the deed which her virginity was taken.  Although he is known for his brutality and being ungentle...he really was pretty nice about taking her that first time.  I was impressed.  Anyways, although this was way different than her normal stuff I did like it.  It was a very interesting story and turn of events.  I wish it were longer though so at least we knew we had a HEA but guess not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VXW3D3TCTGJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NF6S8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1VXW3D3TCTGJS","A3HEG0QCOK446R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEG0QCOK446R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great story.  I really loved it!  It surrounds a quirky little town and its residents who are mostly paranormal.  We meet Joss who is a young witch who is sort of a peacekeeper of the town.  They mostly run to her when there is a problem or squabble.  She's had a very bad day so far.  A growly bear who continues to fight with the squirrel shifters...3 suitors who wanna warm her bed for the winter, a siren issue which may or may not be a legend, a murder, a mate, and to top it off a crop of mushrooms to destroy...will her day get better?  We meet Tiberius Hawk or better known as Hawk to most who is an officer of sorts from The Department of Supernatural and Existential Affairs.  He's kinda growly at first and trying to do his job considering he found Joss in the middle of the illegal mushroom field.  Once he finds out she's his mate the game totally changes.  Add a pesky vampire into the mix who was YES one of the potential suitors who wanted to warm her bed.  Who by the way couldn't HELP baiting poor Hawk.  Ha.  Great story and I just laughed.

"This was a very good story.  I loved Corin's character.  He was a very good guy and although didn't know May's situation at the time he did rescue her.  He finds her bleeding and naked and hurt and offers to buy her to rescue her.  However, he DOES have an ulterior motive and wants to study her.  Once she talks to him and he finds out whats happened and what the real situation is he sorta diverts a little.  He feels things for her but tries not to because he has a mission to find compatible women for his people who are dying out.  He doesn't tell her he's an alien she sorta figures it out.

But be warned, the book is so heavily detailed and documented that it's a bit of a slog to read. If you follow politics, you are probably familiar with the material in the book. It covers the long history of the Clinton's manipulation and abuse of power. The author documents it all, but it wasn't really anything new. If you are a died in the wool Clinton supporter who is not interested in facts, then the book will definitely not appeal to you.

"This is a fairly bad, poorly written book but I'm giving it three stars because I did read it to the end (albeit skimming parts.) it's basically a different slant on a romance novel and as such, it suffers from the flaws of many (but my no means all) romance novels  - flat characters, cardboard and juvenile dialogue, and unbelievable contrivances. Unlike some of the other critics, I liked the way the story was framed - chapters in the present as Dave and Lillian give an interview about their experience on the island, and then real time on the island. The transitions weren't as smoothly done as they could have been, but the framing was the only thing that gave the book any suspense or momentum. The interviewer (and apparently much of the public) don't believe the account of Dave and Lillian's time on the island (why??), but the hostility and snarkiness is over the top and totally unfounded. Character motivations are pulled out of thin air to fit the story so that the whole book is not only unbelievable, but doesn't ring true on an emotional level. And the ending was possibly, one of the stupidest things I've ever read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37P4JNPY7OIN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477821937#wasThisHelpful","R37P4JNPY7OIN8","A20QYSJW937CX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20QYSJW937CX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is like a B-grade made-for-tv movie -- it held my interest but was poorly written and way too convoluted to be believable or gripping. I'm not sure why the author needed to included so many characters and tangential events - yes some added ""thrills"" but the amounted to nothing in the end. Maybe because without all the extraneous stuff the story would have been obvious early on (as it was anyway.) And speaking of the ending - A big cop out.

"I enjoyed the first part of the story - told from the point of view of the youngest of three sisters (Jess) raised by an abusive father. Maybe enjoy isn't the right word because really unpleasant things happened to them, but the story was gripping and the characters well-drawn and believable.  The second part of the story is told from Jess's eighteen-year-old daughter's point of view. She does stupid things and is not at well-drawn or believable as the three sisters. The final part is told from both Jess's point of view and her daughter's and their behaviors are so over-the-top dumb as to undercut almost all my sympathy and interest. That said, the book will keep you turning the pages and I enjoyed it enough that I am going to give the author's other books a try. Warning, it does contain graphic material which, based on the reviews, was too much for some people. I didn't like it but it was true to character.

"This is an unusual book in that I found it heavy handed and amateurish in many respects, yet riveting to read. It is definitely a plot driven sort of story without a lot of character development or subtlety, but I was willing to overlook that because I was hooked into the story from early on. I read the Kindle version and there were a number of formatting errors (mostly paragraphs than ran together in dialogue) but I also didn't let that detract from my enjoyment of the story.

"We got this as a replacement for the NuHeat Solo thermostat, which we loved until it stopped working. This one works fine. Some observations -* It's slightly larger than the Solo, which is only a problem if, like us, it's right next to the light switch. It's also slightly creamier in color.* The wiring (hooking it to electrical in the wall) is completely different than the Solo. My husband installed it fine but without the diagram from the old Solo he would have had trouble sorting it all out. (He's not an electrician although he is rather handy).* The face is black with white numerals, so a different look than the Solo.* Programming was easy (there is no manual but it's all self-explanatory). It took me awhile to figure out how to get back to the home screen after it was programmed as there is no ""home"" button.

The story seemed plodding to me and flat, with no emotional swings even though it dealt with very emotional and heartfelt issues. In part it was the writing style and in part it was the characters who again struck me as flat - even though they were depicted (on the surface) as being really good or really bad.

"I generally enjoy Lippman's books but this one was a bit of a disappointment. Years ago a mother left her child in a hot car and the child died. I find that a fascinating set of circumstances, but the book is not really about that but about manipulation and game-playing by the people years later. I didn't like Tess's continually wondering if she was a good mother, and I didn't like the other characters. The story lacked focus and got bogged down after the beginning.

"I rarely give novels a one star rating but this one was bad, and especially bad for Tami Hoag who is capable of turning out a really good book. The main character is recovering from a traumatic brain injury and can't remember what happened to her. First of all, I find this set up is used far too often and is a cheap gimmick for ""mystery"" and ""suspense."" More importantly it's boring to read. And  in this book it goes on and on. I didn't care about the characters, the cases, and in fact skimmed the last third as fast as I could. The ending did not redeem the book for me.

It's a Hollywood type cat and mouse, plot driven suspense story - and for that it was a decent read although by the end I was really happy to be done with it.

"I read the first book when it came out, in part to see what all the hoopla was about and in part to keep up with what's hot in the YA market. As an adult, I didn't expect to find it more than mildly interesting. But I was blown away. I loved it, found it fully engaging, cared about the characters, loved the drama, the questions it raised and appreciated the broader concepts of power and corruption.  I read the second book and was equally captivated.  I was looking forward to the Mocking Jay and was quite disappointed. If you haven't read the earlier books you won't understand or care at all. I found very little to care about, even the characters who'd so intrigued me in earlier books. The action is more page filling than dramatic. It read to me like the author wanted to wrap up the story and that's all. If you're a fan of these books, you'll certainly want to see how it all ends (as I did).

"At the start of this book I thought ""ho-hum"" three stars at best. The characters weren't interesting and the chapter structure confusing. But along the way it got better and by the end I couldn't put it down. I agree with those reviewers who point out the logical flaws, of which there are many, but I was willing to overlook them because I got wrapped up in the story, particularly the Colin chapters. (Actually, I found Eve, the mother, really annoying and unlikable.) The thought the author did a good job of showing how a person can get caught up in something and in over his head without meaning to. I guessed both ending twists early on (there are clues, plus it was about the only way it could end and the final twist about the only thing that could give it a knock-out punch) but that didn't bother me.

This unit tries to do too much. I wanted a step counter, period. You can't reset this one to zero! Others love it so it might work for you, but check all the questions to see if it does what you want it to.  It's also very large.  UPDATE - While this item is much more than I initially wanted, now that I've used it for a couple of weeks I find that you can use it to merely count steps. The rub is that it can't manually be reset to zero (as it you want to record the steps or mileage of a hike). It resets automatically every midnight. Of course you can get the the answer with a little simple math.

"If I could give more than five stars, I would. This is a fantastic, informative and very readable book about Sharyl Attkisson's experience as a CBS reporter, and should be a must read for everyone. She focuses on a handful of more recent stories (which was interesting reading in itself because we all followed these stories) and uses them to illustrate how corporate and government interests/pushback influence what is covered in the news and how it is covered. The station's own bias (and that of the ""star"" newscaster) also plays a big role. The end result is that stories thoroughly and painstakingly researched and developed by a reporter (using on the ground and inside sources) gets tweaked, rewritten, watered down, and changed to the point that it is meaningless at best. And that's assuming it ever makes the news. It's frightening to me as someone who has counted on the press as an unofficial fourth branch of the government - to keep an eye on things and bring us the truth.  In a democracy/republic it's vital that citizens know the truth about what is happening and it government and the media collude to obstruct the truth, we have state control. I doubt anyone actually wants that.I'm always skeptical of the news I see and read, but will be even more so now. I also found the book informative about the process. I hasn't realized reporters had to pitch stories, get approval, write them, get approval, have them edited, and then either rejected or altered.

"This book was okay for what it is, which is a feel-good collection of stories about the experiences of people who ""died"" and returned to life (A near death experience). But there is no real analysis, no exploration of the experience of people of other cultures, no in-depth attempt to find answers. People's experiences were the standard stuff we've heard before - a white light, feelings of peace and love etc. Is this really heaven/life after death or simply the electronic pulses of our bodies shutting down? Why are all the visions similar to the Christian vision of heaven? What about evil people - are their experiences the same? How are these visions any different from what we experience in our dreams? (some of my dreams have the same elements as these visions). I was expecting a deeper analysis and I was disappointed.

"This book reads as though it was written with the hopes of being made into a movie. It's a Blow'em Up, non-stop action (all unrealistic) ""thriller"" that Hollywood seems to think people like.  Maybe they do in movies, but in a book it comes across as ludicrous. The details don't always add up, people do stupid things, and the author follows the formula of making things worse and worse for his heroine - to the point that by the end of the book it became a parody (and tedious.) As others have noted, the bad guy is so bad (and competent) that he's a joke, and there's way too much torture and cruelty for my taste. I can envision a book about a group of stranded tourists and both their interactions and the struggles to survive - in fact I have read several like that that I've enjoyed. Not this one.

"I found the premise intriguing - what is it like for a mom who suspects her son of murder - and I was looking forward to reading this book, but in the end was disappointed. I didn't like any of the characters much (except, surprisingly, Tucker who is the suspected son). There's a lot of railing and flailing by the characters, saying the same things over and over, and it wore me down. I had trouble keeping track of Tucker's relationship to each of the missing girls and felt there were too many names thrown around without any sense of who they were. The writing lacks subtlety and the characterization is flat. There's one chapter that stands out for being totally and intentionally misleading to the reader, and I found that cheap and annoying. I also found the ""discussion"" (such as it was) about terminating a pregnancy so bland and unemotional as to be bothersome.

"I was hoping for more subtlety and nuance but it is still a readable enough book, although I find the rave reviews hard to understand.  Lisa feels responsible for her friend's daughter's disappearance because the girl was supposed to come home from school with Lisa's daughter and spend the night. But Lisa's daughter got sick that day and wasn't at school. The girl is a teenager - she never called her mom to say I am not spending the night after all? Lisa, and the town, keep beating Lisa up over this. Yes, she would feel guilty, but not to the degree she does, and it got tiresome. As did the missing girl's aunt, who is over-the-top nasty and cruel. Other girls in town have been kidnapped and let go the next day, after being abused. POSSIBLE SPOILER - It was clear to me that Lucinda's abductor was someone different, and I had a pretty good idea how it would play out.

"This is less a mystery than a coming of age story set in gritty town in the Ozarks.  The chapters alternate between Lucy (the daughter who never knew her mother) and Lila (the mother who disappeared early in her daughter's life), and a handful of other characters.  I found the constant jumping around of viewpoint and generation hard to follow at times, especially because all the other characters are present in both generations. I sometimes feel that by writing about ""poor, hard-luck folks,"" and orphans, and victims, and abusers etc, authors imbue their books with an air of importance that is somewhat artificial. It annoyed me here, especially because the characters were largely cliched. And I found a lot of the characters' behaviors unbelievable.

"I found this book interesting enough (once I got into the story, which took awhile) but it was also irritating. The main character is an ex-FBI profiler, fired for being a drunk. She's been sober now for 4 years and works as a PI. She is called in the a homicide detective in a case of serial murders of young girls (not my favorite topic.)  Would a city cop really call on a private, PI for help? Not easy to swallow. There's a lot of forensic focus but nothing really new. The author threw way too much ""PC, aren't we cool"" stuff into the mix - sleuth is Chinese (although nothing made of it except author can check of box for ""unusual"" character), her parents were addicts, she was taken in by her grandparents who were murdered, then adopted by a family that also adopted a Black boy, who is now also gay.  Way too much. Labels don't make a character, and I felt this was manipulative on the author's part. The PI's partner is a computer guy, and while I know some of them are good, this guy is over the top. He can get information that probably isn't even on computers and all in an instant.

"This author previously wrote mysteries under the name Kathy Hogan Trocheck. I liked her mysteries and am not as big a fan of romance in general. Her romances follow a predictable pattern - -  plucky young woman, divorced or recently broken up, broke or down and out tries to make a go of it in a new business which involves houses, antiques, weddings, flowers, whatever. There’s opposition from someone, often family, and a hunky male who falls for her without even knowing her.

"I’ve enjoyed this author’s previous books, but thought this one fell short. A handful of characters muddled around, carrying on meaningless and boring conversations (the author giving voice to her opinions?), and nothing happens. Two sisters - but no conflict or tension. A mother and daughter - a little tension hinted at but not seen. A love affair - sort of, but again with no significance or conclusion. A main character who is trying to figure out where to go with her life, though she does nothing and isn’t particularly likable. A series of arsons which end up meaning nothing and going nowhere. The write up hints at divisions within the community - locals vs. summer folks. This could have been an interesting and meaningful element, but it actually is never developed at all. It stuck me as a book the author began with a few vague ideas that she never got a handle on.

"I loved this book, and am confounded by the number of critical reviews. I found it a fascinating and compelling, and even delightful -  though it deals with a gritty, seamy (and sometimes steamy) aspect of life in 1876. The author did an outstanding job of creating sense of time and place, and in creating colorful and believable (if not likable) characters. It wasn’t until the end that I realized it was based on true events, and the author had done an incredible amount of research to get the time and place right. I loved Jenny, who is clearly the sparkle at the heart of the novel. Blanche was a bit off-putting, but I can understand how she did what she did in order to survive. She was tough and eventually humanized.The book starts with the murder of Jenny. In roughly alternating chapters the book moves forward as Blanche tries to discover who killed her, and from the beginning when the two women met up to the moment of her death. I found the structure easy to follow (unlike some readers - and I don’t like to work at my reading either) and think it added greatly to the structure of the novel.I loved Room (also by the author).

When there's an accident, the father decides to take the blame, and then decides to flee and not report it at all.I did not like his choice then or through out the book, but that's really irrelevant. I often read books where I don't agree with the actions of the characters. What bothered me was that none of the characters seemed believable, there was no one I was rooting for, the plot twists and setbacks were unrealistic, the choices of the characters were nutty, and the ending was too quick and came out of nowhere.

"Like other reviewers, I had some problems with this book but in the end found that overall I thought it was very good, and a bit different from other books (although on the surface quite like Room, as others have noted). In the first part, ""below,"" a young girl, Blythe, is kidnapped and hidden away in an old missile silo by a survivalist. My immediate reaction was ""not another kidnap book"" but I soon realized that it wasn't. Dobbs, her kidnapper, was the school librarian and while he's cruel in keeping her, he does go out of his way to get her ""everything she could want."" Years pass. She has a baby who doesn't live, and then another who does, who grows to be a teen. Blythe had more or less given up hope of ever getting free and has tried to make the son's life as full and normal as possible while being held captive underground.The second part of the book, ""above,"" deals with the world they encounter when they escape. I was expecting a homecoming with family tensions, troubles adjusting etc, but instead they find a world collapsed and the few survivors living in primitive ways and worrying about gangs and autocrats. Again, I resisted at first - this wasn't what I expected, nor was it the kind of book I usually read. But it was captivating and won me over.The strength of the book, to me, was the writing. Morley conveyed strength and horror in vivid ways without resorting to cliches. It was unpleasant reading in many parts because of what Blythe lived through, but her determination and bravery kept me rooting for her. My biggest problem with the second part was that in all the horror above, she finds good people and even goes home and finds people she knows. In that regard it reminds me of Alas Babylon, a book from years back about life after a nuclear disaster in which people all cooperate and fish and live simply but makes the life sound almost appealing. I wouldn't want to read a book that was all bleak, so I understand why authors do this, but it also annoys me  bit.Bottom line, very good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AE70YK29RR1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476731527#wasThisHelpful","R1AE70YK29RR1C","A20QYSJW937CX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20QYSJW937CX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story concept is captivating - Eve is the mother of a teen son with a rare and deadly disease that doesn't allow him to come in contact with UV light so he stays holed up in his room during the day (going to school by computer) but prowling the neighborhood at night. His older sister tends to wild behavior, unknown to her parents, possibly because the family's attention is on the son. The father commuted to DC for work, coming home only on rare weekends - the marriage is rocky. The Eve hits and kills her best friends daughter, and hides the fact because she can't afford to be in prison with no one to take care of her son.

The trouble I had was that each thread then went off in many directions and there were a lot of characters so the full arc of the story is never realized with the suspense or depth that it could have been. Eve was not believable to me, nor was she likable. Because it's written in first person (which I generally enjoy), the author engages in endless observation and detail.But all in all, it was a good book, although not a page turner or particularly moving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3II69B10NCBUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345535243#wasThisHelpful","R3II69B10NCBUF","A20QYSJW937CX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20QYSJW937CX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to give a Laura Lippman novel three stars. I have loved most of her books. She's a talented writer and usually gets things right. This time out, not so. I was never engaged by any of the characters or the central story. I didn't care where Felix went or if he took his girlfriend with him, or even who killed her. I think the problem was the way the book was structured - too many points of view, too many changes past and present, too much jumping around - and all without a compelling enough story to carry it. I didn't like the characters, and didn't find anything that drew me into the story. It seemed disjointed and flat. If you're a big Lippman fan, you'll probably want to give it a try to see for yourself, but if you haven't read her other books, don't start with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Q2WSRIS8XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062083392#wasThisHelpful","R24Q2WSRIS8XP","A20QYSJW937CX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20QYSJW937CX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not read the Oprah edition (didn't even know there was one). I've enjoyed this author's previous books, and I enjoyed this one but not as much as I expected to given her past books and the subject matter. Once I realized it was based on real events I found my interest growing. I did enjoy the peek into life and tensions in the pre-civil war period and the historical perspective. I also enjoyed the story line(s), but I felt the story tended to wander and that detracted from my enjoyment.

"I got this for when my niece and nephew visit.  They are currently 5 and 2 and tall for their ages but this was still a bit big for my nephew.  Not that it stopped him from having a great time scooting around on it.  My niece, the ever cautious one, enjoyed this but was not ready for the drifting with the hand break.  Once my nephew gets another inch or so on him I think this will be his favorite method of transport.  I love that with the low center of gravity they are less likely to turn over than on the normal tricycles.My sister and I each had one of these when we were little and used them non-stop for several years.  They were so much fun.  It makes me happy that they are still around for the next generation to play with.  As far as assembly goes, it wasn't difficult and we had it together in a short period of time.

"I’m having a hard time determining how to rate this transformable laptop.  I’m so torn between how close it is to what I have always wanted and how far it is.  So here are some bullet points.What I like:1) The physical design, everything is sleek, light and everything is easy to access.2) I didn’t find myself frustrated with the keyboard.  Although it is smaller than a normal keyboard I had no issues with it.3) The mouse pad was functional and didn’t require a lot of adjusting to actually be workable (my other laptops took a while in settings to get the mouse set up properly when first bought)4) The initial set up wasn’t hard, and didn’t take long at all.5) This is actually a very sturdy device, I expect it would hold up well in a book back or through frequent travel.6) The touch screen is nice, I enjoyed using it for both drawing and app based surfing.What I Don’t like:1) In the initial setup I found myself having to sign up for tons of different things – clouds, storage, sign up for this, blah blah blah.  And much of the time I wasn’t even sure what I was signing up for and why.2) The Windows Operating System that comes on this is garbage.  I don’t know what Microsoft is trying to do here, but I hate it.  On top of this OS eating up just about all of the horsepower in the computer, it certainly isn’t user friendly.3) You can’t upgrade this at all, no bigger HD or added RAM4) I believe it is an OS issue – but it isn’t speedy at all on the internet.  Massive internet cruising is not speedy in comparison to my phone, laptop or crappy work computer.  Since this is the only thing I have that uses the new Windows, there is a good chance that is the issue.5) Limited storage space – I had hoped to use this for artwork, but because of the limited storage capacity (for installing programs etc.) I cannot load my different graphics programs to work with.6) Expect to have to store everything on the cloud, and for that to be slow because of the slow wifi.I really wanted this to be perfect.  Very few things are.  This laptop is much closer to what I have been hunting for.  In fact this might have actually been almost 100% there if it hadn’t been stunted by Windows 10.  I am going to have a more tech savvy friend attempt to install a different OS on it to see if that makes it better without breaking it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4H7TDV1ILY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RBK#wasThisHelpful","R3B4H7TDV1ILY6","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My friends and I got together to play this game - we had just botched an attempt at playing the Myst boardgame (we really should have all fully read the directions before playing that one) and were looking for something to play that didn't require us to spend hours going through the instructions.  We pulled this out and skimmed the directions like normal.I have only seen a few episodes of the show, two of the people we were playing with had never seen it at all, and the others were die hard fans.  Having not seen the show didn't seem to effect the enjoyability of this game.  Once we got going and got the hang of it, this was a lot of fun.  We were all different biker gangs competing for territory, guns, drugs etc to see who could end up with the most money at the end of the game.  On one hand it reminded me a bit of Risk, where you are trying to get the most usable territories and hold them so that you can expand from a strong base.  However there is a lot of negotiation and tactics involved.  Our group had a great time playing and we will certainly play again in the future.  Because of the imaginary violence, drugs and other adult things, I wouldn't advise playing this with your children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRA1ZVBWRZKO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940825237#wasThisHelpful","RRA1ZVBWRZKO5","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At lunch I ran home to let the dogs out and grabbed the coffee to pour it out - when I opened it the coffee was still warm enough to be consumable.

"This review may sound a bit gross – you have been warned.So, one of my dogs was nice enough to get into the garbage the other day.  What I know was consumed involved eggshells, coffee grounds, moldy cheese and half of a Wendy’s black bean burger.  Other items may have also been involved.  I know these items for sure because they were not salvaged from the mess until approximately 12 hours later when they reappeared out of my dog in the middle of the night all over the carpeting.  Now don’t worry, they came out in the same direction they went in.  Still, now I had percolated coffee grounds, eggshells, bile and moldy cheese saturating the carpeting.I admit that with it being 3am on a work night I did a minimal clean up job and went back to sleep.The following day I got out the carpet cleaner and used platinum pure for pets that Amazon had sent me.  I was surprised that it completely extricated everything from the carpet.  I had expected to still have some discoloration from the coffee/bile combo, but it was 100% gone.  Two thumbs up to this product for saving my deposit.  The scent of the cleaner was nice without being overpowering and the carpet was left very fresh and clean.  After drying the carpet still looked good.  I would definitely purchase this in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UJQEZ5BK6BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XW2JLZI#wasThisHelpful","R7UJQEZ5BK6BU","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My sister and I had Mr. Potato head toys when we were little, and they still resurface at my parent's house for the next generation to play with.  What made me happy about this is that Darth Tater is the same high quality long lasting make as the Potato heads of my childhood.  With all of the current toys seeming like they were built to break, it is nice to come across a toy that is built to last.  This also comes with a nice sturdy carrying case to keep all of Darth Tater's things together when not in use.

"So I'm not a male, but I figure a razor is a razor right?  And the last three times I've gone to the store I've accidentally purchased the same wrong razors that I can't stand.  So I figured that these couldn't be any worse than my accidentally made stockpile of crap razors.These are neither the best nor worst razors I've used - they aren't as sharp as some of the other razors I have tried but they also weren't as uncomfortable to try to maneuver around certain areas as the crap razors I have.  I did notice that they don't sell refill blades (at least not yet) so you will be throwing away the handle after every use... but wait, some of the female razor heads do fit on this handle.  So if you don't mind orange, grey and pink, you can refill them.If you find these at a good price I wouldn't hesitate to get them, unless you have sensitive skin and are a guy.  I'm told that men need sharper razors to keep from getting red bumps, so these may not work all that well for you unless you have skin like leather.

"Our Animal Hospital has roughly 25 employees, countless clients - and a single bathroom that we all share.  Out of courtesy it is understood that if you suffer from gastrointestinal distress - you are not to come into work that day to prevent the suffering of others.  There is nothing we can do however to keep our clients from bombing our bathroom.  We have filled the bathroom with various air-fresheners, scented candles and the like but we still have to struggle at times to keep the odor down.  Enter Poo-Pourri: you are supposed to spritz this into the water once before making a nasty.  Our staff has this down pat and thinks that a miracle has occurred.  Unfortunately well meaning clients use it as an air-freshener and spritz multiple times into the air.  This can cause a cloud of scent that could quickly overtake you.  The receptionists who are label maker junkies have now created new instructions and relabeled it ""1 pump in water before you make a 2."" this seems to have helped client compliance.This stuff is amazing - we have far less stress on the staff from having to put up with smells that did not issue from our patients.

"This is another huge men’s watch.  It is very heavy and attractive, but you have to be the kind of guy who likes big oversized jewelry.

"My nephew enjoys this - it's essentially a boat, with a shark face, and two characters who ride on it and sword-fight.  The boat rolls around and the movement causes the shark mouth to open and close, and if the characters are plugged into their little holes on the deck of the boat - they sword-fight.This is where it gets rough.  Getting the character's pegs into the holes in the boat can be a challenge for a parent, making it extremely difficult for a little one to do on their own.  So the blessing you get as a parent - when you pull this out of the box and discover that it is already assembled, doesn't need batteries, and doesn't sing - is negated by the fact that you will have to keep popping these little characters back into the holes because your tiny can't do it on their own.My nephew is younger and was very very excited to just push the shark boat around, with or without the figures.  My niece however wanted the figures on and off about every 30 seconds.  The toy is fairly sturdy and other than the swords that can break/be lost/swallowed - this should be around long after the kids have outgrown it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFENW8NHJTQ0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKTFK6#wasThisHelpful","RFENW8NHJTQ0O","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a game you can get out of the box and get right into playing. I opened the box and was surprised at how big the box was to have so little stuff in it.  After starting to read the directions I realized that it is to hold all of the expansions that you can purchase as well.  Apparently there are quite a few.  So having no idea how to play this game, I sat down and started reading.  There is a lot of reading and unless you have played before, I suggest reading (and maybe rereading) all of it because it's fairly complex.  I had hoped to play a single player game to get the feel of it prior to bringing friends in on it - I didn't realize that this is also a LONG game.  You will want to dedicate a table to it - I would not set it up on the kitchen table if you plan on having dinner there in the next 5 hours or so.  Also this game builds from one round to the next so you will want to either make up your own character sheets on paper, or print the pre-made ones off of their website.Basically you pick a hero, and you make a hero deck for him.  Then you set up the Adventure and Adventure Path - then each of the locations has it's own deck.  Somewhere in the location decks is the big bad guy you are trying to get.  You travel around closing out the locations to find and trap the bad guy.  Along the way you acquire powers, weapons, and other assorted gear.  This is not a simple game by any stretch of the imagination.The artwork on the cards is good - though much of the print is very small and some of the cards seem cluttered.  I hate that they want you to write on the character cards - so I decided to do that on separate paper rather than write on them.  Also I don't like that there are so many expansions to keep the game going with your same character.  But, as I said this is a fun but complex game.After two days of trying to figure out why I wasn't understanding the directions when it came to application - I discovered that my box actually came without at least one stack of necessary cards.  I have contacted customer service in regards to this (I could not locate a phone number for Piazo but did find an email address of a person titled ""customer service"") I will update this review to let you know how customer service handles the request.***UPDATE***So the Piazo Customer service lady was super prompt, within 24 hours she had responded back to me.  She told me to ask Amazon to replace it, and if for some reason they wouldn't to let her know.  So I emailed Amazon and within 2 days had my replacement.  It was about a week later we finally had a gaming night so we were able to actually play the game.  While it was fun - the game is VERY rules heavy.  There is a lot of complexity and different things that were not clear so we made up our own house rules and wrote them down.  We ended up having a great time playing the game that night, but I don't see that it has the re-playability of a game like Munchkin or Castle Panic.  I am glad I have it, we had a great time, but I don't know that I would spend the money to re-buy it if it disappeared.  Still the artwork is good and they clearly put a lot of thought into the game.  I just felt that the complexity ended up causing us to spend more time trying to figure out what we were supposed to do than just enjoying the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NU5A5DBD6RCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R3NU5A5DBD6RCJ","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In case your pets have never been on a fish based diet before I will tell you that this bag does smell strongly of fish.  I have never had any issues with my dogs smelling bad after eating a fish based food - but one of my co-workers who has a great dane said that it made her breath unbearably fishy so he had to switch her to a different protein.Wellness is a very expensive brand of food that many Veterinarians I have worked with highly recommend.  This specific food is no different.  I personally don't care for the smell of the food and my dogs don't have any allergies so I don't need to keep them on it.

"I purchased her to use in our pathfinder campaign where I play a female Half Drow Rogue Sniper.  I thought I would like her more than I do - First I don't paint my mini's so I can't comment on how easy or hard she is to paint, or how well she holds paint.  I do use them for gaming though, and she came with a lot of bits and pieces that had to be removed in order for her to look halfway decent.  The Bow is very fragile so transporting her requires putting her in a small box to get her to and from games.  What I didn't care for is that aesthetically her face looks very odd.  I like the body and the bow but it's almost like the face is a mask with odd proportions.

"I purchased this to use for our Pathfinder campaign as my Teifling Rakshasa-born Ranger who happens to have a tiger as her animal companion.  I thought this would be perfect as her main weapon is a bow.  From looking at the picture I assumed that these were on the same base - they are not.  Instead they are two separate figures (which works out better when playing).  The problems I have is that they both require a lot of work that I was hoping not to do in order to be usable.  I don't paint my minis and I don't have any tools for messing around with them.  The tiger (or lion or whatever) has a large metal chunk hanging off the bottom making it impossible to keep him standing.  It is too large to use a scalpel to remove and I don't think a kitchen knife would work either because of the thickness.  I'll have to talk to the guys at the game shop and find out how to make him stand up.  Now the actual ranger - she has lots of extra nibbly bits that I think I can remove with the scalpel.  I prefer to just get these things out of the box and play with them, but this is the first time since the 90's that I have bought new minis, and I could have either forgotten all the work they took - or just gotten lucky back then.  Either way, it would have been nice for the two of them to at least stand up out of the box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN3AZ97A1ID0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EY4I6W#wasThisHelpful","R3UN3AZ97A1ID0","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this from a local gaming shop to use in our Pathfinder Campaign as my Tiefling (Rakshasa-born) Ranger.  I was looking for a tough female with a bow, and this fit the bill.  I don't paint my minis (not yet at least, I'm too afraid I will ruin them) so I can't speak to how easy she would be to pain or how well the paint sticks.  What I can say is that she didn't require any trimming out of the box, stands on her own and unfortunately the long lower end of her bow is warped out so that it appears more like a staff than a bow.  I haven't been able to get it to bend back properly, though I'm considering putting her in some boiling water for a while and then trying to reshape it.

"Wellness always makes very high quality and very pricy food.  I was sent a VERY small bag of this food to try.  I didn't know 2lbs bags were even a thing.  When I opened it, I realized that this is a soft kibble.  It looks like little brown Slim Jim pieces and the consistency seems like play-dough. I mixed a bit of this in with my boy's regular food.  They seemed very excited and dug through their food picking this soft kibble out and eating it first. After skimming the ingredients I determined that much like the other Wellness band foods, this appears to be made of high quality ingredients.  Unless your dog has bad teeth, I am not sure why you would feed a soft food.  I certainly wouldn't pay extra for a soft food because - unlike cats- dogs generally do get dental benefit from eating dry food. I don't think I would feed this regularly to my boys (they are both 50lbs dogs so it would be expensive as well) but with the resealable bag - I have been using this bag as a giant bag of training treats.  This has been very successful because they like it, it's healthy, it's already in small pieces and although it is a little greasy feeling, it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't put it in my pocket.So I wouldn't buy this as a regular food for my pets (unless there was a medical reason for them to have a soft kibble) but I might buy the small bags of this food to keep using as training treats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS5RMWEU19GXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03O4U#wasThisHelpful","RS5RMWEU19GXW","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how to review perfumes - I work in an animal hospital, so smells are categorized as: Good, Bad, Don't buy that again, Covers Bad smells well, Needs Cleaning ASAP, and Needs a Doctor ASAP.  Perfumes don't fit well into those categories.  People are able to say that some of them are woody or list different scents within a perfume - I am not that person.I do like the scent of this perfume, it isn't overpowering and it seems to last all day.  It also isn't overly childish smelling, nor does it smell like ""little old lady.""

"These are training treats - so they are small cylindrical treats that are to be given while training.  These had a very strong smokey odor and were surprisingly greasy feeling.  My dogs enjoyed them, but I had an issue with them.  If I am out working on training my dog to do something - I put the treats in my pocket.  These were too greasy to keep in your pocket and your hands and clothes stink of fake smoke flavoring once you are done with them.

"I received one of each of the flavors - and promptly placed them on the snack table at work.  Two days later I asked the girls what they thought. Our clinic has about 20 employees and almost all had tried these, some on graham crackers, some on fruit, some on cookies, and some just would grab a spoonful on the run.  I asked what they each thought of it - there was not a negative statement made.  The interesting thing is that they each had strong favorites though they weren't the same.  Most of them seemed to prefer the Speculoos, though both Cookies & Cream and Graham cracker had their fans as well.  I personally preferred Cookies & Cream, though I found all of them to be tasty.  I personally prefer the nutellas as a spread (which I put on pancakes) these would not replace that in my kitchen.

"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I picked this - I guess mainly it was out of curiosity.  I have an iPhone 5c, an iPod and an iPad - I figured there must be a good use for a thing like this. I wasn't sure what I was expecting - but this certainly wasn't it.  What came out of the box was a little square that is slightly smaller than a deck of cards.  After some tugging I discovered that there are two cords that wrap neatly around the box so that they stash away completely.  The problem with this is that the cords are also only 4 inches and 1 inch long - so you don't have a lot of play with this thing. Also the ""phone stand"" took me forever to get to pop out - it took two hands and a ton of wiggling to make it happen.  I thought I was going to break it to make it come out.So once I got that all figured out I charged it up - that happened very quickly.  Then I plugged in my phone and nothing happened.  After reading the very sparse instructions I discovered that I have to download an app on all of the different electronics I want to hook to it.  The app was free and downloaded quickly.  So I hooked up my iPad and in less then a minute 89 pictures were transferred. I was not able to download any music or audiobooks from the iPad to the LINK. So I hooked up my iPhone and quickly backed up 400 pictures and 10 videos (2-3 minutes and it was done) but again, that was the only option to go from the phone to the LINK.When hooked up to my computer I was able to charge the LINK from the computer and drag and drop files onto the LINK most of which I was able to transfer and then locate on my iPhone rather easily.  I had more trouble with the music.  The reality is that I can't think of what I would use this for other than possibly as a portable charger when I cannot get to an outlet.  I could just as easily back all of the same things up to the laptop I already have and not pay extra money for this device.  I guess I am just not the target market for this item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REX2K1TDS0OO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUDG9Q6#wasThisHelpful","REX2K1TDS0OO6","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the Natural Balance brand of dog foods, for an over the counter food they seem to have high quality and an attention to ingredients  - I have never used any of the ""rolls"" of food from any brand so I wasn't quite sure what to expect when these arrived.  Now I wish I had been recording it on my camera.  I was sitting on my bed opening the mail and pulled this roll of food out of the envelope it arrived in.  My fat dog quickly hopped onto the bed, grabbed the roll and ran off.  I chased him down and retrieved the roll.  I went back to the bed to continue opening the mail.  I set the roll next to me and watched out of the corner of my eye as my fat dog crept back into the room and comically grabbed the loop hanging off the end of the roll - slowly pulling it out from under my leg and trying to creep off with it.  I grabbed the roll and took it back.  He then began making all kinds of howling protests.  At this point I was laughing because he would never have seen one of these before - I couldn't smell any odor coming off of it, but he was convinced that it was for him.  I hadn't planned on giving him any of this - mainly because he is on a diet to lose weight.  My other dog needs to gain weight so I had planned on adding this to his food for the extra calories and to encourage him to remember to eat.Yes I work in Vet med, and yes I know better - but within 30 minutes of this being in my house I ventured downstairs to let them sample it.  Mainly because it had occurred to me that I would not be allowed to sleep until my fat dog had received at least one bite.  When I opened it I was a bit surprised - I had been expecting it to be more of a paste or a pate - instead it was more like a giant crumbly slim jim.  I was ill prepared for this and ended up with dry meaty crumbles all over my hands and counter top from attempting to cut it into one small taste for the fat dog, and a good sized portion for my skinny dog.  After doling out their portions - they both were thrilled.  This must be some good tasting stuff.  Even my skinny dog ate this and then continued on to finish the rest of the kibble that he had left in his bowl for the whole day.Health wise, I could see this being a very beneficial way to feed dogs with bad teeth who are not surgery candidates.  Or dogs who are missing a large number of teeth.  I could also see using this as a special added on treat or to entice picky eaters to consume more.  I probably wouldn't use this as an only food, though it appears to be formulated to do so.  I like having my dogs on dry kibble for their teeth. I am glad I tried it, and down the road if it ever fits into the needs my dogs have for feeding; I would not hesitate to purchase it.  Right now we don't have a need for it apart from as a treat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KJC2GIZENH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9GJ7W#wasThisHelpful","R16KJC2GIZENH5","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have owned this since I bought at beat up copy from a comic book store back in the 90's when I was in high school.  I spent countless hours staring at the artwork in this book.

"One of my two dogs has ballooned up in the weight category after starting his anti-seizure medication.  We are now on a strict weight loss diet.  My other dog is still in training, so we have to use a lot of treats to keep him on the right path.  Because I’m not a jerk, we have been trying to make sure that the fat dog feels that he is getting treats too.  The Goofball gets a treat; the fat dog gets a carrot.  So when these arrived, I wanted to check on the ingredients and calories to see if it was an option for fatty to eat as well.

The set came with instructions on how and where to apply each of the colors to achieve the pictured effect.  This did not work for me.  First of all, these are not a cream as it implies – these are instead a moisturized powder.  The applicator included was essentially worthless.  I do like the double sponge applicator but this one was not worth including.  I used my fingers and will most likely use my brushes going forward.  Because of the strange moisturized texture of the powder – it all sort of mashed together when applying.  Attempting to get the defined color on the picture was all but impossible.  Part of me wanted to make one of those “Nailed it” pictures for my Facebook (The ones of what the professionals did and then my pitiful attempt next to it).  I still managed to get a fairly good look going with it, though once applied the colors were far lighter than I expected.  The powder looked good, it didn’t chunk or flake, or crease up when I opened my eyes.So I went to work – and by lunch all that was left was my eyeliner.  I ended up having to reapply every few hours.  The “Long lasting” part didn’t really hold up for me.  The good thing is that the case seals very well. You don’t have to worry about bringing it with you and the thing popping open in your purse.I liked the simplicity of the great colors all matched together in a palette.  I didn’t like the included applicator or how quickly the makeup was gone.  If I had a young daughter starting to get into makeup, this would be something I might get her – but I will go back to my regular routine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YD8RPW4VX1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLP9RSG#wasThisHelpful","R38YD8RPW4VX1U","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s – but I did not use VS shampoo or conditioner, and neither did my mom.  So I have no strong memories of this scent that many others do.  The scent actually reminds me of Luden’s cherry cough drops.  It is an attractive candy like scent that is not overly strong.  I was a little confused as to why the main selling point of this product seems to be the scent rather then what it does for your hair.  This seems to be focused on just your regular daily wash and condition; if you have needs beyond that you may want to look into their other products.  I have been using this for about a week.  I think it is (at this point in time) well priced for a daily conditioner and will work well for people who don’t need special conditioner (dry or oily hair.)  I personally have dry hair so I will most likely go back to my heavy moisturizing conditioners, but wouldn’t think twice about using this if my hair decided that it didn’t need the more expensive conditioner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RSKDMHQDD15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP24HK8#wasThisHelpful","R28RSKDMHQDD15","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never played Castle Panic, and hadn't played Munchkin in years.  This game is a blending of the two.  The people I played with had never even heard of those games.  It took us a while to work through the rules, I would definitely say that as a group you have to work through learning how to play. Then it becomes much more fun.  The objective is to either individually or cooperatively keep the castle from being overtaken by monsters while still coming out top munchkin.  It was highly enjoyable once we figured out what we were doing. This is not a 15 minute game, expect to spend some time playing.  I also wouldn't get it for kids under 10... they would be able to play but I don't know that they would really enjoy the nuances of the game.As we play more I will add to the review.  As the game is, if you have a group of people for a game night - I recommend this game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EOYK1YT3T128/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R2EOYK1YT3T128","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Niece loves this cute little tea set - mainly because of the colors.  You can't actually add tea to this set as the cups have holes in them and the teapot doesn't open. The teapot does however - sing and talk and make sounds which you can change by the switch on the bottom of the teapot. This alters the level of the songs and sounds that it makes from 6month old up to 18month+.  My niece is 4 and thus older than the recommended age for this play set, but she enjoys it none the less because it is cute and holds up well to her little brother.

"Let me start by saying, this is the only game we have for the LeapTV system, so some of the technical complaints may actually be the system and not the game.I got this for my 4 year old niece and 1 year old nephew.My niece enjoyed the game, her mom and dad like that the game is educational and requires her to move around (but not run).  They can interact with her by offering guidance, watching her play and coaching her.  She is 4 and was able to figure out how to use it on her own.  There were some software issues but in the end she had a great time playing.Pros:- other than long loading times, adults were the only ones to notice the cons :)- she was able to figure out what to do and how to do it, which made her very happy- the audio was clear and had simple easy instructions- the games had educational components to them - matching shapes and colors, sorting things by what they do etc.- there was no way for her to lose, which kept her from getting frustrated (and she is easily frustrated)- somewhat active, requires standing and moving but not jumping or running.Cons:- EXTREMELY long loading screens whenever you select something, at one point my niece thought she had broken it because it took so long to load- Video quality isn't great, my brother-in-law is guessing about 10-15 frames per second.- At times it was slow and laggy, often stuttering.- The first time they launched the game, the menus weren't there so they had to exit and start over.My Niece really enjoys this game.  Because of the issues we encountered, I would wait until you can find it for 10-20 dollars which is in our mind, closer to the actual value of the game.  For the little ones it can be a great time shared with the family, provided the adults can stand to wait through the excessive load times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20GPXNQBGDV5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG3RHB6#wasThisHelpful","R20GPXNQBGDV5P","A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you need a way to get your retriever to the dog park, but still have the back seat of your car hospitable for humans, this is the answer.This cover is the best solution because it coves the entire seat, floor and front seat backs.  The panel across the front seat backs creates a barrier that discourages your dog from passing between the seats to join you in the front.Installation takes a couple minutes and basically consists of attaching the built-in straps with quick release buckles to the four outer head rests on your car.  Small puffy tags sewn to the back of the cover can be stuffed between the backseat cushion and backrest to keep the cover on the seat instead of just hammocking between the front and back head rests.  Another set of tags attach with snaps to the sides of the cover.  Stuffing these between the rear seat back edges keep the cover from drooping at the sides.  There are even velcro straps to attach to the rear seat belts.  I’ve never needed those, but they stay out of your way if they aren’t needed.There are also pass-troughs for the rear seat belt buckles, if your dog will be sharing the back seat with a human friend.  These pass-throughs seal completely shut with velcro when not in use.Another nice touch is the side flaps that fall down the sides of the rear seat cushion.  When it comes to dog hair, more coverage is always better.I do have a couple gripes.  The cover is advertised as machine washable, but a large tag sewn on the cover states it should be cleaned with a damp sponge only.  Formosa confirms these covers are washable and I have washed mine three or four times with no ill effects.  The plastic buckles make a racket in the dryer, but cause no harm.The cover is quilted fabric that looks durable, but is a loose enough weave that dog hair sews itself in easily.  Some of this hair comes out when the cover is washed, but most stay.  This cover may keep your car looking nice, but the cover itself will get ugly.  While this cover has a plastic backing, the quilting goes straight though the backing, so thin liquids—like pee—may seep though in small amounts.  I would expect it to hold vomit or poo completely off the upholstery.My cover developed a small flaw.  I emailed Formosa and they responded the next day and solved my problem.  It seems like this company would like to build a happy customer base.This cover has helped me a lot.  I have a new car.  My old seat cover helped keep hair off the seats, but my dog often moved it out of place, creating a mess.  Even when it was in place, it did nothing to prevent hair on the front seat seat backs and armrests when my dog would stick his head between the front seats.  I bought this cover after I spent a day trying to get hair out of my back seat.  Now my seats and floor are free of hair and dog smells can be taken out and thrown in the washing machine.Finally, my dog likes it.  When he sees me installing it, he gets excited that he gets to go somewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQ3TQE2M3D72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSC40DY#wasThisHelpful","R3CQ3TQE2M3D72","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Esky series coolers are Coleman’s entry into the super cooler market.  Several companies make super coolers, but Yeti is the best known brand.  Coleman has followed the formula almost exactly.  2” or more insulation, recessed rubber latches, gasket in the lid, tie down points, rope handles, even a Bear Resistant Certification from the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee.But the Esky has a few tricks of its own.  It has a textured exterior to hide wear and scratches.  The Esky comes with a cutting board that stashes under the lid.  That cutting board and the walls of the cooler have a antimicrobial coating.  The Esky does not have molded in handles.  Where they would be, you’ll find bottle openers.  The Esky’s drain is all plastic, but seems strong and is fully recessed.Yeti offers a 5 year warranty on its coolers, so Coleman warrants the Esky for 6 years.  And, of course, they are made in the U.S.A.Coleman rates the Esky 55 as being able to retain ice for 6.83 days.  How well any super cooler will retain ice depends more on how well you pre-chill both the cooler and the contents, and how you pack it.  The Esky should certainly perform as well as the best of the super coolers with it’s 2” side insulation and 2.5” top and bottom insulation and really good gasket design.Do you need a super cooler?While at first glance it seems like super coolers like the Esky are just stronger, better built coolers with better insulating properties, they really are a different breed of cooler meant for a different uses.To get the really long ice retention from a super cooler, you must first pre-chill the cooler.  That means sacrificing a bag of ice or two to the cooler the day before you intend to pack it.  If you just toss some beers and a couple bags of ice into a super cooler and a regular cooler, you’ll find the regular cooler will keep ice longer than the super cooler.  Why?  Because the super cooler has so much insulation that needs to be cooled down before it starts retaining ice.  If you pre chilled the coolers then checked them five days after packing them, it’d be a different story.Super coolers are better built, but they’re heavier too.  The Esky 55 weighs close to 35 pounds!  Also, you won’t find wheels and telescoping handles on a super cooler.  Luggage wheels aren’t grizzly proof.So if you want to want to stop at the Quickie Mart and get some pop and ice on the way to a day trip to the lake, use a regular cooler.  If you’re staring down a hurricane and need to be ready for a week-long power outage, use a super cooler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOWJIZMR7WYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGZCEXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IOWJIZMR7WYA","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first dog was wild for his Greenies, and insisted on having one everyday.  My current dog likes these Freshmint Greenies very much and likes taking one to his favorite spot and chewing it up at his leisure.  The trouble with Greenies, then and now has always been the high price.  This pack is $18 as I write this.  With 12 regular size treats in a pack, that’s $1.50 per treat.  Give one treat per day and that’s $45/month for dog treats.I can’t say that I find much improvement in my dog’s breath or teeth after chewing Greenies regularly, so I consider these as just a treat for my pup.

"The variety I’m reviewing is Smoky Applewood BBQ Chicken with Bacon.  This skillet sauce is just BBQ sauce.  While the prep is easy and the results OK, I really can’t tell any difference between this and a (much cheaper) bottle of BBQ sauce.The sauce is thinner than what you’d expect from a bottle.  The taste is somewhat sweet, but not as sweet as a honey or brown sugar BBQ sauce.  I didn’t detect any bacon flavor and wouldn’t know there was any bacon if not for the label.  There were certainly no bits of bacon as shown in the picture.If you want BBQ flavor, I’d suggest picking up a bottle of your favorite variety from the supermarket at a much lower price than this packet labeled “skillet sauce.”While the BBQ didn’t win me over, I would like to try the other varieties.

"This headset is an odd duck.  First of all, it is not Apple compatible.  But the description makes this pretty clear.  I looked around on the Sennheiser website to find the Apple equivalent and there isn’t one.  The news isn’t all bad for Apple users.  Only the volume buttons don’t work.  Click to pause or answer, double click to advance a track, long click for Siri—all that still works.I have two big gripes with this headset.  The first is the quality issues.  The headband holds the wire for the right hand ear bud.  It’s not uniform, and there’s glue squished out in places giving a sloppy appearance.  A headset with an MSRP over $100 should have better quality control.My other (and bigger) gripe is that this headset is totally non-adjustable.  The earbuds themselves are very large, and if you want any bass in your music at all, you have push them into you ear.  Once you do, they stay in place well thanks to the stiff headband.  My ears are most comfortable with small cushions.  I can wear mediums just fine, but smaller cushions are the most comfortable for me.  These Sennheisers aren’t just uncomfortable; they hurt!  I can tolerate them about ten minutes, then they have to come out.  If you can’t tolerate a dime stuffed in your ear, these are probably too big for you.The sound quality is okay.  I may have been too distracted by the pain to hear any greatness.  The wire is a highlight.  It’s a flat wire and ribbed.  It’s stiff enough to resist tangling.  It also resists making noise in your ears.  The headband, however, makes a a lot of scraping noise if you look up or wear a dress shirt with a collar.These are not for me, but if you have an Android and huge ear canals, they may be worth a try.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAOZCGBYTFH8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEIIAZQ#wasThisHelpful","RAOZCGBYTFH8Y","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somehow, it has become tradition in my house for our dog to get his morning treat when I go to the kitchen to get my morning coffee.  When my dog first tried these treats, it took him a few sniffs to decide that he likes them very much.  I took a poll of the dogs at the local dog park and all of them liked Bear Biscuits very much too.  (Hint, if you do this, take a limited number of treats.  You won’t get any peace until you can show you have none left.)These certainly have a much stronger smell than the usual crunchy biscuit.  It makes me think they have a stronger flavor too.  Each biscuit is smaller than the typical crunchy biscuit.  I think they’re small enough and healthy enough that they could be used as training rewards.The label says these are the same treats that are given to bears in zoos.  I don’t see how that makes them better for dogs, but my dog collects his two treats and heads off for the living room carpet for his breakfast snack.  I can hear the crunching from the kitchen.I’ve reviewed other dog treats for Amazon and given some otherwise very good treats bad reviews because they were stupidly expensive.  Amazon has these treats for $3.49 for a one pound bag as I write this.

"This is just a basic hand mixer.  There are only three speeds: fast, faster and “fling batter into the next room.”  There is no slow speed, so make sure you’ve got the beaters in the bowl and vertical before you turn the mixer on.  The wire beaters and high power do a good job of beating down lumps.  Every surface of the mixer that’s likely to get splattered is smooth and easy to clean.  The beaters eject with a lot of enthusiasm, so make sure you’re aiming at the sink before you hit that button.Cuisinart sells different beaters for this mixer, but the wire beaters are good for most jobs.

"Fresh ’n Clean shampoo is good, basic shampoo for dogs.  We have two dogs in our household, a young short haired dog and an elderly longer haired dog who suffers from all kinds of skin allergies and itching.  Fresh ’n Clean works well for them both.  Our elderly pup still itched after his bath, but perhaps slightly less.  Bathing him with a shampoo containing Aloe Vera makes me feel a little better, anyway.The scent is pleasant and really does last a long time.  Even weeks after, I caught a slight whiff of it when the dog wet his fur from licking himself.The 1 gallon size is convenient, but also a problem.  Trying to handle a gallon jug while corralling a dog who doesn’t want a bath can be a challenge.  Also with the gallon size, it’s easy to pour out a lot more than you really need, wasting shampoo.  A pump is a good idea if you’re going with the gallon jug.Nice, long-lasting scent; easy on my elderly pup’s itchy skin and a fair price with free shipping.  5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R71F8LIRJ2XZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH2VA58#wasThisHelpful","R71F8LIRJ2XZ5","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CandyShell AMPED is a standard Speck CandyShell case with a tiny acoustical horn moulded into the silicone layer of the back of the case.  Speck claims that this horn will make the iPhone's built-in speaker twice as loud.  There have been other horn set-ups for the iPhone before, but the ones I have heard of were built into docks.  This is the first horn built into a case that I know.Does it work?  Yes!*****Enter Geek Mode*****To prove it, I get to break out my sound level meter and do some experiments!  Part of how loud the iPhone sounds has to do with whether the speaker is pointing at you or not.  The AMPED case effectively moves the speaker from the bottom to the side of the case, so I made measurements with the bottom of the phone and the side of the phone aimed at the meter.  I used the opening chords from Tom Petty's ""Runnin' Down A Dream"" with my iPhone 5S volume turned up all the way.  I maintained a distance of 12"" from speaker to microphone.  Here's what I found:naked -- bottom, 76dB; side, 73dBCandyShell case -- bottom, 78dB; side, 74dBCandyShell AMPED case -- bottom, 75dB; side, 82dBI have no idea why using a standard CandyShell case would cause the iPhone to be slightly louder.  That was a surprise.  If you compare a naked iPhone with its bottom pointed at the meter to iPhone AMPED with its side pointing at the meter, the increase is 6 dB.  A 6 dB increase is considered by many to be the point where audio sounds twice as loud.  So the AMPED case passes the twice as loud test.*****Exit Geek Mode*****Speck claims the AMPED case makes the iPhone sound clearer.  What I can tell you is that the AMPED case boosts midrange frequencies.  With the AMPED case on, the iPhone sounds like the transistor radio you had in the `70s (without the static).Aside from the sound, the AMPED case has the pluses and minuses of the regular CandyShell case.  It offers great protection for your phone, but the glossy surface of the case itself scuffs ridiculously easily and looks old within a couple of days.The AMPED case is thicker to accommodate the horn.  When the speaker is playing, the back of the case vibrates, tickling your hand.  The thicker back does not interfere with the camera or the flash.  I was concerned that the new speaker position would be easy to block while holding the phone, but the grill is large enough that it's hard to block enough of it to make a big difference.So the Speck AMPED case trades a little thickness for louder sound from the built-in speaker.  For me it's a great trade.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2626PA4RZVHUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITPQKBG#wasThisHelpful","R2626PA4RZVHUQ","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve panned other dog treats I’ve reviewed recently because they were so darn expensive.  And while you can’t really compare Beggin’ Poppers to the treats I reviewed before (they were dental chews) they are at least affordable.  There are about 50 treats in each package, so a four pack is about 200 treats.  At Amazon’s price as I write this, that’s about 17 cents each.  I can handle that.My household’s two dogs like these.  They work well with Kong chew toys.  Hide them inside the Kong to create a fun puzzle to entertain your dog.  I didn’t have much luck with the snout launcher built into the lid.  It does work sometimes, but can fling treats far and in unexpected places like behind the couch or in your eye.  It’s cute though, and ups the fun factor for your dog.I took the Beggin’ Poppers to the dog park to see if my dog’s friends like them.  They did.  I gave them out to about 10 dogs (with their owner’s permission) and all the dogs liked them.  They all asked for more.  I was the most popular human at the dog park that day.An economical treat for dogs that they really enjoy.

"This is a role playing game with battles and quests, things to collect and all the thing you’d expect.  But this is South Park.  It’s not just a role playing game with South Park characters plugged in.  This is the whole town, the whole cast, all the humor, the whole show made interactive.  The core cast is here, of course, but also all the side characters are here as well.  The cows, Mr. Kim’s “stupid Mongorians,” Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave, Al Gore, the Visitors and Mr. Garrison’s penis on a mouse are all here.  One quest is to find Jesus.  Need a new attack?  Roshambo is an option.  Walk into any building and pay attention to the music.  It’ll be a classic from the show:  “You almost make me forget all about….  TACOS!”You play the part of the new kid.  Your main mission is to make friends.  You mostly do that by completing quests for all the other characters.  All the kids in town are role playing a medieval game that forms the frame work of the game.  All the adults are oblivious.This is a game that you figure out almost entirely by playing it.  The game helps you out along the way.  Early in the game if you try to talk to Cartman’s Mom, Cartman will say “Don’t talk to her.  She’s not part of the game.”My one grip is a technical glitch.  While you’re in battle, it’s almost impossible to select your weapon from an extremely twitchy interface.If you like South Park, and have ever thought it would be neat to walk around there for awhile, this is as close as you’ll ever get.  5 Stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXKC7EXSN3W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IOAHTQ#wasThisHelpful","RPXKC7EXSN3W2","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an incontinent dog.  We also have tile floors, thank goodness.  What we have discovered is that mopping just smears the mess around.  You need something that will pick-up the mess, and that’s what the FloorMate does.The FloorMate has brushes that “scrub” the floor, along with cleaning fluid and a vacuum that sucks it all back up.  It works exactly the same way most carpet cleaners do, but it’s for hard floors.The brushes and the nozzle snap off for easy cleaning.  The tanks lift off easily and snap back in just as easily.  This model has larger tanks than the base model and comes with two sets of brushes.  One for tile and one for hardwood.  The base model comes with one brush for general purpose use.We leave ours sitting against the wall, ready to use the instant an accident occurs.  The one flaw is that when the brushes become saturated with water, it takes time for them to stop dripping on the floor.  It’s not a problem until you’re done cleaning.

"Amazon is doing something confusing here.  The ""color options"" boxes change more than just the color, they change the type of cover you get.  While most of the covers are made of TPU, the flexible, tough material that most iPhone cases are made from, others are ""back covers.""  Back covers are made of crystal clear, but brittle, plastic.  They're called back covers because they don't cover the top or bottom edge of the phone, just the sides and back.The crystal clear plastic certainly allows the beauty of the iPhone to be more on display.  The cover is extra thin and as close to invisible as a case can be.  But I wouldn't trust this case to protect my phone on impact with a sidewalk.  Also, the clear plastic scratches easily.  I think this is a good option if all you want is protection from everyday scuffs and scratches.I agree with other reviewers that find screen protectors frustrating.  I put them aside and count on the raised ridges of the case to protect the screen.  This case only provides raised ridges on the sides, not on all four edges like full cases do.Attractive clear plastic or tough TPU?  My big gripe is that Amazon makes the choice confusing by putting their ""back covers"" on the same page as their full cover TPU cases.  Make sure you're ordering the one you want!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NEMU5AKYFEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR8Z0J6#wasThisHelpful","R34NEMU5AKYFEH","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Jabra Revo is a wireless headphone/phone headset with good sound quality that surprises you with plenty of really cool features.These are rechargeable phones with up to 12 hour run time between charges according to Jabra.  My pair played continuously for 15 hours before a pleasant voice started announcing in my ear every 10 minutes that the batteries were getting low.  (Connection through bluetooth, volume about 80%.)  They played another hour and a half before giving up.  I was glad about this, because it means that the 12 hours Jabra claims isn't just for a brand new battery.  No charger is included.  You charge with any available powered USB port.The cords included with these phones are cloth covered, beefy-looking and attached to easy-to-grip plugs.  The center of the right ear cup is a button that does all the things you think it does.  The ring around it though, is a surprise.  Jabra calls it a ""turntable touch control"" and if you've ever used an iPod with a click wheel, you already know how to use it.  Run your finger around it to change the volume, double tap the leading edge to jump a track ahead, and so on.  Neat.  Literally, because there's a lot of functionality here without littering the phones with fidgety buttons.These phones connect three different ways.  The way you'll probably want to use is bluetooth.  Pairing is easy, especially if your phone uses NFC pairing.  Even if it doesn't, you need only put the phones on, hold the off/on/pairing switch in the pairing position for 3 seconds and follow the instructions that Jabra's friendly female voice starts speaking in your ear.  It only took a few seconds to pair with my iPhone 4S.If you want to go wired, Jabra includes a standard mini plug cable, complete with a multifunction button as well as a USB cable.  To listen though the USB cable, the phones must be powered on, and you must choose them in your computer's sound menu.These phones sound fine.  The bass is nice and warm if not terribly deep.  There's not a lot of detail, but the overall sound is well balanced and pleasant.Everything about these handsome phones, from the packaging to the cables is cool.  All the features work well and are actually helpful when you've got your hands full.  There's only one downside.A card that comes with the phones has a scan code that directs you to the Jabra app for your device.  Once you download and launch the app, you're prompted to enter your unique code (also found on the card).  The Jabra app is an alternate music player that taps into your existing music library.  Jabra has partnered with Dolby Labs for digital sound processing.  The app offers a graphic equalizer with all the usual presets as well as a ""Dolby Processing"" switch and a ""Mobile Surround"" switch.  Dolby processing is mostly a drastic mid-bass boost, turning the well balanced Revos into thump cans.  The mobile surround switch muddies up the sound, but doesn't produce any kind of convincing surround.  My advice is to forget the app, the Jabra Revos sound a lot better without it.Aside from the app, there's a lot to like about these handsome phones.  Cool features, cool design, cool phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ST6C8T1BJDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFO14W8#wasThisHelpful","R38ST6C8T1BJDE","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a vintage stereo receiver and needed an FM antenna.  The original dipole was lost long ago.  This Terk fits the bill perfectly.  But I think Terk makes a mistake when they claim this antenna will outperform simple wire antennas that come with most receivers.  In most cases it won't.The box and description say that you can lay this antenna down to make it directional.  That would give it an advantage over stock antennas, but the instructions don't mention it at all, nor are there any markings on the antenna to show what the direction would be.  So unless you want to map out all the stations in your area and spend a day experimenting, don't plan on getting any advantage from it.What the Terk FM+ will give you is a reasonably stylish and good performing antenna for use in a metro area.  To get better than this you need a roof top or attic antenna.

"I thought this was going to be an entirely new toothbrush from Oral-B, but it's just a new head on a familiar handle.  Frankly, I think the older round heads are better.The Deep Sweep heads have bristles that move back and forth, so they go up and down against the gum line. That's what I prefer, but there are a couple issues.  The biggest, in my opinion, is that this brush head is huge!  The head is a full 1"" long and "" from bristle tip to back side of the head.  I have a big mouth (so I'm told) and even I find it awkward to navigate this monster to the back of my front teeth.  If you have a small mouth, pass this brush by.The other thing that bothers me about this brush head is the stationary bristles.  Looking at the brush head, the light blue bristles at the tip and the white bristles are powered.  The dark blue bristles are stationary.  The manual says you can use this brush like you would a manual toothbrush.  So this is a manual/powered hybrid toothbrush?  I'd prefer to have all the bristles fully powered.If you like the idea of a powered toothbrush that brushes up and down against the gum line, by all means try the Triaction 1000.  If you dislike the brush you can simply swap to any of the familiar round heads that Braun has sold for years.  Even if I don't care for this brush head, this is still a high quality tooth brush with a wide variety of replacement brush heads.

"I'm a fan of wood toilet seats, they're a bit more comfortable than plastic, in my humble opinion.  Less cold on touch down, and just more substantial feeling.I also sit on the lid occasionally.  Drying my toes fresh from the shower, for instance.  With a plastic seat, the lid flexes.  A wood lid is as solid as a chair.The slow-close feature is a neat novelty if nothing else.  I never had a problem with pinching my fingers--or, um, anything else--with the toilet seat.  And I never had a tendency to slam the seat and make noise, so this solved a problem I didn't have.  You can push the seat down with your hand, so it doesn't get in the way if you had a spicy lunch and need be seated in a hurry.The Easy-Clean hinge is great.  Being able to pop the seat off without tools makes cleaning both the toilet and the seat easier.  One tiny snag:  When you put the seat back on, you have to make sure the hinges are oriented the same way.  If they're not, you have to adjust them.  Not a big deal, but it does take a bit of effort because of the slow-close feature.The other big feature of this seat that is not mentioned on Amazon's product page is the Sta-Tite mounting system that keeps the seat from wobbling back and forth and loosening over time.  This feature includes a cool installation feature, break-away nuts.  When you're tightening the seat hinge during installation, the the part of the nut your wrench is on breaks off when the torque is correct.  The break-away part leaves another wrench-able nut behind for when you want to uninstall this seat.  This is really nice for those of us that want to get a good tight fit, but don't want to risk cracking the porcelain.This is a great seat so far.  It's very comfortable and solid.  It feels so tight it's hard to imagine it loosening.  Only time will tell how durable this seat is.  After all, this isn't solid wood, it's molded wood.  I don't know exactly what that means, but it's a sure bet if moisture gets to it, it will degrade quickly.I'm a good test subject for this seat.  I'm a big boy, about 225LB and I like to take hot steamy showers with the door closed so I don't steam up my bedroom.  It's January 2013 as I write this.

"The Prexiso laser distance meter works fine and is accurate (as far as I can tell), but I think you'd be better off buying a stand alone meter.The device cradles your iPhone 4 or 4S without a case, so you'll be taking the case off each time you use it.  The software is free through The App Store.  The first thing you notice is that you have to click through a lawyer's disclaimer each time you start the app and each time your screen locks.  Launch the app, acknowledge you are using a class 2 laser.  Pause to write down a distance, acknowledge you are using a class 2 laser.  Someone says hi, acknowledge you are using a class 2 laser. It's annoying after awhile.My biggest problem with the Prexiso is that the same touch screen that makes the iPhone a joy to use as a phone is a pain in the neck in a device such as this.  I'm a one-handed person, so it's probably worse for me than it would be for you, but trying to not drop the iPhone (scary--no case!), not block the laser, keep the laser dot where you want it and press a virtual button you're not looking at is time consuming and awkward.This is a slick device, but a flawed concept.  For the same money as this unit costs, you can get a stand-alone laser meter of similar accuracy.

All I can say is I haven't had a jam yet.  This EVO is rated to staple up to 15 pages, and I thought this would be the thing I would call the Paper Pro out on.  But I just happened to have 16 20 lb. pages and the EVO punched right through.One gripe.  You can't unfold the Paper Pro, for example, to tack a page to a cork board.  But for stapling papers, I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3UKEX5J0TPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D44UYQ#wasThisHelpful","RE3UKEX5J0TPK","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First some corrections.  This unit does NOT plug into AC.  It is strictly a 12V car adapter.  It plugs into a 12v outlet and has a standard USB jack.  NOT a micro USB.  The Apple sync cord is 3' long, NOT 4'.This is two products.The car USB adapter has a high quality, solid feel.  It snugs into a 12V outlet securely, makes solid connection and sits fairly flush with the dash so I can still use my cup holder.  A green LED above the USB outlet shows when the adapter has power and makes orienting the USB plug foolproof.  A lip around the outer edge makes it easy to pull the adapter out even though it sits close to the dash.  Someone put some thought into this unit and I appreciate it.The other half of this product is a nice heavy USB to Apple iPod/iPhone 30 pin connector.  Not beautiful, but it seems rugged and reliable.  It's short, so you won't have to deal with extra cable tangling with your feet while you drive.If you don't use an iPod/iPhone, Belkin offers the adapter as a stand-alone accessory.  Mine is going to be a permanent fixture in my glove box.Simple, easy to use, inexpensive and reliable.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZLR6Y7MVH3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KTIX50#wasThisHelpful","R34ZLR6Y7MVH3X","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Circulon Ultimate pan is a combination of a wok and a fry pan.  While many combinations mean compromises, this pan offers the best of both formats.My household has a bad cook (me) and a good cook (not me).  For a good cook, this pan offers even heating and a tight fitting lid that increases the steam inside the pan.For the not-so-good cook, this pan offers a lot of forgiveness.  The high sloping sides mean that this pan holds a lot for a 12"" pan.  My measuring cup says the Ultimate holds just under 5 quarts.  So even if you're making 3 quarts of stir fry, it's easier to stir and still keep food in the pan and off the stovetop.  Food doesn't stick, so it's less likely to scorch.  Speaking as a serial scorcher, I really appreciate that.  The handle is grippy and easy to twist for sliding the contents out of the pan.  This pan fits in the dishwasher standing on its side straight across the rack (not diagonally), so it takes little space in the dishwasher.The non-stick surfaces of this pan are supposed to be tough enough to stand up to metal utensils.  Only time will tell.  For now, this pan is big on the stovetop, small in the dishwasher, easy to handle and kind to my smoke alarm batteries.  Thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R31E6RAVPGBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GYUOQA#wasThisHelpful","R2R31E6RAVPGBW","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My last flip type belgian waffle maker didn't last long.  This waffle maker has a higher quality feel to it.  The flip mechanism feels a little sloppy, with play in the mechanism, but it doesn't feel like it's about to break.  That's what did in my last flip waffle maker.  The front of the VillaWare waffle maker has only one knob with a power button in the center.  The knob is lightly ratcheted and the power button feels substantial.  It's feels more like the switch gear you'd expect in a good quality car rather than a kitchen appliance.  There are no visible wires other than the power cord.I made waffles for the family this morning, and they came out fine.  Evenly done and tender inside.  There was no hint of sticking.  I used cooking spray as suggested in the instructions.  The one criticism I would make is to replace the words ""low"" and ""high"" around the control knob with the words ""fluffy"" and ""crisp.""  A beep sounds and the light around the power knob shines steady when the iron is ready and when your waffles are done.  Waffles cook fairly quickly.  Clean up is easy as nothing sticks.  Overflows flake off cleanly and the drip tray catches the rest.I did discover that the casing around the plates ding easily.  I don't remember anything falling on the waffle maker or banging into it, yet there's a little ding that wasn't there before.  It's just cosmetic and doesn't effect operation, but darn it, it was brand new.  Oh, well.Flip type Belgian waffle makers are just fun.  This one seems to be a higher quality one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1UQHCIMBY0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009347PAC#wasThisHelpful","R2W1UQHCIMBY0V","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really two products, the little 3M projector, and the Roku Streaming Stick.The 3M projector is a fun little gizmo that projects standard definition images, 480P, on any convenient wall or ceiling.  This is as simple a projector as is possible to make.  There's only one input, the HDMI//MHL port; only one knob, the focus wheel; and just a few buttons: power, volume up & down, menu and info.  This simplicity makes it both easier and more difficult to set-up.  There's no elevating front foot or keystone correction.Most video projectors--even very cheap ones--have a screw adjustable front foot so the picture can be projected higher onto the wall.  Doing so results in a picture that, instead of a rectangle, is a trapezoid that's wider on top than bottom.  So, there's usually a keystone correction control that returns the picture to square.  Since this projector doesn't have that, it must be positioned exactly perpendicular to the surface on which it's projecting.  That limits you quite a lot when it comes to placement.The projector is preset to shoot upwards so that the bottom of the image is slightly higher than the surface the projector is sitting on.  That's good.  Also good is the flat surface on the back that allows you to stand the projector on its backside and project onto the ceiling.  Unfortunately, since it's preset to shoot at an upward angle, if you put this little guy on your nightstand pointed at the ceiling, most of the picture will end up smeared on the wall behind your headboard.  Sorry to keep harping on this, but this projector really would be a lot more fun to use if you weren't constantly trying to find a position that works.Video and audio quality are just OK.  Video quality is adequate but not stellar.  The built-in speaker can produce about as much volume as an iPhone.  This little guy isn't meant to be a replacement for your home theater.  It's meant to be fun, and it is.Among internet TV services, Roku is the 800 pound gorilla in the room.  Roku says they've got 600+ channels to offer.  To use Roku service you first have to sign up with a credit card.  Once Roku has your credit card info, address and phone number, they'll allow you to activate the streaming stick.  Some of the channels are free and ad-supported, like Crackle and most of the news channels.  Most of the movie and TV channels are pay-per-view, like Amazon and Vudu.  There's also monthly-fee subscription services, like Hulu+ and Netflix.  Aside from that, there are games and screen savers you can buy.The Roku Streaming Stick is the standard Roku box reduced down to a dongle that plugs into the back of the 3M projector.  But unlike the projector which can work with any HDMI or MHL input,  the Roku Streaming Stick can only work with this projector and two TVs made by Insignia as I write this.  The Roku streaming stick is a brand new product (I'm writing this in Oct. 2012), and may very well work with a lot of products in the days ahead.Once the Streaming Stick is set up and connected with your wi-fi and once the battery is charged, this becomes a very cool gizmo.  You can stream video anywhere within range of your wi-fi without so much as a power cord to worry about.  I'm planning on projecting a scary movie onto the side of the house Halloween night.Battery life is about 1 hour 45 minutes at standard brightness and 2 hours 50 minutes on ""Eco"" mode.  3M's instructions are scant and error ridden, but the projector is easy to figure out.  The remote is a miniature that's a chore to use, but works well and aim doesn't seem to be critical.  That's good when you have a lifetime habit of aiming the remote at the screen.Overall the 3M projector and Roku Streaming Stick are a fun combo and a little frustrating too.  It's ultra portable, but you can't take it on a camping trip (no wi-fi).  The Roku stick can steam high-def 1080p images, but the projector can only display standard definition 480p.  You can project onto any wall, but you've got to find a leveled surface at just the right height for the projector to sit on.  I think the projector by itself would be a good companion to an iPhone or iPad with an adapter cable.  Together with the Roku stick the 3M projector's a neat toy, but just a toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10J7KERGPLZOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X1BV2Y#wasThisHelpful","R10J7KERGPLZOL","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oral-B makes six different brush heads for their electric toothbrushes.  This one, the ""Precision Clean,"" is their most general use head and is the one they include with all their toothbrushes.I like the frustration-free packaging.  Oral-B uses different packaging for toothbrushes and heads they sell on-line as opposed to the ones they sell in stores.  You get a plain brown box sealed with a plain white label that slices open easily.  Inside are four brush heads each in its own tiny 3 "" long blister pack.  The cardboard back of each blister pack is perforated so you can just punch the brush head out.  These tiny packs won't take up much space in your bathroom drawer.I wish Oral-B would provide a cap with these brush heads, but that's my only gripe.  These are genuine Oral-B brush heads in frustration-free packaging at a fair price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZNHLPA9MZW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YD68NI#wasThisHelpful","R2FZNHLPA9MZW5","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a Sonicare user for a while now, and I wanted to see how the Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 stacks up against my Sonicare Healthy White Easy Clean.  Both are basic rechargeable electric toothbrushes with few fancy features, but a emphasis on cleaning ability.The Sonicare is a more aggressive toothbrush, while the Oral-B is gentler.  Sonicare seems to acknowledge that it's toothbrushes are aggressive because it gives them a feature called Easy-Start that ramps up power over the first 14 times you use the brush so you and your gums can get used to the punishment.  No such feature is present or needed for the Oral-B.  Instead of vibrating up and down against the gum line, the Oral-B's brush head oscillates rapidly.  It is supposed to pulse as well, but it must be too subtle for me to see or feel.  The overall feeling is a little rubbery.The other thing I noticed is that the brush head is thicker than the one on the Sonicare, meaning you'll need more room between your teeth and cheek when brushing your side teeth.  The distance between the tip of the bristles to the back side of the brush head is ⅞"" vs ⅝"" for the Sonicare.  It's not a problem for me, but I can see it might be an issue for someone with a smaller mouth.  It may also be the reason Oral-B doesn't give you a cap with your brush heads.I prefer the Sonicare, but I want to point out some advantages of the Oral-B.  First of all, it's cheaper.  As I write this, Amazon is offering the Oral-B for around $50 as compared to $66 for the Sonicare.  The replacement brush heads are cheaper too.  $25 will buy you a thee pack of Sonicare brush heads, but a four pack of Oral-B heads.  And while you seldom see Sonicare heads discounted, my local BJ's has six packs of Oral-B heads for under $30.  That's less than $5 per head.  That's a big savings over the life of the brush.  I've been guilty of not replacing my Sonicare brush heads as often as I should, just because they're so darn expensive.  $5 per head makes me feel better about chucking old brush heads in the trash.Speaking of brush heads, Oral-B offers a wide range of them.  The owner's manual lists eight different heads you can buy.  There are brush heads for people with sensitive teeth, wearers of braces, people with crowns and bridges, people who want to whiten and more.  My local BJ's has floss head brushes for $32 per six pack.The Oral-B comes in an easy-to-open box.  All the packaging is cardboard.  No frustrating plastic clamshell that needs to be cut open with scissors.  I'm all for eco-friendly, frustration-free packaging.  Well done, Braun.By the way, if you take the Sonicare out of your mouth while it's running, it'll fling toothpaste and saliva all over the bathroom.  That's not recommended with the Oral-B either, but it makes a lot less mess.  Sounds kind-of silly, but about the third time you have to clean your bathroom because you were careless when you swapped your toothbrush from one side to the other, it starts to seem less silly.My gut feeling is that the Sonicare cleans better, but I have no evidence to back that up.  Either brush will clean much, much better than a manual brush.  The Oral-B is gentler, cheaper and has more options for people with sensitive teeth or dental work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYE4J5331ET3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PEMBNC#wasThisHelpful","RMYE4J5331ET3","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost There...The Philips In.Sight home monitor offers a neat and inexpensive solution for remote home monitoring in an innovative and noninvasive hardware package.  Or at least it will, once the bugs are worked out.To use this system you'll need an iPhone or iPad, and a Wi-Fi network at the place you want to monitor.The actual hardware is neat.  Small at only 3 ¾"" high with the base, it easily hides among the knick knacks and stays unobtrusive.  The base is neat too.  The monitor and base form a cup and ball socket that are held together with magnets, so the monitor is free to be positioned in any direction.  A wall mount is included, and the magnetic base can be ceiling mounted.  The AC adapter is simply a USB power adapter.  A thin, white unobtrusive 8 foot cord connects it to the monitor.As neat as the hardware is, the software is clunky.  The In.Sight monitor works with iOS devices along with the free In.Sight app, available in the App Store.  I'm using this camera with an iPhone 4S running In.Sight software version 1.9.2.  My monitor firmware version is 35057.  My early experiences with this app and the monitor operation in general were discouraging; the app would fail to find the monitor, or the video would fail to load or the app would quit unexpectedly.  Though the first couple of days were rough, since then operation has been much more reliable.  Maybe I had a bug that worked itself out.  Still, there are tell-tale signs that this was a new product that had a difficult time in development.While you're watching a monitor though your iPhone or iPad, you have buttons available to save a still picture or video.  Still pictures go to the camera roll on your phone, but videos get uploaded to your YouTube account.  This isn't working as I write this.  Philips' FAQs section on their website says there's an issue that Philips and YouTube are working to resolve along with an apology for the inconvenience.  This is the biggest issue I can see, no video recording.You are supposed to be able to view the In.Sight monitor from any web browser, but when you call up the web page, you get a big fat error message.  (Update:  The error message is gone and replaced with a message saying ""Web view available end of July"").There are discrepancies in the instructions that give away the revisions this product must have gone through late in the game.  Nothing that will trip you up too badly, just things like menu items being in a different place than indicated and, yes, the mention of an Android app that doesn't exist (yet).Finally, I have to say that the In.Sight app is cumbersome to use.  It is slow and has to go through a few steps before you can see anything.  Philips made it all automatic (you don't have to enter passwords or anything) but if you're in a hurry, it's frustrating.  If you're viewing a monitor and want to go back to a menu, you have to wait while the app is ""Stopping Streaming.""  A lot of the latency is caused by encrypting the video stream so the teenage hacker down the street can't tap into your bedroom camera, so maybe that's a good trade-off.While the service to use this monitor is free, you are limited to 5 minute viewing sessions.  You can have an unlimited number of sessions, but if you want longer sessions, you must upgrade to premium service and pay a $25 annual fee.  I was worried this would mean the In.Sight app would nag me constantly to upgrade, but it doesn't.I could go on listing all kinds of minor complaints like crappy video quality.  (I know this is a security camera and not a memory maker but, yeesh, I didn't know they still made cameras this bad).The promise of a great product is there.  Audio and video alerts work just fine, are highly adjustable and reliable.  Push notifications work well, but arrive about 20 minutes after the fact.  There's a lot to like here.  Imagine being on vacation knowing if someone broke into your house, there'll be video of it waiting for you on YouTube.  Software revisions will turn the In.Sight from a frustrating device to a super useful one.  And we are talking about Philips here.  Not exactly a fly-by-night company.  I believe they will get this right.  They just should have done it before they released the In.Sight.UPDATE:  Well, I'm still waiting for them to get it right.  The inability to record video has been addressed with a change to Dropbox as the video service used.  Unfortunately, the software updates required to make that change has broken a bunch of other stuff.  I can't watch video from my iPhone anymore.  Calling up a camera just produces a still picture.  This is the case even on very fast wi-fi connections.  Occasionally the frame will refresh at intervals of once every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but mostly you just see a freeze frame.  Audio still streams.  I could go through a laundry list of bugs, but it's easier to say that the only thing In.Sight's software does reliably is crash.  If Philips intends to fix these bugs, they're keeping it a secret.I'm disappointed to say that my belief that Philips would step up and turn the In.Sight into a reliable device may have been wrong.  Not recommended.UPDATE to the UPDATE:  I spoke a day too soon.  Philips just released an update that addresses a lot of the bugs.  The app is still clunky and frustratingly slow.  The picture quality is still awful.  But the system now works like it's supposed to, even if it's still buggy.  I originally gave the In.Sight 3 stars, then reduced it to 1 star.  Now, I'm giving it four stars.Update number 3:  Well it worked for a couple days.  Now it's quit completely.  The app told me today that there was a firmware update for the monitor.  I went though the update process and ended up with the same firmware revision I had before.  Still, the monitor worked for a few minutes, then quit.  I've reset the monitor and gone through the reinstallation process three times, deleted and reinstalled the iOS app once and generally spent way too much time trying to coax this thing into working.  I quit.  into the junk box it goes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8VHTQQ3FQ4GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085KAGJC#wasThisHelpful","R8VHTQQ3FQ4GR","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little pedometer is hard to fool.  It has recorded every step I've taken it along for, as far as I can tell.  I have a limp, but that hasn't thrown it.  The instructions warn that car or bicycle rides may cause inaccuracies, but my 5.7 mile commute in moderate stop and go traffic in my Honda Civic didn't result in a single step counted.  The treadmill at my gym said I walked a mile, and this little pedometer agreed.  Furthermore, it identified those steps as aerobic steps, in contrast to all the other steps I'd taken that day.Tri-axis means not picky.  This little guy comes with a clip, but you don't need it.  It's a lot easier to just chuck it in your pocket and go.  This little guy has a cord attachment point, but I think it would be handier if it had a key ring.  You could just ignore it until you want the information it's been collecting.  This pedometer saves all the information it records for 7 days.  The step count resets at midnight everyday.Once you've set up the Omron with you stride length, height and weight, it keeps track of steps, aerobic steps, distance, calories burned and steps per minute.My middle-aged eyes could use a larger display, but other than that, this is a great little pedometer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTIHALTB29TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZWIJR2#wasThisHelpful","R3CTIHALTB29TK","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a Tripp-Lite line conditioner for years now.  I recently bought this unit to replace it so the old unit can do duty elsewhere.  I installed this unit on my home entertainment center.  Good thing I did.My house has developed a bad neutral.  If you're not familiar with this, it can cause all kinds of weird electrical problems.  In my case, when I turn on the microwave (or another appliance) in the kitchen, the voltage goes up in my living room.  Lights flicker all over the house.  It's a mess.  Luckily, my neutral line is not gone completely, but iffy enough to cause voltages in my house to vary between about 105 and 140 volts.  A repair is scheduled in a few days.  In the meantime, I'm keeping most of my electronics unplugged.  At least I can still watch TV at night because of the Tripp-lite standing guard.It's interesting to watch the Tripp-lite work.  When the voltage goes out of range, a relay inside the unit trips to bring the voltage back to normal.  Indicator lights on the front let you know whether your voltage is low or high.  The relay is loud, but if it's clicking a lot you have a problem that you should look into.My older unit is keeping my office computer safe.  My house mate works from there and would be in trouble if he was suddenly unable to work while my house waits for repairs.  Compared to the older Tripp-lite, a 1200 watt unit, this unit is bigger with a plastic case instead of metal and much lighter.If this unit serves me half as well as my older unit, I'll be well pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YM5ZSZ8F2MK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000514G8#wasThisHelpful","R1YM5ZSZ8F2MK6","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you care about sound quality more than features, you might like this Denon AV receiver.This is a 5.1 surround receiver, meaning it can power a left, right, center, left and right surround and a subwoofer.  I'm never going to have more than that, and I doubt most people will either unless they have a dedicated theatre room in their homes.  That makes 7.1 receivers a waste for most of us.Speaking of waste, like some other manufacturers, Denon has eliminated some features that used to be standard.  There are no ""B"" speakers, no component inputs, no analog audio output and no AM radio.  In short, everything you wern't using anyway is gone now.What you get instead is 4 HDMI inputs plus one on the front, an ethernet port, 5 sets of good quality banana terminals for speakers, and a USB port on the front for your iPad/iPhone or flash drive.  Useful stuff.  I especially like the front mounted HDMI port.  When my friend comes over with his Xbox in tow, I don't have to dig behind the receiver to plug it in.This receiver is new for 2012, and as you'd expect it supports all the current standards.  HDMI supports 3D and audio return channel.  Also new this year for Denon is a revised on-screen menu system.  It's simple and clean and easy to use, but the set-up assistant feature is a bit silly.  You're supposed to plug in the power cord and HDMI cable to your TV so the Denon can walk you through steps such as plugging in the HDMI cable from your Blu-Ray player into the Blu-Ray HDMI input on the back of the Denon.  Big help.  Set-up assistant is more helpful when you're establishing a network connection and using the included microphone to adjust sound settings automatically.Like other network AV receivers in this price range, This model has no wi-fi.  To use network features, including the much-hyped AirPlay feature, you must run an ethernet cable to the receiver.  That's not practical for me, and I bet it's not practical for most people.  TVs and Blu-Ray players have wi-fi now.  Why are receiver makers lagging behind?  You can add wi-fi to these receivers with an Apple AirPort Express and probably other routers too.  It'll cost you cash and cable clutter.Where the Denon doesn't skimp is on sound quality.  Denon promotes its discrete circuitry, simplified signal paths and anti-vibration chassis and they do make a difference.  I can say that the Denon does sound better to me than the run-of-the-mill Sony, Pioneer and Onkyo receivers out there.  I suspect  this Denon sounds similar to Sony ES and Pioneer Elite receivers, but I haven't listened to confirm that.  The Denon always sounds unstrained and well balanced, rich and detailed.So, if you want to spend your money on sound quality and don't care as much about features, take a look at the Denon 1613.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1GM6IWTR8AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R8U5QW#wasThisHelpful","RM1GM6IWTR8AL","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This handsome TV features a thin bezel and modern look, ease of use with attractive menus and very good picture quality.Set UpLike all other flat panel TVs, once you unbox the set, you'll need to assemble and attach the stand.  LG's stand seems a little flimsy.  There's some give when you touch the TV and the manual gives specific instructions on where you should grab the TV when you pivot it on the stand.

I'm really picky about picture quality in some respects, but don't care a bit about some of the things some TV reviewers seem obsessed about.  What you can see with test signals isn't very important.  What matters, in my humble opinion, is what you are seeing when you sit down to watch.

It results in splotchy light leaks around the perimeter of the screen.  The Flaw is visible during dark scenes and in a darkened viewing room.  How bad is it?  It's invisible 99% of the time, but when the movie ends and the credits come up, there's those glowing globs around the edges.  When the hero goes into the haunted house with a flashlight, there's those ghosts all around him.  Turning on the Energy Saver feature, which reduces the backlight when the room is dark, lessens The Flaw somewhat.It's pretty easy to overlook The Flaw since the LG has a great picture otherwise.  Good, well saturated color, plenty of contrast and good brightness.  3D performance is stunning.  If you want to change something, you'll find every adjustment you can think of in the settings menu.  So overall, I rate the LG's picture very good despite The Flaw.This LG is one of the many new TVs that use glossy screens.  Glossy screens give a more vivid and colorful picture than non-glossy screens, but at a cost.  They are much more reflective.  Is a glossy screen for you?  Pretend your TV screen is a mirror.  If you're sitting on your sofa looking at that mirror, would you see a strong light source, like an unshaded lamp or a window?  If so, you'll prefer a TV with a non-glossy screen.This LG's audio performance is mediocre.  There is an EQ built-in the settings menu, but using it to boost the bass makes little difference.  The speakers just can't reproduce it.  While the audio is fine for dialog, I think LG assumes you'll use a sound system if you care about fidelity.3DThe LG uses passive 3D glasses.  They produce a good 3D viewing experience and have an advantage over active shutter glasses in that they are much cheaper to buy, don't use batteries, and are universal among brands.  Next time you see a Real D 3D movie in the theatre, hang on to your glasses.  They work fine with this TV.  You get 6 pair of 3D glasses with this LG.  Your local Best Buy carries additional glasses from LG and Real D including kid sizes and clip-ons and high-priced premium stylish ones.Here's the part of the review where I expected to dismiss the 2D to 3D feature.  The LG, like many new BluRay players, will synthesize 3D from regular 2D content.  Darned if it doesn't work pretty well.  It's not as good as real 3D, of course, and you probably won't use it that much.  (Are you going to start watching CNN in 3D every night?)  But for a few choice programs, it's surprisingly good.There's a button on the remote that toggles 3D on and off with one button press.  All in all, LG has done everything possible to make 3D simple to enjoy with a minimum of fuss.  Push the 3D button, put on the glasses and eat your popcorn.Smart TVThis TV has apps, just like your smart phone.  There is no longer a menu where you adjust picture and sound settings.  There's an app that does that.  There are apps to switch inputs, search for available video you can download, browse the internet, turn 3D on and off, display media from your smart phone or computer, display the user's manual and on and on.  21 apps come preloaded on the LG, and you can download more.  Most of those are gateways to other content, including a lot of children's programming.  Most are free.You can get to the apps you've installed through the My Apps menu, or through the home screen which also has a ""Premium"" menu where you'll find Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.  The ""3D World"" menu has a number of streamable 3D programs.  Most menu screens keep the program you were watching when you entered the home screen boxed in the upper left corner.  You can select it to close the menu and return to your program.LG's operating system seems rock solid, but some of the apps are buggy.  The internet browser, for instance, seems impressive at first with tabbed browsing and flash installed.  But some websites will lock it up, even to the point where it's difficult to make the browser quit.  And while flash is present, using it will bring a warning that you're using an old version and it won't be supported for long.  Another app, AccuWeather, gave me a face full of error messages when I tried to add Fort Lauderdale to my favorite cities.Still, LG has sent out at least one update since my set was built, so there's reason to believe the bugs will get squished eventually.Media Link allows you--theoretically--to view your computer's media files on the LG's screen.  It requires a third party app, Plex, to be installed on your computer.  I have a MacBook, and the Apple version of Plex crashed immediately when I launched it.  No Media Link for me!The RemoteLG has gone its own way with the remote control.  Instead of a wand with a zillion buttons, you get a wand with a few buttons that works like a Wii controller.  You wave it in the air to move a cursor on the screen.  It's clever, but I have gripes.First of all, the buttons are mostly surfaces flush with the face of the remote.  Also, there is no light or glow-in-the-dark lettering on the remote, so when it's dark, you're left to fumble about on a seemingly featureless wand.  I don't know how many times I've moved the cursor over the icon I want, then pressed the button only to have the muting come on.  That's the button directly below the select button.While you're waving the remote around, it stays on.  When you're still for a few seconds, the remote turns off.  So if you're perusing the menus and pause to read something, the cursor will disappear and you'll have to shake the remote to get it back.  When this happens over and over, it gets annoying.  Also, if you take a swig of your drink, then bump the remote when you put down your glass, a big red cursor pops up on the screen to spoil the mood your movie was trying to build.While I struggle with this remote, everyone else in my household like it.  Pointing at icons on a big screen is much better for them than searching for the right button on a crowded remote.  Ordinarily, I put the original remote away and just use my universal remote.  Not this time.  Everyone but me wants the LG remote.  It stays on the coffee table.  But I'm not out of luck.Even though the LG remote is an RF remote, the TV accepts IR signals, so my universal remote will work with it.  Well, up to a point.  I can navigate using arrow keys, but there is no button to call up the ""home"" or ""My Apps"" menu.  The upshot is that I'll be able to do all the non-smart functions with the universal remote, but apps and on-line content will require the LG remote.The Bottom LineThe LG is a smart, easy-to-use TV with a lot of really cool features.  Picture quality is very good and highly adjustable.  Plus it's a handsome piece of hardware with its thin frame and nearly all-glass face.  Yes, I have a few gripes, but there were plenty of cool surprises to offset them.  Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMP47ISSBN84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZH0M4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1XMP47ISSBN84","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this Swingline shredder.The Swingline works like other sheet-fed shredders, but the new idea here is the Stack-and-Shred concept.  Instead of feeding paper to it, you use it like you would a dishwasher or washing machine.  Open the lid by pulling on the release that looks like it should be pushed like a button, stack your papers in the tray and push the lid closed to start the cycle.Just like a dishwasher, you have to understand a little about how the machine works to get the best results.  If you put a glass in your dishwasher open side up, it'll just fill up with dirty water.  Similarly, when you're loading papers in the Swingline, keep in mind the position of the feed rollers.  If you stack a bunch of standard size sheets in the tray and then decide to put in an envelope, place it so the rollers will grab it when its turn comes.  If you put in stapled sheets, when the bottom sheet gets grabbed the staple will drag all the other sheets in with it causing a jam.Just like every other shredder, shreds fall in the bin directly under the cutters, making a pile.  Pull the drawer out and shake back and forth to knock down the pile before a big job.My Stack-and-Shred has worked flawlessly, never jamming (except when I wanted it to, more on that later).  I've fed it folded sheets, wrinkled sheets, torn sheets, small sheets, envelopes, legal sheets folded over and more with no problems.  Only card stock threw it off.  The rollers couldn't grip it.  It's quiet.  It goes to sleep automatically (basically it just turns off its power LED), has a huge 5 gallon bin and is always ready.I did intentionally jam the Swingline.  I loaded an old instruction manual about "" thick in the tray that I knew the Swingline couldn't handle to see what would happen.  Well, jams from the load tray can be pretty ugly.  When you open the lid, than cuts power to the cutters and rollers, so you can't use reverse mode to help you pull jammed paper free.  It took me several minutes of tugging to finally pull the jam free.  Keep in mind that I caused a really huge jam and you would only get a jam like that by trying.Silly stuff:  This shredder comes with one paper bin liner.  If you like it you can go to swingline.com and find that they're priced at $14.95 for 20, but they are not available!  The Stack-and-Shred 80X is supposed to handle staples and paper clips, but once you have the instructions in hand, they tell you to remove them ""to extend the life of the product.""  The ""80"" in the name refers to the number of sheets the tray is supposed to be able to hold.  At 3/8"" to the max fill line, I doubt you could get 80 sheets in there unless you are shredding brand new copy paper.The Swingline Stack & Shred 80X can shred 6 sheets at a time at the throat and has an 8 minute duty cycle with a really long 90 minute wait between those 8 minute cycles.  Also, the shreds are about 7/32"" wide x 1 ¾"" long.This isn't the heaviest duty shredder for the money out there, but who cares?  When the machine is feeding the sheets for you, you don't really care if it does them one at a time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REN81JBPJ32Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067PN42I#wasThisHelpful","R3REN81JBPJ32Y","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kind of expected to be underwhelmed by earbuds built by a computer accessory maker that claim great sound quality.  But there's no denying the sound these things produce.  The sound is rich and detailed and nicely balanced.  The bass is deep but not at all boomy (a huge peeve of mine).  Highs soar and the midrange vocals land right where they should, neither buried in bass and treble or pushed out and nasal.  Sound snobs like me better learn some new brand names.I do have a few quibbles with the way these work with my iPhone.  iPhone earbuds and earbuds designed to work with iPhones use a tiny mic/remote hanging a few inches below your right ear.  It's easy to find without looking and easy to operate by feel.  Logitech separates the mic from the controls which are further down the cord.  You must look to find it and once you have it in hand, you'll find yourself feeling around for the button unlike Apple style controls where the whole thing is a button.  Once you find the button, you'll notice it's squishy and less clicky than brand A making it harder to double and triple click.  Also, the Logitech controls have a volume thumbwheel on it, rather than controling the volume output by the phone.  I'm guessing this was done to make these earbuds universal rather than just Apple compatible.  If the controls aren't the best, at least they work, and they work with a wide range of devices.The five sizes of silicon ear cushions that come with these earbuds is really a nice feature.  I was able to maximize noise isolation, comfort and sound quality by experimenting with different sizes.  It makes quite a difference.  Turns out I'm a XS.The case is just a plastic clam shell with a stressed plastic hinge, but it's silicone lined on the inside and works just fine.  Logitech says their flat cables resist tangles.  I'm not sure they're much better than other good quality wires, but they're certainly better than Apple's awful, tangle-prone wires.If sound quality is important to you, I'm betting that you'll really like these earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIL7OHL8G501H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Y3IDX8#wasThisHelpful","RIL7OHL8G501H","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this wallet. One neat trick is that if you open it and set it down on a hard surface, it'll stand there with your cards fanned out for easy retrieval and replacement.I've had mine for several months now, and it's holding up well. I was concerned that the latch would wear out, but that hasn't happened. It has gotten a few scratches from being in my pocket with my keys.You should be aware that you can't carry as much in it as you can in a fat leather wallet. Money has to be folded into quarters to fit. And if you drop this wallet on a hard surface, the contents will scatter.Still, I like this wallet for it's small size, sleekness and refusal to absorb sweat and odors.Update: Be sure you are getting a genuine Ogon and not a knock-off.Mine is about three years old now. The clasp is still as firm as the first time I used it. I've dropped this wallet, overstuffed it and generally abused it and it has held up well.

"This is an interesting device that will keep you informed of the energy usage by the appliances in your home.  It's an intriguing idea and would be valuable asset if it weren't so darn cumbersome.  This thing is 12"" round making it too big for a permanent installation almost anywhere.So first of all, this device is only for iOS users.  If you qualify, and you have the space for this thing, here's what the UFO Power Center can offer:The best thing the UFO does is report--to two decimal places-- how many watts each device plugged into it is using.  Reporting down to the hundredth of a watt is a bit silly when reported accuracy is +-2%.The UFO can act as a remote switch.  Except that there is no override--or any controls at all--on the device itself.  So if your roommate wants to turn on a lamp he should wait for you to come home with your iPhone to do it?The UFO can eliminate power draws from electronics in stand-by mode.  You can assign one of the four outlets on the UFO to be a ""master"" and one or all of the others to be a ""slave"" to that master socket.  When the component plugged into the ""master"" socket stops drawing power above a certain threshold, the slave sockets are shut off.  That stops the small power drain than some electronics consume all the time.  But keep in mind that some components need that trickle of electricity to keep their settings.  This is less common in newer electronics, but check anyway.  Still, anything with a clock, or a DVR that needs to record even if you're not watching, or anything that loads and maintains a programing guide will be undone by the lack of standby power.Also, keep in mind the UFO itself draws 1.9 watts.  If you're using it to stop a 1.5 watt drain, you're behind by .4 watts.Also, keep in mind that the UFO is not a surge protector.  The instructions make a point of telling you not to plug it in to a power strip, so if you go by the rules, you'll be giving up surge and noise suppression.Finally, you can schedule each of the four outlets to go on or off on a daily basis, or set-up a one-time switch.  Again, not overridable by a person not holding the iPhone with the Energy UFO app in it.The software is slick and it is interesting to see how much juice any given appliance uses.  And looking at the website you can see how proud the company is of the UFO's Italian design.  But honestly, where would you install this thing?","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TD2QTHGYWPTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057HX17K#wasThisHelpful","R1TD2QTHGYWPTB","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Speck Candy Shell Satin case for the iPhone 4/4S is an improvement on the regular Candy Shell cases, in my humble opinion.  The ""Satin"" part of this case's name refers to the finish on the hard parts of the case.  It feels slightly rubberized and softer than the other Candy Shell cases.  It's not rubbery enough to cling to your pocket fabric, but completely changes the feel of the case.The big thing for me, though, is that this case looks a lot more sophisticated and expensive than the non-satin candy shell cases.  I have the black/gray case, and it seems to say, ""I'm the grown-up here.""  That's probably not true of the garish purple/blue or the red/white cases, but it is true for the black/gray one.  If you agree, well that's too bad because I already have the black/gray Satin case and I don't want your iPhone to look identical to mine!The Candy Shell Satin has all the qualities and flaws of the other Candy Shell cases.  They fit snugly, protect well but don't add a lot of bulk and they don't get in the way when you're trying to plug in headphones or a dock connector.  The one thing to look out for is the very thin edge of the case between the home button and dock connector.  It can break, so avoid stress on that area.  Also the non-satin Candy Shells were very prone to scratching.  The Satin seems less prone, but I'll have to use the case a little longer before I know for certain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36CIKAWP4TT8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005T0DU44#wasThisHelpful","R36CIKAWP4TT8D","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is my favorite.  This is the revised version that has a larger opening for the camera so that the flash doesn't bounce off the edge of the case and spoil the picture.This is a one piece case, the silicone and hard shell are molded together.  To protect your iPhone, Just press it into the case.  It fits snugly and feels secure and solid.  The silence switch is a little harder to reach.  (For me that's a good thing.)  And all the other switches feel pretty much the same.  Not nearly as rubbery as you'd think.  The front glass is protected by a raised rubber ridge all the way around.  The connector opening is nice and large.  There is no silly cut out to display the Apple logo on the back of the phone.  I think that's a plus, but that's just my opinion.This case strikes a balance that I like between protection and usability.  There are more impenetrable cases out there that have the silicon layer on the outside, gripping your pocket fabric every time you reach for your phone, and rubber plugs you must hold out of the way whenever you plug in the dock connector or headphones.  This case makes me feel like it probably won't be a disaster if I fumble and drop my iPhone on the sidewalk, and that's what I was looking for.One quibble.  The case itself scratches fairly easily.  You'll need to carry it in another pocket than the one your keys are in.Update:  The case broke.  The very thin part of the case above the connector opening is also where you tend to grab the case when picking the phone from your pocket.  The shell layer snapped on one end of that very thin cross member, but the silicone is holding it in place.  I still like this case, but be aware this is a vulnerable spot, and don't put pressure on it.Update to the update:  I bought another Speck iPhone 4S case.  This case came with instructions for removing the phone, asking users to pry the top out first so the rest of the phone can ""angle out easily.""  I guess I'm not the only one to break that very thin piece at the bottom!  I would add that you should avoid grabbing that very thin part of the case when plucking the phone from your pocket.BTW, the new Speck Satin cases are extremely attractive in my opinion.  The black case with grey silicone is very handsome indeed!  Much more sophisticated looking than the candy shell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WIHMZWWHJI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005T0DV2K#wasThisHelpful","R14WIHMZWWHJI7","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ooh baby!  This is the one I want!  This chair is absolute comfort.  This chair looks a bit pricey on paper, but I'm absolutely thrilled with the comfort and support it brings.This chair came packed poorly in one big box.  the base, center strut and hardware bag was in the bottom of the box covered by a sheet of cardboard and then the main chair assembly.  There was also a sheet of foam just laying there not cushioning anything.  Nevertheless, my chair arrived in perfect condition.  The only instructions included are assembly instructions.  Kinda strange because putting it together is the easy part.  Press the casters into the base, put the strut into the base and then all of that into the bottom of the chair.  That's it.  You might need help if you can't lift somewhat heavy things.There are no instructions for operating the chair.  Looking at all the controls, I felt like grandpa trying to operate a Japanese toilet for the first time.  Here's a rundown of the adjustments available.  On each side of the chair there is a knob with a paddle just behind it.  On the right side, the knob adjusts the recline tension and the paddle adjusts the chair height.  On the left, the knob locks the recline in whatever position it's in when you locked it while pulling the paddle allows the seat bottom to slide forward and back.  underneath each armrest, just forward of the support, is a button that allows you to adjust the armrest up and down.  under the base of the armrest support is a flip down lock that allows the armrest to move in or out.  The seat back adjusts up and down by simply lifting it up.  It ratchets up as you lift.  When you pull it all the way up it releases so you can lower it again.  There may be other adjustments I'll discover later, but for now, I think that's it.

"I really like this oven.I live in Florida where it doesn't make a lot of sense to fire up your main oven for every job.  Being able to throw a frozen pizza in this little guy makes for a more comfortable home.I like the size.  It's big enough for just about any job you want to give it, but takes no more counter space than it has to.  And I like the speed.  Since this is a convection oven, it's a lot faster than a regular oven.  So if your pizza says to bake for 22 minutes, you better start checking it at 15.  Things can and will burn, and the mess can be ugly.Toaster ovens aren't vented as much as full-sized ovens are, so if you burn something you'll get an ugly smoked door and window.  I've had a little luck getting some of the smoke damage off with Magic Eraser, but it's tough.  So it's really best to remember that this is a fast convection oven and take care not to burn anything.  One other thing; the top of the oven gets very warm.  If you leave a loaf of bread on top of the oven while it's in use, you'll be cleaning up melted bread wrapper.Like all toaster ovens, this one is hard to clean.  Once the crumb tray or roasting pan are soiled, they're stained for life.  Hey!  Oven makers!  How 'bout putting a non-stick coating on those pieces!This little oven bakes surprisingly evenly.  If you look for uneven cooking hard enough you'll find it.  For instance, the pizza cheese under the heating element will be a little more brown.  But it's slight enough not to be a problem in my opinion.  I've used this oven for frozen pizza, frozen french fries, meatloaf, broiling french soup, bagels and, oh yes, toast.The one quibble I have with this oven is that the knobs are a bit stiff and fairly smooth which makes them a little hard to use if your hands are wet.  The timer knob has a ""stay on""  setting left of the ""off"" position.  This has fooled a friend of mine who cranked the timer all the way to the left trying to turn the oven off.  Good thing there's a pilot light right under the timer knob to show absolutely whether the oven is on or off.  My confused friend simply pulled the plug rather than burn the house down.Good friend.

"As a Mac user, I was anxious to give the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk a spin.  My good friend recently tried one with his iMac to hold his iTunes library and had problems.  I recently tested the Seagate Expansion external drive and found it to be reliable and glitch-free, and thought the GoFlex drive would be a slightly more deluxe version of that problem-free drive.Unfortunately, that's not what I found.I installed the provided software, choosing to use the drive as a Mac and Windows compatible drive.  Doing this installs Paragon NTFS for Mac.  Paragon is a driver for the Mac that allows it to read and write files on a drive formatted with a NTFS partition for Windows computers.  I rebooted and found my rock-solid, reliable MacBook replaced with a clunky crash box.  After struggling past two crashes and reboots, I was handed my very first ever kernel panic!  The culprit was the Paragon driver.  I got up and running long enough to run the uninstall software for Paragon, and my MacBook returned to it's usual self.  Whew!Though my computer crashes were over, the drive crashes were not.  The Seagate GoFlex will run from nine minutes to 2 hours then simply freeze.  I though it might be going to sleep, but the drive continues to spin and the lights stay lit.  It simply stops responding.  It will not even eject.  The application using the drive at the time will freeze, and any application you may try to launch that polls the drive--Disk Utility or Activity Monitor--will freeze and be unable to launch.  The only way out is to unplug the drive without ejecting, and then plugging it back in for another few minutes of use until it locks up again.  This is identical to the problem my friend had with his GoFlex on an iMac running Snow Leopard.  I am running Lion on a MacBook Pro.I have reformatted the drive, reinstalled Seagate's software and uninstalled Seagate's software all with the same results.  I have checked that I have the latest software from Seagate, and I have checked that this Seagate is in fact supposed to be compatible with my computer and OS.  Seagate says yes.  I've looked for help on Seagate's trouble shooting pages where the bulk of the advice is to check the cables.  And I've looked to Seagate's forums where I found others that have similar problems, but no one that had an answer.This seems to be a problem for Mac users only.  I plugged this drive into a friend's netbook running Windows 7 Starter and the Seagate happily served up video for hours on end with no hiccups.  My advice?  If you have a Mac, or think you may ever have occasion to transfer to or from a Mac, stay away.Yikes!","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14M3D0PRPRNY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IA84AA#wasThisHelpful","R14M3D0PRPRNY7","A2P07C09N1Z2GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P07C09N1Z2GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm one of those guys who saves all his change and cashes in occasionally for an unplanned payday.  I broke my glass jug that I used for the purpose and went looking for a replacement.  If you save a lot of coins, glass isn't really the best choice because of the danger that heavy coins will break the glass.  Ceramic shards are much less dangerous.I was charmed by this little pig, from his cute little face to his curly little tail.  The glazing is plenty good enough with consistent color and no bubbles.  The non-skid feet do a good job of keeping him firmly planted.  My only worry is the plug which fits a little loosely making me wonder if it will hold when the pig is full of coins.Based on my experience, I'm gonna guess this little guy will hold about $250.  (That's IF you don't ferret out the quarters!)

"I'm a real admirer of Donna Leon's writing.  I love her characters -- they are so expertly developed that they seem to acquire a third dimension -- almost rising out of the pages.  I could pick Guido, Vianello, and the Vice-Questore out of any crowd -- no problem!  I also admire Leon's writing style.  It's clean prose but very evocative. Her plots often involve timely subjects, treated with respect and intelligence.  Falling in Love is, like its predecessors, an excellent novel in many regards. However, in my view, it's not as thoroughly superb as many of her previous works.  For example, it has an uncharacteristically slow start. The pace does gather speed eventually.  The seed of discomfort is slowly sowed,  gradually grows into a threat,  and finally bursts forth into terror and murder. I have concluded the slow start was a deliberate device to show how adulation can become obsession; how obsession can become madness..  While the process may be gradual, fear can grow exponentially. Yet, after having so deliberately constructed the mood, after building an action-packed sequence that ratchets tension to a fever-pitch, Leon suddenly stops writing.  I was so disappointed at the abrupt ending, particularly since so many questions remain unanswered.  We know ""who"", but not really ""why.""  We certainly don't learn what happens next, or how the victim emerges from her ordeal To me, it's an unsatisfying and annoying way to end a psychological thriller.  In my opinion, it's an unworthy way to treat readers who have invested  time, money, and good faith in an author's work -- not to mention the emotional energy that we invest in the characters.  For this reason, I think this is only 3 1/2 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R56K9017Y3SF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123538#wasThisHelpful","R56K9017Y3SF9","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, this is a gorgeous gown!  It's difficult to describe the exact color, but I'll do my best -- it's an unusual shade for formal wear.  I don't expect to ""see myself"" in multiple iterations at the big event I am planning to attend. The gown is just that ""different."" The lining is a medium steel gray and the net overlay is an ashy-gray/brown (with more emphasis on the brown) -- the result is a mutable shade of taupe in some lights, and a slightly bronzy-gray in others -- but the over-all result is simply lovely.  The beaded embellishments are perfect for it -- more concentrated on the bodice and around the neckline, but gradually tapering off down the skirt.  The godets in the skirt move gracefully and the fit is spot-on for size.  It's a very flattering design and the color is, I think, an attractive choice for many women. The skirt is long, however -- I am 5'7"" and even with heels on, I needed to have the skirt professionally shortened by over two inches.  That added an extra $60 to the cost of the gown. A final point: I was concerned about finding shoes that would go well with this gown -- silver wasn't right, and black looked too harsh -- but I found a perfect match in Adrienne Vittadini's Surya Dress pump in a pewter-gray (also on Amazon).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTTMFBFSDRBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWCO76G#wasThisHelpful","R2CTTMFBFSDRBV","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After using this cleaner for several months, I am reducing my original review to an edited 2 stars.  Here's why:  Yes, the DC59, marketed as the ""Animal"" cordless vac does an outstanding job of extracting animal hair from carpeting and upholstery.  I should know. I have 4 big dogs.  Mind you, they are not long-haired dogs, but they do shed, of course.  Still, the problem is not with the power of this little device, but its ""finicky-ness.""  Despite being made for the purpose of removing pet hair, my machine often gets clogged up and refuses to work. What an annoyance that has become!  Let me clarify that I use my Dyson Animal Ball vacuum cleaner for my regular heavy duty vacuuming (it's a wonderful, dependable workhorse) and the cordless vac for small touch-up jobs; eg, entry hall rugs, etc. But picture this scenario, if you will: you've just started working on an area rug with a cleaned-out canister, but seconds into the job, the machine starts making a very loud, whirring noise, closely followed by a halting ""stop-and-start"" action of the roller and the motor..  While you're wondering what in the world is going on, you notice the blue light on the side of the canister is flashing, and very soon the motor stops completely. A 4x6 area rug is only half cleaned.  This is happening to me all too often for my liking. It happened again today and the last time I pulled the cordless vac out to use.  And yes, I clean it thoroughly each time after use.  Amendment -- I clean it during use as well, for the canister fills up very quickly.  But this issue of blockages can occur anywhere in the device. When the situation described above occurs, the device must be disassembled and the hunt begun for the source of the blockage. I have even had to take apart the roller from the floor apparatus. I have never had to do this with any other of my vacuums (even the cheap one of my student days).  Why am I doing so with a Dyson now? Why am I doing it almost every time I try to clean with it?  This is not acceptable for any product. And this is certainly NOT why I paid a substantial amount of money for a top-tier product.  Indeed, the big reason I plunked down the money for this vacuum is because of my previous positive experiences with other Dyson products -- all of which have performed beautifully -- and because I wanted the quick convenience a cordless vacuum promised -- and not another time-consuming challenge in my life.Regarding the battery: Some reviewers think the charge doesn't last long enough, but I find that the charge (about 20 minutes or so) is sufficient for me to do my main level, high-traffic area rugs and still have some ""juice"" left. Mind you, you don't have to go over and over the same area in order to get it clean with a Dyson, so you are done more quickly than with most other vacuums (assuming, of course, that you haven't had to stop work to de-clog it).A final thought: Even though my machines are all deemed ""Animal"" -- it's hard to empty the pet fur from the canisters and around the filters.  Some kind of thin, soft brush is needed to clean it properly.  I see from my Instruction Manual that such a brush was to have been included, but alas, it was not in my case.  A bit of improvisation should do the trick, however.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YW1ZIN3AKBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXFI6RA#wasThisHelpful","R11YW1ZIN3AKBI","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a vacation rental property -- let me assure you I have purchased multiple sets of cookware.  Previously, I had been lucky to get through a 4 month rental season without having to replace the pots and pans.  They receive heavy use and, often, a good bit of abuse . . . which brings me to the T-fal cookware.  This set has held up exceptionally well and it's well into the second year of use.  It is dishwasher safe (a huge plus), and reasonable use of metal utensils won't damage the finish (unless someone decides to carve meat while on the pan, of course). I have a gas stove in this house and I have found damage to previous cookware resulting from renters using too high a flame, but so far, the T-fal has held up very well. In my experience, no non-stick cookware is a lifetime investment.  Replacements will be necessary at some point, but even with hard use, I have been very happy with the T-fal Hard Anodized cookware.  I think it's the best performing non-stick on the market (and I have tried a good many -- and some that cost quite a bit more.)

"In my opinion, this is a scarf for cooler - not cold -- weather. I purchased it thinking it was a lighter, more summery scarf than it is.  Though the fabric is not heavy, it's important to note that the scarf is about twice the width of other warm-weather infinity scarves and that makes it bulkier to wear (and thus warmer) than I wanted for this time of year.  Also, despite realizing that monitors can distort colors, the site photo suggested to me that the colors were more vibrantly-hued than they really are.  It is an attractive pattern, but the colors are too muted for my taste -- some might even subjectively call them ""dull."" Even the black of the background is not as intense as the photo suggests on my screen. I love bright colors against a dark ground but this isn't really ""It."" Again, the scarf seems to me to be better suited for the Autumn color pallette, as well as for cooler temps.  Though I'm rather disappointed in the scarf, I still like it enough to keep it and wear it later in the year.  3 1/2 stars would be accurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSH1XJU55WCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIGI0ZE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSH1XJU55WCE","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this is probably a 3 1/2 star novel for me.  I stress the ""for me,"" because this sort of thing is such a subjective assessment.  Andrea Frazer's main detective and his partner are rather an odd couple -- a device that has become rather tired. DI Falconer is an often grumpy, fastidious, middle-aged bachelor who still deals with nightmares of his childhood under the thumb of the very formidable Nanny Vogel. His Detective Sgt. is a sloppy, happy-go-lucky family man.  I much prefer the DS. The author injects a dose of humor whenever possible, which is something that is often lacking in mystery novels.  While I don't object to that at all, I feel that sometimes the humorous situations seem awfully contrived and occasionally ill-timed. Mind you, the laughs are a counterpoint to a series of murders associated with a secretive religious sect. As I say, the light-hearted moments don't always work. Within the spectrum of British mystery novels, I'd place this novel pretty much in the middle of the road.  It's not grisly, macabre, or wallowing in gritty realism.  There is no profanity and any sex alluded to is not explicitly described. It's sort of a Midsommer Murders kind of offering, set in a vanilla-flavored British village.  The plot has a few surprises, though the prime suspect crumbles pretty quickly at the end.  Still, it's an enjoyable enough read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DICIML4U3TQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7J9292#wasThisHelpful","R2DICIML4U3TQV","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read all of Clara Benson's novels and, generally, I like them.  They do vary in quality, I think.  Mind you, each was written for the author's own enjoyment and were only published after her death.  She seems to have been playing with different literary devices, scenarios, characterizations, etc. -- all of which is more than fair enough -- and some novels have succeeded better than others.  The Trouble at Wakeley Court is my least favorite because it's so predictable and two-dimensional.  The general time period for her novels is 1920s-early 30s. I'm not sure when this one was first written but it has a naive (and rather disparaging) notion of eastern European culture and political affairs.  The plot revolves around a teen-aged girl, the daughter of a Grand Duke, who is the heir apparent to a fictitious eastern European country, Morania This tiny nation is embroiled in constant border strife and political intrigue with an equally fictiitious neighboring nation, Krovodar.  When the Grand Duke learns of a Krovodarian plot to assasinate him, he sends his beloved daughter to boarding school in England, under an assumed name, for her own protection. Unsurprisingly, the Krovodarians have their spy network up and running and follow the young girl to England.  Enter Mrs. Marchmont, who has been tasked by the British government to ""keep an eye on things"" at the boarding school.  It's implausible from start to finish, and a number of the characters are absolute caricatures. However, as with all of Benson's works, there is a great deal of period charm and a couple of successful characterizations (most notably, Angela Marchmont's god-daughter, Barbara, who featured in another novel -- she seems completely real and quite refreshing. For ""cozy"" entertainment, it is still an enjoyable enough read, but the pace is sluggish, and the whole premise is pretty implausible.  I would recommend Benson's other novels before tackling this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJKBQOFL5PC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGOPCZM#wasThisHelpful","R2SJKBQOFL5PC1","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very happy with these earrings.  They are a rather uncommon shade for a gemstone, leaning more towards orange than the red that they are described as being. I'd call them a terracotta with brown undertones.  I emphasize the color because: 1) they aren't what I first associate with the color red (for me, that's an apple red) and 2) they aren't a fake-looking bright orange, either.  If you are paying for real gemstones, you want them to look natural.  And these do.  As to size -- the site says to expect a minimum total weight of about 1 carat. But mind you, the density of gemstones differs, so the carat measurement is not always a useful estimator of size.  I'm not a jeweller and I can't accurately address the weight of the stones I received, but as to their size, they were a bit smaller than I had expected. (Despite my caveat above, I had used my diamond engagement ring as a way to ""guesstimate"" the size of the individual studs --- the 5 mm length that the site describes is just too hard for me to visualize.) I had expected stones about the diameter of a standard No. 2 pencil eraser.  Mine are a bit smaller than that, but I must emphasize that they are still big enough to make a visual impact. I wear mine as a second set of studs, higher up on my ear, so these are perfect for my purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OVACMKR06JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ9AL1O#wasThisHelpful","R26OVACMKR06JZ","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is expensive but I feel that it's worth it, especially when I think of what I've spent on other products only to abandon them when they failed to deliver.  Deep wrinkles are not a problem for me and neither are dark circles, so my review addresses only the puffy incipient bags that have been ""growing"" under my middle-aged eyes.  Many of the previous eye creams that I've used did a fine job of moisturizing the eye area but they were too rich and heavy and, thus, seemed to make the puffiness worse.  I did find a product to moisturize the area that I liked -- it's a Vitamin C eye gel and very light weight.  But still, the puffiness -- while certainly no worse -- was not much better, either. And so, in desperation, I tried this product, based on its many positive reviews. I'm no chemist, but I reasoned that the caffeine in the tea would be helpful in reducing the swelling.  After trying this product for two weeks, I can see an improvement in my under-eye area.  I doubt that there is any cream that will act as a ""magic wand"" to erase the puffiness, but this one has certainly made enough of an improvement that I am very pleased, indeed.Update; I have been using this product for over 6 months now -- and I still believe it to be the best eye cream I've ever tried.

"I am a big fan of C. J. Sansom's Shardlake historical mysteries.  This is yet another triumph.  The author has chosen a fascinating era (Reformation England in the reign of Henry VIII) and he treats the history with respect.  This isn't a simplistic approach to the Protestant/Roman Catholic religious struggle but a nuanced treatment of the complexities of the times and how those issues affected the lives of ordinary people. Lawyer Matthew Shardlake, now a prestigious Sargeant at Law at Lincoln's Inn, has been asked by a powerful personage at Court to find a missing religious manuscript which, if it fell into the ""wrong"" hands, could mean the death of another Queen for treason and an ensuing shift in the balance of political power at Court. Reluctantly, Shardlake agrees to help, thus becoming ensnared by a mare's nest of intrigue, spies, and murder.  Against this backdrop, Shardlake must revisit his own thoughts on faith, friendship, and honor. It's a long book -- no quick read -- but it is rich, detailed, complex, and fascinating.  As with Sansom's earlier works, I was reluctant to see this novel end.  That's the highest praise I can offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTS2P1HHX2NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVK30W4#wasThisHelpful","R3GTS2P1HHX2NB","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never thought of myself as a Birkenstock person.  I am definitely in the pretty-spangly-jewelled-sandals-for-summer-camp, but sometimes, needs must.  I have recently had leg surgery that has meant, during the recovery time , that comfort and support in my shoes is an imperative.

"LIke Margaret Frazer's other Dame Frevisse mysteries, The Boy's Tale is excellent.  It is well-researched historical fiction at its best. The author creates a vibrant world for the reader within the confines of a medieval Benedictine convent.  The characters are beautifully wrought, complex, believable, relatable; the plot is well- constructed and keeps the reader guessing and the setting is evocative and unusual.  The irony is that within the walls of the convent, deliberately created to keep out the world, an entire other world thrives with many of the same rivalries, conflicts, and jealousies that exist outside the convent's walls. Despite the nuns' best intentions, however, the outside world still intrudes -- in this novel, it intrudes suddenly and violently.  How Dame Frevisse handles these unbidden secular realities, manages to investigate several murders, and maintain her spiritual grounding is rather marvelous.  It's a compelling mystery and I highly recommended it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E80EP003X4BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NNVWI4#wasThisHelpful","R2E80EP003X4BV","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scent does not disappoint --- I have vivid memories of my high school years in central Florida where orange groves were still prevalent.  In the spring, the heady scent of orange blossoms on the breeze was magical.  So often, distilled fragrances leave something to be desired -- but not this one.  It conjures perfectly the sweet, light scent of orange blossoms.  It is not heavy or cloying.  As with other citrus oils, the scent doesn't linger as long as some other scents do, but no matter -- this is memories in a bottle.  Love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6DIJITY7FG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K3WQMG#wasThisHelpful","R3O6DIJITY7FG3","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried so many eye creams and serums and until now haven't been thoroughly happy with any one of them. I don't have problems with dark circles or deep wrinkles around the eyes, but as I've gotten ""less young,"" I've developed puffier eyes, especially in the morning. A number of the eye creams that I've used did a good job in moisturizing the eye area and discouraging wrinkles, but some have been so heavy and greasy that I feel they've made the puffiness much worse.  I stopped using them for several weeks and, sure enough . . . Still, I don't want to leave this delicate eye area unprotected.  Oz Naturals Eye Gel goes on lightly; it's not greasy; the puffiness has not worsened but has improved overall.  I use it twice a day and it does not pose a problem with eye makeup.  (Some of my previous creams caused mascara to smudge under the eyes.)  In general, this product is so good that I've recommended it to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RWYW3MPBZP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYF65TK#wasThisHelpful","R27RWYW3MPBZP6","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I collect cookbooks -- lots and lots of cookbooks.  My favorite genre is the modest, spiral-bound collections by local churches and community organizations. They provide not only some wonderful ""real"" recipes, but reveal such a friendly window into the local traditions and communities themselves.Thus, I was excited to get my hands on this Community Cookbook by Southern Living which is meant to cull some of the best recipes and features from those little local gems. Scattered throughout this book are a number of side-bar ""chats"" concerning interesting related topics and hints, and a good array of ""real"" Southern recipes from real Southern cooks. Five stars for that. An effort was made to recreate the neighborly quality of the originals. The graphics and page lay-outs are cute and unpretentious, but in my opinion there's too much emphasis on the graphic design and not nearly enough on the readability of the text itself. Someone was really wedded to the  ""optics"" of the book -- and it succeeds in offering an artistic vintage ""feel"". But a cookbook is of little practical use if one cannot easily read the recipes. That seems a fairly obvious concept, but in this case, I believe it was often overlooked in favor of artsy typescript and spidery fonts.  A multiplicity of different font types is used throughout the book (some which are meant to look like script, suggesting a hand-written recipe -- cute, but not clear).  Also,the pages are printed in different pastel colors -- very pretty -- but some of these background  colors make the type even harder to discern.  In strong natural light, there isn't a big problem with the type, but in a real dinner-time scenario with the book sitting on the counter and artificial light and shadows from cabinets factored in, it's frustratingly hard to read. I have good eyesight and do not need to wear prescription glasses, but I cannot easily refer to some of these recipes without moving the book to a direct light source or grabbing the pair of magnifier glasses I keep around for detailed work.  And that is not appreciated by a busy cook -- at least, not by this one.  In fact, this is so annoying a problem to me that what should be a favorite ""go-to"" resource has been significantly reduced in its usefulness to me. 1 star, then, for the poor print.  As to the recipes themselves, they do represent a nice variety of the old and new.  There are a few really stellar recipes included, such as Gumbo Z' Herbes and Crook's Corner Shrimp and Grits, (both chef-submitted recipes,) and believe me, they are absolutely awesome! There are also a number of predictable and somewhat-tired standards present, like Pimento Cheese,  banana pudding, and congealed salads -- recipes that one will find in any and every self-respecting southern cookbook. On the other hand, there are also some newer variations on traditional themes, like Hoppin' John Salad and Slow Cooker Pork and Pinto Chalupas. Further, there is a sprinkling of recipes that reflect the vibrant, changing demographics and cultural sharing of the New South; for example, Tempura Dill Pickles and  West Indies Salad. 4 stars for the array of recipes. Like all of Southern Living's productions, the photography is first-rate --absolutely luscious -- another 5 stars for that. I'd have preferred more photos (or even more recipes -- there is a treasure-trove of good cooking in those little spiral cookbooks upon which to draw material) -- and far less of the cuteness. Overall, then,  I'm settling on 3 1/2 stars. There are some really good aspects to this book but the readabiity issue is a major drawback for me.  I hope any future editions will rectify that problem.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RS9KGPV3D21Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848743547#wasThisHelpful","R1RS9KGPV3D21Q","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, this is elegant and evocative! It's an old favorite, rediscovered.  It's a curious thing: I saw a review by someone who thought it was ""an old lady's"" fragrance.  I'm not quite sure what scent that reviewer might be thinking of -- but it is clearly a negative connotation.  Nothing is farther from my mind when I wear this perfume! It's so exotic and mysterious -- and sensual! It's quite unlike any other perfume that I am aware of.  There is a ""powdery"" aspect to it, but it's certainly not of the canned talcum variety! I think of green, mossy scents, mixed with spices and aromatic woods.  I first wore this scent as a young woman and I received so many compliments on it.  I'm not an ""old woman"" yet, but I started wearing more floral scents for a number of years.  I ""rediscovered"" Mitsouko and wondered what was I thinking to stop making this my signature fragrance.

"I'm not a big bath oil fan, generally.  I hate the residue that oil leaves in the tub, so a product has to be pretty special for me to want the extra clean up effort after a hot bath.  This is worth it, I think.  The fragrance is clean, herbal, pleasant.  I've heard it called ""medicinal"" -- I wouldn't argue with that assessment, though I personally don't perceive it that way. Scent is such a powerfully emotive thing -- we all  react differently -- but EOV strikes me as having more of a spa-like connotation. ""Clean"" is the adjective that keeps coming to mind, as well as ""relaxing."" If you don't want the hassel of slippery tubs -- you can still use this product right after a shower. Just lightly apply the oil to still-damp skin. Why not 5 stars instead of 4? That's my personal bias against bath oil.

"The general consensus of the whole family is that Season 2 is even better than was the excellent Season 1.  If you enjoyed the first season, you 'll be enthralled with the second.  The actors are terrific, but seem even more comfortable with their characters.  There's a seamlessness about them --  you don't see the actor, but each character is vibrantly alive.  This is particularly true for Travis Fimmel, who manages to convey so much with just a swift, fleeting expression in his eyes. The drama is tightly woven, combining history, legend, human insight, powerful action, suspense, betrayal, and deep, personal conflict -- all with a backdrop of the most glorious scenery imaginable.  It is a powerful, excellent series.  It must be said, however, for those who are sensitive to violent portrayals -- this has graphic violence in abundance. You must use your own best judgment on this issue, but know that  what is portrayed is not done in a gratuitous manner. It is not meant merely to shock; but rather, it is appropriate to the subject matter. But it may not be appropriate for you or your family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSQUP4AK6DON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9AHY2K#wasThisHelpful","R2WSQUP4AK6DON","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've reviewed a number of Ann Cleeves' novels, and I have liked them all very much, indeed.  The George Palmer-Jones series, of which Murder in Paradise is the second offering, is quite different from her more famous Vera Stanhope series.  One of the things I admire most about Cleeves' work is her incisive observations and detailed, plausible characterizations.  This novel certainly has those qualities in abundance.  Next, there's her ability to create environments so real, they are almost tangible.  The sparsely populated outer islands of Britain come alive in her works (I also recommend her Shetland Island series).  Cleeves and her husband are avid ornithologists and she has visited and, in fact, worked on some of these islands before her writing career took off.  Her experiences are transformed into very evocative settings for many of her novels.  I heartily recommend any and all of her books (I haven't yet read one that I didn't enjoy).  Focusing on Murder in Paradise, I would say the reader is in for a treat.  The standard mystery gambit of the secluded setting, such as a country house cut off from its neighbors during a terrible storm, is transposed by the author into a small, outer island -- home to a great many birds,  a lot of sheep, and a very few crofters.  A young English nurse marries a man from Kiness island.  Entranced by a magazine's featured article about Kiness being a veritable ""paradise,"" Sarah agrees to move with him back to the island and take up the life of a crofter's wife.  The reality is not nearly as romantic as Sarah imagined, though she gamely makes an effort to succeed in her marriage and in her new environs.  Soon after her arrival, the first death occurs on the island, then a second one soon follows.  Police from the mainland are ill-equipped to deal with the investigations and prefer to write them off as either an accident (in the first case) or as the result of alcohol-fueled island in-fighting. But George Palmer-Jones, retired Home Office official who liaised with the police forces, is also on the island. Palmer-Jones is an ardent ""twitcher,"" or ornithologist.  He is quite convinced the deaths are linked and is asked by one of the local families to find the truth.  He asks Sarah, as the only other reasonably neutral observer on the island, to help him out.  Already a bit bored, she agrees. Not surprisingly, their probing questions ruffle a lot of feathers. Will Sarah ruin her own future by aiding Palmer-Jones? There is a good bit of atmosphere, psychological insight, an impressive creation of the crofter's world, and some quiet, but potent, suspense.  Action is a relative term here.  There isn't much in the way of overt action, but it's there on a more cerebral plane.  With very limited resources, Palmer-Jones gets to the truth of the matter.  This is an intelligent novel, with a more lanquid pace than some, but it keeps the reader's attention focused and compels the pages to turn. It's a very good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366XENORM1FKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKHI9DE#wasThisHelpful","R366XENORM1FKF","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, let's deal with the negative. Yes, monitors vary and it's hard to determine color from the ""sample"" swatch that the manufacturer provides, but here's the thing: the lipstick I bought is called ""Cognac"" -- not ""Island Orange"" or ""Vivid Tangerine,"" or such like.  So I thought I was getting a deeper shade, with some brownish tones.  When I opened the tube, I was so pleased to see the color I thought I was buying.  However, when I applied it on my bare lips, it went on as a much brighter orange than the tawny/coppery color in the tube. The difference is so extreme on me that I don't think I""ll be able to use this product at all. That is a disappointing two star problem -- at best. I am reminded of that curiosity from the drug store of my teen years -- the ""magic lipstick"" that would change color to suit your ""perfect"" shade. This Borghese one, at considerably more cost, doesn't do me any favors by turning orange, either. Still, the way the lipstick glides on,, and the way it feels when on the lips, is rich and luxurious -- five stars for that.  The basic product is a good one. However, I would suggest trying out these colors at a department store, if possible, before purchasing, to make sure you will be happy with the way the color looks on your lips.  And finally, I really wish companies (clothing and cosmetic companies, especially,) would make an effort to name their colors appropriately. What color, pray tell, does ""Malibu"" indicate? And ""Cognac"" isn't a tropical orange.  How tough can this be? Combined score would be a 3 1/2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UBL8DUL4SF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027JIVOO#wasThisHelpful","R21UBL8DUL4SF2","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even easier:  add some prepared bruschetta, and crumbled feta (not traditional, I know, but oh, so delicious).  The results always garner glowing compliments.

"Clara Benson wrote during the Golden Age of British Mystery.  Her novels are charming as period pieces and as cozies -- but they typically don't offer much in terms of depth, sophistication, action, or even much suspense.  The Riddle At Gipsy's Mile is par for the course.  The characters are the most interesting thing about this novel, but even they are rather two-dimensional.  The plot revolves around our amateur detective, Mrs. Marchmont, an intelligent lady of rather secretive background, who stumbles upon yet another dead body. (She seems to find quite a number of them in the series).  The problem with this one is that the face has been destroyed (this is an unusually gruesome detail for a Benson mystery) and identification is difficult.  Mrs. Marchmont and the irrepressible Freddie Pilkington-Soames come to the rescue by conducting their own investigations.  Strangely, Scotland Yard doesn't seem to mind. . .

"Perfumes are such subjective things to rate that it seems almost unfair to try.  What smells heavenly in the bottle may not ""wear well"" on one's skin; and we all have our own preferences.  Having said this, I do like Grand Amour a lot -- it's a romantic, but not overly heavy floral scent.  I am a big fan of Annick Goutal's fragrances in general, but for me, Le Matin d'Orage and Gardenia Passion are my personal favorites.  Despite the sweetness of honeysuckle and lily, Grand Amour has a crisp edge to it, that's just a bit tart -- rather like the first bite of a green apple.  That's not an unpleasant thing, but it is a bit of a surprise.  This sharpness soon mellows on my skin, leaving a classic, heady, floral perfume.  Very nice, indeed.  If floral scents are your cup of tea, then I think you'll be pleased with it.

It's a subjective point, but I feel uncomfortable with so many gathers in the sleeves -- (they didn't seem as exaggerated in the photo) --  thus, making me feel like I'm wearing football pads.  I also don't care for the texture of the fabric.  It drapes well, but it's thin and not woven as tightly as it should be. It can be too revealing in certain lighting  (a slip is definitely needed); ultimately, the fabric just doesn't feel very good to me.  The neckline is not secure and attaches only at the top of the waist band.  On my figure, it tends to gape open, so I've had to secure it with a snap closure.

As a result, I personally feel like this is a 3 star purchase for me.  I was searching for a new, warm weather scent -- something light and either softly floral or citrus-y.  I had heard great things about this fragrance, but I couldn't find an available tester in the department store to try out this scent. (Sadly, it seems that testers are disappearing in many stores, making it so hard to gauge how a fragrance might wear on each individual).  Instead, I had to rely on the product description which starts out by naming light, fresh essences, like pear, ruby red grapefruit, geranium, etc., with medium notes of rose and peony.  Hence, I thought this was what I was searching for. It isn't.  Instead, it is a complex, heavy scent -- not unpleasant, but rather overwhelming on me.  The product page suggests it is suitable for day wear.  I'm not convinced of that, unless one uses a very light hand in its application. It strikes me as far more appropriate for a romantic evening out.  It is a statement fragrance.  I'm compromising with 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQRGNMJHR2WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UIXHOG#wasThisHelpful","R3DQRGNMJHR2WH","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a number of the Sister Frevisse medieval mysteries and have enjoyed them very much, including The Prioress' Tale.  Historical fiction is a passion of mine -- a ""busman's holiday"" sort of thing.  As a historian, I am particularly appreciative of the amount of research Margaret Frazer does for each of her books and the dividend to the reader is a lush, three-dimensional world that this gifted author creates as a result of her attention to detail.  Each of Frazer's plot lines revolve around a particular individual -- a sort of representative member of a medieval community: an abbot, a prioress, a midwife, a huntsman, etc.  It's sort of a modern mystery nod to  The Canterbury Tales, and illuminates the lifestyle and experiences of these people.  Further, the ""detective"" in each of these novels is Dame Frevisse, a very curious and intelligent nun from a small Benedictine priory. Dame Frevisse is an engaging character, a spiritual woman who is not unaware of the temporal world and must often navigate between the two realms.The tensions and moral quandaries she experiences in these endeavors is fascinating.  In The Prioress' Tale, Frevisse has a fraught relationship with her prioress, Domina Alys, who is a demanding, harsh, and often manipulative woman -- a woman with a ruthless personal ambition to build the priory into a richer and more ""important"" spiritual house (or, perhaps, simply as a monument to herself?)To this end, Domina Alys favors her kinsmen in a power struggle with another prominent landed family over disputed lands.  The presence of these armed relatives in St. Frideswell puts a terrible strain on the small community of nuns and on the meagre food stores they have accumulated.  Intrigue, violence, and murder ensue and it's up to Dame Frevisse to find those responsible and help steer her beloved convent back to it's true and peaceful purpose.  Like every other of her novels, the author peoples it with fully-developed and credible characters.  If you enjoy intelligent historical novels that are well-researched and boast polished writing -- The Prioress' Tale is an excellent choice, but truly, any of Margaret Frazer's novels will do the trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PELQ27MZLQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VT3W3O#wasThisHelpful","R35PELQ27MZLQD","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bag is perfectly acceptable for the price -- but it's not ""knock-your-socks-off"" great.  I tend to spend substantially more on the bags I use often, but my purpose in buying this one is much more limited.  I wanted it to go with a color-blocked dress that boasts a stripe of hot pink at the hem.  As this is pretty much a one-off  occasion, I didn't want to spend a fortune on a matching bag.  This one fits the bill quite well. I have no problems with it.  It is a man-made bag, not genuine leather, but it is a good facsimile. Again, I chose the hot pink color, which is vibrant but not garish.

"This lip stain is a rich, gorgeous shade.  Though it is a neutral, deep brownish color, there's a reddish tint to it that, when on the lips, makes them pop with intense, fashionable color.  It is a thinner liquid than I expected, however, so while it feels quite light to wear, the down-side of that thinness is that it's a little bit harder to control its application.  This is made worse by the applicator tip, itself.  It is flat on one side, pointed at the end, and it bends too easily for my liking. I find it a little less user-friendly than I would have expected from YSL.  Nevertheless, this is not a deal-breaker -- just keep a lip brush handy and you'll be good to go. I give 5 stars for the color and the staying power of this lip stain, 3 for the application; hence, 4 stars over-all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX7FJT1OGG07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QV3OG4#wasThisHelpful","R2PX7FJT1OGG07","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read all of Anne Perry's Victorian novels and am a big fan of her work, in general.  Her earlier works are vibrant, absolutely alive with period detail and color.  They boast a swift tempo with action and suspense harmonized with romance and emotional insight. Her main characters are complex people who develop over time into seasoned and mature persons, credible and likable. The author's typically winning formula hasn't quite come together in this latest novel, in my opinion.  Indeed, her last several novels seem to be more languid and formulaic.  I wonder if Perry is simply getting bored with these characters and this time period?  Death on Blackheath seems tired and often turgid to me. There is a lot of repetitive inner musings by Pitt and not much in the way of real action or suspense.  As his investigation gets bogged down, so does the novel.  Pitt, the recently promoted head of Special Branch has been called in to investigate the sudden disappearance of a housemaid in the home of a naval weapons expert. As the naval race between Britain and Germany was gearing up at the end of the 19th century, it was feared that the maid's disappearance threatened dire implications for national security. That should have provided a tense and urgent scenario for the reader, but somehow, this book never really got off the ground for me.  There were so many thwarted avenues of investigation, not a lot of action, and Pitt's wife Charlotte, a spirited and clever woman who has played important roles in his earlier investigations, has a very limited role in this one. I think a number of Perry fans will find this novel not up to her usual standard, but as every Perry fan also knows, a ho-hum Perry novel is still better than a good many others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15FHTOD477A8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIMYZF6#wasThisHelpful","R15FHTOD477A8V","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the basin of this birdbath is attractive,  my objection is to its over-all ""design."" The glass basin is affixed with glue to a disc of metal (about the size of a silver dollar) that screws into the narrow stand.  Well, within 5 minutes of putting it together, the basin came apart from the disc and fell onto the patio.  Amazingly it didn't shatter, but it is unusable as designed. You can put NO pressure whatsoever on the basin. Period.  I put my birdbath into loosened potting mix in an over-sized patio pot -- so you know I didn't have to put much effort into inserting the birdbath into the soil. In fact, I used the stand and my foot on its base to insert it.  The only ""pressure"" on the basin that I used was to straighten it -- apparently, that was sufficient to snap the glue seal and it soon tumbled to the patio.  I'm less than impressed with the flimsiness of this design.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVB0ST4ICB0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NDQL70#wasThisHelpful","R3DVB0ST4ICB0V","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heads-up, folks! If you are tempted to buy the bundled group of coffee maker, water filter and permanent gold coffee filter featured on this page, please note that the cone filter (049-33) does NOT fit the Krups KM9008!  I discovered this the hard way -- I simply assumed that the featured filter was offered because it fit this machine and thought I'd be saving myself some shopping time by ordering it along with the machine. This machine requires a basket type filter and not a cone filter.  (I found that a standard Mr. Coffee gold basket filter for 8-12 cup coffee makers fits this model.)  As to the machine itself -- I am delighted with it -- it's very easy to operate and solves the problem of different ""coffee times"" within my family.  No more sludgy coffee sitting in the warming carafe. I noted that one reviewer complained of the temperature of the coffee produced, but I have found it to be piping hot even after it's been in the machine for close to two hours.

"I agree with the reviewer who said the title alone was a bit off-putting.  I had visions of ""Brenda Starr, Reporter"" with a modern, Swedish twist --but I was wrong.  This is a solid, well-crafted mystery with intriguing scenarios and some fine acting.  Malin Crepin does a very good job at making Annika Bengtzon come alive as a multi-dimensional real woman. The character development and fresh plots won me over as well. Without giving anything away, the first episode was a fascinating insight into the Nobel laureate selection process -- and what can be at stake. I haven't seen anything quite like this setting before.  So, there is a freshness about the series which surprised me.  I recommend it, especially to viewers who have enjoyed other quality Scandanavian mysteries like Irene Huss, Varg Veum, or Maria Wern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYFNKCNQH3YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDUF4D2#wasThisHelpful","R3GYFNKCNQH3YI","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of Lotus Moon's Vita A complex and on the basis of that, I tried the Pumpkin Enzyme Peel.  In no particular order, here are the pros and cons. First of all, there's the scent -- for me, I found it to be overwhelming.  I smelled like a Thanksgiving pie. Yes, that's a great scent when wafting from the oven, but it isn't what I want slathered on my face for any prolonged period of time.  Secondly, there isn't much product for the price.  I was surprised at how little was in the jar. They are quite clear that it's 1.5 ounces, but that's a bit hard to visualize.  It's a paltry amount, in my opinion, for a product that is meant to be used rather thickly all over the face and neck. Third, the results were pleasant -- my skin felt really good and smooth, but I've had similar results with other masks and scrubs -- for less money. There was nothing especially remarkable about the results I experienced from this product. The biggest plus, though, is that it's a natural product, made with integrity and without the addition of a lot of weird chemicals.  You can feel confident about that. While I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, on the basis of the final ""pro"" -- I have to go with 4 stars -- and a caveat about the heavy fragrance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83VENIAIQAQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBYV63S#wasThisHelpful","R83VENIAIQAQA","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great dog coat.  It has a water-resistant and wind-resistant outer shell and a warm fleece lining.  What I appreciate even more is that it is designed to accommodate a wide range of breeds.  Small, medium, and large size offerings don't necessarily tell you much if you are trying to fit a broad-chested dog. Neither do suggested measurements from collar to tail. I have a boxer/bull dog mix and he is really hard to fit.  If I find something that fits around his chest, the coat then hangs off him in the back and on the sides.  That would make for a terrible mess on his walks.)  The design of this coat, however, allows for extra girth around the chest by providing a wide (and longer than most) velcro band to customize the fit. I can then choose a size that better fits his over-all body size, too. Finally, the piece de resistance: he's now the best dressed dog on the UNC campus.

"After a fair bit of research, I purchased this oximeter for a family member who suffers from clinical sleep disorders.  He has already completed a medical sleep study but was encouraged to keep monitoring his oxygen levels at home.  It has proven to be a really useful (and reassuring) piece of equipment. It features an alarm that sounds if oxygen levels drop below a certain level. Further, t registers and records important data which can easily be transferred to a laptop for long-term storage and analysis. With a click of a keystroke, all that information can be emailed to one's doctor.  That's been such a great help. The 4 stars, then, are not for the overall efficacy of the device -- it works perfectly when properly worn.  The problem is that the finger sensor can become dislodged if one is a more energetic sleeper.  I understand this is a general problem with many of these devices and our choice of this model took that into consideration. The wristband and the shorter cord that connects the sensor to the monitor seemed to make for a sturdier connection and a better bet for less disruption of data than other models offered.  Still, it sometimes comes loose during the night, anyway. The other finger clip monitors (especially the plastic ones without silicone cushioning) can be quite uncomfortable and they certainly can come loose or get knocked off during sleep.  Finally, with regard to relative costs: this is a more expensive model than a number of home-use oximeters on the market.  Depending on your purpose for purchasing this kind of device (e.g., sports performance analysis), you may not need to spend so much on an oximeter. For our purposes, though (the accurate data collection, ease of storing and conveying results, and comfort level of wearing the product throughout the night, etc.,) this was a very good choice.

It can stand alone or be grouped with other chains for a more opulent look.  I would give it a full 5 stars for looks alone, however, I must mention that the chain is very fragile.  Within less than a day of ownership, as I was wearing the necklace, a link either broke completely or came dislodged from its neighbor and the necklace slid off -- 2 stars for that. The links are so tiny and delicate that it was impossible for me to try to reconnect them.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement necklace (a sparkling 5 stars for customer service!).

Instead, I have those occasional nights when everyday problems, worries, and stresses seem to gang up on me and I toss and turn.  Of course, I wouldn't recommend this product to treat clinical sleep issues, but for ""one of those nights"" that we all have now and again, I found it to be genuinely helpful.  It doesn't make you sleep. I haven't noticed that I feel suddenly terribly drowsy -- but the next morning, I realize that I did, indeed, fall asleep pretty quickly the night before and stayed asleep.

"Over the years, I've thoroughly enjoyed Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley mystery novels. I've admired her writing and looked with anticipation to her next offering in the series. Therefore, it's hard for me to believe that I could be as disappointed in one of her books as I am with this one. The pace of the action gets bogged down with many highly-detailed descriptive passages; further, established characters are suddenly behaving out of character.  This is especially true for the singular Barbara Havers. Her behavior now seems so implausible, out of control, and outlandishly unprofessional that it beggars belief. (And, speaking of improbabilities -- the aristocratic Lynley has developed a fascination for women's roller derby, no less!!! How very bizarre!) There are new characters who figure prominently in this novel but it's hard to care much about them. I suspect this has something to do with an over-abundance of descriptive detail. For the first time ever with an Elizabeth George novel, I got bored and had to put the book aside. Frankly, it was hard to get motivated to pick it up again.  A good portion of the novel takes place in Italy, one of my favorite places. That should have proved delightful reading (shades of Donna Leon and Christobel Kent) -- but it did not. In addition to the seemingly endless descriptions of Lucca (which seem better suited for a travel guide than a mystery novel), George inserts many Italian words and phrases into her writing. Yes, Italian is a beautiful and lyrical language and I appreciate that the author might have wanted to give her Italian chapters an authentic flavor; still, I'm afraid she only managed to break up the flow of her prose. For those of us who don't speak fluent Italian, it gets annoying. It is not always clear from the context what all the words mean. Does one stop reading to go online for a translation? Or say, ""The heck with it!"" and plow ahead anyway? In any event, it seems to be a pretentious affectation by the author.  If you have not yet read any of  Elizabeth George's works, please don't start with this book.  Her previous novels are so good, so well-written and richly nuanced that I find it hard to believe this is the same writer at work.  Sadly, two stars are the best I can muster for this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHNLUBB4HTF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5R7H8O#wasThisHelpful","RLHNLUBB4HTF5","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd award this product 2 1/2 stars, if that were an option.  It's definitely not ""okay"" in my book but it's better than 2 stars.  I have been using ceramic butter crocks for years and finally had to retire my old one only when I dropped the bottom reservoir and it broke.  I thought the marble would be a good sturdy choice while keeping the water and butter even cooler than pottery would do.  It's also an attractive piece.  It became quickly apparent that I'd made a mistake.  Until I broke my old butter crock, it never leaked or left a ring on my counter or table.  This marble one does.  I can find no hairline crack in the marble -- it appears to be all of one piece -- yet it still leaves a significantly wet ring  where ever I place it.  I'm guessing it ""sweats"" and that's what is responsible for the moisture.  I now leave it on a small saucer (not really a great look, but it solves the problem).  It's the day after Christmas and I can't be bothered to stand in any more lines to return this item at the post office -- but I will be retiring it soon and returning to the good old ceramic crock.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVATWCFAATWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VZ0WC#wasThisHelpful","R2QVATWCFAATWX","A29PLTX74EI6NN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29PLTX74EI6NN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DC has never quite had the same success with team comics that Marvel has.  Marvel has the Fantastic Four, Avengers and X-Men, all of which have been running more-or-less continuously for five decades (except for an early '70s hiatus for X-Men).  DC has the Justice League - which has had its gaps - and to a lesser extent, the Teen Titans and Justice Society, but none have really had the runs that Marvel's team comics have had.  Among DC's lesser (in terms of ongoing success) comics are the Outsiders, Challengers of the Unknown, Metal Men and - the topic of this review - The Doom Patrol.The Doom Patrol consisted of three superheroes:  Robotman (human brain in a robot body), Negative Man (who could project an energy being from his body) and Elasti-Girl who could grow or shrink as needed (mostly growing).  Leading them was the Chief, a super-genius in a wheelchair, and occasionally assisting them were Mento (a telekinetic who was also Elasti-Girl's boyfriend/spouse) and Beast Boy (a green teenage who could take the form of various animals).Volume 2 of the ""Showcase Presents"" series has issues 102 to 121, the last of the original series.  In these issues, the Doom Patrol takes on various strange villains but their archenemies are the Brotherhood of Evil who seem to appear in around half the issues.  There are also backup stories providing backgrounds for Robot Man, Negative Man and Beast Boy.As anyone familiar with comics history knows, a pivotal change in the industry occurred with the 1961 appearance of the Fantastic Four.  This and the other Stan Lee/Jack Kirby and company creations at Marvel brought a new level of storytelling and characterization that DC would take a long time to catch up to.  These Doom Patrol stories appeared in the late 1960s and show DCs gradual adaptation to the new comics world.  There are some character development and multi-issue story arcs which show some growth in DC's writing from the simple kiddie fare of earlier days.  On the other hand, the writing is still rather simplistic and the characters not all that interesting.In short, this is not the DC has to offer.  It's not awful, and credit should be given to DC for at least starting to evolve, but in general, this Showcase edition (which I'd rate a low three stars) is perfectly okay to skip.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZVFIVPSBS6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401227708#wasThisHelpful","R2GZVFIVPSBS6S","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Certain novels have great first sentences.  Aric Davis's Rough Men is not one of them. In fact, I liked it so little, I wondered if I was in for a bad book.  Fortunately, things picked up.  (For the record, the first sentence was ""Alex pushed the magazine into the Glock, pulled back the slide to verify the still-chambered round of .45 ACP ammunition, and then hit the magazine release again.""  It's a sentence that does promise action in the near future, but is awkwardly written and has too much gun details, which distracts from the meat of the sentence.)The novel begins with Alex Daniels - essentially a young hoodlum - participating in a bank robbery which turns into a slaughter of the bank's employees and patrons.  Alex himself is killed by one of his cohorts after witnessing something he shouldn't have seen.Will Daniels, Alex's father, has overcome his own troubled past to become a semi-successful writer.  When he hears of his son's death, he has to confront his own subpar parenting and the fact that Alex was a bad seed.  Both for revenge and to atone for his own sins, Will decides to seek Alex's killers and attend to them himself.  To do this, he needs to ally himself with an ex-crime partner who he left previously on bad terms.This is a taut little thriller (less than 200 pages) that shows that Davis can tell a good story even if his writing is a bit off at times.  Plot trumps prose here, and the result is a reasonably entertaining book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KQAMO1UIWCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161218653X#wasThisHelpful","R4KQAMO1UIWCY","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although generally a serious field, science - or more properly, sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) - has often had a tongue-in-cheek side.  For example, calling quarks ""quarks"" and giving it qualities like charm and strange shows a bit of whimsy on the part of the scientists who proposed the names.  Phil Edwards takes the humor potential of science to the limit with his book, Fake Science 101.Designed as a mock textbook, Fake Science 101 offers looks at astronomy, biology, chemistry, Earth Science and physics along with insights into the life of a scientist.  As with the best humor, there's usually a bit of truth mixed in with all the jokes, but you'd be hard pressed to get any sort of real science education from this book; of course, that really isn't the point.The point is to make you laugh, and while Edwards doesn't hit 100% of the time, he's successful more often than not with his jokes.  That's all that's required to make this a five-star book.  If you have a fondness for science, you will likely find this to be a very funny book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ABA9EKHB3B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440527016#wasThisHelpful","R39ABA9EKHB3B9","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A decade or so back, Stephen Cannell - a successful TV writer and producer - started writing a series of novels.  Now, Dick Wolf - the force behind the Law & Order TV shows, among others - is following the same path with his debut novel, The Intercept.  How does he do?  Okay, but not much better.The story follows Jeremy Fisk, an NYPD detective who deals particularly with intelligence work for counterterror purposes.  As the story begins, he bucks the higher-ups to pursue a terrorist in a minor prologue to a much bigger story.  Mostly taking place after the death of Osama bin Laden, Fisk finds himself coping with a bigger, more mysterious threat.The new terror plot begins with the attempted hijacking of an airplane.  The hijacker is quickly stopped by passengers who will soon become major media heroes.  Fisk, however, suspects more, and starts pursuing another passenger on the plane, a Saudi art dealer who seems to have disappeared.  Was the original hijacker merely a decoy?  Fisk believes so.As would be expected from a veteran TV writer and producer, Wolf knows how to tell a story, but there's little to recommend this book above plenty of others in the genre.  The characters, led my Fisk, are relatively uninteresting and rely a bit on stereotyping(all the cops are good guys, even if some are a bit bureaucratic; virtually every Islamic character is a terrorist or terrorist-sympathetic) the plot is generally familiar, and when there are twists, they are often borderline implausible (much of the terror plot depends on a whole bunch of factors occurring perfectly).If you don't read many thrillers, this may be a decently entertaining book.  For veterans of the genre like myself, however, The Intercept is strictly a been-there-done-that book that may not be substantially flawed (and merits a low three stars), but offers little that's not done better elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAEKFFPV1VME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062064835#wasThisHelpful","RJAEKFFPV1VME","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a mathematician by trade, education or inclination - or if you just enjoy science - then the periodic table is a thing of beauty.  It puts the universe in order in a wonderful fashion, giving it a logical basis that didn't exist prior to the table's creation.  It even successfully predicted elements that hadn't been discovered.  Theodore Grey's The Elements celebrates both the periodic table and the individual elements that make it up.After a few introductory pages that explain how the periodic table is constructed, the book dedicates two to four pages on each element, providing a few paragraphs about the significance of the element along with some nice pictures of the element either in pure form or in a compound or in some object.  Of course, with later elements (the very short-lived elements), there is very little to show or discuss.For each element, Gray provides some vital statistics (like atomic weight or density) along with graphical representations of the electron distribution, atomic emission spectrum and temperature ranges where the element is solid, liquid or gas.  Fanning out the pages will show that these ranges fluctuate based on atomic number and are not merely random.If you are into science, this is a nice book, but it may not have all the details you'd want.  It is more of an introduction to the foundation of chemistry, something to teach newcomers with nice illustrations and often humorous text.  Despite all the versions of periodic tables he shows in the book, the one thing I found Gray omitted was a complete table showing all the elements by symbol.  Nonetheless, this is a fun and informative book that is good for all ages to learn more the stuff of which we are made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQAD0Y81KDJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579128955#wasThisHelpful","RSQAD0Y81KDJI","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a minor classic of film noir called They Live by Night, a couple-on-the-run story with Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell.  Outside of a general association by genre, this movie has nothing to do with Dennis Lehane's similarly titled Live By Night, his semi-sequel to The Given Day.The earlier book followed Danny Coughlin, a well-meaning cop in post-WWI Boston.  This book follows Danny's younger and wilder brother, Joe, who, as the story opens in the 1920s, is a minor league thief whose heist of an underground card game will have far reaching repercussions:  not only will it entangle him with mob boss Albert White, but it will also romantically link him with White's mistress, Emma Gould.A series of mishaps will get Joe thrown in jail and Emma apparently dead (I say apparently because no body was ever found, and in a crime story, that rarely equates to death).  It isn't all bad; Joe will get involved with White's chief rival and eventually will take over the Florida crime operations of the rival, primarily rum-running during the Prohibition Era.The bulk of the story deals with Joe's rise to power in Florida, an area which is a change-of-pace for the Boston-centric Lehane, but one that the writer handles well.  In fact, in terms of the things you normally look for in a crime story - character, plot, etc. - Lehane does well, which isn't surprising because he is one of the great mystery writers of today.  You don't really need to read The Given Day first, but if you're new to Lehane, you will probably want to read it after getting a lot of entertainment from this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JBD1LPAPKT0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060004878#wasThisHelpful","R1JBD1LPAPKT0Y","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you took all the active comic strips that have been around for decades, virtually all of them are pale shadows of their former selves.  Garfield, Blondie, Family Circus: they all may be institutions, but they are not that great.  There is only one exception to this rule, and that is Doonesbury.  Why this is the case is amply demonstrated in Brian Walker's Doonesbury and the Art of G.B. Trudeau.Walker (the son of Mort Walker, creator of two other institutional strips, Beetle Bailey and Hi & Lois) has written several books on comic strips and is something of an authority on their history.  In this book, he takes us through the history of Doonesbury which started its syndicated run in 1970 (prior to that, it was only published at Yale).  At first, the art was crude, but the characters offered deeper satire than typically found on the comics page.Yes, strips like Pogo and Lil Abner may have had political satire, but Trudeau used real political figures, not thinly veiled parallels.  As biting as the humor could be, he still centered his strip around the characters:  at first, the key foursome of B.D. (the conservative football player), Mark Slackmeyer (the campus radical), Zonker Harris (the easy-going hippie) and the title character, Michael Doonesbury (the eternal loser).  Eventually, many more characters would join the cast and the key characters would evolve and develop depth (except, of course, for Zonker, whose chief quality was that he was incapable of real change).And that's the key difference between Doonesbury and B.C., the Wizard of Id or Heathcliff:  Doonesbury changed over the years.  The characters changed, the art changed and there were even bits of seriousness mixed in with the humor.  Characters married, had kids (who also married), died and were seriously injured, as when B.D. lost his leg in Iraq.  Ground would be broken by the then controversial introductions of gay characters, extramarital sex and other topics.All this is chronicled in this book, which features a history of the strip, plenty of comics and a whole heap of other supplemental art work.  If you're a fan of Doonesbury, this is a must read.  If you aren't yet, this book demonstrates what you're missing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ABNRGFSZL8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300154275#wasThisHelpful","R13ABNRGFSZL8C","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you read Proust or Faulkner or perhaps an in depth history about turnip farming, it might be expected to take a while to finish the book.  On the other hand, a mystery novel should be a generally fast read; Peter James's Not Dead Yet, however, turned out to be a much slower read for me than it should have been.This is the eighth book in a series about Brighton, England's Detective Superintendent Roy Grace, all of which, like Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse books, all feature the word ""Dead"" in the title.  I have not read any of the other books, so it's possible that some of the points I raise below were covered in earlier books.The book begins with the discovery of the torso of an unidentified corpse found at a chicken farm.  While Grace and his team investigate this crime, a second task comes to light:  the singer Gaia (who bears more than a passing resemblance to pop stars like Madonna and Lady Gaga) is coming to town with her entourage to film a movie.  This brings out various bad guys, including a man desperate to get his girlfriend Gaia's role in the movie (and figures killing her would clear the spot); an obsessed fan who can switch from love to hate very quickly; and a screenwriter who feels that the movie's script was stolen from him and is intent on revenge.These two separate plots will tie together in certain ways, but there's also a bunch of subplots that contribute little to the main story.  Grace has to deal with a vengeful ex-con as well as his very pregnant fiancee; his friend and subordinate finds himself between a bitter soon-to-be-ex-wife and a love triangle in which he is the invisible third wheel.  Then there is the subplot about Grace's wife, Sandy, who disappeared a decade ago and who he's trying to declare dead so he can remarry; of course, any mystery fan knows that if a person disappears but no body is found, she is not necessarily dead.  There are some basically unsatisfactory answers provided about Sandy, but the subplot generally goes nowhere (I have a feeling that this storyline is designed to extend over several books).So there's a little too much going on, but more than that, certain flaws stand out.  Too many of the characters, particularly the potential bad guys, are a bit too one-dimensional and come off more pathetic than evil.  One of the potential killers disappears from the story without ever impacting anything.  And most gratingly, the final plot twist relies on one of the most tired cliches in suspense fiction (which also involves lying to the reader).Despite the sometimes muddled writing and weak characterization, the story did pick up in the second half of the book, and I probably would have given it three stars, but the final plot twist - which is almost unforgivable in a writer of James's experience - makes it drop a star.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRXX47POA95U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312642849#wasThisHelpful","R1YRXX47POA95U","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the adventure strip dies off of the comic page, it is nice to look back at a time when the genre was at its peak, with Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon among the tops.  Following in the footsteps of Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon would wind up being the superior strip, with fantastic tales that have rarely been equalled on the comics page.Volume 6 of the collection starts out mundanely enough.  Flash, his girlfriend Dale Arden and friend Dr. Hans Zarkov are on Earth (having returned in the previous volume).  Written in 1942 and 1943, this gives Flash a chance to fight for America in a WWII parallel against an evil dictatorship that is unnamed but clearly a Nazi Germany substitute.  Of course, Flash, his friends and the virtues of democracy have the ability to overcome the dictatorship's navy.A lack of radium (necessary for fueling the ray guns that Flash had brought from Mongo) gives Flash, Hans and Dale an excuse to return to that alien world.  A crash landing will put them far from friendly faces and into an insurrection by the evil Prince Brazon against the vain but beautiful and kindly Desira.  This conflict will take up the remainder of the volume.If there is one shortcoming in this book, it's that there is no Ming the Merciless, for whom Brazor is not that great of a substitute.  Still, this is another fun collection of strips again showing that the comics page of yesteryear offered more than its contemporary equivalent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30YIBVHSJKLFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933160284#wasThisHelpful","R30YIBVHSJKLFA","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a young elementary school student, perhaps the most illicit material of all was Wacky Packs.  Rumors prevailed among the first grade set that owning or displaying the stickers were grounds for expulsion and/or arrest.  Of course, that just made them even more intriguing, although the myth would eventually fade, replaced by the fatal consequences of eating Pop Rocks (especially with soda).In a way, the somewhat subversive nature of the Wacky Package stickers probably added more to their appeal than the stickers themselves.  Relying on puns, some rather weak, each sticker parodied a particular product.  Even before picking up this book and revisiting them, I could still remember some of them:  Crust Toothpaste, Head and Boulders Shampoo and Drowny Softener.Revisiting the stickers is also a glimpse into the commercial world of 40 years ago.  Many of the products spoofed remain familiar today: Quacker Oats, Rice-a-Phoni and Shot Wheels are easy enough to figure out, but it escapes me what Fooey Mold Rush gum, White Fowl cigarettes or Sweat Hard soap were take-offs on.Perhaps as interesting as the stickers is the fact that Art Spiegelman, one of the most noted comic artists of today (and a Pulitzer winner for Maus), was one of the people behind the Wacky Packages.  I think that this book will not rate very high for those who didn't grow up with the stickers, but for those who did, the nostalgia value is worth the full five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOPVV1IQH5XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081099531X#wasThisHelpful","R3EOPVV1IQH5XT","A2F3M93RRLFQNJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are alignment ridges on the bottoms and tops, to allow each case to nest securely on top of one another. On the latch end, I use HVAC metal foil tape, as a label below the latch, upon which I write one to three words to describe the contents (with a black Sharpie marker). That way, with one glance, I can spot and pull what I need off the shelf, without opening each one to locate what I need.

"WOW. Is all that I can say about this movie. I saw it on ABC in 1979, when I was blown away by how Kurt Russell nailed this part, 2 years after Elvis died. It was Dick Clark Productions who decided to chronicle Elvis's life, shortly after his death, and enlisted John Carpenter to direct it. This television movie, which garnered 3 Emmy nominations, including best Lead Actor for Kurt, along with an all star supporting cast, has stuck indelibly in my mind since the night I saw it, and I was absolutely thrilled to see it finally released on DVD, from the original master recording. At the time of release, the movie was the highest rated television movie ever aired.  Kurt was only 27 years old when he performed this role. And it was a role which he hoped would lift him above his typical Disney movie roles. As he hoped, it ended up proving that he was capable of much more mature portrayals, than the light-hearted and squeaky clean characters in all of the Disney films, for which he was known. Ironically, Kurt's first appearance in film, as a child, happened in Elvis's movie, ""It Happened At The World's Fair"", where he was instructed to kick Presley in the shin. And following his brilliant portrayal of Elvis, John Carpenter decided to cast him again 2 years later in Kurt's second attempt to establish himself as a serious adult actor, in the action/sci-fi movie, ""Escape From New York"", and then again 2 years later in the dark comedy ""Used Cars"". So, Elvis was the spring board which thrust Kurt into the actor that we all know and love.The story line in this movie ends in 1969, before Elvis's personal and professional decline, followed by his triumphant rebound and eventual death.Other actors in the film included Elvis's actual confidant, Charlie Hodge, who appeared as himself in the film. And Kurt's real dad, Bing Russell, played the part of Elvis's supportive father, Vernon Presley. The role of Priscilla Presley was played by Season Hubley, whom Kurt actually married in 1979, a month after the airing of the movie in February of 79 (and having a son together, prior to their divorce several years later).The entire time I was watching, I could not believe my eyes or ears. Elvis was a alive and well, in Kurt's body :-)  Kurt has Elvis's voice and inflections down pat. Close your eyes and you would swear Elvis himself is speaking and singing. This movie was extremely well acted, sung and produced. You will be mesmerized from start to finish and I found myself wishing it would go on and on (in awe of Kurt's portrayal), even though I am not a rabid Elvis fan. I absolutely loved Elvis in his much more edgy rock and roll days. I never cared much for the Las Vegas orchestral turn in his career, with the exception of some of his songs from that era. And I loved it when Elvis showed his true ""old"" self in the NBC television production ""Elvis: 68 Comeback"", during the segments in which he appeared in signature black leather, with his band members, in acoustic renditions of his earlier and greater hits.  Elvis had not appeared on stage in front of a live audience since 1961, prior to this NBC Special, which is a ""must have"" DVD for any Elvis fans.The timing of this movie's production and release, was bittersweet, in that we all felt disappointed in, and sorry for the visible decline we saw in this huge icon in music. He had grown to be overweight and a mere shadow of himself, as a victim of his own success and excess. So it was healing and refreshing at the time to see Kurt take the stage and embody the character that many of us grew up to know, and wished that Elvis could have retained into much later years of his life.A couple of other sidelines to this is that Kurt was the voice of Elvis in Forrest Gump. And in 2001, he played the role of an ex-con, Elvis impersonator, planning a Las Vegas heist, in the Kevin Costner vehicle ""3,000 Miles to Graceland"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29521NJ506TJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030ATZI0#wasThisHelpful","R29521NJ506TJU","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to first caution about potential charger damage, which many might not be aware of. Obviously, we are all aware that dropping a cell phone into water, will ruin it. But what I did not know is that if you accidentally allow the charger tip (the end which plugs into your phone) to be submerged in water, it will ruin the charger. Which is what happened to me. Unplugged it on the counter top, which had a bowl of water sitting near by and without looking, I tossed the end aside, after I removed it from my phone, and it landed in the bowl of water.

"When this protective port cover broke on my phone, I was very excited to that there are replacements available, which are critical to protecting the phone from potential water intrusion. By viewing Amazon reviews and going to YouTube, I found that replacing this part is very easy and simple, by removing the back of the phone, where you access the battery. You can see the small screw(s) that hold this cover in place, and can easily proceed, with a very small tipped screw driver, to remove the broken tab, to replace this new piece.And this Amazon merchant, East Coast Supply, sent it promptly through the mail, without any shipping charges or postage charge.

"I want to first caution about potential charger damage, which many might not be aware of. Obviously, we are all aware that dropping a cell phone into water, will ruin it. But what I did not know is that if you accidentally allow the charger tip (the end which plugs into your phone) to be submerged in water, it will ruin the charger. Which is what happened to me. Unplugged it on the counter top, which had a bowl of water sitting near by and without looking, I tossed the end aside, after I removed it from my phone, and it landed in the bowl of water. I immediately dried it off and tapped it on the counter to dislodge any water that might have been left inside the tip. Then waited for it to dry and then tried it in the phone. It was dead.

"I have an Arrow electric brad nailer, which only lasted through a short term project, nailing crown molding and base boards. It worked great when it was working, but without warning, right in the middle of nailing a strip of baseboard, it simply would not fire anymore, after going through one fourth of a box of brads. I was not able to claim warranty because I only used it to test it once, upon purchase, but then let it sit in a box until I got around to a project that it would be good for, which happened to be beyond the warranty period. So, if I was doing a review of the Arrow electric, it would not deserve even one star, since it was virtually new, when it malfunctioned. So, why mention the electric? Well, I obviously needed to replace it and was certainly not going to buy that brand again. However, I saw this nailer pop up as a free Vine product and thought, ""Well, Arrow owes me one, so what the heck.""  Upon receipt, I was impressed with the apparent durability and build quality. It appears to be well made and does not have any cheap plastic parts on it (almost all metal). So it should endure moderately rough handling. Its feature set is very minimalistic, so for those who are looking for a greater measure of control over the finished project, there are better nailers out there. If you are a DIY at home, kind of person, this will function very adequately, as long as you do not have an underpowered compressor. I also do not expect any malfunction issues with this since it is not electric. Pneumatics are pretty fool proof, since air is doing all of the work of driving brads (not an electric device which malfunctioned for reasons which are harder to troubleshoot).Negatives are: (a) Lack of any documentation or instruction manual. Although it is a very simple and intuitive tool, there are those out there, who may have never used one of these before, and need to know where and how much oil to put into the tool. (b) At the top of the motor housing (head), is a knob which can be turned...so what the heck is that for? Is it simply an air exhaust outlet which can be rotated 360 degrees to direct exhaust air where you want it to go, or is it there to adjust the pressure in order to set the proper ""drive depth"" for your brads. It would be nice to know, without having to experiment to find out. (c) There is not a rubber tip attached to the contact point of the nailer, so you have to be careful about how hard you press against more delicate surfaces (soft wood, or painted wood). You could leave a dent or scratch the paint. (d) Not too much of an issue, in the general scheme of things, but there is a lever on the forward face of the nail housing which allows you to open the head to remove any jammed brads. This is impossible to release by your bare fingers. You have to use something very sturdy, such as a screwdriver to pry it open. I guess the positive to this, is that there is no way it is going to accidentally open, and it insures that the brad to be fired is pushed firmly against the inside firing rail. (e) I have all of my tools in cases, for efficient stacking in my shop, so it is a big negative that you will have to go out and buy a case to house this in, which adds to the overall cost of the tool, and makes you consider buying a slightly higher priced competitive model, which almost all, come with cases.Other observations: (a) When you release the loading chute and pull it back, there are two different ""stacked"" cylindrical ""brad  head"" receiver slots that guide a variety of brad lengths into the chamber (6 different lengths being...5/8"", 3/4"", 1"", 1 1/4"", 1 1/2"", and 2""). And each of these two ""tubes or barrels"" have a hole in the working end of the head, through which you can see the short or long brads in the chamber. When you get down to almost empty, a red interior sleeve becomes visible, indicating the need to load some more brads. So that is a helpful feature. (b) The nailer trigger won't fire, unless the spring loaded tip is depressed against your work surface, so that is the main safety feature, which is common to all pneumatic nailers. However, unlike framing nail guns, you can't rapid bump fire this tool, without pulling the trigger. But, that is not how one uses a brad nailer anyway, so that is not an issue.Overall this is an adequate tool for the ""around the house"" jobs it may be intended for and I would venture to guess that it could also be very adequate for commercial work, as long as the compressor has sufficient capacity to keep up with trigger pulls. Bottom line is that this tool becomes a bit more expensive than justified, when one considers the need to buy a case to store it in, along with potentially better feature sets on other nailers, such as DeWalt, Porter Cable, Ridgid, etc. while also factoring in their features and their ""included case"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4RD0PMNA7VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXDPZ3K#wasThisHelpful","R2J4RD0PMNA7VJ","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very pleased with the quality of this oven's results using frozen pizza (DiGiorno, 11"" diameter Tuscan Chicken, which had a regular crust with a slight rise to it). I cooked it on the Thin/Regular setting, and it came out great. Crispy crust, lightly browned and the cheese on top had a slight browning with crisp texture. Please realize that the maximum diameter of pizza, to fit, is 12"" but in some cases, if you are at this limit, then the pizza will be very close to the interior sides and back of the oven, and might cause the perimeter edges to get more done than the center. This will also happen in a regular oven if you have pizza shoved clear to the back or off to the sides, picking up radiant heat from the oven's metal cavity, so this can't be considered a fault of the oven. Just be aware that your best results will be with pizza slightly less than 12"" diameter. I have not yet tried homemade pizza in it yet, but I followed the instructions, which recommended preheating the oven for 5 minutes, for regular pizza and thin crust. My DiGiorno came out perfect.There are four heating elements which run parallel to the face of the oven. There is an extremely high intensity single bulb that runs across the center of the bottom of the oven, which does most of the heat delivery. There are also 3 horizontal, evenly spaced, lower intensity bulbs running across the top of the oven, which are designed to heat the toppings and brown the cheese. I noticed that these do not come on, when preheating the oven with the lower bulb. Makes sense, since the preheating is meant to insure a crisp and done crust, by not only preheating the oven's interior, but also preheating the ceramic tray that the pizza will rest upon, when placed in the oven. Unlike one reviewer who complained that  his oven was still scorching hot, 30 minutes after shutting it off...this is simply not true. When my oven was done and the timer clicked down to zero, and shut off, I came back 15 minutes later and could comfortably place my hand on top of the oven's exterior. There are five heat settings on the control knob (bake, frozen snacks, thin/regular crust, rising crust, and deep dish), so you have a variety of options which basically vary the intensity of heat. With experimentation, you should be able to find the ""sweet spot"" for your favorite type of pizza or other baked items. I do like the fact that in the summer, I don't have to heat up my wall oven and the kitchen along with it. Simply use this oven instead. There is a 30 minute, rotary count-down timer which activates the power to the oven. You are instructed to turn the timer to ""just beyond 10 minutes"" and then back to the time desired for anything cooking under 10 minutes. My only ""wish list"" suggestion  would be for the manufacturer to put cord-wrap retention hooks or posts on the back side of the oven, to manage the cord when not in use.There is a black ceramic slide out tray, which goes into the oven with the smooth side up (although I don't know what is ceramic about it, since it is a metal tray which seems to have a black powder coated surface on  it). This tray can only be positioned in the center of the oven, where the guide rails hold it in place. the clearance from the tray to the upper curved edge of the oven is 2.5"" high and you probably would not want to put anything in the oven that is taller than about 2"". The pizza goes directly onto the tray. The tray handle has a catch-hook on it to cradle the tray safely, to remove it completely from the oven, but you have to use the flat, leading edge of the handle's working end to grab the wire frame leading edge of the ceramic tray, to pull it half way out (with no danger of the tray falling out of the oven, when pulled half way out). At that point you slip the handles hook onto the edge of the tray and pull the tray out completely, from the oven, to slide the pizza onto a cutting board. Very simple and functional, but some people have complained that they could not engage the handle's removal hook with the tray fully seated in the oven. They are not using their ""thinker"", to understand the mechanics of tray removal. Totally efficient and practical hardware. The only assembly required was screwing two black threaded posts into one side of the oven or the other, which are resting points for the handle that removes the tray (you decide whether you want the handle stored on the right or the left side of the oven). The power cord is 42"" long, if that information is helpful in determining where you may want to place this oven in use or as a countertop decor item.I find the design style to be very pleasing and looks great, on the counter, with the arched top and brushed stainless steel surface.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKXXCN2P7PHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","RUKXXCN2P7PHI","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got these to give to my daughter/granddaughter, primarily based on the cheerful and bright design. The only distinctive thing about these, if it is at all important is that they are PBA free. But realistically, absence of that chemical in plastic only makes sense if you are talking water bottles, from which chemicals might leach into the liquid. In this case it is irrelevant, but I guess it is fashionable today for consumer companies to throw buzz words out there, like the ridiculous ""gluten free"" labels you see on things that, by their very nature would never contain gluten to begin with (like gluten free water...haha). Not detracting from this product, but seems a bit silly.The mats themselves are high quality, although a bit thin. The main thing that I notice as a minor negative is the back of the mats is very smooth and slick, which means they easily slide around on the surface of the table.

"I just received these, so I can't speak to the long term durability, of being exposed to the sun, in an outdoor environment. I know that some vinyl or plastic items will dry up and crack over extended periods of use. The fact that they are a silvery white color, should aid in reflecting the sun's rays for longevity.However, these seem to be pretty well made. The backside of the vinyl is lined with a felt type material, for some reason. It adds to the thickness and tactile feel of the material but not sure if it is functionally needed. They slipped easily over my power boat trailer wheels (back side of the covers being ""open"" for easy mounting on the tire) and there are two plastic grommets on the lower backside corners to run black braided cords through to cinch the covers down. The cords have to be tied in a knot on the back so that is a little tricky. Would have been nice to have a spring loaded button tension clip to cinch it down (like elastic bands at the bottom of ski jackets). Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  On some tires, the fit may be snug enough to forego use of the tie down cords.This also comes with a ""same material"" bag to store them in, when not in use.

"I thought I would try this EDT since one of my daughters wears Euphoria for women, which I like very much. This EDT has a pretty subtle finish. You almost can't detect it after about 30 minutes. On my skin it has a slightly fruity scent, and a very soft odor, somewhat like baby powder. I am not sure that I am all that fond of it. I have been wearing Armani Aqua Di Gio Essenza, which is absolutely outstanding, with its extremely fresh smell (like you just hopped out of the shower). And it lasts all day long, and well into the evening, from a morning splash. When measured against the Aqua Di Gio, the Euphoria doesn't even come close. No contest. My ultimate measure of a cologne is comments received from females who might receive a hug, upon greeting, or my girlfriend. Without exception, like clockwork, when I am wearing Aqua, they always comment, ""Wow, you smell so good. What is that you are wearing?"" And of course my girlfriend always says ""you smell so intoxicating"".But after wearing the Euphoria for a couple of weeks, I have not received one comment from the same above. Which pretty much says it all. The Euphoria is a pleasant smell, with nothing about it that might be a ""turn-off"", but it just doesn't stand out among many others out there. And as an EDT, it does not have the strength in odor, that it should have. Although something such as a cologne, ends up being a very subjective thing, with different odors appealing to different men and women, so this EDT might be the perfect odor for some men. It just does not ignite a spark for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBTSPFSB15J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWXJQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1KBTSPFSB15J5","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son in law is a ""trouble shooting"" electrical systems engineer for Learjet, and I gave him this battery tester as a gift, since he also rebuilds cars and motorcycles. So he is  knowledgeable in many mechanical disciplines.  Within minutes of trying this out, he was immediately impressed with its intuitive simplicity.  First of all, the small printed manual that comes with it, was very well written and easy to understand (even for a novice like mysefl, with no experience).  By reading the manual, it explains exactly how to do various tests AND what the results of the test mean. So the manual does not assume automotive experience or knowledge.The manual includes the following instructions and/or cautions (with visuals of the tester's screen to clarify:1)"" Hook Up"":  requires you to enter the temperature of the battery at time of testing.  So you  may need an infra red temperature gauge, especially if the battery has been under load while the engine is running.  If the battery has been sitting idle in the car, then you can probably enter the ambient temperature, unless your car has been sitting out in the sun, raising the temperature of the engine compartment.  If you have the battery clamps reversed, on the battery posts, it will screen flash an error. Also, if you do not have ""sound"" connection to the posts, it will tell you to ""Check Connections"".2) ""Battery Test"": After entering battery temp, if the battery is above 180 degrees, you get a warning that ""Battery is too hot to test safely"".  At which point you are taken back to the main menu, to wait for the battery to cool down.  If the battery temp is ok, then you next select the battery type, such as ""Standard""  vs. AGM and within those two categories, you  get to pick ""Starting"" or ""Deep Cycle"".  Next you enter the rated CCA of the battery, which will then pull up a summary screen.  When that is done, it will start the test. And if the reading is below 7.2 Volts, it will ask you if it is a 6 Volt battery.3) As it goes through the Digital Pulse Load test, it removes the surface charge, and has a status bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating progress of the battery test.4) One of the following test results are displayed on the screen: (a) Battery passes testing and can return to service. (b) Battery did not have sufficient remaining capacity to pass tests, and battery should be replaced immediately. (c) Battery is good but needs a charge before using. (d) Battery did not have a sufficient charge for the Digital Pulse Load Test, so you need to charge the battery and then test again. (e) Battery passes testing, but is near the end of its life. It is ok for mild climate, but may not start vehicle in hot or cold conditions.5) After the test is completed, you can print out the results on an infrared printer (optional purchase item, if you are using it in a shop environment to share with customers.Bottom line is that this is an awesome product which is definitely INDUSTRIAL strength. Extremely ""durable build"" with an Otterbox style rubber enclosure to protect it from rough handling in a commercial garage environment. It also comes with a couple of terminal post adaptors. One for side post terminals and one with top post terminals. They recommend you use these for the most accurate test results. If the price fits your budget, don't hesitate to buy this because it is worth every penny. Although I also suspect that this will have greater appeal to mechanics who can get the most use out of it on a daily basis. For the average consumer who may only want to test their car battery, as needed, and infrequently, it might not be as desirable.  All a matter of perspective and need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RR2SMTEX5R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A8OJH2#wasThisHelpful","R14RR2SMTEX5R6","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this due to it being under a hundred bucks and wanted something very lightweight, which this one is. However, it is a cheap  piece of crap. My first clue was after assembling it. Every time you try to lift the vacuum off the floor by the handle, or pull the handle towards you to vacuum in a backwards line of travel, the entire vertical portion of the vacuum slips right out of the receiver in the base. So there you are with the upper portion of the vacuum in hand and the vacuum head resting on the floor. COME ON, Eureka. Only a friction fit ?... with no retaining clip or push button snap to hold the darn thing together?  I now notice this complaint in many Amazon reviews. This is simply careless and lazy product design/engineering, in which I doubt seriously that quality control ever used the vacuum to witness this blatant oversight. What I had to do to remedy this was to drill a small pilot hole through the (upper portion) sleeve connector, and the female sleeve receiver in the base (vacuum head), and then drive a small sheet metal screw through both, to make a solid connection that would not allow them to come apart. So get out your drill and screw driver if you don't want your's detaching with every use.The other thing that sucks on this vacuum is that the small, hard plastic wheels, which the rear of the vacuum rides on, keep popping out of the slot that holds them in place. You're ok if you are simply going forward and  back in a straight line, but if you try to go at an angle, especially on tile floors that have any kind of grout indentation in them, those wheels will pop right out of their sockets. They are easy to put back in, by flipping the base upside down and snapping them back into the base, but again, lousy engineering.Another thing that happened with mine is that the rotating carpet brush in the head, broke in half, right in the center. Totally puzzled about that, so I suspect there may have been a defect in the injection mold ""pass"" for my particular brush. I went to Eureka's website to see if I could purchase a replacement and none are available, so I returned the whole vacuum.As far as vacuuming function, it does do a decent job, however the dust canister fills up very quickly, so it is a good thing that it is removable for frequent dumping. I can't speak to the issue that other 1 star users have complained about (losing its suction velocity over time), since I did not keep the unit long enough to see whether it went downhill after repeated use. I only used it about 5 times before returning it for a refund. Another minor detail or irritant, is that the corrugated hose which loops at the top of the handle, does not seat as positively as it should, in the recess at the top of the handle. Mine kept falling forward, which in no way affects the performance. Just not as tidy as it could be.Bottom line is that this is priced under a hundred bucks for a reason. If you think about it, this manufacturer probably has a hard cost for manufacturing this unit for somewhere between 20-30  bucks, in order for retailers to sell it at the price point. That won't buy much in the way of quality or engineering. So realize that you are getting what you pay for. If you want extremely light weight (one of its biggest positives), then this is the one for you. If you want to risk parts falling off, and/or breaking, then you have been forewarned.And P.S. to Eureka.... just because you respond with a tap dance of concern, to all one star reviews, on Amazon, with an invitation to contact Eureka customer service, does not alter the fact that this is a cheap piece of junk, which you should simply remedy by going to your production design department to request some minor product or tooling changes to insure that parts don't separate or fall off in normal use. FIX IT, instead of giving lip service to blatant design flaws.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187GLNTMP6JEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRCZHLQ#wasThisHelpful","R187GLNTMP6JEW","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could give this vacuum 10 stars, it would easily deserve it. What I was not expecting was the superior design and build quality, with which this is made. Everything is well thought out, with extremely durable parts, of unusually high quality. My first clue was pulling the telescoping wand out of the box. My goodness....extremely light weight stainless steel. From that point on, I was not surprised at all, with the other components. So, here are the things that make this vacuum so superior.PROS:** Stainless steel telescoping wand which allows you to effortlessly slide it in and out (like a trombone), to set the absolute best height between your hand and the floor, which totally negates back strain (I am 6'-2"" and can maneuver this wonderful thing in a totally upright posture without hunching forward or leaning down). And the glide action in the telescoping wand is as smooth as silk, with a self locking, spring loaded finger button which engages the adjustment depression stops, in the upper wand, every 3/4"", for 19 click increments, from short to long. So it telescopes in a manner that the distance from the handle to the floor attachment is 48"". Then, by depressing the spring loaded finger clip (located at the top of the lower wand section), you can shorten this distance, for shorter people, to 32"".  This wand flexibility is EXCELLENT for doing, not only basic floor vacuuming, but also upright tasks, such as vacuuming drapes and upper surfaces, near the ceiling. Use the short telescope for close up and the full extension for getting cobwebs, etc off of the ceiling. Very versatile.** The handle (which is raised up, off of the top of the wand, kind of like a gasoline pump handle, but open at the back end closest to the user) is sized and positioned perfectly, for comfort and maneuverability of the wand and vacuum head. Besides the main power button on the canister, there is also a convenient thumb-activated, on/off button on the handle, which disengages the rotary brush in the vacuum head, for those instances when you move onto solid surface floors and don't wish to change the suction settings, or when you simply want only suction on the carpet, without the brush rotating. Very smart and handy feature.** The vacuum head swivel at the base of the wand, works the same way as a Dyson Ball. Turn the handle to the right or left and it causes the brush head to turn and travel in the same direction, right or left, that you moved the handle. This minimizes the amount of arm effort needed to redirect the path of the vacuum head. You can stand in one place and cover a lot of area, back and forth in wide sweeps, without moving your feet. And the fantastic thing about the swivel head, is that, by rotating the handle, so that it is at the 3:00 or 9:00 position (while at the same time, lowering the wand down, close to the floor, you can  get under any furniture or obstructions which have a clearance of only 3"" above the floor, which is the height of the rotating brush vacuum head).  You can also twist and turn the handle in either direction, underneath furniture (sofas, buffets, etc), to easily move the head, in all directions, to get to all of the surface areas to be cleaned, under obstructions. I was pleasantly surprised about the ease and utility of this function, especially since I have some very heavy wood furniture, which can't be moved to clean under. Instead, I have to get out a dust mop, on my hands and knees. Well, not anymore. I can't do that with any other vacuum. Another feature which adds flexibility is that, not only the vacuum head swivels, but also, where the flexible suction hose snaps into the canister....the hose can rotate 180 degrees, which aids in not having the hose fight you, by getting into a twisted bind, when you maneuver the wand and the canister in different directions.** Suction settings are versatile, with 6 different levels of suction. The lowest suction level will allow you to vacuum drapes and sheers without sucking them into the vacuum. And the air velocity can be increased to the maximum setting, for hard surface floors. And if you are on thick carpet which might be resisting your wand movement, you can simply dial back the suction setting so that it moves with less resistance. Very user friendly and consumer-centric.** The canister is not only gracefully beautiful (I got the Mango Red), but the wheels glide effortlessly on every surface, including deep pile carpet. All three of the small wheels swivel independently within cleverly designed, larger molded casings, so no matter where you go with the wand, the canister follows you effortlessly like a shadow, without any need to tug on it, as if it were a Great Dane on a leash:) The canister can glide flat on the floor, or it can sit upright and stationary, since the back of the canister is a flat surface (for when you want to use the wand for things up higher and don't want the canister rolling freely). This feature also allows upright storage in a closet, taking up minimal space. The main power switch is located at the back of the canister and is a foot-activated switch, about the size of a cell phone. Next to that switch is a ""same size"" switch which activates the self winding power cord, to retract it back into the unit. The other nice feature of the canister is an ergonomic handle on the front, which allows you to easily carry it in one hand, while carrying the wand in the other. Unbelievably, this canister is so light that you don't even feel that you are carrying anything. It only weighs 8 pounds. And the wand and head assembly is also around 8 pounds, so when you are carting the whole affair, from room to room, or up and down stairs, you are only dealing with 16 pounds total, but equally split between two hands.  Worth its minimal weight, in gold.** There are several options for filters. The hinged access door to the inside of the canister is easily opened, which reveals the vacuum bag (which some might view as a negative, since many vacuums today, use a reusable, removable plastic debris container). The vacuum bag readily snaps into a bag cradle, with absolutely no effort. And then when the door of the canister is closed, it automatically seats into the opening of the vacuum bag. So there is no struggling with slipping the bag over a vacuum tube and securing with elastic bands. Its all automatic.  Inside the canister is a small pre-filter, which protects the motor from debris, and then there is a larger exhaust filter which is a 4"" x  8"", single sheet filter, under a removable screen, which keeps particulates from re-entering the room. The unit comes with this basic particulate filter installed, with the option to remove it in favor of an included ""plastic framed"" HEPA 13 filter for those with allergies, in need of a higher level of filtration (this filter resembles the air filters on most automobiles). The dust bag appears to be relatively small, so I do not yet know how much vacuuming I can do before replacing it. It folds over on itself inside the canister and may expand more than it appears at first glance. The canister also has a sensor on top, which alerts you, when the bag is full, and on the border of not being able to accept any more debris. The bags for this unit are G/N type bags.** The retractable cord is 19' long so it gives plenty of room to operate from a single wall outlet, versus running around the room to find the next convenient spot to plug it in. And when the product description states it has an operational range of 29', what they are telling you, is that you have the 19' of cord, from wall outlet to canister, and then you have an additional 10' of reach,  with the wand itself. So you can go out as far as 29' from a wall outlet, to reach the limits of the vacuum head. This vacuum is rated at 1200 watts, and with the rotational brush activated, it pulls 12 amps, according to the manufacturer info.** Attachments are pretty straight forward and typical. Three small attachments are a small vacuum head, a round brush head and a crevice tool, all of which store on a bracket, which snaps to the base of the vacuum hose, where it enters the canister. Besides the rotary brush vacuum head, there is also a large hardwood floor attachment, which you can switch out. It features soft bristle brushes around the perimeter of the head, which have varying heights of bristles, so it doesn't just push dirt out of the way, when vacuuming, and allows debris to enter the suction zone of the head.CONS:** This is so minimal that it is probably not worth considering in the general scheme of things. But you have to replace vacuum bags, which may be a turn off for some. But the tremendous utility of this vacuum in all other areas, offsets this minor inconvenience. And the only other negative about this feature is that the replacement bags are more expensive. For the genuine Meile bag kit purchase, you  will spend around 18 bucks on the replacement kit, which includes 3 bags, as well as replacements for the other filters inside the canister (main motor filter, standard exhaust filter, and a replacement HEPA 13 filter). So, on the surface it may seem like a lot, but one has to consider the  cost of the other filters which come with the bag kit.** The only other minor negative is that this vacuum is not going to store as compactly as many other vacuums, since the hose and wand have to be dealt with. The canister itself, takes up only 10"" x 8"" of floor space, in a closet, and stands 18"" tall, when set upright.  The telescoping wand (collapsed to its shortest length) with the vacuum head attached is about 34"" long, end to end, but can be broken down even further, by detaching the vacuum head (taking it down to 22"" without the head). The head can easily be stored on a shelf, out of the way. The other component, for storage, is the flexible vacuum hose which has the integrated handle at one end, which is 6' long and could be draped over a bracket in a closet, thus shortening its needed clearance to 36"", when hanging.  Maybe these dimensions will help those who may have limited storage space.All in all, this is one of the finest, well made, and well thought out products which I have had the good fortune of experiencing. So, if the price does not deter you, I can assure you that the quality and function will easily justify itself, in this German engineered, and manufactured product. This is obviously a  product which had a lot of ""hands on"" involved in the engineering phase, translating functions into true usability. I can't find a flaw in its design, at any step of the way. Kudos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDD9UTNTURCDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGVS#wasThisHelpful","RDD9UTNTURCDU","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the past I have used straight line shavers, such as the Braun, which gave me closer shaves than rotaries, such as Norelco. So this is the first rotary which I have used in a long time. Right out of the box, I tackled a two day growth. I have pretty stiff whiskers and this shaver took them down to a smooth face in just a few strokes, so it does work very well. The heads are spring loaded so they follow the contours of your face. I also have a combo goatee and mustache and the only negative I noticed, was that the shaver tugged on or caught some of the short hairs around the perimeter of my goatee, which causes insignificant discomfort. Thus I will stay away from ""real close"" and simply finish off the tight edge around the goatee with a safety razor, to get up close and clean.The shaver is also very light weight and comfortable in hand, so no complaints there. It also has a lithium rechargeable battery which supposedly has a longer ""power holding time"" and it is listed as good for 30 minutes of shaving before it needs to be recharged. I can't attest to this benefit since I have not gone thru a charge recycle yet. It also has a pop up trimmer for sideburns which works as it should.All in all, as rotary razors go, this one performs well in the ""close shave"" department. Time will tell, as to its durability over time, especially as it relates to how many times it can be recharged before its battery runs its course.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHOGZN9Y16CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMNLD4Y#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHOGZN9Y16CG","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reason I selected this set of mugs was for the European flair in the artwork and design and the streamlined look of the curve. The quality is first rate and the white porcelain finish is flawless, both inside and out. And the image appears on both sides of the mug. One thing I find appealing is the generous space within the handles. I can place three fingers comfortably within the handle, minus the pinky finger.The size is ideal for a large cup of hot chocolate and I find the 14oz. size to be great for cups of soup, chili, etc.And although the smooth rounded design at the bottom appears that it might not be stable, that is not the case.

"I have had this router in my home for 4-5 years now. I bought it after reviewing comments in ""geek"" discussion forums, which universally mentioned and praised this router. All of the sophisticated users who are far more technologically knowledgeable than I, had nothing bad to say and all praised it for its consistent signal output and range. I have a rather large, multistory home and have the router in an upstairs office. The signal is robust in every corner of the house and I can actually use my computer throughout my large yard and have even been able to navigate online with my devices within my car, out in the street. I have experimented with driving a short distance from the house and still get a durable signal. Obviously, with this capability, you want to password protect access to your wifi, since this thing does an incredible job in its performance and range.Over the past several years, I have had friends who were experiencing signal drop and connection problems with two other well known brands, which they were using for their wifi. I suggested they try this one and they have been absolutely delighted with the switch. All problems have gone away and I told them the good news is that this will likely be the last router they will ever have to buy, unless technology changes so much that a new paradigm shift, renders this technology obsolete.As you can see, there are three outbound antennas to ""spread the juice"" in various directions. although I have never had to tweak their rotational position. I am not sure that is even necessary, but the magic may be in the fact that there are three, along with the fact that D-Link simply makes the best router in the business.So don't hesitate for one second on this one. It is the gold standard for function, durability, performance and being absolutely trouble free for a very long time in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E20PATHB8QLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LIFB7S#wasThisHelpful","R1E20PATHB8QLO","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I looked at dozens of fountains, focusing on style and the water effect. This one is extremely classy. There are small sealed lights in the two lower vases, which cause the sides of the vases to glow slightly, since the plastic is semi translucent (due to its thickness), which is not at all noticeable until it gets dark, so this provides a very impressive, unexpected appearance, when the sun goes down, providing a wonderful counter balance of vase illumination, in conjunction with the bulbs illuminating the upper bowl and the water falling out of it.Some reviewers complained about water splashing out of the lower vases but this only happens under three potential conditions. First, it is critical to use a level in both directions (north/south and east/west, resting on the rim of the upper bowl) to insure that the surface which your fountain is resting on, is totally level. Using a level, I positioned shims under a couple of corners of the base of my unit, to level it. If it is not level, then the water will not pour equally from the two upper spillways and the flow will not hit the middle of the water pools in the two vases. If it is out of level and off center, then water can hit closer to the edges of one or both of the vases, causing it to splash over the edge....easy to prevent. Second, if there is a strong breeze, of course the wind will blow the spilling water out of its intended path. And third, you might have to adjust the pump velocity to decrease the water flow, as a potential source of splashing, although I found the two aforementioned conditions to be more likely to cause splashing.I did find the assembly instructions to be not quite as clear as they could have been, but a little common sense and logic can get you there. Mainly realize that you are to run the two electrical cords for the light bulbs, immediately from their vases and into the large round downspout tube in the reservoir, as well as the cord from the pump which sits at the bottom of the reservoir. They are not to reside within the water reservoir. So all of the ""excess"" cords/wiring are supposed to nest within the bottom of the unit, on the ground or pavement. Of course there is a ""mouse hole"" cutout in the base for the power cord to exit the unit, towards an outlet.One valuable feature of this fountain is the fairly large reservoir which basically includes most of the structure behind what is visible, so I only have to refill it every few days (depending upon how much it is flowing...evaporation).Do not let the reservoir run dry, since it will ruin the pump. Two things will alert you to low water condition. First, the level of water will be noticeably reduced in the upper bowl, along with reduced waterfall flow, But more importantly as an ""early warning"", the water entering the base of the upper bowl, from the pump, will start to exhibit small air bubbles with the water flow (a bit of frothing). That is a definite sign that you need to add water and it alerts you well in advance of being critical.I am extremely happy that I chose this unit over many other designs, although I really wanted to spend about 50 to 75 bucks less. So I am glad that I ignored my original budget desire, because this one is well worth the extra money for great design, features, and function. I get extremely positive comments from guests, who now want to get the same unit.Oh, by the way, some earlier reviewers complained that the factory production molds created a visible vertical seam in the middle of the front of the two lower vases, but that problem has been addressed in the units being sold now, so not an issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RX8LVHLF1WD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NTNCMY#wasThisHelpful","R3RX8LVHLF1WD0","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the simplest concept can be simply brilliant in it's execution. I absolutely love this innocuous little product that started out in its early life as a camera holder, many years ago, which you could wrap around any stationary object which could accommodate the device's bendable arms which are infinitely positionable.This device does one thing extremely and simply ""WELL"". Hold any phone, any camera, or any media player in a way that is extremely user friendly. I have a Samsung Galaxy 5.0 Player (which is not a smart phone, but is of the same dimensions as most). What makes this device so versatile, and which is not readily apparent, are the ""grippers"" which are spring loaded ""fingers"" which telescope out of the frame of the unit which attaches to the tripod. At first glance, upon receipt, I thought to myself, ""darn it...my player (or iPhone, or any other similar device) will not fit this thing since the holder is not wide enough. Then I noticed that one side of the spring holder ""fingers"" slides out to accommodate whatever width of device you want it to hold  BINGO. No problem. This expandable holder threads into the spider tripod base to hold your device, with an adapter that comes with the unit.There are enough adjustments for swivel and angle to satisfy any desirable viewing/using angle. Although the product photo on Amazon shows the 3 feet in a fairly upright orientation (which is not the most stable for ""touch and go"" usage), you can spread or bend them out much flatter to provide a more stable base to eliminate tipping over. You can also use this same bendability to tilt the unit back into a very ""reader friendly"" viewing angle for easy ""hands free"" navigation with your device. I can press and swipe to my hearts content in moving through screens on my device, with it sitting 6""-8"" above the resting surface that it is on. Feels like someone is holding it up for me, at an angle of my choosing.In addition, the same things which make it functional for smart phones or media players, also apply to cameras, with the standard universal threaded bases, which this is designed to accommodate. And don't forget that in any situation, this tripod does not have to sit on a counter top to be effective. You can literally bend and squeeze the flex legs to any object, vertical or horizontal, such as a door jamb, stair railing, post, etc. It will grab onto anything up to about 6""-8"" wide or thick.Love it.

"For over 10 years, I have had the same species of birds building a nest behind my basketball goal, mounted directly to the side of my house above the overhead doors, in the driveway. There is just enough room between the siding and the backboard of the goal to allow birds to fly in for the most protected bird nest area on the planet. I have tried every conceivable method for trying to keep them out, since every year produces another crop of baby birds that call this home and then come back the following year to produce their offspring. Many times I just wanted to blast them out of there.I have used chemicals, fake owls, shiny strips of foil, etc. everything recommended on all of the sites that advise such a thing. Then on one site I experienced the ah-ha moment, at the suggestion of netting. WOW. In all those years, I was looking for a way to scare them away or make their environment unpleasant with chemicals. But the simplest solution was to physically preventing them from entering the area they wanted access to.So I bought a 14' x 14' package of the BIrd-X 3/4"" mesh and stapled it to my siding around the basketball goal, with absolutely no possible access points for the birds to enter. GOLDEN SOLUTION. The minute that it was in place the birds could not enter and within 2 days of prevention, they no longer even try...Taking up residence elsewhere.The hardest part for me was trying how to attach the netting to the house, since the netting can be difficult to work with, when it is unrolled. It gets tangled on itself. So I had to create a stable frame to hold it while moving into position for attachment. I went to Home Depot and bought several 10' long strips of what they call ""Lattice"", which is basically very thin wood strips which can accept staples from a hand activated ""Arrow"" staple gun. I stapled the netting along the factory cut edge, every 6"" to hold it in place and then rolled the strip over on itself to run another series of staples along its length. This firmly attached the mesh to a single wood strip, which allowed me to walk it up to the ladder to attach above the backboard, by using an electric carpet stapler (but in the absence of that, you could simply tack it into place with very small finish nails). With the 10' wide mesh, now hanging from the siding above the goal, I then proceeded to attach a bottom 10' strip of wood lattice to the mesh, below the goal. I used two 6' step ladders, spaced 8' apart to rest a 12' 2x4 on the top. The 2x4 gave me a solid surface to hold the bottom lattice piece in place while I stapled it to the mesh, the same as I did the top piece, rolling it several times to insure a fool proof connection. I then stapled (nailed) the bottom piece to the siding below the goal and the hard part was done. The only thing left, was to staple (adhere) the mesh along the vertical edges, With lap siding that is 10"" tall, I cut 10"" long strips of the lattice to staple to each individual piece of vertical siding, using a level to insure they were in perfect alignment for visual balance.Mission accomplished. Absolutely no more bird intrusions.What was accomplished in a fairly labor intensive effort to eliminate birds from bombarding the sides of my house and my cars with bird poop, undoubtedly will be very easy to accomplish with a minimum of effort, to protect fruit trees and vegetables from incursion by simply draping this mesh over the protected object.Flat out....it works. Birds can't get to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JX3YFQWOPHCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQ81A4#wasThisHelpful","R1JX3YFQWOPHCP","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item came relatively well packaged with very thick foam insert protectors in each corner to hold the pit, nested and centered within the box. Although, upon opening I did note a very slight deflection in the rim, where it might have experienced some impact along the middle of one of the sides of the box. The manufacturer could avoid this by putting some foam protection all the way around the copper rim to keep the edge of the rim 1/2"" to 1"" away from any impact points. Although, I remedied the slight bend by placing the bowl face down on the kitchen floor and stepping on the area with my foot, which straightened it out, so as not to be noticed. And even though I was able to do this, does not mean that the copper bowl is thin or flimsy. It is very hefty and robust and will not be damaged through regular use.The frame and legs are very strongly constructed with thick steel, so the unit is not flimsy in the least. I give it high marks for being well made.Tip:  When bolting the legs to the frame, I found it easiest to set the frame ring on its edge on top of a table so you are not bending over to assemble. Place a pencil or something small like that, on the table where the ring touches the table to keep the ring from rolling and rotate the ring so the holes in the frame for the leg are at the 7:00 to 8:00 position. This is the most user friendly position for inserting the bolts through the frame to align with the holes in the legs. IMPORTANT...one reviewer commented that the holes on one of the legs did not line up with the frame. I too, thought I had run into the same issue, but found that if I inserted both bolts and only turned them a couple of turns to get them started, it solved the problem. Because the holes in the frame are larger than the targeted holes in the legs, allowing some wiggle room to get them both started. I had originally tightened the top bolt snug, which appeared to force the bottom bolt to have to go in at an angle that would not thread, so when I backed off the top bolt, the wiggle room in hole spacing allowed the bottom bolt to go in with ease. So tighten them both real tight, only after getting them started loosely in the holes. Also, there is no chance of stripping the bolt heads since they are tightened with an Allen head tool, which comes with the unit.If I would suggest anything of the manufacturer, regarding construction, it would be to get closer on tolerances for the fit of the spark guard screen. Regarding the unit I received, the diameter of my screen was 1/2"" smaller than the diameter of the depression in the rim of the bowl that seats the screen. The diameter of the screen needs to be slightly larger than it is, because I notice that when I place the screen in place, with it all the way to one edge of the rim of the bowl, the screen's rim barely misses the rim ledge on the opposite side of the bowl, allowing the screen to sag down a bit below the edge that it is supposed to rest on. I might add that this does not in any way make it non functional for what it is designed to do, resting on top, to arrest sparks, since I simply scoot it over enough to center on the rim of the bowl.As far as looks go, this is a beautiful fire pit. It looks impressive in a casual or dressed up back yard setting. The mission style is very classy and has elicited very positive comments from our guests. Some reviewers have commented about the copper changing color. That is the nature of copper, to change its patina through oxidation. My dad was an architect who designed quite a few shopping centers, in which they used copper mansard roofs as decorative treatments along the facades and I remember commenting to him, as a youngster, that it was really cool, how bright and shiny they were, when construction was finished. He advised that they would not be like that for long, since the objective in using copper was to allow it to weather to a much more subdued look.  So, if it is important to keep the shiny copper penny look, you are going to have to get out the copper cleaner and burnish it back to its original look from time to time. Or, as my mom used to do, back in the 60's, with her copper bottom Reverware pots and pans was to squeeze lemon juice onto the bottom and sprinkle salt over it. Then scour it with a cloth or abrasive sponge. The combo of salt dissolving into the lemon juice, quickly brought the bright copper back to life. Its possible that copper cleaner might work around the rim, where the heat of the fire has not altered the metallurgical properties of the copper as much. But the copper cleaner may not do anything where intense heat has altered the characteristics of the metal. At any rate the visual focus is on the fire and the classy looking stand. And although the copper changes color, its main attribute is that it will not rust, like thin steel bowls will.Another reviewer commented that the round fire grate which the logs sit on, has warped through use, from intense heat. This also happens in all of the Weber charcoal grills, for which you can find replacement round grates in all different sizes in hardware stores and all of the big box home improvement stores. So, that is an easily replaceable part, several years down the road, if needed or desired.The bowl is roomy, at 28"" across and 7"" deep, with the screen standing another 5"" higher at the peak, allowing 12"" total clearance at the peak, which is deep enough for several fire place logs which you can stack pyramid style if desired. And I like the fact that there are 5 small holes in the bottom of the unit to allow water to drain. Although possible, I doubt that the holes are big enough to add air circulation for the fire. The fire pit comes with a fitted vinyl cover to protect the entire unit from the elements. There is a 1"" wide elastic band sewn into the perimeter of the cover which holds it snugly in place (much better than any of the bbq grill covers). It remains to be seen, how well this cover holds up to extended exposure to the elements, since I have had 4 or 5 expensive bbq grill covers that seemed to be heavily constructed but started cracking and deteriorating within 3-5 years, in the sun.On a final note, due to the heavy duty construction of the frame and legs, with closed weld points everywhere, rust over a long period of time will not be a threat, because any that might occur, will only be cosmetic, and easily addressed with Rust-Oleum flat black or semi gloss. Same true on the spark guard screen.You will not be disappointed with this fire pit. Very functional, attractive and large enough to satisfy. In the past, I have had some of the 50 to 100 dollar fire pits from ""Wally World"", which are much more shallow and with steel bowls that rust out within 2-3 years of use, and this is far superior in every way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBGNPJZNN4KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096DD84W#wasThisHelpful","R1OBGNPJZNN4KH","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My credentials: Former owner of a chain of large dance clubs (in Atlanta, KC, Augusta Georgia, Omaha, and Wichita Kansas) with patron capacities varying between 1,000 to 3,000 people in each. We spent massive dollars on elaborate sound systems in each. Equipped with MacIntosh amps, Crown amps, UREI equalizers, JBL, and Cerwin Vega speakers (when they were all at the top of the food chain in quality). In addition to being an audiophile at home, I do recognize good sound when I hear it. Regarding consumer brands in this category, I am totally ""brand"" agnostic and do not have allegiance to any one over the other. I could care less, since I let my ears be the judge.For the past 15 years, I have lugged around the most incredible portable sound system (a monster of a boombox), made by JVC, called the Kaboom. Absolutely nothing rivals it's incredible output, with 2 side firing 6"" subs, and 2 forward firing 3"" mids with embedded tweeters. It puts many home component stereo systems to shame. It has on board equalization for bass, mids, and highs, so I have been spoiled, however, this thing weighs too much to justify use in many mobile situations. Thus I went in search of a ""decent"" small speaker that I could use in hotel rooms, kitchen, outdoor bbq, pool parties and other outdoor get-togethers. Not expecting to fill an area with home component sound, but certainly did not want the hollow ""tinny"" sound, which is put out by most MP3 player speakers.I contemplated a purchase, reluctantly, for about 6 months, with repeated trips back to the big box stores to convince myself that these small portable speakers are justified at $150 to $200. Hard to stomach since you can get a pretty decent bookshelf speaker in that price range, which sound a heck of a lot better. Ultimately, within that price range, I narrowed my choices down to the UE Boom, JBL Charge, and Bose Soundlink Mini since all other brands (including Sony, iHome, and Dr. Dre Beats Pill 2.0) were definitely lacking in fullness of sound and simply sounded cheap. I do have to say, however the the XL Pill from Dr. Dre was a very impressive, hands down winner, with very solid bass and volume, but not at $300.I kept coming back to the UE Boom, due to its overwhelmingly positive reviews. Seems like the majority of reviews raved about three things. a). Its battery life, arguably 15 hours, depending upon individual experiences (b) the fact that it can go ""really loud"", and (c) being water resistant for outdoor activities which might jeopardize other brands. I decided against the Bose, because Bose retail store displays prohibit side by side comparisons, with their locked down pads and physical restrictions against being able to plug in your own player. So, I simply could not tell whether the Mini had decent volume. The store display would not go above a certain volume which did not seem to be as loud as the competitors on the backside aisle displays. Although I did notice that it had a more full range of sound than the UE Boom. Of course, Bose is famous for boosting the low end bass spectrum to deliver what many might consider to be a ""fuller"" sound. But I was worried that it might not be loud enough at 15-20 feet away, in a backyard setting, so it was out of the race.On my last trip in, to purchase, I had pretty much decided on the UE Boom, but I had this nagging doubt about it sounding a bit too shallow and harsh with most of its volume dedicated to mids and highs (even though they were pretty natural and ""uncolored""). I brought my Samsung Galaxy 5.0 player into the store to give it a good test drive since I had a great 7 band equalizer in my player software and could challenge the UE with a wide range of music genre's. The EQ helped some but I still could not achieve a satisfying balance with some low end to fill it out. Then, by sheer chance, I spotted a speaker at the end of the shelf display, which, I had not previously noticed since I never saw it in Amazon keyword search results for these small bluetooth speakers, and thus, did not consider it when looking for brands to compare. This speaker was the TDK A33. I used my mini stereo headphone cord on the Samsung and played specific songs, in R&B, Rock, Country, and Jazz, switching from the UE Boom to the TDK and back, in the store setting. Without question, the TDK sounded a heck of a lot better than the UE. It had impressive ""on the shelf"" bass response and made the UE sound pretty hollow and flat, with it's ""nothing but mids and highs"". I felt it was still hard to really evaluate due to the store setting, with ambient noise and large volume of open space, so I purchased both to take home for a test drive in a more natural setting.Took both into the kitchen, bedroom, and living room, switching the player's line signal between the two, multiple times on each song, to insure my ears were not deceiving me. The UE did not come close to the TDK in delivering a full and pleasant range of sound. I next went out into the back yard, since the biggest boast for the UE is that it gets really loud, when you need it to. So that was a concern, as to whether the TDK could measure up. And to my surprise, with both units maxed out on volume, I could not tell the difference between the two, except for TDK's much richer sound range. So, within 10 minutes at home, the decision was made, without any hesitation or doubt. If you want great sound, under $200, nothing compares to the TDK (which will cost you around $130). I have since taken it with me to several friend's houses, who have some of the other brands and they immediately comment on how much better it sounds, than their units.Having made the choice in favor of the TDK A33, based on sound quality alone, I will admit to some pros and cons, but am willing to take my chances, since I know my ears would have buyer's remorse every time I turned it on, had I gone with alternate choices. The following are issues which are raised in some of the negative reviews for the TDK. Although the number of 4 star and 5 star ratings for the TDK (500+) are right in line with the same number for the UE Boom, with both brands having an overwhelming number of 4 and 5 star over a minimal number of 1 and 2 star (21 for the TDK), so I feel the odds are in my favor regarding the few negatives.TDK Cons: The UE has a 2 year warranty and the TDK only has 1 year. Matters little to me, since I suspect that if there is a component failure, it will probably occur fairly early on. Most of the 1 star reviews of the TDK complained about the unit becoming inoperable within its first month or so (OK, then replace under warranty). But again, a very small percentage, compared to the hundreds of 4 and 5 star. But if that is an important concern, then buy an extended warranty since the TDK is 50 bucks less expensive, most everywhere.TDK Cons: The UE claims to have a 15 hour battery life and reviews in actual use, seem to be mixed, on the actual achievable, depending upon volume level being run. The TDK only claims 6 hour battery life, so that is a point in UE's favor. My experience with the TDK is 5-6 hours if running inside at 50-70%% volume, within an enclosed space, however, outside, I tend to max the volume, for listening within 20', and I get about 3 hours that way. But since I am close to outlets, I simply plug into an extension cord and don't worry about it.TDK Cons: The UE appears to be pretty robust in its tolerance for moisture, such as actually dropping it into water, etc, so it probably has a leg up in that department. The TDK is water resistant, meaning it can take getting rained on or splashed on, but not able to be submersed. So, if I accidentally leave it outside when it starts to rain, I won't have to worry about it being ruined. And I do not plan on taking it kayaking, floating, or canoeing, where the UE might be a safer bet.BIG TDK Pro... on Sound: Absolutely no contest, with the TDK delivering much better sound than the UE Boom. The TDK has two forward facing 1.5"" drivers for mids and highs and and two 3"" rear passive radiators, linked to a 2.5"" forward facing subwoofer, to deliver a very pleasing full range of sound, in such a small package. I have no idea what drives the UE but do know that it has no ""bass"" presence. When the ultimate test is done with the ears, there simply is no reason to consider anything else in this price range. After all, I want a speaker that does justice to the material and is the most pleasing to the ears. Tip, to further enhance the punch from the impressive little TDK speaker....be aware that bass, in any speaker of any size, is enhanced whenever a speaker is closer to a wall or within a more confined space (such as an open cabinet recess), to radiate the bass sound waves, so, whether I am outside or inside, I try to place the TDK within about 6"" of a wall behind it, which intensifies the bass. This has no effect on the UE Boom, since it has no bass presence to begin with.Misc Points regarding the TDK only....There is an auxiliary ""in"" port for wired connections, coming from any source that has a stereo mini output (i.e. headphone jack). Although there is no auxiliary ""out"" on the TDK, to send signals to any other device. Other than wired ""input"" you obviously can send wireless Bluetooth signals to the TDK, which also doubles as a wireless speaker phone, paired to your smart phone. Which might be convenient to use in the car for phone calls. Charging the TDK is only done with the AC line cord from an outlet. There is an ""outbound only"" USB port, to charge other devices while you are listening to the TDK (or have it on, but with no signal being sent to it, or volume turned down, if you want silence while charging something else). The manual says the TDK will charge other devices through the USB, when it is ""on"" and plugged into an outlet. Since I have not tried it, I don't know whether the TDK would charge something through the USB port, if it is not plugged in. Also, in the distant future, if and when the rechargeable batteries run their course and no longer hold a charge, they are replaceable, unlike some electronic devices which have sealed systems. There are instructions from TDK on how to remove and replace worn out batteries. This will not happen for quite some time, since these types of batteries typically go through hundreds of recharge cycles before wearing out. I do not believe the batteries can be replaced on the UE Boom, since it is a totally enclosed system, for its water repellent attributes.At least purchase the TDK along with the UE Boom and try them at home, side by side, and let your ears be the judge, without online ""brand fans"" hyping their favorite, at the expense of what will please you. You will not be disappointed with the TDK, and in a true side by side comparison, I do not see how anyone could favor the UE Boom over the TDK, based on sound quality alone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDJZTKJZKG2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM0XHNS#wasThisHelpful","R2PDJZTKJZKG2P","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, this is a good quality bag. However, the price leads us in a different direction. Functionally, the primary minor drawbacks are these: they do not store in the freezer very efficiently due to the way they are constructed, which prevents stacking as flat as other bags, which are not self standing. So, if you want to store a lot of bags for extended usage periods, they might not be the best solution. We also found them to be a bit more difficult to fill, due to the stiffness of the bag. Although the labeling section at the top is a nice feature, if you cut the bag off closer to the ziplock area above the reservoir, they are easier to fill, which works out ok if you are not concerned about storing them for extended periods. And we think that is not much of an issue since the breast feeding cycle is not likely to force you to keep them for more than a month or two in the freezer, if you are cycling them properly by using the oldest first. We feel that you can use a ""Sharpie"" to mark the date on the lower portion of the bag, laid out flat on the counter, before you fill the bag, so that you can cut off the upper portion. We tend to favor the Lansinoh bag over this one. But we think you should at least try on package of this brand to see if it better suits your needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34CI45QKI6XFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZFNHOA#wasThisHelpful","R34CI45QKI6XFM","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an extremely well designed lantern/flashlight. As a lantern it puts out adequate light to maneuver within a fairly large room (not necessarily to be able to read by), but what really blows me away is the flashlight, which should really be classified as a SEARCHLIGHT. This baby throws a very wide angle beam of light with an intensity one would expect from those spotlights that you see on vehicles. There are two concentric zones of light within the beam which are co-existent. At 10 feet away, it illuminates a 20' diameter circle well enough to walk in the woods in the dead of night and be able to see everything in your path. And within that 20' wide beam, in the center is a very highly concentrated and very bright hot spot of light which is about 3' to 4' in diameter, so you can see objects within that zone, as if it were daylight.  I am extremely impressed for outdoor use in open spaces and navigation. Also has a handle for 90 degree rotation for the most comfortable position for carrying as a lantern versus searchlight. Obviously the reflective design of the searchlight cone and of the other end of the unit for the lantern, have been very well thought out. Also has a fold-away hanger on top for suspending from the inside top of tents and a direct line charger for plugging into electrical outlets when not using batteries. And since the light sources are high efficiency LEDs, the battery life is going to be very good.  Well done and a slam dunk purchase, with no worries of buyers remorse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RY9P213IJ4KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN1LP1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2RY9P213IJ4KA","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SO SAD, that Amazon (who is generally the gold standard for honest retailing and fantastic customer service), does not more thoroughly screen the fragrances category of their offerings. There are many ""less expensive"" knock-offs of well known name brand fragrances, which have found their way into the Amazon marketplace. And the risk that Amazon customers run, is that if you discover that your fragrance differs from the authentic, which you might buy at full price at Dillard's or Macy's, etc, you can not return it for credit. You are stuck in the Amazon prohibition for fragrance returns. Just be aware, when the description at the top of the page for any fragrance says, ""In stock but may require and extra 1-2 days to ship"". This means that the fragrance is being provided by someone other than the original manufacturer or the original manufacturer's stocking distributor. It is taking the extra days because Amazon is relying on an outside source to fulfill the order, or getting it to Amazon for them to ship it. And Amazon obviously does not care to qualify their supplier's resources or the authenticity of the product that they are representing on their website. Extremely disappointing since I have relied on Amazon to be my ""protector"" over 15 loyal years of frequent purchases.Regarding Tommy Bahama Very Cool... I have been wearing this for 4 to 5 years and get endless comments from ladies on how wonderful it smells. I always receive comments, out of the blue... even from strangers in public. However, I recently ran low, almost exhausting a 2 year supply I had at home, only to find out that Tommy Bahama discontinued the fragrance. It is nowhere to be found on their website, as my first clue that it was no longer available. And in checking with Von Maur, Dillard's, and Macy's, they also confirmed it is no longer available, thus they do not carry it.However, I was momentarily delighted to find it on Amazon, only to be disappointed upon receipt. When it was in authentic production, it was being formulated by ""Viewpoint International"", who is clearly identified on the bottle and on the box, and it also had the distinctive oval cork cap. What is now being sold as TB Very Cool, is made by an alternate manufacturer ""5 Star Fragrances"", sporting a new cap which is a vertical plastic cylinder. IT IS NOT THE SAME FRAGRANCE . Obviously Tommy Bahama has farmed out its license to this alternate manufacturer, allowing them to use the TB name and fragrance name, so shame on them for tarnishing their brand. And shame on Amazon for displaying the deceptive pictures of the bottle with the cork cap, on the product description page, which is misleading to those who might be ""in the know"", and expecting to get the authentic versus the less impressive knockoff.The knock off fragrance is just ok, but does not have the subtle floral/citrus oil punch and longevity of the original. I sprayed the original on one wrist, in the morning and the knock off on the other, and then took a sniff at mid day and at days end. The original was still very much noticeable and  potent at days end, however the knock off had faded considerably by mid day. And the knock off, although somewhat similar in smell at first sniff, is definitely lacking what the original offered. And I have 5 daughters who have always raved about how great it smells (over the past several years), so I recently quizzed them as well, wearing the knock off, without explaining the background, and they offered that I did not smell the same as what I normally wear.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7T5IGF6A2XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VOLOPK#wasThisHelpful","RL7T5IGF6A2XV","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the definitive resource for trying to understand the impacts and ramifications of Medicare and all of the peripheral issues related to comprehensive coverage. As an all-encompassing treatise on Medicare, it is written in an easily digestible format, with common sense English, explaining everything you need to know about senior health care. The book is written by a Medicare expert at AARP, who has been analyzing Medicare for 14 years and has answered thousands of questions, since 2008, from Medicare beneficiaries, on the AARP website.Not only does it cover all aspects of Medicare, but also delves into supplemental insurance and how to evaluate different plans, in relation to the basic coverage provided by Uncle Sam. It touches on how to manage your health care costs, in order to reduce out of pocket expenses, when dealing with doctors and filling prescriptions.  I seriously doubt that there is a question, left unanswered as well as providing answers to questions you would not even think of, to ask. It covers all deadlines and explains the consequences for missing deadlines. I only wish that this book had been available before I turned 65, two years ago. It would have saved me money on premiums as well as guiding me into supplemental Medigap plans and Part D drug coverage, with governmental safeguards and requirements which protect against the whims of insurance carriers, if you enroll in those plans within the first 6 months that you are elligible for Medicare. After the 6 month window then you are at the mercy of what the underwriters can do to your policies. So much valuable information which cuts through all of the clutter of information that comes at you from all different directions. This is a ""must read"" prior to reaching Medicare age, if you want to have a clear understanding of your choices, in one single, concise, and comprehensive resource.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTS0ZVFFI26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118532783#wasThisHelpful","RFTS0ZVFFI26","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After purchasing one pair of the Melvin loafer, and wearing it for about a month, I decided to purchase 5 more pair in various colors for wardrobe matching and as backups, since you never know when a manufacturer is going to cease making something that might be your favorite. Without question, this is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, and is in a style which goes well with extremely casual, all the way up to business casual. Very versatile look. The memory foam insoles are like walking on marshmallow pillows. They also provide great arch support (I have high arches) and are so light weight, you hardly realize you are wearing a shoe. Wow. My feet have never been so pampered. Can't begin to describe how sensational they feel. I have also purchased Skechers Go Walk which are close, in comfort but tend to run a bit smaller than standard. But they are not quite as comfy as the Melvin. There are also some other Relaxed Fit models, such as their ""Dario"", ""Diamondback"", and ""Naven"" models, which are close in comfort but not quite as much as the Melvin (but even at that, these other models are still far more comfortable than the majority of competing brands). Overall, Skechers has created some of the most comfortable casual shoes over the last 15 years, that I have ever experienced. Anytime I run across a new model in shoe stores, I always try them on and have rarely been disappointed with their extremely comfortable casual shoes. Although, I have not tried any of their sneakers or athletic shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TF4GKTBJB2PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBT7CPK#wasThisHelpful","R2TF4GKTBJB2PO","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to this item due to the inflatable headboard, which is a very smart feature. I have often wished there were some way to prevent my pillow from falling off the front edge of the bed, with inflatables. This solves the problem very simply. And being 6'-2"", I was worried that this  would shorten the head to toe dimensions of the bed, which it did not. My feet did not hang over the foot of the bed. So, all in all, a great product. Caution....not a big deal, but since it has the inflatable head rest, you can not slip a fitted queen size sheet over the mattress, so we simply use the top sheet for a bottom sheet and wrap it around both sides and the foot of the bed. Another top sheet and blanket, finished it out. We slept comfortably on the bed.

"Dr. Mulhall is the world's leading expert in sexual medicine, as it relates to preserving male functions after radical prostatectemy (prostate removal for cancer). After my prostate removal in August 2013, I did a massive amount of online research regarding how best to get back to normal after the surgery, which will take 12 to 24 months. Prostate removal, universally results in the inability to achieve erection, due to nerve damage (even when the nerves are totally spared). It takes the nerves as much as 12 to 24 months to come back to life, in order to trigger normal sexual function, even though you have full sensitivity to touch, without any lapse, immediately after the surgery.An unforeseen problem arises for those who do not engage in penile rehabilitation, during this critical 12 to 24 month period of nerve healing. If erections are not instigated through intervention (as described in Dr. Mulhall's book...daily use of low dose Viagra or Cialis, or trimix injections), on a regular basis, starting about 6 weeks after surgery, then the cavernosa muscles in the penis, which the blood flows into, in order to ""inflate"" can be become damaged through lack of oxygen that accompanies engorgement from blood flow. Collagen deposits will form in the spongy tissue of this muscle and cause atrophy, over a period of time. Then when the nerves do come back to life, they are ineffective in causing an erection because the erection muscle has been damaged through inactivity.The only reason I knew about this critical post operative requirement is because I went to Houston to have my prostate removed, by one of the foremost surgeons in that situation. Dr. Brian Miles has performed over 5,000 of these surgeries over the past 20 years and he told me that it was critical to follow this protocol to keep myself in the best possible condition for the return of the nerve function. I discovered that every male has 2-3 nocturnal erections every night in their sleep. We may not be aware of them, but it is the male body's normal way of keeping that muscle oxygenated, which was a complete surprise to me. Clinical sleep studies measured a large number of test subjects, to discover this universal pattern. So Dr. Miles advised that stimulating at least one to two erections per week with the help of Viagra or Cialis and in conjunction with your partners help, if possible, is critical to maintaining the health of the membranes. Subsequent research on  my part, led me to Dr. Mulhall, who lectures to Urologist symposiums throughout the country (some of which can be seen on Youtube, under a keyword search of his name). I discovered that he had written this in depth book on the subject and purchased it to educate myself even further. There are no gimmicks here. This is a true medical professional, writing on a very critical subject, with the sole purpose of allowing yourself to get back to normal with the highest potential degree of success. The book covers every possible aspect of explaining how we function ""down there"", and what leads to erections, along with in depth education on the structure of the membranes and tissues which are affected and what they will respond to, in order to overcome erectile dysfunction.AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ FOR EVERY MAN THAT GOES THROUGH PROSTATE REMOVAL.12/5/14 UPDATE. I am happy to report that, approximately 9 to 10 months after the surgery, my system started to awaken without the use of Viagra or Cialis and am delighted that one year after the surgery (following the book's advice) that I am totally back to normal and able to maintain full erections, as I had before the surgery. Thank you Dr. Mulhall and my surgeon in Houston, who brought this critical post op regimen to my attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FQZJTHE1UMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0980064961#wasThisHelpful","R24FQZJTHE1UMF","A3LSFJ32QJZVLR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LSFJ32QJZVLR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a jewel of a lantern. Small package with fantastic light output. Undoubtedly, due to the design of the lens enclosure around the extremely ""low power drain"" LED bulbs. I have paid three times this much for larger LED lanterns that put out a dismal amount of light, in comparison. This one gives off an even and very bright glow, capable of filling an entire room with light. We bought 4 of them to place in various areas of the rooms in our cabin, to allow spontaneous switching on and off to navigate during the night without waking others. Inside a tent, you can easily read with one nearby. It can radiate 360 degrees or there is an optional ""slide up"" shield on the backside if you want to turn the lantern so the light does not interfere with your eyesight while illuminating the entire area that you place it in. Also has a flip out hook to hang it wherever desired. Truly a great value with superb illumination.

"3.5 STARS**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I am going to start out with why this book is getting the 3.5 stars when I really didn't care for it until the end. I think Blake redeemed himself when he finally fully opened up. I think the secrets of his past gave him a bit of a pass to be the man he was, but it doesn't justify all of his actions in my eyes. It just helps better understand where he is coming from. I think if I would have been able to read his POV instead of just Lila's this book would have been better for me.But...As it stands this book just didn't do it for me. I really didn't connect with Lila at all. Her characters didn't ever just grab me and make me feel for her, other than at the beginning of book one before she through her life into a tailspin of emotion. I couldn't stand all of her choices and then I couldn't understand her justification of those choices. I hated the way she treated Pierce even though she didn't really do it intentionally, but she did it not once but twice. I am neither fan or foe of insta-love, if it's written well I can get on board, kind of the same with a love triangle. But after this book I am ""on a break"" (like Ross and Rachel) with insta-love and the love triangle.There were too many mixed emotions, rash decisions and push & pull with everything in this book. The pace seemed to be slow and then speed up when somethings could and should have been elaborated on to help better connect with the story and the characters.In the end this book just wasn't my cup of tea, although the last few lines of this book did intrigue me as to ""who"" it might be ;)I leave it here. This wasn't a must read for, but you know that saying ""another mans trash is another man treasure"", this book could be your favorite of all time. But you do have to read book one Lies Unspoken before reading Love Unspoken.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOI6MTGGOII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SS6O7A#wasThisHelpful","R1QOI6MTGGOII","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 STARSSo, Lila pretty much got the shock of her life when her fiancé called off their wedding the day of her final dress fitting. She ignored all the signs that they had been drifting and it came as a shock to her when he gave his honesty. So, she decided to finally follow her dreams and move to Chicago.When we first meet Lila she is a bit of a broken mess, but I did admire her drive to start over in a new city to far away from home. She gained my respect when she went out and found herself a waitressing job on her first day in town in a crappy place because she needed a job. I liked that she made friends with the people around her and that she even allowed herself the opportunity to move on with her life after Derek. I like that she made the effort to better herself personally and professionally.But...By the end of this book I think that I lost a bit of respect for her.When she meets Pierce Stanley I was pretty sure that this guys should be the one that she focuses on, but nope. She falls for her friends moody and tortured brother. I hated that she fell for him so easily and so effortlessly. It made her lose a bit of herself and I lost that connection with her. The connection though really wasn't all that strong to begin with. I think her character could have been a bit more developed with out Blake's presence consuming so much of her. I felt like once they became what they did that she changed and not for the better. She allowed him to treat her like crap and it wasn't beneficial enough for my liking. I really like the way the end of this book was going but then it fell off for me.I guess I am unsure about how I feel with this story and the characters. I guess Lila's story isn't one that I have fully connected with. It feels like she is too naive at times and too wrapped up in Blake, who in my opinion hasn't fully redeemed himself for me.I am currently reading book two and I am liking the way it has started, but I'm not sure about where it appears to be leading.To be continued with LOVE UNSPOKEN...","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBJVK9YY90KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVBEKQ8#wasThisHelpful","RVBJVK9YY90KF","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**Lately I have found myself drawn to the religious cult fiction books and this book was a pretty good read. It didn't really focus to much on the religious cult aspect, but it did focus on the darker depravity that usually goes along with the religious cult reads.At times I felt like I just couldn't get on board with some of the things that were done with this storyline between Candace and Ivan, but I guess it ultimately worked for them, just not for me. I am not going to give them away but I do wish that revelations would have come sooner and that the two main characters would have had a little bit more to their ending.The storyline has a pretty consistent flow but at times it was a bit repetitive or at least the characters actions. I did like that she eventually did it for the right reasons and that it eventually worked out for her and for Ivan.This is a good religious/cult fiction read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GB1DL132DJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R17GB1DL132DJF","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I LOVE BEAU! That is all... okay seriously though...River Savage has done it again and she has continued to keep me coming back for more with this series. This is definitely in the TOP 3 of my favorite MC Series' reads.I have been waiting for Beau's story since pretty much book one. I have been waiting for him to be knocked on his ass by love and lead around by his balls by his woman and boy was he ever. Now, we all know (if you read the previous books) that Beau likes to partake in some pretty sexy kink, well let me say that Beau does not disappoint in that area. But I will also say that he stole my heart with his sweet and caring nature when it came to Kenzie.Mackenzie, we met her briefly in book two when she is ran through the the safe house and is saved from her abusive ex. I knew then that this little broken woman would be Beau's weakness and I could not wait for her to heal and find herself. All she needed was to be able to feel safe and comfortable in her own skin to be able to come out of her shell and Beau and the club did that for her.Some pretty heavy stuff happens in this book regarding the ""other side"" of things for the club and even with Beau and Kenzie, but it made for such an amazing read and it is exactly what their story needed for them to move forward. I hate though that some people get hurt along the way and are still hurting when the end of this book comes around, but I know that their story will make for a good read also.This is by far one of my favorite MC reads that keeps me coming back and I look forward to more of the Knights Rebels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JELWZEIQHZPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BHRN4W#wasThisHelpful","R1JELWZEIQHZPW","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 DARK and BAD ASS STARS!!!**ARC for an honest review**Tillie Cole is fast becoming one of my favorite Dark Romance Authors. She definitely knows how to spin one dark and depraved tale and this might just be one of my favorite of hers yet...well not really because off of her books (that I have read) are all on my favorite list.Okay, let me get to the RAZE. WOW!!! There are so many twists in this book. You kind of get the feel of where it is heading and who RAZE really is to the Bratva family that Kisa was born into, but until it is confirmed and all things come out into the open you are just holding your breath. Waiting to see if all things will come full circle.Kisa is the Bratva kings daughter. She has suffered through the death of her brother and mother and the loss of her soul mate, Luka. She is just living her role as the next Bratva King's fiancé, Alik Durov. He is one dark and sadistic man. I hated him from the first chapter told in Kisa's POV. I knew that there would be nothing redeeming about his character...ever. On a night that Kisa is helping the church she is assaulted and is scared for her life when a large man comes from the shadows and saves her. She doesn't know why, but there is something about this man that the feels the need to know him.RAZE aka 818. He has spent most of his life in the gulag, a prison where he is forced to either fight to kill or be killed. He has no memory of who he is, where he is from or why he is there. He does however know the name and location of the person responsible for his being in HELL. He escapes his hell and is on his way to exact his revenge.Raze is one scary dude. He is huge, all muscle and no humanity. I had trouble seeing how this man turned monster would come back from his hell, but the author did a wonderful job. Kisa and Raze had such a unexplained connection, but when it all comes out it is oh so good. This book is a must read...especially if you love the dark romance, especially if you love hot fighters and most especially if you love male leads that will make you swoon and shiver. Raze's character is so well written. I loved him throughout this whole book. I loved Kisa too...one thing I would have changed is her willingness to comply to her crazy fiancé and her Papa. I would have liked her to be more rebellious, but at the same time I loved her sweet character and I am glad that she did eventually become a tad rebellious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPTDBHRQVMCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5LEI#wasThisHelpful","R1PPTDBHRQVMCW","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I loved me some Dirty English. That Declan Blay is what most fantasies involving accented men are made of. He is strong, smart, intense and oh so sexy. I loved him right off the bat and I really loved that his book includes his POV. It really helped to connect with his character and to understand him more.So, this book starts off pretty much in the middle of any woman's worst nightmare. I hate that Elizabeth went through something so tragic at such a young age and that it left her jaded. Most of all I hate that she blamed herself and that she let it dictate the next few years of her life. When we meet her in the present she lives her life by her set of rules and she mostly sticks to herself, well that doesn't last long. Slowly and surely Dirty English himself as well as his brother Dax weasel their way into her life and slowly she realized there is more to life that just getting by with her rules.Now there isn't a love triangle in this story by any means, there are some misguided decisions but those are easy to get over once everything is out on the table. Dax is Declan's twin brother, yes twin brother, but he does nothing for Elizabeth once she sets eyes on Declan, Mr. Dirty English himself.I liked both characters personalities and I really liked the way both of the grew over the course of this book. They are so much alike and so well suited of each other. I also loved all the secondary characters too, they too are well developed and make the story better as it progresses, even the ones you want to slap in the face or maybe get shabby with in a dark alley.The storyline of this book flows pretty steady and never really stagnates and makes you lose interest. I couldn't sit and read this in one sitting, but every time that I had to put it down I couldn't wait to pick it back up. A lot of things are going on in this storyline with both characters and I love the way the author flawlessly ties them all up. I like that there aren't any strings left frayed and flapping. I really liked the ending of this book and how both characters really changed over the course of the book. That they both needed each other to really become who they were meant to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SKO4EA6GMFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R38SKO4EA6GMFM","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kentucky on the Rocks by Gwendolyn Grace Review4.5 STARS**I beta read this novella*This was quick and sexy read. I liked the two characters and Gwendolyn's ability to make me connect with them in such short story. I admired that Josette took a stand with her long time, not ready to commit, boyfriend Derek. I liked that she was ready to move forward with her life and move on from all the emotional push and pull that her relationship with Derek caused.I loved the way that Aidan and Josette meet and I like that he made something that should only take a few hours span over the course of a few days, just so he could see her more. I also liked that he knew what he wanted and he was going to get it. I loved that the start to their relationship outside of customer and vendor, started because Aidan volunteered to help her with her writing assignment.I really enjoyed how these two go to know each other and the pace and flow of this book really worked well for the novella style.

"This what a great addition to Malcolm and Rachel's story. I loved that after all the drama of the past was cleared up a bit and the effort that they both put into getting to know each other again made for a good reads.At times I felt that some things fell a little flat and predictable, but I did enjoy the different sides of Saint and that more of his vulnerable side showed. I also loved that Rachel learned for her mistakes and was always honest the second time around. The two of them together are really a sweet but totally sexy couple. I also loved Rachel started to take cues for Saint and ignore what others thought of their relationship, mostly the public. I also like that Saint made a stand for them with his friends and with the public by his actions.I enjoyed spending a little more time with both of these characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRN6PJ7LPRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SP33XEY#wasThisHelpful","R1YRN6PJ7LPRS","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"5 EMOTIONALLY SINFUL STARS**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This book is by far my most favorite of Penelope Wards, ever. I think I have said that about each and every book that I have read, but this one takes the cake. It is filled with so much more than I thought it would be and it definitely surpassed all of my expectations going into it.This book contains so much emotion right from the start. It is just packed with so much that I don't even want to mention because I do not want to give any spoilers. But I will say that I am in love with Sevin Montgomery. I will say that he is so much more than the man we meet at the beginning got this book. I will say that it has been awhile since I have connected so fully with a male character and he takes the cake.As I write this review, I am still reeling a bit from the ending of this book. I can still feel the lump that was lodged there pretty much the entire second half. I am still going through everything that happened and still processing it and keep loving this book more and more.This book is definitely one of my most favorite reads of 2015 and I can pretty much feel the book hangover coming on.If you are a Penelope Ward fan then this is a MUST READ. If you have never read a Penelope Ward book before, then this is a MUST READ. If you have never read a book before, but love an emotional and satisfying story then this a MUST READ. So, in my honest opinion Sins of Sevin is a MUST READ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GA3TABE6LOSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1PULU#wasThisHelpful","R2GA3TABE6LOSP","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 STARS**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This MC book was a pretty good reads, but it was predictable. I could see some of the things coming from a mile away.I did like the characters Cami and Gauge though and I really enjoyed getting to see their relationship grow from the beginning. Of course there were some obstacles in their way that caused a lot of tension and grief, but I guess that all comes with any relationship. I also liked that Cami eventually found herself again, but I thought her situation with Nathaniel could have been more expanded on. I would have liked a little more grit to their relationship, especially since some of the things she did to cope. I just didn't complete feel that whole situation and it all just ended way to easy.At times I thought that things could have been developed a little bit more and not just thrown out their without any warning or hint before hand. It happened a couple of times with pretty big things in the storyline, but it didn't really take away from the story it actually helped to where it was going overall.There were a few inconsistencies that I was able to overlook seeing as it was an ARC, but there were quite a few things that even for an ARC that distracted. A sentence just ended right in the middle and a lot of missing words or a word in place that didn't make sense for the sentence.Now, I loved the ending of this book. The last few chapters really made me like this story and the characters. Although it really didn't hook me like I would have liked.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AU290NQ4GSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XLV2NA#wasThisHelpful","R13AU290NQ4GSL","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This was a quick sweet read, but I just did't really connect with the characters completely. I did like the crazy aunts and the crazy beach town of Pelican Key Cove, but there just was never that spark between me an the characters.There also wasn't enough of Luke and Ginny for me. I would have like to see more of them together, but I did like that the storyline did revolve around the whole wedding planning and reality tv show. Although I did think it overtook the storyline and didn't really leave much room for the actual love connection for Luke and Ginny.Now, don't get me wrong the times they were together were good, but I just never had that feeling where I loved them together. I wanted that overwhelming feeling of second chance love, but it never happened for me.Don't get me wrong there are plenty of great parts of this book. Especially when Ginny finally realized that there is more to life than just making sure a wedding goes off without a hitch. That she finally decides to put the feelings of others first. I really like that part of the storyline. I also enjoyed her reconnecting with her old friend, Jules and making new friends in Marcie and Pixie. Even though most of the time I wanted to wring both Ginny and Marcie's neck for always making it about the show or the ""I do"" they really did redeem themselves by the end.The ending of this book was really sweet and left a smile on my face.

"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**Another great book in this series. I love that in this book that we get both Brooke and Masons POV and I am so happy that Mason did get his POV. I LOVED him and his accent back in Alabama and I now I love him even more.Mason is truly that perfect mix of sweet and oh so sexy. I love his sweet and caring side. I love that he didn't just want what Brooke was offering and I loved that he wasn't scared to ask for more. His personality really endeared him to me. Now, let me talk about his dirty sexy mouth. Wow! That man sure could spout the filthiest of things that would make even the filthiest of women blush and boy did he make Brooke blush on a number or occasions.Brooke, we met her in the previous books, when we saw that Dylan didn't really want to hire her and Joey hated her. But we also got to see her start to find herself and go through some changes. Well, this book really opens her up. We really get to see Brooke for who she is and who she eventually becomes. I love that all it takes for her to open up is a sexy, dirty talking yoga instructed.I really loved how their relationship starts and unfolds. I like that no matter how hard she tried, Brooke just couldn't break Mason, even though I know he struggled with it. I like that their relationship grew according to what Mason wanted and that eventually without realizing it Brooke began to want it to. The way that their relationship progressed was something that I really enjoyed. It felt real between them.Another great book from J. Daniels.P.S.

"**I had the opportunity to BETA read this book**I am not going to give anything away because there are something's that just need to be found out on your own.Kennedy and Grayson met at a young age and both grew up in less than great lives...heck their lives were less than period. But they had each other...until they didn't.Things happened, lines crossed, friendships left behind and lives definitely changed. For Grayson it was fame and fortune. For Kennedy it was a great loss and living a comfortable life in a small town.When their paths cross again and secrets are revealed things really start to escalate. This book was a really emotional read for me. It was hard for me not to get choked up when all the secrets finally come to light.I felt so terrible for both Grayson and Kennedy. I hated that they both had to come to grips with some something so heavy when they are reunited. But I do love that after the eventual shock of it being revealed and after the anger dissipated that both of them leaned on each other. I like the determination that Grayson had to be more in the know. I like all of his actions even his anger because it was real. I loved that Kennedy stepped up and helped Grayson however she could even though it wore her up. I really liked the support that they had with their friends.The end of this book blew me away.

"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This is my first M. Robinson book and I am blown away. She had me hooked from the prologue and I was hanging on every word until the end. She did an amazing job making me connect to all of these characters, not just Lucas and Alex. I loved that this book follows their ENTIRE story. That it doesn't skim over all the ugly less flattering parts, everything is out there laid bare and I could feel every emotion Lucas and Alex experienced throughout their lives.Some parts of this story I hated...absolutely loathed...I wanted to close my eyes a look away and pretend that it wasn't about to happen or happening. But I just couldn't I had to keep reading. I had to feel everything that Alex and Lucas felt, because it was so consuming. There are so many emotions in this book. So many heart aches and heart breaks. So many happy times and so many sad times. This book has it all and it won me over completely.I didn't know how I would like the timeline of this book after the prologue, but this book couldn't have been written any other way. There was no other way to tell Half-Pint and Bo's story, it had to be from the beginning. Their story started out so young, but even then you could feel the strength of their bond. You could feel the magnitude of what they meant to each other. Sometimes they gave in to their urges and other times they handled them poorly, but it all had to play out the way it was supposed. The way that would lead them to their path.It wasn't easy for them and at times I was sure that it was impossible. That too much happened for them to be able to move forward and strengthen their bond, but if things happened any differently I don't think their story would have been half as special.I am really excited for more from this author and definitely more of this series. This is a MUST read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJC1WQP8U8JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BUC1YG#wasThisHelpful","R3JJC1WQP8U8JO","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This book had me second guessing how everything would turn out. I just could not seem to predict what would happen. So many twists and turns in this book and it made for an excellent end of sorts to Jackson and Anna's tale.This series got so much better for me from the start to finish. At the beginning I was a little annoyed with Anna's less than strong character, but she is the only female lead that would have complimented Jackson so well. This book really made me love and hate Jackson. I was so worried about him losing himself, but Anna seemed to be the only thing that kept him grounded. Don't get me wrong there were plenty of times that I wanted to reach through my kindle and smack the ever loving crap out of him, but he ultimately redeemed himself.As mention, but defiantly not spoiled, there are so many new things brought into the picture of this book. So many more characters have stronger rolls in the storyline and I really would like to get their stories too, I am hoping that LA Cotton was leading up that. Well, I know of at least one character that will be making a come back and I am oh so ready for that.A lot of things closed up and sealed tight in this story. I loved that, even though it was drawn out into three book, Jackson and Anna's story needed those three book to get the full scope. A lot of things happened that I didn't see coming, but it made so much more sense. Other things I hated had to happen, but it made for a fantastic story.This book is definitely a great addition to the Chastity Falls Series. I am definitely looking forward to more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3AEBZX93TW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132ONGII#wasThisHelpful","RF3AEBZX93TW7","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.** Well, what an amazing end to this series. I fell in love with Blake in Erica right from the beginning and even though their story hasn't been easy it is definitely one of my favorites.This book in The Hacker Series really cemented this series as one of my favorites. I love that Blake and Erica's love saved them both so much. I like that Erica kept to who she really is at heart and fought for Blake when he though all was lost. So many things in this book helped close the doors that were left wide open in the other books.People were dealt with and some people redeemed themselves even if just the slightest bit. Loose ends were tied up, relationships solidified and friendships grew. I loved every moment of this book. It really stayed true to the rest of the series, being that there wasn't a lack of sweet, sexy and even suspense. So many things come to light and so many things are handled that I did not think that this would be the last of it, but Meredith Wild really closed this up nicely.I don't want to give anything away because if you are a fan of this series like I am you will want to discover it for your self. I am sad to see the end of this but it was such a great ending that I am very much satisfied with it.This is a MUST read series...every book is a MUST read!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNXVJLV9TKSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W22ITCU#wasThisHelpful","RMNXVJLV9TKSP","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received and ARC for an honest review.**Well, I can honestly say that Guinevere redeemed herself in my eyes. There was a time that I was so disappointed in her and maybe even  little bit hated he, but this book definitely turned it around. Put things in perspective for me even though I still hate some of the things that happened along the way.I'm not going to give away the ending but I will say that it could not have ended any better...at least in my opinion. Guinie definitely went through some trials in this book, but I think she came out a stronger and definitely more respectable person. I like that the strength that she showed in book one makes a reappearance in this book. I loved that she eventually realized that she needed to be the one to let go in order for her to move on and forward and to find herself, ←not a spoiler.In this book I think I am a whole lot mad and a whole lot disappointed with Arturo and it is all because of the choices he made. They not only hurt him but they hurt everyone that he considered family. I hated that all of his family (the bad and Guinie) suffered because he wasn't strong enough to face what happened. I also hated his choices that made things so much more difficult for him and Guinie to try and reconcile.I can sit here all day and list the things that I loved and hated about this book and the truth of Arturo King, but the fact is I loved the way everything happened. It all falls into place and it all had to happen the way it did for this series to keep me interested. There isn't one thing that I would change that happened along the way because it made each character stronger individually and then it made them stronger for their partners. This was a fantastic end of this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VBFMSRL9KLAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151WRMXY#wasThisHelpful","R3VBFMSRL9KLAU","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I vow that this a 5 STAR READ!!!**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This is most definitely one of my most favorites of 2015. I LOVED this book!Mia Sheridan does an amazing job with this story. I felt the heartache and pain as well and the happiness and love. She makes sure that everything gets it ending and leaves no stone unturned. She has an amazing way with word that draws you into the story and it's characters. Her characters are so well written and easy to love or hate.Grayson Hawthorn is kind of an ass, but he his an ass that will still make you swoon and root for him. I couldn't help but fall completely and utter in love with him. Although there were times when I wanted to reach into my kindle and smack him around a bit, but after getting into his head and knowing his full story you can help but understand him and the reason he guarded his heart. When all of the truths finally come out and everything is laid bare, I think I fell in love Grayson a little bit more.So, when Kira is concocting her plan I really didn't see it coming. I though about quite a few things that she could possibly proposed to Grayson to help each other out, but what she actually did was ballsy and after getting to know her totally made sense. I loved her personality the more I got to know her. Especially after knowing her past and relating it to the person she became. She is such a genuine and loving person. I loved that not only did she want to make Grayson's life a little bit better, but she made everyone's lives better in the process.Her coming into his life allowed him to open up as well as the people around him. I loved all of their interactions even the ones that broke my heart, but I loved that they both started to trust each other enough to open up. I really liked when Kira brought out a side of Grayson that had never been present. I loved that her presence made slowly brought him back to life and let him start to mend the scars of his past. Of course there had to be some pretty awful things have to happen before the mending could begin. And this awful things just about gutted me.This is a MUST READ!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DVNGPBTX5EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","R29DVNGPBTX5EW","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**It's no secret that I LOVE to read. So, the fact that I get to read a book that is about something very similar to my life is pretty cool. I like the behind the scenes feel of this book. I love that and author wrote a book about an author and there is so much of the indie community in the book. I like all the added touches with Facebook, private messages, street teams etc.So, in book one Behind the Lens we met Blake and his mut-self. Even though he pissed me off with all he mutty stuff that he did in book one he totally redeemed himself in this book, big time. I was so hooked on his character in this book. I loved his honesty and the way he changed so drastically because he finally found someone worth changing for. Although he was still his same smart butt self, he was no long a mut.Enter London...London is an author...pretty cool huh? An indie author writing about an indie author, who just happens to get to know the model of her latest book a little too well. I loved the start of their relationship, but I quickly hated it when London did her Houdini act and left Blake high and dry. I guess he kind of had it coming to him, you know Karma and all. Anyway, I really liked London after she started remember who she was before. Before the really crappy situation in her life that sent her running to California in the first place. I loved that when she finally starting living again, that it was Blake that was making her love life again. I liked that she was opening up herself to new friends and experiences, although she did remain closed off about her past, but I can't blame her for that. I would want to forget also. Blake was so patient with her and that really endeared him to me more.So, of course there is a big bad scene in this book, but I won't say what it is..you will just have to read and find out. But I will say that Blake handled fantastically and pretty bad ass might I add. I especially loved the after.We get a little bit more of Kallie and Jax in this book as wells as  Brody, loved that Brody's story got expanded on a bit. At the end of this book there is a nice glimpse into the next book that has left me really curious as to what is going to happen next in this series.I enjoy this series and the characters. I like that the author writes them in a way that I can connect with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JP0MX8KFD20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014V1A8DM#wasThisHelpful","R1JP0MX8KFD20","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**Another great addition to this series. I absolutely fell in love with Jake right off the bat. Talk about swoon.I knew Lana as Tate's sister in book 2 of the Try Again series and I was very curious to know her story. I knew that it had to be something pretty dark considering to small tidbits we got in Whatever You Do. Even though Lana has had a not so pleasant past she doesn't let it affect her in her life ""after"". That is what I loved most about her. That even though she is going through a pretty tough time, with getting over her past and then to be carried from her home in the middle of the night by a complete stranger because your home has just gone up in flames, she is still really well adjusted. Well, minus her fear of everyone eventually being taken from her.Jake...oh that Jake. I loved him from he beginning. I loved being inside his head and getting every single one of his thoughts, they were some really good thoughts. I loved his open, loyal and honest, well mostly honest, character. Even though he was hiding a secret from Lana, it didn't make me like him any less because of the part of his character that he was holding in tact. I really liked that about him. Also I loved that he was such a wonderful father. Being a single parent has to be hard on anyone, but Jake handles it so well. I loved that the most about his character. I also loved that he was just the sweetest man ever.So, by now you have figured out that Jake has a child, a daughter, Hallie. She is one of the best parts of this book. She is so sweet, well adjusted and funny as hell. I loved all of the ""Hallie Tales"". She was definitely a nice addition to this story. Her straight forward nature added much needed comedic relief at all the right times. I laughed out loud many times during this read.If you haven't read any of the Try Again series you should definitely pick up some one, two or all of these books. They are emotional, sweet, loving and pretty dang sexy too. All can be read as stand alone, but the characters are all friends so it is nice to keep getting little pieces of the other couples after their books have ended.This is a MUST read series in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZNXQKOX7H9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SCK30W#wasThisHelpful","R2YZNXQKOX7H9D","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**Another great book in the Kill Devil Hills series by Sarah Darlington. So, far I have enjoyed each book more than the previous one and this one is no different.I loved Rhett!He isn't at all like I assumed him to be from the previous to books. Nothing. Well, okay so he was indeed a manwhore, BUT that all stopped when he met (or met again) Sydney. I liked that we get his POV in this because it really made me fall in love with him. He is truly a great guy with just a few insecurities but he does an excellent job working through them.So, Sydney is not at all like she appears in the first two books either. Nothing. I though I was not going to like her because of the way she seemed in those books but the author did a really good job of clearing up all of the past appearances Sydney made in this series. I will admit that from the past appearances, Sydney seemed like a bit of beyotch, but she is not at all one. She is very different and it a good way. I also like that when it comes to Rhett she always is honest with him and that she does stand up for him when it matters.One of the things that I really liked is that this book runs parallel to the rest of the book. It truly starts at the beginning and we get to see the relationship between Rhett and Sydney from the very start and I mean the very beginning. I like that it doesn't pick up after the LA trip and then go from there because it really helped me get to know Sydney and Rhett and it made me love them and their relationship so much more.If you are looking for a sweet feel good read then this is your book. I really enjoyed it and I am hoping that there is more of this series, particularly Ben's story and I wouldn't mind more of the rest of the Kill Devil Hills gang either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RU2IYUNAHRCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131LV6KW#wasThisHelpful","R2RU2IYUNAHRCW","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**What a nice surprise Where We Belong was. I loved this addition to Ben and Mia's story and to get another glimpse into their lives after they started their HEA.So, things aren't always as easy as Ben and Mia thought they would be. After the scare of their lives in book three and then adjusting to life with two kids, they learn that making time for themselves is a bit tricky. There isn't always the right time and things aren't always going to be convenient. This biggest adjustment was learning that their naughty time will be interrupted as long as Nolan and Chase are anywhere around.Even though they are adjusting and growing through the growing pains of a growing family, they are both still very much in love with each other and they make the time to let each other know. Even though they are frustrated with Ben's ever changing schedule and from being denied sexual gratification, they always talk openly with each other. I fell in love with Ben Kelly a little bit more in this little book, because he got even better and sexier. Mia even grew and marital life and motherhood agree with her.They have a bit of a tense situation involving Angie, Nolan's birth mother, but that situation is handles so well and I felt the relief of that situation when it was over. There are also some other things that are going on with Ben and Mia as well as some of the other characters that I love and I can not wait for more of this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUPRGSX71UEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145COWD4#wasThisHelpful","R1KUPRGSX71UEP","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received a copy from the author for an honest review.**And another MC romance makes it to my growing list of great MC reads. Kings of Korruption is now on my list to keep an eye out for. The author did a wonderful job keeping to the MC feel as well as keeping to the characters true natures. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters in Ryker, all of them, all of the guys in the MC were written well also and made me very curious about their stories and wanting more of them also.I especially loved Charlotte. She is an amazingly loving and genuinely sweet person, but she is also a bit of a feisty live wire with a bit of a naughty side. Well, Ryker really brings out her naughty side and I don't blame her one bit. I think he would bring out anyones naughty side. Okay all of that aside I really loved Charlotte. I liked that even though her sister was a major pain the the butt she still stuck by her. I liked that even though she had to grow up at such a young age and basically take responsibility for her sister she still did not turn out jaded. I also really like that she took the experience that she went through in her teens and turned that into a career. That she genuinely wanted to be there for others in their time of need. I really loved everything about her character. I mean LOVED her.Ryker...well Ryker is definitely all biker and definitely what naughty biker dreams are made of, but he is also so much more. Charlotte definitely brings out a whole different side to him. He doesn't think that he can have someone in his life. He doesn't want to risk them getting hurt by his life choice of being in an MC. But I love who Charlotte puts things in perspective for him. I love that all it takes are a few words from her perspective to make him change how he looked at things. I really enjoyed both of them together and I really enjoyed their characters separately.The storyline of this book is really great. I liked that the MC feel is there with the gritty and gory details. I like that even though it is MC book that there is still things outside of the MC that are introduced into the book. I really liked that it starts out outside of the MC and it starts with Charlotte and it also gives a bit of her backstory. The flow and pace of this book is great. I like that things are constantly moving forward and it all things introduced into the book were all addressed and found their endings. Even if they weren't pretty. This book also had some moments where I got choked up and got teary eyed and I wasn't expecting that at all. It definitely has it all. It is well written and I will definitely be reading more of the Kings of Korruption by Geri Glenn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3577KRUWZMWTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010N4H726#wasThisHelpful","R3577KRUWZMWTP","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received and ARC via NetGalley for an honest review.**I absolutely loved that this book is told entirely from Jake Beckers POV and what an awesome perspective it was. Even though we don't get any of Chelsea's POV I fell in love with her all the same.She is one amazingly strong and wonderful person. At twenty six she becomes the legal guardians of her six nieces and nephews. As a mother of three I can only imagine the trouble with double. She handles it so well and she is so great with the kids. I loved everything about her and her relationship with the children. She really won me over with her personality and the way she interacted with both the kids and Jake.When we first met Jake you can tell he is lying the ultimate bachelor life...bachelor pad...anonymous hookups...sexy...honest even if it hurts...and in no way about to make any woman believe he is capable of ""more"". That is until he has an unexpected visitor, a barley memorable hookup that makes him look at things a bit differently. I loved those couple of agonizing weeks for him because he definitely got the meaning of ""reap what you sow"". After he decides to turn over a new leaf he runs into someone that is going to inevitably change his outlook. I really loved that pocket picking incident and the fact that Jake saw himself. From there things start to progress pretty quickly.Jakes life begins to change for the better. His world is no longer that of single man always looking for a hookup but it consists of becoming part of the McQuaid family even if he is a little slow on the take. I loved every moment of him changing and becoming attached to the McQuaid kids and their aunt. I didn't care for how he kept trying to pull away because it was so much more than pulling away from Chelsea...the kids also felt left behind. But I did admire him staying apart of their lives even if he was trying to be ""just friends"" with Chelsea.I really enjoyed this authors writing style and the flow of this story. I liked the character development and the way she made me fall in love with all of the kids as well as Jake and Chelsea. I loved and of the emotional tension and sexual tension in this storyline and boy was the sexual tension so delicious. Overall I really enjoyed this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16283F06ENGNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R16283F06ENGNX","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I am in love with Joshua Hayes!!!! I was so ready and curious about his story. I wanted to know if he had something looming in his past, but he didn't. Well, just his promiscuous ways, but those were quickly done away with when he started to feel something for Arden.Arden had lived a terrible life before she had her daughter and met the fold of Willow Creek. Luckily she was able to get out of her toxic life, although it was not in the usual way...that should have been a dead giveaway that things were far from over. I loved Arden role as a mother. She put her daughter first always and I really loved that about her. I also loved that while trying to fight her attraction to Hayes because she should put her daughter first, she found that he too was including her daughter in all things. I loved that during this whole book Mia is never left out of anything. Things revolve around her and all of Hayes and Arden's decisions are made with Mia in mind.Now of course this wouldn't be an amazing read without some sort of drama that happens and guts you..well let me tell you I was gutted. I hated that Hayes, Arden and Mia had to go through such a horrible ordeal, but it made their bond so much stronger. I liked that Arden didn't push Hayes away, she did lash out, but she needed him to keep her together. I also love how Hayes finally broke when things were finally resolved..well partially resolved. I definitely teared up a few times with this book.I am a huge fan of this series. Probably one of the best crossover from YA to NA rocker series there is. I LOVED every book and all of the characters and their stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BD4I3EV04B53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149QJBIM#wasThisHelpful","R2BD4I3EV04B53","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**These two authors teamed up and gave us one amazing read. I love all things Penelope Ward and I loved what I have read by Vi Keeland, but this book I absolutely LOVED and I really would like them to do more together.I loved Aubrey and I loved Chance right from the start. I liked that their story starts immediately and that we get to go through their tale with not one but both of them. The first part of this book is told in Aubrey's POV and and it gives that story of how them meet and how their relationship/friendship starts. I love all of the things that they do together and all of the new things that Chance shows Aubrey. I especially love that he awakens a new part of her that she didn't exactly know about herself. I loved both of their personalities and the way that Chance really brought Aubrey out of her shell. I will admit though that at one point I was not a fan of Chance even with his really good looks and awesome personality...oh and that accent...but ultimately he did redeem himself.Part two is told in Chance's POV and I fell in love with him so much more after getting his story from his perspective. He is so much more than the Cocky Bass turd (<had to keep it clean) that we first meet. Even though he takes up a bit of an unconventional approach to winning Aubrey back I still fell extremely hard for his character. He isn't your typical manwhore...even though he totally could be...he is so much more. I love that he waits for Aubrey and that he is dead set on getting her back and making things real.What I loved most about this story is that is kept close to Chance and Aubrey. There weren't  too many other outside things going on to distract from their story and the ultimate goal. There definitely was a good amount of tension and some emotional stuff going on that made me hold my breath and hope for the best, but I really enjoyed the flow and pace of this book so much. I like that everything happens in a seemingly realistic fashion and that there isn't the instantly resolved problems. I just really enjoyed this book.I really hope that these two authors will collaborate more in the future and gives more books like this one or even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXAWRYZ398SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014005B72#wasThisHelpful","RVXAWRYZ398SM","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 STARS**I received an ARC for an honest review.**What a fantastic end to King and Does story. There were so many things that I just didn't see coming. The author does a fantastic job twisting all the parts of this story and keeping you in your toes. Characters that you thought you would love are characters that you will end up hating with a vengeance and when they get what's coming to them you will most definitely have a smile on your face. Characters that you thought you would hate and loathe redeem themselves in the final pages of this book.They are shocking twists and heartwarming surprises but it is all done and kept true to the feel of this book. Some parts made me cringe and grit my teeth. Some parts made my heart melt and some parts are just down right naughty and sexy.I loved that I fell in love with both King and Doe all over again. I also fell in love with Sammy and Max and the people that Doe and King became because of them. There were a lot of revelations  in this book that helped both characters grow and become better than they were in book one.Overall I really enjoyed this book and King and Doe's story. I am excited for more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE26ULVY4Q3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGEWUWQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GE26ULVY4Q3C","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This is by far my most favorite book in the Hades Hangmen series. I didn't think that it would be possible to top Styx and Ky and their old ladies, but HOLY FLAMING HADES HANGMEN, I am in LOVE with Flame.What a terribly broken couple Maddie and Flame make. I didn't think that Flame's story could be any worse than the horrors of Maddie's past, but I was so so wrong. Flame's story is so heart wrenching and so terribly horrific. I could not believe the things that he suffered in his childhood to make him into the person he is, but I loved that Maddie is the only one that could get through to him. To save him. To claim him. Especially when he spent most of his life feeling like he was wanted by no one and that everyone he touched left or was harmed by him. His story is just so much worse that I imagined.Maddie's story is as expected but we also get to know so much more of her traumatic past. I love Maddie's sweet disposition even after everything that she suffered in her life. I like that she came to grips with what she believed her whole like was not real. I like that she openly admits things to Flame and that they both fit together so easily. I like that once she knows that he needs things to be said strait to the point, she is always honest with him and makes sure he knows what she if feeling. I really loved all of the interactions between Maddie and Flame.Their love is definitely unique and it definitely shocked most of the group, but it felt so pure. I liked that after getting to know them both a little better, I could not see them without each other. Now in my mind there is no Flame without his Maddie and there is no Maddie without her Flame. These two people needed each other so they could both realize who they were meant to be.There is some pretty crazy stuff happening with The Order in this book and I can not wait to see what else is coming from them. I was a bit shocked that these ""Godly"" people are so blinded by their faith that they believe the rambling left by a creeper of an old man. Now I wasn't shocked of the things taking place because of the first two book, but I am shocked that these people are so easily swayed by the newcomers and that Cain's brother Judah has easily accepted the teachings from the previous Prophet. I am really looking forward to more of what is going to happen with them and the Hades Hangmen. Although I have hated Cain for awhile I am now wondering how is story is going to play out.Tillie Cole has a real knack for making both sides of this book so real and believable. Her writing style lets me really connect with all the characters in these books. I love that the MC aspect of this book is so real and it feels authentic. I like the grit of the men of the Hades Hangmen and I really love their women. The women in this series are such a contradiction, but at the same time it makes so much sense of them to be saved by the men of Hades Hangmen. It makes sense that they could not just go out into the world because they would be overwhelmed, but with the Hades Hangmen they are both exposed to the world and they are protected form it.This is by far my most favorite MC series EVER.

"This has now one of my favorite MC series'. This is the first book that I have read in the Selected Sinner MC Series, but I will undoubtedly will be read the first three book as well.When I read the synopsis and an excerpt I just had to find out about this ""eighth wonder of the world"", but I will be honest...I HATED the name Biscuit for a biker, but after reading this book and falling in love with Dalton ""Biscuit"" Biskette, I don't think that I could have loved him by any other name. I loved that he was so freaking hilarious, but still held that certain sex appeal even when he was telling stories that made him look like an idiot. I loved that even though he was a bad ace 1%'r he was still a stand up guy. I liked his honesty especially when it came to women and what he intended to take from them...well really what he intended them to give him. I also like that once he realized that Kat made him feel different that instead of running or screwing every puntang in the area he searched her out and was willing to give things a try. What I loved most about Dalton ""Biscuit"" Biskette was his willingness to step up and take responsibility for something that most men would run from. That endeared him to me all the more.While I love the fact that this book seems to be dominated by the male POV I really loved the added female POV. I love when a biker book is written well enough that you can connect with both characters equally. I loved Kat. I liked that she was not your typical 22 year old twit. She was your typical 22 year old cop daughter looking to rebel, but it seems that she looked for the wrong type of bad boy before meeting Biscuit. I like how she seemed to changed. I also liked that by the end of this book it seemed that she was in a healthier relationship with her mother and father. I also like the way that she went about getting to know Biscuit better when she realized that she liked him more than just of the sex. By the way the sex was oh so sexy!If you like biker books and not just those that seem to imitate SOA, then you should start this series. Being that I started this series with the fourth book I was in no way lost with the storyline at all. I liked that it was read as a stand alone, which meant that the others most likely follow the same. I will most definitely be starting the series from the beginning because I have to know more about Slice, Toad and Otis and I hope there will be more to come after!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZ2TAJTJ8BMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ISP1HO#wasThisHelpful","R2BZ2TAJTJ8BMA","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received an ARC for an honest review.**What a sweet and swoon worthy second chance romance. I loved Lawson and Emelyn and their ability to forget and forgive the past and move forward to a new future. This book has everything that makes a great quick romance. There is sadness, there is love, there is super sexiness, there is tension and there is heartfelt forgiveness. I loved this book right from the beginning and I just did not want to put it down.This book starts off with Emelyn waking up from a nightmare that will change the course of the next four years. Her life is no longer on the course she thought it would be and everything changes. There are flashbacks with glimpses into how everything started and it helps connect with both Lawson and Emelyn. We get to meet them as children and we get to see the sparks fly even at such an early age. We get to see them for a little bit in their teenage youth and their teenage college youth. We get to know them as young adults and then eventually as adults. They both change so much over the course of this book especially after they reconnect.I really enjoyed the pace and the tone of this book. I liked that even though they all went through something so tragic that they all were able to grow and move on with their lives. I hate that things were lost between Lawson and Emelyn, but I think it all played out the way it should for these two people to be able to be who they are. I really enjoy this authors writing style and I really liked this book. It was just so nice and refreshing to read a sweet and relatively drama free book. Don't get me wrong there is drama, but there isn't unnecessary drama in order for these characters to find themselves both separately and together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1669COTF6VWIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SB1VE8#wasThisHelpful","R1669COTF6VWIK","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I loved this book more than the first one. I absolutely hated Mack in book one but he really did redeem himself in this book of the Drive Me Wild series.I met Jonna in book one and I knew that she was Drew and Woody's sister. I knew she was fiesty and a bit of a spitfire but I didn't know how much. I liked how she was with Mack right off the bat and I liked how she pushed to get to know him when she thought he was pushing her away.It turned out that Mack had good reasons for pushing Jonna away and they were for her own good. It was nice to see that someone could actually penetrate his tough exterior and open him up. I liked the softer side of Mack and it did not take away from his sexiness at all. This book had plenty of sexy and Mack was at the center of them all.There are quite a few new developments going on in this book in regards to the racing circuit and even the other characters lives. The very last words of this book dropped a bomb that sets the tone for th next book in the series and I can not wait for it. I look forward to more of what is going on with the other characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQ6RPXUTBHGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01151PJOE#wasThisHelpful","R2NQ6RPXUTBHGY","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This book blew me away with the twists in the plot and the overall outcome. When things started coming to light and everything started sliding into place it made Nick's need for revenge that much sweeter.Right from the start something was swirling in my head and I kept trying to get my sister to tell me if I was right, but I am so glad that she didn't give it away. I loved every word, paragraph and page of this book. Nick Ryder is every woman's hero, although not in the traditional sense not by a landslide. Nick suffered a terrible tragedy and so did his family. A tragedy that he watched with his own eyes and vowed that he would get revenge for what was done to his family. The things he saw were enough to splinter anyone and the way he went about his retribution was dark, depraved and oh so bad ass. The thing that Nick did in the name of revenge is not butterflies, flowers and unicorns. This is not a light and airy romance. It is so messed up, but so fulfilling.Aubree Culling she found herself trapped and kidnapped not once, but twice in her life. She is so broken, but she is still so strong. The things that she has had to survive and live through are so much worse that I would have thought, but are what I suspected right off the bat. I love that she found herself with Nick and that the two of them seemed to have found themselves in each other. I liked the honesty that they shared with each other after they started to cut through the bullspit.I don't want to give anything away and this is already turning to a point of being a bit spoilerish... I will just say that this book is so much more than I thought it was going to be. I knew it would be dark and gritty, but it was dark and gritty in an amazing way. The things done in this book will make you cringe, but also make you cheer with they are avenged. This is one of those books that you can't put down because you can't wait to find out how everything will play out. Somethings I saw coming and somethings were a surprise, but I loved everything in this book.This book is a MUST read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97VZUR8WNZYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105H0E7G#wasThisHelpful","R97VZUR8WNZYS","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**What a fantastic emotionally packed read. I loved the growth that took place with the Maxfield family in the wake of their terrible loss. The author did a wonderful job portraying all of the emotions, thoughts and feelings that Kelsey went through.I don't agree with what Kelsey did, but seeing as she did not break down like I would have expected, it seems that the relationship that she grew with Peter helped her grow and accept that she no longer would have her twin by her side. I knew that even though she didn't want to be the one to tell Peter, that Michelle had die, her not telling him wasn't entirely selfish. She knew that he needed that little light at the end of his tunnel. But once she grew to love him and him her it was harder for her to tell him. She just couldn't break him and let him go back to war.I liked that this story mainly focused on Kelsey and her life and her heeling. I really enjoyed watching her re-learn to live her life, but what I like the most is that she started to view some of the world as her sister did. Even with a loss so big, she still managed to find her path and her life changed for the better. I hated that the rift between her and her parent grew to crazy proportions, but I did like the end when things were aired and addressed.There were a few inconsistencies in this book and just somethings that didn't really flow well for me in this storyline. None of it took away from the storyline, but it did make me want to know why those things may not have been addressed.Overall this is a great YA read and the ending was very touching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIVKN8X79TTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316283681#wasThisHelpful","RUIVKN8X79TTM","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**NOT ROMANCE.I am hooked. I am so overwhelmed with guessing what is happening. There is a constant loop of possibilities of what I think is happening to Nora Gilbert going through my head. I want to know what is going on and I want to know now.There are so many possibilities of who took her an who locked her away. Was is Bradley? Was it Maren? Was it Rosies? Are those people even real? Was it her mother? Was it Nora? So very many possibilities! The way this book flips from past to present makes things all the more confusing, but in a really mysterious and a suspenseful way.Especially the ending.What was on the other side of the hole? Who is singing? What is the beeping noise?So many questions and I need the answers. I am very much looking forward to The Missing - Volume Two - LIES. I know there will be so many more questions until the end of this three part series, but I need the answers to those questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PTPBWCSQOZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119CTKEE#wasThisHelpful","R26PTPBWCSQOZQ","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This was such a intensely sexy read with a bit of mystery. The whole time I was reading this I kept thinking about the way that the synopsis made it seem that Jeremy was only after revenge and I kept trying to relate a vengeful person with him and I just kept coming up empty. It was so hard to keep the faith when all of the secrets kept popping up, but when everything was finally out in the open I really wasn't all that shocked. It made more sense than anything.I don't want to give anything away with this story so I will steer clear of that. I will tell you that at times I felt like there was too much going on in the story and that there was a lot of back and forth with Phoebe and Jeremy. I love drama in my reads, but at times there was too much, I guess that made the name of the book appropriate, TOXIC.I liked the person Phoebe became after her past. I liked that she took over her family's business with the hopes of saving it. She appeared to be strong and had her life together. I did not like that she so easily lost herself in Jeremy so quickly, but I guess she also found herself in him as well. At times I thought she was to insecure when it came to their relationship and I also thought there were too many things on the outside that they both let affect their relationship.  But in the end it all made it worth it. Everything they went through was something that needed to happen for them to ultimately become who they were. For them to find themselves and for the to find each other.I loved that epilogue was told in Jeremy's POV and that getting that glimpse of things from him was an added bonus of their story. I enjoyed this read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLLG4HFYAJ59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6E2#wasThisHelpful","RJLLG4HFYAJ59","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I loved Jesse's story! I have loved all the books in this MC series but I was really looking forward to Jesse's.Nurse Bell. I was curious as to who would ultimately be Jesse's woman and I love that it was shy sweet Nurse Bell. I also love that they continuously called her Nurse Bell. I loved Bell. She is so sweet and such a great female lead. At some point I would have labeled her a pushover but considering all that she went through and all they her family had been through she is just genuinely thoughtful and selfless. She puts everyone's needs above her own and Jesse is no different. Even when he is constantly pushing her away she always relents and lets him have his way. I loved the way she responded to Jesse and l loved that she kept fighting it. I also loved that she just didn't easily give into him. I loved the relationship that they built and I loved they they grew to respect each other.I didn't love how Jesse constantly tried to hurt her while hiding himself away. But I did like that I got to understand the man behind the early smile and cheesy pick up lines. The flashbacks alone are enough to make anyone's life a hellacious one but that is not all Jesse had to endure in his lifetime. Hiding behind his smile is how he coped with all the crap that was constantly suffocating him. I love Jesse so much more after this book.Now I am gonna touch on the subject of Paige, Bell's sister that disappeared six years prior. I just did not see something like that touching the sweet Nurse Bell, but I am so glad that there was somewhere she could go when law enforcement had failed to move forward. I love that the Rebels are an MC that are willing to take care of their family no matter how new to the group they are. This most definitely one of my favorite MC series and I look forward to more.This book is a definite MUST read and so is the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QCEZZJG20OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3GI5MC#wasThisHelpful","R37QCEZZJG20OM","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I LOVE PERKINS VALE!!! That is all!Okay kidding...I LOVED this book in the Legendary Rockstars series! This is my favorite tale of The Nights thus far.This book was so well written and so were the characters. I loved that this series has a modern take on classic takes, but I love that it has an antiquated feel to it. I love the play on names that the author continues throughout this series. I love the modern time troubles that have the old world feel to them. I like the creepy characters because they make each tale unique. I love that this book takes place during the time as the previous one takes place. That we get to know what Perkins was up to while Lansing was making such a mess of his life. I also love that Perkins Vale seemed to complete his quest but I wasn't without struggle and plenty of time passing.From book one of the series we know that Perkins is not your usual rockstar and that he is looking for a girl from his teenage years. I like that throughout this book it seems that everyone knows who his mystery girl is but they had never crossed paths, except for those two fateful times. Even though it upsets him to know that she had been within his reach I think it makes for such a great story. I immediately fell in love with their relationship from the beginning.I loved that Perkins was riddled with question but I loved him even more for his patience. I loved Hollister right off the bat and I knew once she opened up to Perkins that their relationship would be amazing. I was right. I loved every push and pull I their relationship. I loved every truth revealed between them and I loved Perkins willingness to forgive and love Hollister regardless of how he first felt hearing her truths. Hollister is definitely fitting with the rest of the leading ladies in this series. She is such a loving and giving person even though she had something so precious taken from her. I loved her need to give back and take care of women in need. I also loved her tough exterior but I loved even more when she accepted the protective nature of Perkins.I guess I really just loved this book and I am looking forward to more of this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XJ8SPI2QHIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102ZNUJA#wasThisHelpful","R39XJ8SPI2QHIS","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**Wow!!! This is the best book of this series yet! I am so in love with Talia, Donovan, Jeremiah and even Allan. You will meet all of the most important men in Talia's life and you will fall in love with them just like I did. We even meet some characters that I can not wait for more of their stories to unfold.So, we met Talia in books one and two of The Affair Series as Laurie's best friend. I knew that I would love her from those books. I liked her personality and her devotion to her best friend. She was definitely a rock in a Laurie's rough patch and that spoke volumes of the type of person she is. I fell in love with her even more at the beginning of this book when she is a woman just trying to make a living doing what she loves and at the same time trying to take care of her father and everyone else she feels the need to help. I felt for Talia when she was feeling the weight of all her problems and the way she was so overwhelmed in trying to deal with everything by herself.During a pretty stressful time for Talia she gets a blast from her past, Donovan Lore, the man who changed her forever. I am immediately drooling over Donovan Lore and all his sexiness when he just shows up into Talia's center. I like that he is someone that she never thought she would see again because his is tied to one of the kids from her center. I like that just before he makes his first appearance she was just making comparisons between the troubled kid in her office and the man that once held her heart.Getting to see all of their relationships grow from the start of this book until the end was so great. This book is off the charts sexy, sweet and pretty funny at times. I like that the characters all evolved in some way, because it made for a better read and it really helped connect me with the characters and their story. I definitely want more of this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJ6P0GQEYCVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZS0FQB0#wasThisHelpful","R1OJ6P0GQEYCVS","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"** I received an ARC for an honest review.**I have recently read a few series and ending and I feel like I keep saying this, but this was a great ending to the Bliss Series. I am so glad that Dr. Noah Taylor finally got his story and that he found love. Although I want to shout out who his woman is I won't.BUT...I will say that she is oh so awesome and oh so funny. I loved her personality right from the start and I loved how she tried to keep strong and ignore all of the ""Walking Dildo's"" advances. She started out so so strong, but of course started to bend as he turned up the charm. I really liked that even though she had been through some pretty crappy things in her recent past, she didn't let it define her and she always did what was best for her. I think that she could of been a little more forthcoming with what she was struggling with when it came to those closest to her, but I can also understand that she didn't want to burden anyone with what she assumed would eventually fade away.We get to see a whole new side of WD. After this book I can no longer just define him by his extremely blessed member, I have to give him credit for his really awesome personality. Not only did he surprise me with his excellent boyfriend skills but he surprised me with how much he matured in this book. Don't get me wrong he is still the fun loving Noah, but he is oh so much better when he finds someone he wants to share his life with.These two characters together are sexy, sweet and funny. I like that the humor of this series did not lessen but it grew especially with (insert name here) and her family. I loved the witty remarks that were traded even while some pretty heavy stuff plagued (insert name here). I liked that the other characters from the previous book in the series are a constant in this book. Everyone makes an appearance and we get to see what is going on in their lives. The epilogue gives a great little glimpse into all of their Blissful futures...even Satan gets a shout out ;)Loved this book, loved the characters and I especially loved that everyone finds their Bliss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQOWN9QRFVA8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VO2ING6#wasThisHelpful","RQOWN9QRFVA8P","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I really really really enjoyed this book in the Willow Bay Series. I love that each book is so much different than the previous ones. From the start I was wondering if Sadie would keep her place in Emma's life and therefore in the band life too. I am so happy that both Sadie get their story.So, for the blurb we know that what Sadie though was her happily ever after was not at all her HEA. I had a feeling that Braden was not going to be in her life for the long haul after the scene at the New Years Party in Never Too Late. I am so glad that things came to a head with that and that Sadie took the initiative to start over with her life. I am also glad that the person she went to for help was Ezra.Ezra is just so easy to love and I loved him for the very beginning. He is a great brother, friend and eventually a really sexy lover. I really hated that he was so stubborn and denied both himself and Sadie what they both wanted the most, but I loved that when his finally was ready to reveal his feelings he did not do it in a small way but a really big way. So so sweet that Ezra.I loved how their relationship was hidden, because it seemed to make it that much more intense but I also hated the strain it put on Sadie. But it did make her face her long suppressed feeling, well both of them really.All the previous characters make an appearance in this book and I love that we get more of their stories too. The fact that all of them are still such a close KNIT (that is for Maddox) group is a really great thing about this series. I like that their lives are all still progressing and changing but they are all still very committed to being friends and family.I am really looking forward to Hayes' book...I can not wait. I am going to cut this off before I give anything else away. I hate spoiler reviews and this one is already on the verge of being spoilerish.

"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**I will start this review off by saying that I LOVE every book in this series and this book was an excellent end to a SENSATIONAL SERIES.From the beginning, in Sound Advice, we met Tricia Carter and her long time boyfriend Trent Walker. I loved her character from the start because of her selfless personality. She did so much for her family and she was just always genuine in who she was each and every time we see her. Over the last few books we got the sense that she wasn't happy in her relationship with Trent and boy what an understatement that was. I did not see the pretty heave stuff that came of that relationship coming. I just thought that her and Trent were simply in a rut and too comfortable with their relationship, but that could not be further from the truth. When it finally is revealed what all Tricia went through in her relationship with Trent it was heartbreaking, because she kept it all to herself, all because she did want to ruin someone who was already ruined to begin with.At the beginning of Sight Words Tricia is just starting a new school year, at a new school, and with her newly single status. She isn't all that hopeful that the will find new love in the small town of Elk Rapids and she is even less hopeful when she keeps running into Trent. But that all changes when she looks out the window of her classroom and watches the physically fit man play basketball everyday and the same time.Leon Ramirez. This is the first appearance of ""King"" of the whole series. He is new to town and has his priorities already lined out. Take care of his sisters and lay low, but he can't take care of his sisters without financial stability so he works not one, not two, but three jobs to take care of his sisters when his mother and father are forced to leave the country. He struggles to keep the afloat and he is working so hard to follow his fathers orders. He tries to stay under the radar, but it is hard when your are in a small town where everyone knows everyone. Not only that but the chemistry that he feels between him and Ms. Carter. He tries to fight it, because he knows he can't risk bringing her into his life.I loved that Tricia was such a genuine person when it came to wanting to help the Ramirez family. Even though Leon was constantly pulling and pushing her away. I enjoyed the build up of their relationship over the period of time that the Ramirez Family lived in Elk Rapids. The connection of Leon and Tricia was great to watch grow from how it started to the way it ended up. I loved every bit of their story because it felt real and never far fetched or rushed. There are so many things that are going on in both Tricia and Leon's worlds and when they all come to light it is so much easier to understand what makes them both tick. I enjoyed both of them as individual characters and I LOVED them as a couple.I said before that this was a great in to a great series and do recommend this whole series as a must read. LB Dunbar does an excellent job of drawing you into Elk Rapids and into the Scott and Carter families as if you grew up with these people all of your life. I fell in love with Jess and Emily, Ethan and Ella, Jacob and Pam, Gavin and Britton, and Tricia and Leon. I loved that in every book all of the previous characters made an appearance and I kept falling in love with them more. This group of people are such good friends and are always there for each other. It is a heartwarming series with fantastic and easy to love characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGM5S167ANY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLXS3CO#wasThisHelpful","R3MGM5S167ANY7","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**What an emotional read.This book starts off with a little glimpse into the past and what sets the pace for the rest of the book. When we meet both characters they are both lost in life, they both feel something lacking and one knows what it is while one has no clue what is about to hit them. Even though Nolan is living his dream and had accomplished so many things he still feels somewhat numb and empty. It isn't until he is back in his hometown and sees his Little B after six years. When he left he thought that no contact would be best for her to move on with her life but it didn't turn out like he thought.They see each other for the first time in six years and Brooklyn's suppressed feelings for Nolan return with a force, but Nolan is so confused by his attraction to his Little B and his need for their friendship to resume is most important to him.I really enjoyed the push and pull of both characters and their emotions. I liked that there was no insta-love with them (well on both sides)  and that it took time to grow their relationship again and make it stronger than it was. I loved that their friendship aspect always took priority over anything else. They always made time for each other and tried to help one another with what is going on in their lives. There is a lot going on, emotionally, in this books. At times it felt like it was a little too much but it all worked out for the best.At some point I thought thing would never line up for Brooklyn and Nolan, but neither of them were willing to give it up. I liked that they both refused to lose the relationship even if it meant they would never be able to be together as a couple, they knew they needed to always remain friends. But I did like the way this book ended. So many things came full circle fro them and the possibilities for their future are endless. I know this is a standalone, but I would not mind more of these two characters in maybe a flash forward novella.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KOIR3PVH8ZEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7MMXPG#wasThisHelpful","R2KOIR3PVH8ZEF","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**I received and ARC for an honest review.**What a beautifully emotional read. I LOVED this book. At first I had bit of trouble getting into it because I was constantly waiting for THAT point. The point where everything would change for Bailey. I kept asking myself ""how will it happen?"".Will Major not be as perfect as he appears?Is he a crook and gets arrested?Did he cheat with a stripper?Will his grandparents not give their blessing and in turn he doesn't want to marry Bailey?Does he die?Does he just leave her at the alter?Why is this book called Happily Ever Never?What is it that happens that drastically changed a Bailey's life?I was just obsessed with needing to find out that once I did I didn't think that I would be phased in the least. I WAS WRONG!!! I was phased...a lot. I cried, real tears and I am tearing up thinking about it all over again. What's more is that the last half of this book is so emotionally packed. I could not believe how this book turned around for me. I never thought I would connect with certain characters and I just couldn't see how some characters could connect with each other. Especially after the first half of the book.During the first half of this book I found Bailey a bit annoying and hard to root for, but I also knew she was super stressed with her upcoming wedding and meeting her soon to be husbands extended family. She was also on edge because her fiancés best friend was such a tool and she never knew what he was going to do. But by the second half of this book I was in love with Bailey. I was amazed at her strength and her ability to see the silver lining. I loved that she put the past in the past and was there to make someone feel loved and not alone. I love the person she turned into.So much sadness and heartbreak in this book but there was also tons to smile on by the ending. This book is fairly short but the flow and pace are very easy to follow and I love that it progresses easily.Only read this book if you have a box of tissues handy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXH7DOC1DBRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI6WGYA#wasThisHelpful","RAXH7DOC1DBRX","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**I received an ARC for an honest review.**This is a quick and sexy read, but it felt a bit lacking for me in a lot of areas. I know that this was meant to be a fast pace novella, but I just never felt the connection with the two characters. I felt that the way things started out was a bit of a reach, but I did end up enjoying the story overall.I just felt that a little more time could have been taken in cultivating the relationship between Jack and Jenna, mostly from the past. There was mention office flirtation and stuff but it just wasn't enough for me. I also thought that there could have been a little bit more of a separation between the two names of the men in Jenna's life, Jax and Jack were just too much at times and cause a bit of confusion.This little novella just didn't do it for me, but that does not mean it isn't for you or someone you know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHUGQTL96LSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U747MYG#wasThisHelpful","R1UHUGQTL96LSR","AFC97KDPMJHXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFC97KDPMJHXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got two of these chairs and am very pleased with them. They were very easy to put together, requiring absolutely no tools whatsoever. The instructions are just a one page set of numbered pictures which you barely need as the assembly is pretty much common sense. It takes about 5 minutes to put a chair together.The cushions on the chairs are very thick and comfortable. Even the armrests, which appear to be hard plastic, are actually a cushiony foam material which is great for your elbows while still remaining easy to clean.What I like most is that the entire chair is adjustable. You can adjust how tall the back is. The armrests have two adjustments. One adjustment allows you to determine how far apart they are sideways from the seat cushion which is great for people who are thin or wide. The other adjustment allows you to determine how tall the armrests are set. So a tall person can set them to a higher setting than a short person.The chair has three additional settings. You can control the seat height (how far the seat cushion is from the floor), the chair back (how far it leans back), and the chair's tilt (this determines whether the chair pitches forward or backward). If you leave the chair back unlocked, then the chair acts like a rocker chair.These chairs are listed as high back chairs; however, I think they're more like mid back chairs. They do not overpower the room like the high back chairs I'm replacing.I bought two chairs to go in our computer room and have just ordered a third chair to go with a third desk. These chairs are my third set of chairs for that room. Our first set of chairs had a very similar upholstery fabric as these chairs which held up very well. Our second set of chairs were high back leather chairs that fell apart almost immediately after buying them. I'm hoping the upholstery on these chairs will perform as well as the upholstery on our first set of chairs. I also like that these chairs do not have any buttons to fall off.I am very happy I found these chairs. I've been looking for new chairs for a long time, but wanted something that combined good looks with comfort without spending a fortune. These chairs seem to have the perfect combination all the way around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCTJ3WRFEHT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0008GMTUA#wasThisHelpful","R2WCTJ3WRFEHT1","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a dark colored cave for tanks with dark substrate! These caves are loved by all of my cave dwelling fish, as well as my shrimp. Best of all, my Pelvicachromis (aka Kribensis) love them!Because the caves have an open bottom, you can push them into the substrate as far as you want to make the caves larger or smaller. This allows cave dwellers to arrange the substrate inside the cave the way they want which is a normal part of the breeding process. For my kribensis, I like to push them almost all the way down so that just a tiny hole is left open. The female krib will pick the cave and then rearrange the gravel to make the opening just perfect for her. This gives her a sense of safety so she will breed and care for the eggs and fry.I've been looking for a dark colored cave that looked attractive in my planted tanks for a long time, and this cave is perfect. I started out with 3 caves and just bought 3 more. No more ugly clay pots! They look great in the tank and don't detract from the beautiful colors of the fish.UPDATE: My Pelvicachromis clearly love these caves! One pair mated and have successfully raised the fry. They're about 3/4"" long now. The other pair have had two sets of fry, but aren't as good at parenting so they've lost both sets. However, they're trying for their third set of fry so maybe they'll do better at protecting them as they gain experience.Even though I still have other caves in the tanks for my Pelvicachromis fish to use, they most definitely prefer these caves. I'm not going to bother buying any other kind of cave from now on. These caves are a definite winner! Just bought 5 more for a 90g tank I'm converting over to a planted tank! I'll probably get even more for that tank over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HAFE7IQ9XGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1SG6S#wasThisHelpful","R25HAFE7IQ9XGE","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent a long time reading reviews of stain removers before buying this one. I must admit, I was skeptical. But I'm a believer now!I had tried to clean dark stains from my an area rug years ago to no avail. Nothing I did would even budge the stains. Then health issues prevented me from cleaning my house, and everyone just gave up cleaning. I'm better now and trying to deep clean through about 3 years of filth and stains.Considering I could not get these stains out before all this happened, I had very little hope I'd get them out now. I even found a replacement rug. But before spending $1,000 on the replacement rug, I decided to try to clean my old rug one more time.The steam cleaner wasn't even budging the stains, using hot water with an oxyclean formula cleaner. That's when I grabbed my bottle of Folex cleaner for the first time. I read the instructions, and they seemed too easy, but I had nothing to lose. Imagine my surprise when it actually worked!!I started spraying stain after stain after stain and they were ALL coming out! I was getting so many stains out that I rubbed my fingers raw so I switched to using the back end of a toothbrush. The rug is indigo blue with a beautiful cream border, and that border is now just as pretty as new! I'm about halfway through cleaning it, but I've done the worst part (the high traffic area). There are just a couple more stains to get out, but I feel confident it'll get them.I hope they never stop making this stuff because I will never stop buying it. I finally found something that actually works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RBHSRGVIPX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ILA3YY#wasThisHelpful","R15RBHSRGVIPX3","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted something to keep my prescription medicines organized and locked up, but all of the normal boxes intended for those purposes did not fit my needs. So I took a chance on the Ape Case, and I couldn't be happier!The height of this particular case is perfect for prescription pill bottles. I can put about 30 prescriptions bottles in a case (5 rows of 6 across) which is quite a few. The case comes with padding on top and bottom which fills in the gaps for smaller bottles so they don't fall around when you pick up the case and move it. There's also padding that you break away to shape for the items you're storing so if you have fewer bottles to store, you can use the padding to fill in the gaps to keep things organized. This means you can label the lids, stand them up in the case, close the case, and then move it around without the contents getting jumbled around. When you open the case again, everything is just as you put it.While the case comes with a key lock, the latches have loops which can be padlocked, if desired. I also like that it's metal and not plastic.I looked all over for something to lock up prescription medicines, and I think this case is the best thing I've found. It's even better than the cases I've seen designed to lock up meds. It's the perfect size and offers a lot of flexibility of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UU9637M0Z3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045EIO9Q#wasThisHelpful","R5UU9637M0Z3C","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had basically given up on using super glues before trying this one. When other super glues worked, they were great, but they often did not work. Even worse, they would dry up quickly, making the entire bottle wasted. However, Gorilla Glue has exceeded my expectations. It has worked on everything I've tried without the drawbacks I've encountered with other super glues.I have used this glue for well over a year now, and it continues to be good!

"I bought this fan a couple of years ago and now can't live without it. I'm buying another one so I can keep one in my bedroom and one on my covered patio. It is quiet enough to use while sleeping. It puts out so much air, it offers instant relief. It does a better job than the ceiling fan on its highest setting.I'm using mine even with our central a/c set at 74F. I still get hot with the a/c, but this fan instantly cools me off. It blows strong enough to actually offer relief even when outside.I cannot recommend this fan enough!-------------UPDATE: I am downgrading my original review from 5-stars to 4-stars because I found another fan that I think is much better. The fan I prefer is the Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan with Remote Control, HY-048BP which is also available here on Amazon for about $10 less.Differences between the Lasko and the Honeywell fans:Air-Flow: The Lasko wins out when it comes to the amount of air that is blown. So if the most important feature you want is air flow (and not temperature cool down), then the Lasko would be the better choice. However, the Honeywell isn't that far behind when it comes to air flow, and it offers many other features that I have found to make it a far better fan than the Lasko.Cooling: The single most important difference that I prefer with the Honeywell is that it has a thermostat that allows you to set a temperature for the room (in 2 degree increments). That does two things: First, the fan blows colder air into the room. You can actually feel the temperature difference! Second, you can optionally set the fan to automatically turn itself on and off based on the room temperature. When the room temperature is above the temperature you set on the fan, the fan automatically turns itself on, cools down the room, then it shuts itself off. This is the same behavior as that of an air conditioner!Noise: The Honeywell is also a quieter fan; although, I must say that both fans are very quiet. The noise made by both fans comes only from the sound of the rushing air which is unavoidable. But since the Honeywell uses colder air for cooling while the Lasko uses high velocity air for cooling, the Lasko makes more noise.Remote Control: The Honeywell includes a very nice extra feature of a remote control that is missing in the Lasko fan. I have found the remote control to be a wonderful tool as I can alter the fan's setting quickly and easily anytime I want. Sometimes I will change the settings if I'm drinking something cold which chills me for a few minutes. I use the remote control every day because it's just so convenient.Dependability: I have owned both fans for at least two years and have found them to be highly dependable. So I'd say they are basically equal in lasting a long time.Price: Surprisingly, the Honeywell runs about $10 less even though it has more features. This is one time when you don't get more by paying more.Other: Otherwise, both fans are basically the same. There are other small differences, but they don't matter much to me. The Honeywell has a filter that some people may find preferable, but I don't think it's good enough to make much of a difference. Both fans offer multiple speeds and can be set stationary or oscillating. You can direct the air flow up or down somewhat on the Lasko, but not the Honeywell. The Lasko is shorter and has a more solid base footing so it's less likely to be pushed over by children or pets, but I haven't had any problems with the Honeywell being knocked over. So there are some minor differences, but I didn't find any of these features to sway my preference between the two fans since my main focus is on the fans' cooling abilities and the Honeywell's cooling abilities is so superior that it makes all the other differences insignificant.BOTTOM LINE: If you are wanting to push a lot of air around, get the Lasko. If you want to cool down the room or yourself, then get the Honeywell. I especially recommend the Honeywell for people who get hot while sleeping at night!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEIOVHDC1I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BO58PC#wasThisHelpful","R3PEIOVHDC1I4","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the bottom, I've updated a couple of comments now that I use the iLap for my MacBook Pro.I bought my iLap in July of 2006 for my PowerBook G4.  I was having problems with my PowerBook being unbearably hot when placed on my lap so I decided to give the iLap a try.The iLap has surpassed my expectations.  I feel absolutely no heat on my lap from my PowerBook even though I use my PowerBook many hours at a time, every day.  The hinged front and back cushions offer enough flexibility that I can use the iLap in many different positions, such as sitting up or laying on my back on the couch.  I also find the cushions offer enough support that I don't have problems with discomfort from the weight or metal of my PowerBook or the iLap itself.I have not had the slipping problem others have reported.  My iLap came with 4 rubbery pads that grip the PowerBook very well.  If I do notice any slippage, all I have to do is clean the pads and the feet on my PowerBook, and the slippage stops completely.  I have to clean it maybe every 2 or 3 months which is very reasonable.  I constantly walk around with my PowerBook on my iLap, and the grip is so good that I have to be careful to remind myself that they are not truly attached because I sometimes find myself not holding my PowerBook as securely as I should.  So far, in 8 months of use, the iLap has not allowed my PowerBook to slip even with my occasional carelessness.The iLap has held up very well after 8 months.  The cushions have not degraded, the front cushion remains firmly attached (although, I usually don't take it off as there's no need), and while I'm sure the cushions must be dirty by now, you wouldn't know it by looking at it.  I have used a lint remover on the cushions a couple of times to clean up cat hairs when my cat thinks my closed PowerBook is her personal warmed napping spot, but that's about as much care as my iLap has needed.I have found my iLap to be so good that I take it everywhere I go, including finding ways to put it in suitcases when I go out of town.  The hinged front cushion helps greatly when packing it, and it's stood up well through many plane rides in the front pocket of suitcases that were checked in.I can't say enough good things about my iLap.  It is one accessory that I find completely indispensable for my laptop usage and comfort.  It receives my highest of recommendations, especially considering how well it's held up for so long.UPDATE: I have now used my same iLap for 2.5 years! I still can't live without it! I have had a MacBook Pro for about 1.5 years now, and continue to use my iLap with it. I finally did run into slipping problems as the rubbery pads hardened with age. But I found a great way to resolve this issue.When I bought my MacBook Pro, I immediately put it in a clear hardshell case to protect it. To stop it from slipping on the iLap, I simply put velcro on my hardshell case and on the iLap. Now the MacBook Pro stays put without any slipping at all no matter how I position it.If you give velcro a try, I suggest putting the soft side on the Mac's case and the hook side on the iLap itself. That way when you take your Mac somewhere in which you don't take the iLap, the velcro on the bottom isn't a problem.I also wanted to comment that I ended up removing the cushion in the front of the iLap, and I have found it to be very comfortable on my lap without it.I've used Macintosh computers since 1986, and this is one accessory that I have used the longest. I cannot be happier that I bought it.UPDATE 2: Wow, I ran across my old review and just realized that I've been using my iLap for over 5 years! It's still doing great! I'm now using it with my 3rd computer, and still can't imagine being without it. I use this thing every single day for many hours each day. Amazing value to get this much use out of a product. It's still just as good as ever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20M3QTO2RL9EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006DV6A4#wasThisHelpful","R20M3QTO2RL9EZ","A2SLUAWMUP8FLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SLUAWMUP8FLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you know cast iron skillets, you know the benefits and care and feeding requirements.  An examination of the grates themselves shows they are definitely cast iron - extremely heavy.  But it's not really porcelain coated, whatever the marketers would have you believe.  A proper porcelain coating is smooth.  These are anything but.I just replaced the old porcelain steel grates with these grates.  The new grates make perfect grill marks.  They also have the ability to conduct heat into the food faster.  The steel grates basically just hold the food off the fire - they don't help cook the food.If your grates start to rust, you're not seasoning properly .  You have to coat the grates with oil over the entire surface periodically.  I cannot imagine that coating they call porcelain will hold up that long.  But if you are willing to live with the little bit of extra maintenance, you can basically get food that tastes like it was made on a charcoal grill.Like a cast iron skillet, if you take care of these grates, they will never fail you.  They will outlast the rest of the grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221QEA5TSGMZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WEOQH2#wasThisHelpful","R221QEA5TSGMZU","ARIC00M54T1YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARIC00M54T1YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Tfal nonstick wok I had was great for nonstick, but it couldn't be warmed up over medium (believe it or not).  That's not real stir fry.

"I really wanted to like this TV.  Great brand with a long history in making LCD displays, great price, nice looking.  I have its little brother at my office so I already knew the UI.  But I don't watch movies at work, and I couldn't notice the problem with a delay between audio and video.  This is especially noticeable on the B's and M's on the speaking parts.I first noticed it on an external BluRay DVD player, which was brand new.  Then I tried a Roku and of course the internal smart TV.  Problems everywhere until I tried the X Box.  I used the component outputs from the X Box 360.  Hmmm.After reading the forums, they basically said to turn off all the video processing or put it into game mode to speed up the video decoding.  This did help, but it was still noticeable.  I thought about just using the X Box to relieve the CPU in the TV from decoding the HDMI, but component out s a dying technology.So, I took it back to the store where I bought it.  The crew was incredulous, so they set it up with a DVD player.  The process was painful, as it took them nearly 10 minutes.  Finally, they got it running and two of the three people from the store who were apparently just there for the entertainment of it all said - yep, I see it, and walked away.  The third guy gave me my full refund.My lessons learned.  A great display brand does not necessarily a great TV brand make.  Slow video processing on HDMI inputs can cause the audio to be decoded much quicker than the video, resulting in a lip synch problem.  Since most sources don't allow you to set a delay, you have to deal with the problem in the TV.Which is where my story ends.  I picked up a Samsung 6300 series in its place which does not exhibit the problem at all.  It even has a programmable audio delay.  Nice touch.  It also has Amazon Prime which the Sharp did not have, which is one of my favorite streaming sources.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7Q78IZO1JZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG5M93Y#wasThisHelpful","R2F7Q78IZO1JZP","ARIC00M54T1YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARIC00M54T1YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ouija Exorcism is about what you'd expect for a straight-to-DVD horror flick. I tried to give the movie a chance, as you can sometimes find hidden gems among low-budget horror movies, but it disappoints.The good: The cinematography has its moments, there are a couple lines of funny dialogue, and the story just barely scratches the surface of Jewish exorcisms (something rare in horror movies).The bad: The audio levels change way too much. You find yourself turning up the volume just to hear what's being spoken, only for it to be too loud the following scene. The lighting effects aren't consistent. The movie contains too much filler of weak dialogue and subplots involving relationships. The acting isn't anything special. The special effects and ""demon"" voice sound effects are lame. And aside from a one or two ""boo"" moments meant to startle the viewer, the movie just isn't that scary.If you're a diehard fan of movies related to demonic possession, it might be worth watching. If you're a casual fan of horror movies, do yourself a favor and pass on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GBZRFMH4KQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157753X4#wasThisHelpful","R22GBZRFMH4KQ6","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loveworks isn't exactly a how-to book on marketing, but it will absolutely offer the inspiration needed to excel in advertising. The core concept of the book isn't new: people make purchases based on their emotions, rather than logic. But Loveworks provides 20 case studies of how different companies were able to create amazing foundations of customer loyalty. The type of love for a brand that makes consumers look past premium pricing, ignore competitors, and maintain that support if a company makes mistakes.The author spent 25 years working for one of the world's leading ad agencies. Which makes Loveworks a treasure chest of real-world examples of how businesses were able to successfully convert their target audience into diehard supporters. What's great about the case studies is that they're backed up with statistics which prove ""Lovemarks"" is more than just marketing theory. You're given a clear sense of what each company accomplished as the result of their Lovemarks-based advertising campaigns. And although the case studies all reference the author's former ad agency's (Saatchi & Saatchi) involvement in these campaigns, it doesn't come off as boasting or self-promotion.Can you benefit from reading this book if you don't work for big brands like Nike, T-Mobile, Pampers, or Cheerios? Yes. Loveworks is concluded with a simple four-step process that can be applied to any business. Although the case studies all involve well-known brands, the main concept of Lovemarks can work for anyone, even small businesses that don't have a recognized brand. So even if you're familiar with advertising psychology and emotional appeal to customers, the case studies will inspire you, and open your eyes more on connecting with your audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STGK1IVVKJO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576877310#wasThisHelpful","R3STGK1IVVKJO9","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've developed and promoted hundreds of websites over the last 14 years, and have made millions for my clients. I bought this book to see if there were any useful new copy writing tips, or to let newbies know if it's helpful. But at best, it's a brief primer of recycled ideas that may only help point new copy writers in the right direction.Pros: The book mentions a few basics of writing copy. This includes how to write a headline, how to organize text, making copy easy to skim, and writing in a conversational style.Cons: The book is basically a small pamphlet with a lot of fluff and filler. None of the writing techniques mentioned are original. The book barely scratches the surface of these writing techniques, so newbies to copy writing are seriously missing out on how to make the most of these methods. I also can't help but notice that most of these five-star reviewers have only reviewed one product (this book), give vague/brief reviews, or don't seem to be writers.Bottom Line: Even if you're new to writing, this book wouldn't help you much. There are other books available that provide more info on how to get results from writing good copy. Books that helped to improve my client sales and leads over the years include: Ca$hvertising, The Copywriter's Handbook, Words that Sell, The Everything Guide To Writing Copy, and Content Rules.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVFBWN0IYOJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989895300#wasThisHelpful","R1PVFBWN0IYOJP","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've developed and marketed hundreds of websites over the last 14 years. So I'm always looking for new tips, or curious to see how thorough internet marketing bookies for newbies are. While ""Get the Click"" has a few useful (but recycled) tips for people new to website promotion, I felt the book could have offered much more info.Pros: Get the Click offers a limited primer to newsletter signups, identifying target customers, and writing website text to encourage sales.Cons: There's only about two dozen pages of actual techniques, with frequent double-spacing. It's almost as though a few different blog posts with lots of fluff were slapped together into a pamphlet. The ""formula"" described in the book are techniques that have been mentioned in other web marketing books - but in much more detail - over the last 5-10 years. I also found it questionable that the author's own business site is not optimized for Google, and doesn't use any of the techniques he promotes he in the book. It's also odd that every account that gave this book five stars all happen to review the same e-books, all giving five-star ratings with vague reviews. Smells like paid shills.If you are new to internet marketing, I don't think this book would be helpful. There are significantly better, more thorough books available for less money.

"Student of the Game isn't Noreaga's best work, but it's still an album fans should cop. I've been listening to his music since the CNN days of War Report, and while my preference is for his old stuff, much of what's on the new album is trademark NORE: street life, sex and drugs.As with all of his albums, N.O.R.E. is highly listenable, even if he's not trying to be especially lyrical. He acknowledges this on Camouflage Unicorns, spitting ""I'm the Lefrak king, I don't care what you say to me, say I don't make sense, cool that's okay with me.""  Where he shines is easily ""Built Pyramids"", which coincidentally has the best beat on the album thanks to Large Professor. You can also expect some vintage N.O.R.E. with ""Faces of Death"", which feels a bit like a continuation of ""Banned From T.V."" Four minutes, no hook, just N.O.R.E. going hard on the track along with French Montana, Swizz Beatz, Raekwon and Busta Rhymes.Student of the Game has a mix of guest features ranging from longtime artists (Scarface, Pete Rock, Havoc) to a few that have only recently started to get a buzz. The only unusual thing about the guest spots is that Lil Wayne only did the hook for ""She Tried"", he doesn't drop any verses for the track.Most of the beats are good, a few I wasn't feeling. Amazon obviously doesn't list them, but the beatmakers for the album are Cookin Soul, Illa, Inf, Pharrell, SPK, Pete Rock, Charlie Brown, Scram Jones, DJ Thoro, Hazardis Soundz, Large Professor, and Jahlil Beats. Standout beats on the album are ""What I Had to Do"" by SPK, ""Built Pyramids"", and ""Camouflage Unicorns"". The last of which has Nore, Havoc and Tragedy Khadafi dropping bars over a music box sample and a dusty beat (samples ""Love Story"" by Henry Mancini, same as Immortal Technique ""Dance with the Devil"" if it sounds familiar).One of the few complaints I'd have about the new album is the number of skits and filler tracks. The album is 19 tracks deep, five of them are skits/fillers. I can maybe understand showing props to Victor Cruz and Kevin Hart by putting them on the album, but I have no idea why Scott Disick (Kourtney Kardashian's baby daddy) is on the album.Overall, Student of the Game is worth copping. Sometimes he stretches it thin to make words rhyme (or not at all), not every guest feature is on point, and a few beats aren't suited for him. But I still enjoy the new album, and it's an overall step up from Noreality. If you've been a fan for a minute, you'll like the album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7N8WXVK98HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEWN190#wasThisHelpful","R3O7N8WXVK98HY","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a movie fan in general, I enjoyed Filly Brown. But as a longtime urban music journalist, I also appreciated just how true to life this movie was.  What makes Filly Brown stand out from movies like Hustle and Flow or 8 Mile is both how it deals with women in urban music, and having a female lead that offers a powerful performance.Filly Brown tells the story of Majo Tonorio, a Latina rapper who dreams of performing for huge audiences.  The Los Angeles MC builds her buzz rapping on the radio as Filly Brown, but her desire to get signed gets put into full gear because of her family. Filly's mother (played by Jenni Rivera) is serving a ten year prison sentence, her only hope for early release depends on whether Filly can come up with fast cash. What follows is a story of desire, manipulation, and redemption.Despite having a low budget, Filly Brown was shot well. But what really stands out about the movie is the cast, a mix of film veterans and new faces. Gina Rodriguez puts on a terrific performance as Filly Brown, with a voice and intensity that made her a great choice for the role.Edward James Olmos adds some seasoning to the film, and is reunited with Stand and Deliver alumnus Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays the hardworking father of Filly and her younger sister.  Film and TV star Emilio Rivera plays Mani, Filly's protective uncle and boss. California rappers Cuete Yeska and Baby Bash add new faces to the cast, with H-Town artist Chingo Bling adding some needed humor to the film as Filly's manager.Despite this being her first feature film, Jenni Rivera (RIP) offers a moving portrayal of Maria, Filly's drug addicted mother doing hard time.  Rivera ditched her trademark stage glamor for a prison uniform to deliver a haunting and memorable performance.  Her scenes are convincing, bittersweet considering Filly Brown will be the only time she appears in movie theaters.As far as the movie's inside look at the urban music game, Filly Brown scores for realism. Hip Hop managers are left hanging when labels strike backroom deals. Female rappers are often denied mainstream attention if they refuse to compromise their artistic integrity. In this case, Filly succumbs to the pressure of ""sexing up"" her image and lyrics to land a record deal for a fast payout to help her mother.The movie isn't flawless, of course.  Filly Brown offers more than a couple character types common to other movies, which gives several scenes a recycled feel. There are also one too many subplots, which threatens to muddle the film as the end approaches.Overall, Filly Brown succeeds. Its lineup of actors, surprisingly good Hip Hop soundtrack, and tear-jerking ending all make it a film to remember. Although the film features a variety of established Latino actors and artists, it's a movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. Definitely worth getting on DVD or Blu-Ray.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWCB6FD9GL1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAYH200#wasThisHelpful","R1AWCB6FD9GL1F","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Few movies start out with as much promise yet failure to deliver as The Devil's in the Details. What could have been a memorable film with a veteran cast of actors is instead a massive disappointment.The Devil's in the Details tells the story of a soldier struggling with PTSD, kidnapped by a drug cartel in an attempt to use his family to help smuggle drugs into Mexico. Combat veteran Thomas Conrad is tortured as his wife and child are held hostage, while everyone's fate depends on the cartel's tasks being performed on schedule.The only good news about this film is that is features a variety of experienced actors. But that's not enough to redeem all of the problems that plague what had the potential to be a memorable crime thriller. As for the bad news, there's plenty of it.The movie involves a number of flashbacks, but unlike Slumdog Millionaire or Pulp Fiction, the non-linear approach doesn't do much for this film.  It's filled with tiring dialogue and scenes that seem to go on forever.  To distract you from the pointlessly long scenes, the camera is always panning around, and there's too much atmospheric background music.  Most of the action is off-screen until the movie is almost over, and the torture is unnecessary considering the cartel's hostage plan can work without it. The ridiculous coincidence of what Conrad's family members do for a living is already hard to swallow, let alone the pointless complicated smuggling plan.Raymond J. Barry and Ray Liotta bring some talent to the film, but are totally underused. Emilio Rivera steals the show as the devilish kidnapper, but sadly his performance will go unnoticed since this film will get little attention.  As for the main character Thomas Conrad, I have no idea why Joel Mathews was cast as the lead in this movie. He had only been in one full-length film plus a short by the same director; the 12 year old playing his daughter actually had more screen experience. His performance was just terrible.Any tension that isn't wasted in the movie builds up to a twist, and it's a weak one. As the seemingly relevant flashbacks continued, I was hopeful that a dark spin was coming a la Session 9 or Jacob's Ladder. So when the twist is revealed (and it's not original), you're left saying ""Wait... that's it?"" It's such a let down that you're forced to believe it's so brilliant and subtle that you missed something. Well, you didn't.The only reason I'm not giving the film one star is because of Emilio Rivera, Raymond J. Barry, and Ray Liotta. The sole special feature is a 12-minute behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews. Watch this online before you consider buying the DVD or Blu-Ray. If you're a fan of Emilio Rivera or Ray Liotta, it's worth watching online once, otherwise give this one a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJHIWS34WQ40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJXO4NC#wasThisHelpful","R3SJHIWS34WQ40","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original score for Cocaine Cowboys was composed by Jan Hammer, the same musician who created the theme for Miami Vice as well as the TV show's weekly music.  The album has almost all of the original music from the movie, including the second track which was the sample for ""Cocaine Cowboys"" by rapper N.O.R.E.One issue I did have is that the song that plays when the documentary's title pops up and the intro credit rolls isn't on this album, and it's a song that some people may specifically want. Look up ""Cocaine Cowboys Theme Song 01"" online and the first result is a video with an incorrect mixtape cover. It's neither on the Rick Ross mixtape nor the official movie score album. Also, the full album download price for only six songs at 17 minutes of music seemed a bit high. I understand the pricing for individual tracks, just seems like the full album cost should have been lowered. But overall, this is a good soundtrack, and worth buying if you're a big fan of the documentary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37P9DA1BHRTYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AJ9ZLA#wasThisHelpful","R37P9DA1BHRTYJ","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good compilation of old-school style Bachata. Just keep in mind that despite the album title, these are mostly songs from early 2012. Even though I prefer modern Bachata (Prince Royce, Aventura, Xtreme), I still enjoy the traditional sound from time to time.What's great about this album is that most of the artists are established, unlike some of the compilations with just a bunch of unknown Bachateros. ""I Love Bachata 2013"" has Yoskar Sarante, El Chaval, Frank Reyes; a good number of artists with hit songs recently and going back to the 90's. You also get a bit of the modern Bachata sound thanks to tracks like ""Por Mentira"" by Grupo Vena.  My only complaint would be that a few songs such as those from Kiko Rodriguez, El Chaval and Luis Segura are from 2011. At least two of the songs (by Truhanes and Emocion) were on the radio back in 2010. So just know that it's not all 2013 music.This is a good collection of songs if you like the older Bachata style. The entire MP3 album on Amazon costs less a Starbucks Frappuccino, so there's no reason why you shouldn't buy it now if you like Bachata.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1WIXMY12KQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR9IX6C#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1WIXMY12KQE","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for established Bachata artists like Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, or Hector Acosta, this album may not be for you. But if you want some good Bachata from groups that are still underground, DanDote Bachata 2013 is a decent compilation of songs.Most of the songs are enjoyable, which is a surprise because many bachata compilations of unsigned or up and coming artists aren't that good. My only real complaint is that you can only tell who the different artists and groups are if they shout their own name out, otherwise the MP3s don't mention the specific singers.  Even though the album isn't Aventura-quality, I can listen to a playlist of all the songs on repeat, except for the title track ""Dandote"" (terrible off-key singing).Aside from the poor title track, and the record label misspelling the album name on the cover, I thought this was a decent collection of Bachata songs. Overall it's a good album considering the artists are mostly unknown.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NENPSVY4O20Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076GCF9U#wasThisHelpful","R1NENPSVY4O20Y","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fiesta Latina is a decent compilation when the price is less than $4.00 for an MP3 album download, just don't expect more than a couple of big name artists.  Out of 21 tracks, about half are from late 2012 and 2011, so it's not exactly all 2013 songs.If you favor Dominican music, there are five Merengue tracks and four Bachata songs. The rest of the album is mostly Latin Pop, and a little bit of Spanish Reggae and Romantikeo. The best song on the compilation is easily ""Echale Salsa"" by Ciclon Cubano, but it's also from 2011, so it's not especially new. The one track that should have probably been left off of the album is the ""Gangnam Style"" track by Miss Evelyn, it's just outdated now. Most of the artists on this compilation are from the same record label, so you're not really going to get any recognized artists. At only 20 cents a song, it's worth getting as a playlist.

"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11OJAD2YOOGJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CT04T6#wasThisHelpful","R11OJAD2YOOGJZ","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Abducted is about what you would expect for a movie made for TV.  The film was first broadcast on Lifetime as ""Layover"", but the name was updated apparently so that the DVD might appeal to a broader audience. The DVD cover features a member of the cast (Tara Erica Moore), but it in no way reflects any parts of this movie. For the most part, Abducted is a cross between ""Taken"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada.""Abducted follows the story of a pampered executive of a luxury hotel chain who constantly mistreats her personal assistant. After her plane trip is diverted by bad weather, the mean-spirited exec ends up at a cheap hotel in Detroit. She becomes tangled up with Russian sex traffickers, and it's up to her assistant, her security chief, and the FBI to save her.The good news about Abducted is that it's actually shot fairly well by a first time director, with good lighting and color correction.  Which is a surprise considering this was a film by Asylum, responsible for such past gems as ""Snakes on a Train"", ""Transmorphers"", and ""Titanic II"" (I'm not making this up). Film veteran Lauren Holly does a decent job as the snarky executive, and most comments from women I've read seem to be excited by Joe Lando being cast as the exec's security chief.The bad news about Abducted is that it isn't any different from most low-budget movies that go straight to DVD. The story isn't very memorable, most of the acting is average at best, and a great deal of what happens in the movie is laughably unrealistic (the clues about the abductor's hideout in particular).As a Lifetime Network movie, Abducted is noticeably geared towards a woman audience, but I think guys like myself could still enjoy. Amazon doesn't list the rating, it's TV-14 for violence (no nudity, occasional b-word).

"For being a noticeably low-budget flick that was destined to go straight to video, Conned is a halfway decent crime thriller. But a mostly inexperienced cast and average writing is what separates this film from other low-budget cult classics.Conned tells a story of scheming, power grabs and betrayal in the Boston crime underworld. The film follows a variety of two-bit dysfunctional criminals that square off against one another and the police, leading up to a fixed horse race that could potentially leave someone rich.The good news is that Conned has a bit of good cinematography, and some of the shots are slick and clever. The shootout and robbery scenes are okay, considering the budget.  It also offers an interesting twist on crime flicks, which is the introduction of a heist crew and other characters that communicate in American Sign Language (those scenes are subtitled). For this being only the second directing gig by Arthur Luhn, who himself was born deaf, he did a decent job with the shoestring budget he had to work with.The bad news is that Luhn tries too hard to style Conned after Guy Ritchie movies. The emphasis on cleverly-named characters, the type of music used, and the shooting style are noticeably influenced by ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" as well as ""Snatch.""  Too many members of the cast were either first-timers in film, or had little feature film experience, so the performances are partly what would keep this from ever becoming a cult classic like a Ritchie/Tarantino flick. Aside from a few funny moments (like the ""gamma rays"" running joke), there's nothing special about the film's dialogue or story in general.There area also odd changes in the film's look from scene to scene. Interior shots like those for the intro are great, as are a couple of interestingly-lit shots (warehouse scene, billiards scene), but some of the exterior shots look like they were filmed with a handheld cam with no color correction done in post production.Overall, Conned is worth watching once if you're a fan of crime movies. Because this is a low-budget flick by a guy that was a newbie director/writer at the time, you also have to cut it some slack. So don't expect ""The Departed"" by any means, but it's better than your average straight-to-Redbox or Netflix crime movies. Amazon doesn't list the film rating, but there are shooting deaths, cursing, and nudity. Give this one a watch before you decide on buying the DVD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QZFBOK64FLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008IG0ADA#wasThisHelpful","R32QZFBOK64FLP","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barrio Tales is a horror anthology that seems to be modeled on 1995's ""Tales From the Hood"" but with a Mexican spin. If you're a fan of campy horror, at least one of the film's three stories may satisfy, but Barrio Tales is otherwise not a memorable flick.The anthology is tied together by two American teens that venture to a Mexican border town in search of drugs. Just as with Tales From the Hood, a creepy storyteller spins several dark tales to his audience.The first story, which involves revenge through black magic, drags along far too much. It's filled with weak dialogue, and missed opportunities as far as how the payback on the wrongdoers is administered.  The third story deals with a group of rednecks that abduct Mexican day laborers in order to torture them, but the volume is turned up a bit too much on how the characters act.The best offering on Barrio Tales is easily the second story about a cannibalistic taco truck owner. It's certainly predictable from the start, but it's also very campy without apology. There's a decent bit of gore, and the murderous taco chef adds some dark humor with his over the top persona. So if you're a fan of campy or shlock horror, ""Uncle Tio's Taco Truck"" makes Barrio Tales watchable.The biggest difference between Tales From the Hood and Barrio Tales is that the Spike Lee flick offered stronger messages, and had a much better wraparound. With Barrio Tales, the tie-in with the narrator isn't surprising. For being a low-budget flick, Barrio Tales is about on par with most straight-to-DVD flicks. If you're a diehard horror fan, it's worth watching once.  If you only casually watch horror movies, or stick to theater-quality stuff, you might want to pass on this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T5I4FQPGQEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2MLZ0A#wasThisHelpful","R25T5I4FQPGQEC","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Very British Gangster is one of the most underrated and beautifully-shot crime documentaries available. What distinguishes this documentary from most others is how it's directed. Far from the typical gritty hand-held guerrilla style of documentary work, this film is filled with brilliant cinematography and effective crane shots. The British rock soundtrack is an excellent backdrop to footage of the seedier sides of Manchester.Dominic is no Tony Soprano; despite the flashy suits and manicured appearance, his home life seems to be fairly working class. Where Noonan loses credibility is with his entourage, which is almost exclusively made up of teenagers. It calls into question not how dangerous Dominic is, but if he's as powerful as others make him out to be.It's still impossible to deny his family's reputation, as the film reveals Manchester's major reaction to the death of one the infamous Noonans. His constant court appearances serve as a testament to his alleged criminal activity, and some of the things that this gangster confesses are shockingly honest and revealing. So while it's hard to say exactly where Dominic Noonan ranked on the totem pole of British gangsters, it's safe to say that this was a well-shot documentary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMNHHTH33WMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CQS7II#wasThisHelpful","R2HMNHHTH33WMW","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prince Royce #1s is a ""best of"" album with tracks from Geoffrey's first two CDs, and a few tracks that weren't on either. There are seven songs from his debut album, and six from Phase II. The catch, though, is that four tracks total are TV version repeats of what is already on the album.If you own both of Royce's albums, the only new tracks you will get from his album are two guest features. The two guest feature songs are the salsa track ""Sabes"" with Luis Enrique, and ""El Verdadero Amor Perdona"" by Mana.The good news is that the album does stick with his biggest hits to date, namely Corazon Sin Cara, Las Cosas Pequeñas, Incondicional and Mi Ultima Carta. This would be a good album to own as a compilation if you want his bigger songs on one CD. But mostly, what you're paying for is to have the three tracks that weren't on his previous two albums.

"Harry Brown is more ""The Crow"" than ""Death Wish"", as his vigilante behavior is mostly motivated by revenge. Whereas the Bronson film explores a man fed up with criminals in general, Harry's anger is largely focused on those connected to his friend's death. Another similarity is a subplot involving Emily Mortimer (Redbelt) as an investigator who suspects Brown is more than just a bystander to the killings.The film slowly heats to a boil until its halfway mark, when it begins to explore very gritty and violent situations. From the moment Harry attempts to buy his first gun, the movie pulls you in and never lets go. The film offers a few minor twists, and though the story isn't especially original, a terrific performance by Michael Caine easily carries it the distance.The cinematography is great, and the soundtrack is very stark and haunting most of the time. My only real complaint is that the use of CGI for certain scenes of violence was unnecessary.The only reason I'm giving Harry Brown four stars instead of five, is that the concept isn't very original. But it's still a very interesting look at a man who has reached his tipping point, played by an excellent veteran actor. This is a film worth watching for Caine's performance alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QST52FG2ZJEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UA8AIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QST52FG2ZJEH","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3RO0WZKLT7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZCUFPY#wasThisHelpful","R3B3RO0WZKLT7J","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good News: The soundtrack to House Party will instantly take you back to 1990, when parties were about dancing to good music. The 80's and 90's were about remembering certain periods of our life by the songs that were big at the time, and this soundtrack has jam after jam reminding us of that era. The soundtrack is more than worth the cost just for the ""Surely"" jam by Arts & Crafts (Groove: ""I'm getting those digits"").Unfortunately, one of the hottest tracks from the movie isn't on the soundtrack. The most memorable scene of the movie is easily the dance battle between Kid 'N Play and the ladies, set to the classic ""Aint My Type of Hype"" by Full Force (who also appear in the movie as Stab, Pee Wee and Zilla). I would suggest this CD to anyone who enjoyed the movie, but just know in advance that ""Aint My Type of Hype"" does not appear on the soundtrack for some odd reason.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWX5ZJXHHDXBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026WZM7Q#wasThisHelpful","RWX5ZJXHHDXBH","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tried to cut Flatline some slack, for the simple fact that it was shot on a low budget. But despite the decent cinematography, it lacks in too many ways to make it worth recommending.Flatline tells the story of how death and regret plague a young man's life. It begins as Marc pleads with emergency room doctors to keep his father alive after a car accident, and provides a backstory through the use of flashbacks.  Although the movie itself was shot well, there are simply too many things that make it difficult to enjoy.The story and dialogue for Flatline is average, at best. While some of the cast had worked in television or straight-to-DVD movies, many of the Dallas-based actors had very little experience, even if they had the right look. The most unusual decision in casting seems to be that they choose a guy in his 30's with no film experience to play the lead role as the troubled teenager. Film veteran C. Thomas Howell, who has apparently worked with Flatline's director many times before, only gets a few minutes of screen time.If you're not a fan of slow-burning dramas, Flatline isn't for you. The film drags on, despite a few tense moments as well as attempts at lightening things up with humor. The only redeeming aspect of Flatline is the plot twist at the end, but even that doesn't make up for an otherwise dull movie.The twist itself is a bit of a ripoff of a 2005 Marc Forster film, which I won't name outright because it would give away the ending.  There are a few subtle hints at what the plot twist may be throughout the movie, at a minimum you'll know that one is coming.  Flatline would have worked as a 10-minute short movie. But at almost an hour and a half running time, I don't think that I would recommend that anyone sit through the whole thing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RT33ENH9HSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VJ5BX4#wasThisHelpful","R28RT33ENH9HSB","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scary or Die has its moments as a collection of short horror movies, but each story included is either entertaining or forgettable. It takes a page from Creepshow in that you're treated to a variety of different stories, although there's no single tie-in that really connects them. The only real link between each short is that characters overlap, though sometimes in a fun and subtle way that you may not catch at first.The less you know about the plot of any of these stories, the more you will enjoy the movie. What surprised me most was that Scary or Die was shot on a shoestring budget, but visually it's a great horror movie. The directing and cinematography were surprisingly good, especially the great colors and visuals of the Koreatown story, Teujung's Lament. If you're a fan of gore, Scary or Die shouldn't disappoint. Not every segment of the film offers up blood or violence, but those that do should satisfy most horror fans.The highlight of Scary or Die, without a doubt, is ""Clowned."" If you're a fan of clown horror flicks, just this short story should be enough to get you to rent the DVD. It's got a better story than the other segments, and the makeup effects for the eventual killer clown was terrific.My main complaint about this movie is weak dialogue and story lines. Some of the stories are fairly boring, outside of the actual gore moments. ""Re-Membered"" was disappointing because the writers noticeably recycled the idea for the fictional horror flick ""Cleaver"" from the HBO series The Sopranos. And the final segment of the movie, Lover Come Back, felt like a pointless addition (even if it supposedly tied the movie together).DVD extras include short interviews with director Michael Emanuel, and actors Corbin Bleu, Bill Oberst Jr., Hali Hudson, and Shawn-Caulin Young. Other extras include a couple behind-the-scene looks at the making of the anthology, and the makeup effects used.Overall, Scary or Die was a fun watch. A few of the segments were honestly boring and dragged on, but they made up for it with great visuals, blood, and some seriously unexpected plot twists (there's no way you can see a few of them coming). If you're a diehard fan of horror movies, you should absolutely give this one a rent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1A4KXTK6MDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A5H9K6#wasThisHelpful","R2G1A4KXTK6MDD","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After watching a string of sub-par horror and slasher movies from Redbox, I didn't expect much from Wreckage.  But in the end, it was a decent little movie night flick.  Despite its shortcomings, Wreckage was actually a fun watch.Wreckage tells the story about a group of young people from rural North Carolina that make their way to a remote junkyard after breaking down on the highway. What they don't realize is that a convicted killer from the next town over has escaped prison, and is making his way towards them. Victims are picked off one by one as they try to discover who is responsible for the killings.Wreckage is a low-budget movie, so don't expect theater-quality performances. Most of the cast worked in television rather than movies, and a few hadn't acted before Wreckage, so the acting is slightly below average. Fortunately the older and more seasoned cast members make up for the film's lack of experienced actors.The story itself isn't anything special. The film's ""twist"" is predictable about halfway through the movie, with some foreshadowing even earlier than that which gives you a clue as to what the twist may be.All that having been said, Wreckage is still entertaining. Even though the story isn't that great, the writing for the dialogue is surprisingly good. For this being David Frigerio's first full-length film screenplay, he put together some clever speaking scenes.There's a decent little bit of gore, although a few of the murders take place off-screen. But what makes Wreckage an enjoyable horror flick is that they managed to keep it funny where it counts. Scoot McNairy steals every scene he's in as the backwoods owner of the junkyard. While the whole ""ignorant hillbilly"" character is a little outdated, Scoot constantly delivers the best lines of the movie, with perfect comedic timing. Even after the credits finish rolling, there's a funny extended scene with him which I'm convinced was half-improvised.Not sure if I'd buy the DVD, but Wreckage was definitely worth a rent. It's not exactly theater-quality, but if you're a horror fan looking to have a fun evening with a B-Movie, you should check it out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH7IGPYZLWH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070ZDMYE#wasThisHelpful","RSH7IGPYZLWH2","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every once in a while, you rent a straight-to-DVD horror flick, and get surprised with a decent movie. Parasitic, on the other hand, is so awful that I can't imagine how it even wound up on DVD in the first place.Parasitic is the story of what happens when a group of night club co-workers are trapped in a building as they become infected by an alien organism. And while the story itself isn't very original, it may have actually been spun into a good movie, as opposed to the total train wreck that is Parasitic.Tim Martin, the film's writer and director, has served on the special effects crew of over two dozen major movies. We're talking X-Men, Spider Man, Hellboy, AVP, Apocalypto. So it's hard to understand why someone who has been involved with so many blockbuster movies could be responsible for such an awful horror flick.First off, the ""acting"" in Parasitic is so bad that it's painful to watch. 90% of the cast had never appeared in film or television before, and it shows. Virtually all of the cast is from the Tampa area, I can only imagine that they were friends of the director, and appeared in the movie without getting paid. The exception is Bianca Holland, who I actually recognized as a fairly established Hip Hop video model. Based on her appearance, it's also no surprise that less than 15 minutes pass before Bianca's character has removed her shirt and bra (because she wasn't feeling well).The eye candy couldn't save this movie, though. The sound quality was horrible, and I was constantly reaching for the remote to adjust the volume. The lighting was bad, and the cinematography was equally dismal.As if it couldn't have been any worse, there were the plot holes. In the opening scenes, a delivery boy goes on a sushi run for the club manager, as the late afternoon sun still shines. When he arrives at the restaurant, he gets an impatient text message from the club manager with a 1:30PM time stamp (2008, at that). Moments later the delivery boy shows up to the club with the sushi, and suddenly it's 2:30 at night, just as they're shutting the bar down. There are continuity errors in movies, and then there's just plain lazy filmmaking. Add to that the fact that almost no one at the bar had a cell phone, and the manager would inexplicably lock everyone inside of the venue with no way out until she was ready to leave for the night.There are only two redeeming features of this movie. The first is the CGI work done for several scenes. The second is that Tim Martin did an amazing effects job on the fully-matured parasite towards the movie's conclusion. In the final scenes, you literally feel as though you're watching a totally different movie. Terrific work was put into the design of the creature, the animatronics, and the final set. Which makes it all the more confusing as to why the previous hour and 10 minutes of the movie are so boring.This movie is terrible. The special effects plus the eye candy thanks to Bianca Holland are not enough to make me recommend even renting this film. I have no idea why anyone would even consider buying this on DVD.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEB0JVHYNI2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N31YAW#wasThisHelpful","R3CEB0JVHYNI2X","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once in a while, a horror fan can stumble across a hidden gem at Redbox. Junkyard Dog is not one of them. A weak story and over-acting plague what could have otherwise been a decent low-budget serial killer flick.Junkyard Dog is about a cannibalistic serial rapist that preys upon young women in rural Tennessee, until he is discovered by an FBI agent looking to redeem herself after a lapse in her career.Despite being filmed with a low-budget, the set design of Junkyard Dog is decent, as well as the visuals and color correction. But that's not enough to save the film. Most of the actors in the movie go way over the top in their performances. I've been a fan of Vivica Fox for over 15 years now, yet she sadly gives a ""so where's my check"" acting job in this one. Film veteran Brad Dourif has his name opposite Fox on the DVD cover, but he gets maybe a grand total of five minutes of screen time.The story is neither original nor particularly memorable. Some of the scenes, such as FBI Agent Samantha Deatherage interrupting a country hoe-down, are so bad they're laughable.  If you're a gore hound, there are no real scenes of killing or torture a la Hostel, only scenes that reveal the killer and his captive munching on stir-fried human meat. There are numerous rape scenes, which I could have lived without.  The film is also billed as being inspired by real events, although no amount of searching online actually reveals what those supposed events were.Writer and director Kim Bass had a terrific career writing for In Living Color, Sister Sister, and Kenan & Kel. So it's bizarre that such a successful writer who made those 90's TV shows popular would try his hand at horror flicks. I honestly couldn't recommend that anyone give this one a rent, let alone buy the DVD. It's also worth pointing out that EVERY five-star review for this movie on Amazon was written by someone who only reviewed one product: this DVD. So buyer beware.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNSO0J4SYHEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079ZWULG#wasThisHelpful","R3HNSO0J4SYHEN","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For being a straight-to-DVD movie, Uninhabited is surprisingly excellent when it comes to the cinematography. Otherwise, it's a pretty standard haunting flick, just with a different setting than other ghost movies.  Uninhabited is about an attractive young couple that take a vacation to a deserted coral island on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. But it isn't long before Harry and Beth discover that they may not be alone.Despite this being a low-budget movie shot with a skeleton crew, the visuals really stand out. The footage of the Queensland, Australia beach is beautiful, and makes for an interesting setting to a ghost movie. Uninhabited marks Aussie director Bill Bennett's first return to shooting a feature film in over eight years. So it's refreshing to see this quality of directing for a simple horror flick.The bad news is that the concept of the film isn't incredibly original. While most haunting movies don't take place on a deserted island, the general plot ideas come off as familiar. The first half of the film, there's a genuine feeling of suspense as you try to figure out what is actually happening to the couple, and why. But there's a bit of an easy cop-out as to how the audience discovers the island's secret, and by that point, the suspense sort of fizzles out.Uninhabited was billed as being ""inspired by a real-life incident,"" which is pretty vague. Only after some digging was I able to find out that writer/director Bill Bennett had a fearful experience when staying at a similar deserted island with his brother and their girlfriends years ago. Bennett never goes into detail about what happened, but cryptically states that there was someone or something on the island with them. So it's a bit misleading that any of the more dangerous elements of Uninhabited had ever occurred in real life.Despite being a newbie actress when this film was shot, the beautiful Geraldine Hakewill offers a surprisingly good performance as Beth.  The same can't be said for actor Henry James, which isn't a surprise considering Uninhabited was his first and only feature film to date.  He comes off as a surfer that was cast only because of his looks, which unfortunately hurts the film overall.If you're a diehard fan of supernatural horror movies, especially those with a revenge theme, Uninhabited is worth renting or watching online. Just don't expect Gothika, or The Grudge. It's a slow-burning movie, so if prefer a fast-paced horror flick, Uninhabited isn't for you. I'd say give this one a watch first, before you consider actually buying the DVD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDTWYFJZBNO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063DOV76#wasThisHelpful","R2DDTWYFJZBNO2","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coffin was shot on a shoestring budget of only $600,000. So in all fairness to the filmmakers, you can't expect a horror or thriller of the same quality as Scream or Jacob's Ladder. If you're a diehard fan of Kevin Sorbo, or horror movies in general, it's worth a watch. Otherwise, casual fans of psychological horror flicks may want to give this one a pass.Coffin is the story of a Jack Samms, a man who discovers that his wife and her lover are buried in a wooden box with less than 75 minutes to live. A mysterious stranger offers Jack the opportunity to save his wife, as streaming video shot from the ""coffin"" reveals what could be her final moments alive. As a duo of detectives gain clues into the disappearance of the missing wife and her lover, Jack must play ever card that he has in order to win the game of cat and mouse that he's been pulled into.Despite being shot on a ridiculously low budget, the creators of Coffin were able to cast Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly in X-Men), and Kevin Sorbo of ""Hercules"" fame. The rest of the cast is largely made up of actors that have worked on short films, straight to DVD movies, and the occasional TV show. In other words, the performances in Coffin won't be scoring any movie awards.The story itself isn't especially original. Coffin borrows elements from Saw 2, with an incredibly similar ""twist"" to the 2010 thriller ""Abandoned"" with Dean Cain and Brittany Murphy. So while the twist ending is somewhat predictable, Coffin at least throws one final curveball in the end that the audience won't see coming.  The film has its moments early on, but more than a few scenes just come off as filler.Coffin was written by Kipp Tribble, who also appears in the film as a seasoned detective who likes to play by his own rules.  Tribble shares a Director's credit with Derik Wingo, who also appears in Coffin as a junior Detective. Both have worked mostly as uncredited film extras during their respective careers.  So even though neither is a terrific actor, you have to cut them some slack, as they're relatively new to having as much dialogue as they did in Coffin.Monica Giselle and Moksha McPherrin appear in the film as not much more than eye candy, although I can't complain considering both are gorgeous women. Their inclusion in Coffin does follow a theme to the film's casting, though, which is that many of the actors were veterans in makeup, wardrobe, or special effects in other movies.DVD extras include behind the scenes plus interview featurettes, although the jump in sound levels for both was a bit annoying (seemed to be recorded with a basic handheld digital camera). The behind the scenes look does give plenty of insight as to how they shot the ""coffin"" scenes, and how demanding many of the filming days were.Audio options include a director's commentary by Kipp Tribble and Derik Wingo, though it's noticeable that they're videoconferencing from different cities as they record it. The commentary was interesting in that you learn a great deal about the locations used, their experiences with the different actors, and how brutal some of the 15 hour shoots were.If you love low-budget thrillers, are have a thing for Kevin Sorbo, Coffin is worth a rent online or through your local Redbox kiosk. From the interviews, I know that the two directors put a lot of time and energy into what had to be a low-budget movie, but I honestly wasn't impressed. You definitely want to give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FD42IMB24GO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087Q24A8#wasThisHelpful","R1FD42IMB24GO2","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BVLTK2CVM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SPFB06#wasThisHelpful","R1BVLTK2CVM0","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Across the Line (also known as The Exodus of Charlie Wright) isn't quite movie-theater quality, but stands out as one of the better straight to video flicks I've seen in a long time.The film tells the story of Charlie Wright, a California businessman that has defrauded others out of billions of dollars. Wright takes flight to Mexico where he's pursued by the FBI, Tijuana gangsters, and Russian mafia mercenaries.For being straight to DVD, the film is shot extremely well. Great visuals of Mexico, plus a solid movie score. Director R. Ellis Frazier, who himself lived in Mexico for a number of years, takes a page from Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" with interesting color correction styles. Frazier's talent shows in this film, and could be the next Antoine Fuqua if given a better budget to work with.The film also features an interesting cast of actors. Aidan Quinn appropriately comes off as a shell of a man, as the lead character Charlie Wright. But it's Andy Garcia who steals the show, in an excellent performance as aging Mexican crime lord Jorge Garza. His role is complemented by Danny Pino, who I became a fan of from his days as Armadillo Quintero in The Shield. For being almost 50, Gina Gershon as Garza's wife looks just as hot as she did in Showgirls, though she doesn't get much screen time. The rest of the cast is rounded out by experienced actors such as Corbin Bernsen, Raymond J. Barry, Luke Goss and Bokeem Woodbine.The plot itself is fairly simple, but it ultimately works thanks to a few quality performances and its theme of redemption. Don't expect too much if you're an action junkie, as shootout scenes are limited. Across the Line is a step up from La Linea, the last Frazier-directed movie I watched. But due to a low budget, it's definitely not on the level with Traffic or Man on Fire.If you like crime dramas with a bit of meaning behind them, you should absolutely check this film out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GG0QOACYNICY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EJ2QBO#wasThisHelpful","R1GG0QOACYNICY","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing to know about Tenderness is that it's a crime drama, not an edge-of-your seat thriller. While it does offer suspense from time to time, don't expect Silence of the Lambs.What I found most interesting about this movie were the compulsions by the major characters. A self-destructive teen obsessed with a murderer, a young man obsessed with killing girls, and a weary detective obsessed with keeping the young man behind bars.In the film From Dusk Till Dawn, we get glimpses of compulsions by Tarantino's character. With Eric in Tenderness, those compulsions are amplified. We're able to see the wheels turn in his head whenever opportunities for him to murder present themselves. He battles his inner demons with a sense of confliction so apparent that you can see it in his face. Those feelings, as well as the disturbing vibe of his admirer, make for an interesting movie.The movie isn't a cult classic, of course. There are a few plot holes, as well as established actors who get only moments of screen time. My only real complaint is that we're given a sense of how disturbed the two lead characters are, but the film never delves into what made them that way. Eric doesn't seem to require state-mandated therapy for chemical imbalances, so the audience never fully understands what motivates him to kill.If you're looking for an exciting crime drama, this may not be for you. If you're looking for something more in the way of a subtle psychological thriller, Tenderness is better than most movies that go straight to video. Worth the Amazon rental, in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9G59V0IFRR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AN9RY4#wasThisHelpful","R3M9G59V0IFRR2","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harry Brown is more ""The Crow"" than ""Death Wish"", as his vigilante behavior is mostly motivated by revenge. Whereas the Bronson film explores a man fed up with criminals in general, Harry's anger is largely focused on those connected to his friend's death. Another similarity is a subplot involving Emily Mortimer (Redbelt) as an investigator who suspects Brown is more than just a bystander to the killings.The film slowly heats to a boil until its halfway mark, when it begins to explore very gritty and violent situations. From the moment Harry attempts to buy his first gun, the movie pulls you in and never lets go. The film offers a few minor twists, and though the story isn't especially original, a terrific performance by Michael Caine easily carries it the distance.The cinematography is great, and the soundtrack is very stark and haunting most of the time. My only real complaint is that the use of CGI for certain scenes of violence was unnecessary.The only reason I'm giving Harry Brown four stars instead of five, is that the concept isn't very original. But it's still a very interesting look at a man who has reached his tipping point, played by an excellent veteran actor. This is a film worth watching for Caine's performance alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DX2YCMEZBLHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OCJLF6#wasThisHelpful","R2DX2YCMEZBLHK","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabriel's Bakersfield performance is what made me a big fan of this incredibly underrated comic. I tend to gravitate towards Latino stand-up comics, and it's difficult to escape the gravitational pull of someone so fluffy.Gabriel has really fresh material, his sense of timing is great, and the man simply has tremendous stage presence. With the exception of Pablo Francisco, Gabriel is also one of the only Latin comics that brings great impressions and voices to his performance.I'm personally okay with swearing during a comedian's performance, but Gabriel coincidentally keeps his material fairly PG. So if your kids are a bit too young for the likes of George Lopez or Juan Villarreal, this DVD would make for safe family movie night.If you enjoy laughing out loud, treat yourself to this DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1QUYIDLNFGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041I8RUM#wasThisHelpful","R1U1QUYIDLNFGI","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The infamous diner scene is one of the most powerful moments in film, which fits amazingly with Duran Duran's ""Ordinary World.""Drugs, traitors, hitmen, dealers and gangster wisdom.

"Never Down is one of those independent films completely under the radar. What attracted me to the film was that it starred Robert LaSardo, who I've been a fan of for 15 years now.Nip/Tuck is really what expanded LaSardo's fan base, but most of his past film work has been as a background character. Never Down is one of the few movies that really allows him show his range, but it's weighed down by the low budget and weak story.LaSardo offers up an emotional performance as Rico, a stressed husband and father who dabbles in crime to make ends meet. An extramarital affair puts more strain on his situation, leading up to the moment when he's imprisoned for five years. Which leads to one of my complaints about the film; there's virtually no focus on Rico's imprisonment. Rico battles his inner demons and suffers the pain of being apart from his daughter, but we miss out on a good opportunity to experience it at his most vulnerable. So while Rico spends five years in prison, the film dedicates only two minutes to his entire experience.Other movies that include the ""father back from prison"" concept such as ""Blow"" and ""He Got Game"" have already tackled the story line. So while LaSardo gets to flex his acting chops a bit, the story itself isn't very original nor interesting.As far as the casting, there were two choices that stood out. The first was Kamal Ahmed of Jerky Boys fame, cast as Rico's arresting officer. The other was the famous author Kurt Vonnegut Jr, making his third and final acting appearance in a film just before passing away. Vonnegut gets a few minutes of screen time as something of an angel on the shoulder of Rico and his daughter.If you're a fan of Robert LaSardo, Never Down is a good opportunity to watch him as a lead actor. What puts my review at three stars is the low production value, and the lack of an interesting or highly original plot. It's nice to see LaSardo step away from the background, so watch this film at least once if you're a fan of his work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2LHO9D2R8IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029JANYI#wasThisHelpful","R1W2LHO9D2R8IV","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cry of the Owl is a slow-boiling psychological thriller that doesn't offer the nonstop suspense that ""Seven"" might, but still delivers by the film's end.The movie is based on a 1962 novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the novel that ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" film was based on. Cry of the Owl was eventually shot as a movie in 1987 by a French director, and was finally re-shot in Canada in 2009. What stands out about this version is the cast, which includes Julia Stiles and British actor Paddy Considine.I've long been a fan of Considine, and he plays the neurotic Robert Forrester brilliantly. I've seen Considine in a number of roles where he plays an assertive character, so it's interesting to see him as a shell of a man and something of a coward. This was also my first introduction to the stunningly beautiful Caroline Dhavernas, who plays Forrester's sadistic ex-wife.The plot overview for this movie by Amazon is a bit sensational, particularly in which character is ultimately labeled a stalker. The film starts quite slow, but eventually pulls you in with the bizarre psychological problems most of the major characters seem to deal with. It's not until the second half of the film that the story picks up steam, and you're thrown unpredictable moments and twists along the way. There's a great deal of foreshadowing used in the movie, which seems appropriate considering the superstitions surrounding owls.Cry of the Owl is not ""Silence of the Lambs"", so if you're looking for a constant thrills with a crystal-clear ending, this isn't it. I found it to be intriguing and suspenseful, with dark psychological undertones as the film hit its stride. While the conclusion isn't open-ended, it allows the audience to make their own interpretation of the story and the true significance of its characters.My guess is that people will either love or hate this film, depending on their appeal to film noir. I thought it was a step above your average Redbox rental, and I think anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers should watch it at least once.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274GZWEF9PX3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037Z963C#wasThisHelpful","R274GZWEF9PX3G","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're looking for a movie that is Academy Award quality, you're in the wrong place. But if you're in the mood for a cheesy but kick-ass action flick, Legendary Assassin absolutely delivers.I love deep movies that make you think. But like any red-blooded man, sometimes I just need an adrenaline-pumping action movie. This film offers great fight sequences, sprinkles of intentionally corny humor, and bone-crunching action. The fight scenes were choreographed by Nicky Li, an official member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team for over 15 years. If you've seen Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, or any other Jackie Chan flick, you've witnessed Li's fight choreography.The film was shot surprisingly well, and has a terrific music score. I was impressed with the fact that this was the directorial debut of Wu Jing AKA Jacky Wu, who also plays the lead character Bo, a soft-spoken stranger who carries a mysterious bag everywhere. Legendary Assassin also marks the acting debut of the amazingly beautiful Hong King singer Celina Jade, starring as small-town police officer.If there's any drawback to the movie, it's that there is virtually no character development or backstories. While most of the film's characters are memorable, and have their own unique vibe, you really don't get to learn anything about them. There's not much to the plot itself, and even Bo's motive for being an assassin isn't revealed until the film's conclusion. But despite that minor frustration, there's also a small twist revealed in the final scene that I was totally surprised to have not picked up on earlier in the film.The film was shot in Hong Kong, and the dialogue is Cantonese with English subtitles. The DVD extra features include two short featurettes: The Making of Legendary Assassin, and The Characters of Legendary Assassin. The ""making of"" feature offers great insight as to why the lead character wears a wolf fang around his neck, and also provides details on the actors and production.Overall, I thought this was a great action flick. It was intentionally shot to be kind of corny like an 80's martial arts movie, but the fight scenes definitely deliver. If you're a fan of Jackie Chan flicks, you should absolutely check out Legendary Assassin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23OAUCQF9AANA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RHZW8K#wasThisHelpful","R23OAUCQF9AANA","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spiderhole had the potential of being a memorable horror flick, but is weighed down by recycled story ideas. Four young London artists decide to squat in an abandoned home, where they ultimately find themselves trapped and at the mercy of a mysterious figure.The only redeeming aspect of Spiderhole are the visuals. The house is certainly creepy and foreboding, and the color correction of the movie is spot-on. Beyond that, the film itself just isn't that interesting. Spiderhole cobbles together ideas from horror movies such as Hostel and Shadow, with a musical score that's noticeably patterned after the closing music from Saw.From the start, the film seems to go in a supernatural route, but eventually shifts to a slasher flick. Gore lovers will be disappointed, as moments of torture occur largely off-camera. It would seem that if you're trying to appeal to Hostel fans, the last thing that you should do is tone it down. When one of the squatters has his eyeball removed, the scene comes off like a botched Penn & Teller illusion. It's moments like that which suggest the director skipped out on the gore in Spiderhole simply due to a low budget.The worst thing about Spiderhole is the wasted opportunity for a chilling backstory. Only in the second half of the film are you offered glimpses of what fuels the mind of the movie's antagonist, but it's far from enough to satisfy the audience. The conclusion offers about as close to a ""twist"" as it can, but even that is too weak to validate the movie as a quality horror flick.There's a semi-sex scene (no nudity), an abundance of whimpering, and a tedious plot that will have you occasionally glancing at the time. The only reason I'm not giving Spiderhole a single star is because director Daniel Simpson put together a visually interesting film. It's the recycled story, wasted opportunities, and lack of gore (in a slasher movie) that make Spiderhole a flop. If you're a diehard horror aficionado and can stream it online for free, it might be worth a watch. But it's not worth paying a one-time fee for an online rental, in my opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMPRX0UMP4NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EPHX7O#wasThisHelpful","R2DMPRX0UMP4NA","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pinprick is a psychological thriller that takes its time, but rewards the viewer by the conclusion. The movie tells the story of a teen that allows a Hungarian criminal to live in her closet. Although her mother doesn't know about the secret guest, the man eventually finds a way to insert himself into her life as well. As time passes, he becomes more and more manipulative, and his motives remain shrouded in mystery.The good news about Pinprick is that the film retains a creepy edge for most of the movie, and there are more than a few scenes that offer plenty of tension. The mother and daughter are also both portrayed by actresses with a good bit of film experience.The major drawback to Pinprick is that it has the tendency to drag on. Despite this being a thriller, there are definitely stretches that made me debate whether watching the film was a mistake. In other words, don't expect ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" from this low-budget film. It's also a bit frustrating that much of the film goes without a backstory as to how the stranger befriended the teen in the first place.One of the most redeeming aspects of Pinprick is the ending. I had several early ideas about how the film would conclude, yet all of them turned out to be wrong. That's not to say that the unpredictable conclusion is totally original, though. While the story is somewhat different, it uses an almost identical concept from a 1999 Josh Klausner film (don't Google it until after you've seen Pinprick).If you're a diehard fan of psychological thrillers, Pinprick is worth watching once. But if you're a casual fan of slow-boiling thrillers, you might find much of the film leading up to the conclusion to be a bit dull.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW8UXKLF71GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006P4I3LI#wasThisHelpful","RRW8UXKLF71GM","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try to cut some slack to first-time directors, especially when it comes to horror flicks. But Secrets of the Clown was just a big disappointment.The lighting for the film was terrible, and it's noticeable even from the opening scenes. There are a few interesting cinematography tricks in the film, but it still looks as though it was shot with a camcorder. It was also annoying that virtually all of the film's dialogue was either mixed down poorly, or was a voiceover recorded in post-production.The story itself wasn't interesting, it dragged on forever, and the ""twist"" couldn't redeem it. There's a good bit of gore/blood, though it was pointless when so many of the kill scenes take place off-camera (seemed more because of the budget, than for effect).The acting was pretty bad, considering the overwhelming majority of the cast had no feature film or TV experience. There are two extremely hot women that offer up some eye candy, in what are probably the only scenes in the film that actually keep your attention.I really wanted to give this movie a shot, but it dragged on, and it just wasn't as interesting as most recent horror flicks. It's not worth paying for an online rental, in my opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I62QIO24JWN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NGCKMU#wasThisHelpful","R1I62QIO24JWN1","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a British crime flick that packs the punch of Snatch or Lock Stock, Sugarhouse may not be what you want. It burns slow, has an extremely lean plot, and uses a skeleton crew of actors. But what it lacks in fast pacing, it makes up for in acting, tension, and plot twists.Sugarhouse follows the story of a middle-class Brit who attempts to make a mysterious purchase from a paranoid crackhead. But as the deal progresses, a violent and tatted-up local drug dealer ends up in the mix only to complicate things further. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse game with a dangerous conclusion.The good news about Sugarhouse is that it always maintains a gritty feel, even when it plods along. The cinematography is good, and the cast does a solid job. Andy Serkis does such a convincing job as a thugged-out coke dealer that I hardly realized it was the same actor from the Lord of the Rings. Ashley Walters also does a spot-on performance as a crackhead with personal demons that go beyond drug addiction.What surprised me the most was that as the film progresses, the characters gain more depth. By the movie's end, revelations are made which offer a different perspective on the characters involved.My biggest complaint about the film is that it tends to drag on. There's a bit too much dialogue, and the movie just seems to plod along with only a few brief interjections of violence. It felt as though the entire film could have been stuffed into a one-hour TV show with better effect.As a fan of foreign crime thrillers, I thought Sugarhouse was definitely worth the rental. While it lacks the spark, witty dialogue and action of a Guy Ritchie flick, I still found it enjoyable. Definitely gives this one a watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWC7CW1DJOT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P42YBS#wasThisHelpful","R2TWC7CW1DJOT0","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bachata 2012 would be a decent collection of bachata tracks for a party, but it's incomplete as far as hits go, and they aren't exactly 2012 tracks.  Many of the songs are from early 2011.  A few of the tracks such as those from El Chacal, Jose Lopez, and Los Generales came out back in 2010.  Only a handful seem to be from the beginning of 2012.If you're an Aventura fan, the standout song on the compilation is ""Cuentale a el"" by Angeles De La Bachata. Unfortunately, you wont find any Prince Royce, Romeo Santos, Marcy Place, or Xtreme on this album. So if you're looking for some fresh 2012 Bachata hits, this may not be the album you want.  But for only $6.99, it's still a good deal as far as MP3 albums go if you want a mixed playlist of Bachata songs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2FTHDM2JFI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XVBA4G#wasThisHelpful","R1X2FTHDM2JFI9","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a fan of gore or torture movies, A Darker Reality would be right up your alley. Otherwise, nothing about this horror flick really stands out. A Darker Reality tells the story of a sadistic maniac, nicknamed ""The Ghost"", that kidnaps and tortures young women until he ultimately kills them. The Ghost drops hints to a persistent Detective, who is teamed up with a beautiful psychiatrist in order to track down the serial killer.If you're into movies along the lines of Hostel, or are a diehard gore-hound, a Darker Reality delivers. There's a good bit of blood, torture, and nudity. Aside from that, there's nothing memorable about this movie.The story was written by a first-time writer, shot by a first time director, and it shows. Most of the cast had only appeared in television, or in shorts. The performances, especially those of the detective and his psychiatrist partner, are soap-opera quality. Daniel Baldwin noticeably puts some effort into his role, but it just doesn't seem like a good fit.My biggest complaint about this movie is that it heavily borrows from other horror flicks. A Darker Reality lifts ideas related to the killer's journals in ""Seven"", a plot twist from one of the ""Saw"" movies, and an entirely too similar character idea and twist from ""Just Cause."" The final twist of the movie is foreshadowed early on, but even then it's fairly predictable.I suppose it's worth watching once if you're a diehard fan of horror movies, there are certainly worse straight-to-video horror flicks out there. But unless you're big into gore and torture, you might find yourself let down by the recycled concepts. Give this one a watch before you consider buying the DVD.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23CBVJHP2CVWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C9YZKA#wasThisHelpful","R23CBVJHP2CVWR","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned this phone for a few years, and was initially happy with it.  But after a while, problems started creeping up.The first issue was that the ""Replace Battery"" message would continue to appear, even when the backup batteries were replaced.  The second problem was that the screen would occasionally light up, and the phone would promptly ""reboot"" and delete all of the saved information and incoming calls. I'd have to go back through and reprogram everything.The final and biggest problem is that I eventually couldn't hear anything through the receiver.  The speakerphone would continue to work, and people could hear me speaking, but the audio would simply drop out two minutes into a phone call.  Now I'll have to buy a new phone, although I may think twice about buying RCA if their other products have similar technical issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYC9AVQTQ6N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NWG4GO#wasThisHelpful","R2SYC9AVQTQ6N7","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Outcast was definitely better than I had expected it to be.  The film tells the story of a woman and her son hiding out in a Scotland slum from would-be killers that have tracked them from Ireland.  Things become complicated further when the son becomes the love interest of a beautiful young neighbor, and the witchcraft-practicing mother has to protect her son from what she considers a number of threats.The film was shot well, with good cinematography and color correction.  The film was shot on location in Edinburgh, and the visuals are kept dreary to stay in sync with the theme of the movie.  The film is light on gore, but there's enough to satisfy most horror fans.  The audience isn't given much of the film's ""monster"" throughout most of the movie, which seems to help make this a film just as much about the characters as offering up scares.One of the best aspects of the film, though, is the cast.  I became a fan of Scottish actress Kate Dickie after watching her performance in Red Road back in 2006, and she doesn't disappoint in Outcast as the overprotective mother.  The absolutely gorgeous Hanna Stanbridge makes a great film debut with Outcast as Petronella, neighbor to the mysterious couple practicing ancient magic next door.  The remainder of the cast is rounded out by seasoned film veterans from Scotland and Ireland.My first complaint about the movie was that there wasn't enough backstory.  As the film progresses, you learn more about the ancient Celtic magic being practiced, but you are never given the full picture.  It's hard to completely understand how all the puzzles fit together, or the significance of some of the characters (such as the man who must give permission for the hunters to search for the beast in Edinburgh).The only other problem that I had with Outcast was that it wasn't completely original. While I had never seen a film focused on Celtic magic, the plot itself seemed to borrow from a few other movies.  Outcast seems to borrow a few elements from Let the Right One In, but it certainly will remind horror fans of Stephen King's 1992 film Sleepwalkers.  There's a son that changes into a beast, on the run from town to town with his overprotective mother.  While the two movies aren't identical, it would have been nice to see a completely new spin on the concept.Overall, I thought Outcast was a good film to watch.  It was certainly shot and cast better than most straight to video horror flicks that I'm used to, with a slightly better story.  If you're a horror fan, it's definitely worth a watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5WHMZ0XJSGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VW4VCG#wasThisHelpful","R1V5WHMZ0XJSGR","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about this tea kettle is that it boils water faster than other electric kettles that I've owned in the past.  What I also like about this unit is that it has an automatic shutoff, as I would sometimes leave my last kettle on for too long, and wouldn't realize that it was continuously shutting on and off after the water was gone.The only thing that would make this a five-star product is if it whistled, as I enjoy being able to turn an electric tea kettle on, and hear it the moment that it's ready to pour.

"Politics of Love largely comes off as one of Tyler Perry's more serious flicks, but without the life lessons and funny moments.  The film tells the story of an unlikely romance between an Indian American Obama supporter, and a Black Republican, shortly before the 2008 Presidential election.The good news is that the film was shot well.  Decent cinematography and color correction, and a nice soundtrack. The film is also rounded out with a seasoned cast of actors.  Veteran actress Loretta Devine and funnyman Gerry Bednob lead the pack of seasoned actors in this Rom-Com.Having been a fan of Brian White for eight years now since his role of Tavon in The Shield, it was interesting to see him play a character outside of what he's normally cast as.  He and the beautiful Mallika Sherawat were obviously cast (and shown in skimpy clothing) to appeal to an audience that wanted to see exactly that.The problem with Politics of Love is that the plot is too simple and predictable.  Man and woman meet, fall for each other, run into problems, and ultimately... Well, how do most movies like this end?  The dialogue is uninspiring, it's easy to predict what direction the film will go in, and it's simply more Rom than Com in this romantic comedy.  Many of the characters are overexaggerated, and you never really feel much for Aretha Gupta's parents as you should.Politics of Love is worth watching if you're a serious fan of Brian White (I know some of you ladies are), or the gorgeous Mallika Sherawat.  Otherwise, I found it mostly unfunny and sticking to a recycled formula for romantic comedies.  Unlike the Tyler Perry movie ""I Can do Bad All By Myself"", which also starred Brian White, Politics of Love was a box office disaster.  This movie is worth a watch online if you enjoy the work of any of the main cast members, but I don't suggest buying the DVD until you've seen it at least once.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP0CJRQB7RRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W48KHU#wasThisHelpful","R3GP0CJRQB7RRV","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For over 10 years I have developed hundreds of websites, gotten them ranked well on Google, and have made my clients a great deal of money. But like any experienced web marketer, I'm always looking for fresh ideas for my clients and for myself.Free Marketing is a good primer if you're new to promoting yourself on the web. Where the author succeeds are the chapters on what he is most experienced with, which is email marketing. Web newbies are provided with useful tips on newsletters, mass mailouts, and automating your marketing emails.The book also offers useful ideas related to blogging, marketing through the use of original content, and the benefits of promoting your business through Youtube videos.Having purchased at least 50 sales, marketing and web promotion books through Amazon, I was surprised that the author was probably the first to print an extremely important technique related to Youtube promotion. Google owns Youtube, and tends to mix videos into many of its search engine results. That being the case, a business owner can find their videos on the first page of Google for a search of their target keywords. It's an effective strategy that I've been surprised more web marketing authors haven't emphasized.Having said all this, the book is unfortunately light on the type of marketing tips that could help most. The author admits that he isn't particularly savvy when it comes to social network marketing (Facebook, Twitter), so the chapters on how to capitalize on using them are lacking. Other books dedicated solely to social networks provide case studies that prove just how powerful promoting yourself through those websites can be with respect to free marketing.The author's lack of knowledge on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) also hurts how comprehensive a book on free marketing could have been. While the book does provide a simple breakdown of how Google ranks websites, the author paints a grim picture of maintaining a positive ranking.But the truth is that I have clients that were first on Google eight years ago that are still first on Google today, simply because they meet Google's largely unchanging criteria for ranking well. There is no ""Google Code"" (as he puts it) to crack, it really boils down to proper on-site optimization, original content, and scoring quality backlinks from other sites. Despite the author's dislike of informational websites, my clients have generated millions in revenue thanks to having deep sites with interior pages that also ranked well for highly-specific keyword searches (long tail keywords).The author's misfires on SEO are most obvious when he suggests leaving comments on blogs with links back to your site to improve your ranking. Most experienced web marketers, however, know that almost all blogs include ""nofollow"" attributes to links that appear in the comments area. A nofollow tag instructs search engines to not place any value on the link, making it worthless unless someone actually clicks on it. Long story short, blog comment links won't help you at all with respect to Google ranking, nofollow was created to discourage spammers from trying to game search engines. [update on author's response at end of my review].Overall, this is a good primer when it comes to web marketing, but it's definitely not a comprehensive book. Having a focus on SEO and social network marketing would multiply the results you get from this book's techniques. If you're new to web marketing, buy it, but also supplement it with other books such as:SEO: The Ultimate Web Marketing Guide, Web Marketing All-in-One Desk Reference For DummiesContent Marketing: Content Rules, Get Content Get CustomersSales Copy & Psychology: Ca$hvertising, Words that Sell, The Copywriting Sourcebook, The Copywriter's HandbookSocial Network Promotion: Likeable Social MediaI hope that you found this review helpful, feel free to comment if you have any questions you want answered with regards to SEO and web marketing.[2/11/13 Update. The author of this book commented on my review that he made no reference to using blog comments to improve search engine ranking. So in response, I have included in the review comments the chapter, page and paragraph of where he suggests this technique. It is literally the first suggestion of Chapter 16 ""Get Found on Search Engines.""][3/27/13 Update. The author has since deleted parts of his earlier reply, and offered a hasty explanation. But here are the facts: 1. His book was published late 2011, 2. Nofollow was introduced in 2005, 3. Blogs like Wordpress from version 1.5 (released 2005) and onward used nofollow for comment links. This wasn't something that occurred a year or two before his book came out, his suggestion had been outdated six whole years before publishing.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QG6YS6EAYVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118034716#wasThisHelpful","R19QG6YS6EAYVA","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film.  Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.  Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame.  The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film.  Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts.  Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow.  Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise.  The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil.  International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico.  Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.There are two elements of the film that stand out.  The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs.  The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.The other element is the final car chase of the film.  Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving.  The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course.  To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption.  While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up averageacting at best.  I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much.  While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them.  Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene.  But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours.  While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.  If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series.  Definitely give this one a rent, or get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo to own one of the better movies in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S0X3XLBMD3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPYZQC#wasThisHelpful","R17S0X3XLBMD3W","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She teaches the reader how to create content that your target audience would like, what mistakes to avoid, and how to make it personal.  Even for experienced web marketers, the chapter on Social Media Marketing Tools is an excellent resource on where to promote your content.The author follows that with an equally strong chapter on blogging, with a terrific list titled ""20 Easy Business Post Blog Ideas."" She also includes some excellent suggestions for Wordpress Blog plugins, several of which I immediately installed on client blogs. Even as an experienced blogger, I picked up some great new ideas from this chapter.The book's chapter on Microblogging (Twitter) is worth its weight in gold.  It teaches you what to Tweet about, how often to Tweet, and details 17 awesome Twitter apps to make promotion easier. And kudos to the author for stating the truth about Quality vs Quantity when it comes to Twitter followers.Where the book falls a little short is the chapter on Facebook promotion.  It left a lot to be desired if you were already familiar with Facebook, but an excellent supplement is ""Likeable Social Media"" by Dave Kerpen.Throughout the book, the author only makes one small reference to the connection between original content and Search Engine Optimization.  So I'll stress something she doesn't.  Adding original articles to your website is a great way to pick up new visitors via Google, especially if you write about very specific topics.  Otherwise, any helpful content (be it a video or article) on your site can serve as good bait for links from other websites, and that's what can help you rank better on search engines.Overall, this is a great primer for people at the beginning or intermediate stages of web marketing.  Even if you're an advanced internet marketer, I promise that there are still a few resources and tips that make this book a must-buy.  Bottom line: if you want to connect with customers and make more money, add this book to your shopping cart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BP42UA6DW4FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071743812#wasThisHelpful","R2BP42UA6DW4FU","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before buying the book, first understand that is mainly a primer for online sales.  It's geared towards people interested in using automated systems to sell things such as e-books.  The emphasis of the book is on selling a products that can be downloaded, or using similar products as freebies to encourage bigger sales down the road.In other words, it's not a practical read if you owned a restaurant, had a retail business with no online shopping cart, or offered services such as construction.The good news about this book is that it offers a variety of starting tips to anyone that is totally new to web marketing.  The author provides basics on establishing a web presence, and how to get the most from selling products such as e-books.But overall, the book doesn't deliver on it's suggestion that you can ""master"" online marketing, even if you were to strictly sell e-books through an automated system.Because the book was written in 2007, it obviously makes no references to social network marketing through Facebook and Twitter.  Which would make the book up to date in 2007, but reading it today means you would miss out on some of the most effective methods of internet marketing.The book is also outdated with respect to suggestions for ranking better on search engines.  The author stresses the importance of the keywords meta tag for your website, but Google completely ignored that tag two years after the book was published.But even as a 2007 primer for web marketing, the book is still incredibly weak on the topic of Search Engine Optimization.  The author barely scratches the surface on proper SEO, and only dedicates about four pages to discussing the subject.The book does offer some decent tips for newbies on the marketing efforts that range from sending newsletters, to participating in message board discussions.  But much of this information, as well as better tips on writing copy, can be found in more recently published all-in-one web marketing books.Over the last 10 years, I've developed over 300 websites, and have marketed them online for my clients.  Even if a web marketing book brings little to the table for me, I often give five-star reviews if I think it will be helpful to others.I purchased this book from Amazon without the understanding that it's targeted towards people who want to sell information online.  It's a somewhat practical purchase for anyone selling e-books, but I wouldn't recommend it anyone not specifically in that industry.If you are interested in online marketing, I would recommend the following books (in no particular order):""The Ultimate Web Marketing Guide"" by Michael Miller""Likeable Social Media"" by Dave Kerpen""Ca$hvertising"" by Drew Eric Whitman""The Copywriting Sourcebook"" by Andy Maslen""Content Rules"" by C.C.

"There's really no need for a plot review.  If you're reading the reviews, chances are you've seen this excellent cult classic.  I purchased the Blu-Ray version of the film in early 2011, and getting to experience it in high-definition is a real treat.I was pretty late to the party with this film, having not seen it until the late 90's.  When I realized it was on Blu-Ray, I had hoped that the transfer would be good.  I wasn't let down.  The colors are excellent, and the amount of detail that you get down to the beads of sweat is just insane.I can't comment on the differences between the Director's cut and the original, as I didn't have the first version on VHS or DVD.  So that aside, this is still one of my favorite Blu-Rays to watch in HDTV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JBOLFDXFLIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OONQ9O#wasThisHelpful","R25JBOLFDXFLIJ","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wearing Drakkar since high school, and have received nothing but compliments from women when I have some on.  Despite the fact that Drakkar is a popular brand, it's still underrated enough that you will stand out from the guys wearing CK1, Cool Water or Nautica.I was recently chatting outside with my lovely (but involved) neighbor, when the wind picked up.

"If you're a fan of rap from Spain, Frankattack is easily one of the better albums released since the late 90's.  I've been a fan of Mala Rodriguez, Arianna Puello, Nach Scratch and SFDK for over a decade now, but didn't discover this great album until 2007.Frank T stands out with his signature monotone sound, but what really makes this album great is the top notch production.  The beats were created by some of Spain's hottest producers, who throw samples over East Coast style breakbeats to amazing effect.The one track that is alone worth the price of this album is Nuevo Ser, an addictive head-nodder with Ari Puello on the hook.  If there's any downside to the album, it's that there's literally no way to get the CD unless it's an import.I bought the import from Amazon back in 2007, though, and it was worth the extra cash.  If you're into Madrid Hip Hop, definitely add this album to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BI78FJR1C9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HOMS2W#wasThisHelpful","R30BI78FJR1C9Q","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent collection of traditional Bachata tracks, although the album title is misleading.  Billed as the Best of Bachata 2011, many of the songs are from 2009 and 2010.  Only three or four songs on the album were released in 2011.Also keep in mind that this is a compilation of traditional Bachata, as opposed to songs with a Pop or R&B edge to them.  So don't expect any Toby Love, Aventura, Marcy's Place, Xtreme or Prince Royce.Amazon doesn't list the artists along with the tracklisting of songs, so here you go:1. Alejate de Mi - Opalo2. Dime Que Me Quieres - Nicold Frias3. Desesperado - Zacarías Ferreira4. Atrevete - Joe Veras5. Parece Mentira - Raulin Rodriguez6. Escobita Nueva - Yoskar Sarante7.

"Over the last decade, I've developed hundreds of websites, marketed them for Google, and have helped make my clients millions of dollars.  Likeable Social Media is hands-down one of best marketing books I have read in a very long time.  There's no fluff. No filler.  Simply terrific advice on how to make the most of social networking in order to improve your business.The best part about this book is that it's absolutely stuffed with case study after case study of how businesses have triumphed (and suffered) by harnessing or ignoring the power of engaging people through social networks.While many books on marketing simply offer up theory, the author has noticeably poured a significant amount of time into researching real examples of how social networks can make or break a business.  You're treated to concrete examples of what works, and what doesn't.  Granted a few case studies are from the author's major corporate clients, but the information he provides is still extremely useful.With the conclusion of each chapter, you are offered a quick recap of ""action items"" that make it easy for you to plan your marketing efforts.I'm no stranger to marketing through social networks, but the author has definitely given me great new ideas.  A few involve how to encourage more people to become fans of a business page, I'm a little ashamed I hadn't thought of them sooner.What's interesting is that the author doesn't simply help you to positively engage existing fans, but how to deal with unhappy customers.  While some of the info is Customer Service 101, he offers a fresh take on how a bad situation can be spun into great free promotion.Not every technique outlined in the book is brand-new.  But many ideas haven't been addressed in other books on social network marketing, which makes this book worth its weight in gold.  Take my advice as a longtime internet marketer: add this book to your cart right now if you want to engage potential customers and improve your business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ODHIBR8EDDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071762345#wasThisHelpful","R31ODHIBR8EDDF","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For over 10 years I've designed hundreds of websites, promoted them online, and have literally made millions for my clients. I've invested in dozens of marketing books to create an edge for myself and for my clients.With all of the positive reviews that I read for UnMarketing, I had high hopes for this book, and what it would offer. By the time I finished reading it, I was incredibly disappointed.Just reading the book is a chore. It's poorly organized, filled with fluff, and the author constantly wanders with his topics and unhelpful anecdotes. It's written as though the author composed the book in one sitting, without any real planning. His constant use of footnotes to inject humor is distracting, made worse by the fact that he's honestly not that funny.With respect to marketing techniques, the author brings nothing new to the table. The author credits much of his success due to videos going viral, but this does nothing for the business owner reading the book. Having a video go viral is something that simply can't be forced. His end advice seems to be to create as many videos as possible, and keep your fingers crossed.As far as his Twitter suggestions, he also isn't telling us anything new. As pointed out by another Amazon reviewer, the author's own Twitter account seems to be made up of a significant number of reciprocal follows. And truth be told, Twitter follows should always be about quality vs quantity.Furthermore, some of his advice is flat-out bad. He knocks Youtube, suggesting that it's better to host videos on your own website. Never mind the fact that Youtube allows for greater ease in a video becoming viral, thanks to ""favorites"", easier sharing, and the ability to embed videos onto blogs and message boards. For business owners, the right wording in your Youtube title can also mean finding your video on the homepage of Google for your target keywords.The author simply doesn't seem to be any type of expert on marketing. The honest truth seems to be that he capitalized on the surprise success of one particular video. He offers no new nor sound advice on how to duplicate his own success. The parents who uploaded the ""Charlie Bit Me"" video are just as qualified to write a book on non-traditional marketing.I've given plenty of four and five star reviews for marketing books that were at least good primers for newbies, even if I had a good grasp of their suggested techniques already. I consider this book to be a waste of time, and I will gladly suggest other marketing books that have concrete results of generating more revenue for my clients.[11/2/11 Update: kudos to the author for commenting on this review without giving it a thumbs down in the process, which I can't say for some authors I've reviewed on Amazon]","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYU9SCKK81ZWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=047061787X#wasThisHelpful","RYU9SCKK81ZWB","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since most people browsing this product have seen this film, this review will focus on the Blu-Ray's special features and video quality.First off, the visuals of the remastered Blu-Ray are amazing.  Watching the Blu-Ray in Hi Def offers you vivid colors, and detail that allows you to spot the smallest beads of sweat on character's faces.  While the new edition does offer 7.1 audio, it's more noticeable with respect to the film's music, not as much to spoken dialogue.The Blu-Ray comes in a special Steelbook metal case, and includes 10 collectible cards with a variety of Scarface graphic artwork.  It also includes a bonus disc of the original 1932 film of the same name, which the 1983 version borrows a few elements from.The good news is that the Blu-Ray contains plenty of extras.  The bonus area starts with three-part featurette titled ""The Scarface Phenomenon,"" a mini-documentary that explores how the film became so ingrained with pop culture.  It features commentary from Scarface fanatic Eli Roth of Inglourious Basterds, as well as Cuban rapper Sen Dog of Cypress Hill.The World of Tony Montana offers an interesting look at the lives and lifestyles of the 1980's Cocaine Cowboys.  Everyone from DEA agents to local law enforcement comment on the film, as well as their personal perceptions of serious coke dealing.I was a bit disappointed that the TV Version segment only lasted a few minutes.  Clips of the rated R version and the TV edits are played back to back to comic effect.  While a funny addition, it could have been much longer.One of the most interesting featurettes is The Making of Scarface: The Video Game.  I'm a big fan of the 2006 Scarface PC game, so it was fun to get a glimpse of the voice actors involved with the project.  There is recording studio footage of  Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Ice-T, Cheech & Chong, Anthony Anderson, Michael York, Sen Dog, Tommy Lee, Ling Bai, Wilmer Valderrama, and Jillian Barberie.  The feature offers brief clips of project comments by several of the actors involved, from Michael Rapaport to James Woods.  Various executives of both Radical Entertainment and Vivendi also lend their insight on how the game reflected the spirit of the film, as well as Tony's own ""morals.""Not all of the extras are new features, however.  The Deleted Scenes segment is a great addition to the Blu-Ray, although it was available on previously released DVDs.  ""The Creating"" contains older clips of the film's producer and director discussing why most of the film had to be shot outside of Florida, and their struggle to avoid an ""X"" rating.In the bonus feature ""The Acting,"" there are interview accounts of how Pacino, Bauer, and Pfeiffer were cast for the film, and how those actors were able to prepare for their roles.  The Rebirth featurette includes comments from De Palma, Martin Bregman, Oliver Stone and Al Pacino on how the original 1932 Scarface provided inspiration for their own take on an epic gangster film.I only have two serious complaints about the Limited Edition release of this film for Blu-Ray.  The first is that there's still no audio commentary by Brian De Palma or Oliver.  My other gripe is that all of Pacino's interview clips were noticeably old.  While his comments were a solid addition to the Blu-Ray, it would have been nice to get fresh feedback.  Recycling clips doesn't just apply to Pacino, there are also a few segments that use noticeably dated footage of producer Martin Bregman.Overall, the Limited Edition Blu-Ray is an excellent film to enjoy in high definition.  The visuals are sharper than you've ever seen them, and there are plenty of bonus features to give you a better understanding of this cult classic.  If you consider yourself a Scarface fan, absolutely add this one to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0E19S0YDF8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019N94X6#wasThisHelpful","R1T0E19S0YDF8A","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's worth pointing out that most five-star reviews for this book are by people with only one review to their credit, or they got the book free through Vine (Look especially at the newest five-star ratings: all one-time-review Amazon accounts). I've also noticed new reviews automatically get 4-5 ""helpful"" votes the same day they go up. Despite this review being one of the few that actually goes into technical detail about the book, it's the most down-voted (though I received an interesting tip as to why all the ""unhelpful"" votes were cast within a 24 hour period). Moving on.....I have developed hundreds of websites over the last 10 years, optimized them for Google, and have made millions for my clients. But I also enjoy checking out the latest SEO books for fresh ideas.Outsmarting Google is a good starting point for people new to Search Engine Optimization. But if you're already familiar with terms like anchor text or nofollow tags, this book won't offer any new SEO techniques.The good news about this book is that it's definitely more thorough than the majority of SEO books that I've come across in recent years. If you're unfamiliar with how Google ranks websites in its results, the book will provide you explanations that are fairly easy to understand.Another plus about this book is that there's an emphasis on how to prevent being penalized by Google, which few online marketing books seem to stress.For experienced webmasters and online marketers, Outsmarting Google doesn't bring anything new to the table. Most of the actual optimization tips are SEO 101 from six or seven years back: Create good title tags, and acquire quality inbound links. Put simply, there's nothing quite ""secret"" about the book's secrets.The most unusual inclusion in the book is the revealing of what the author considers to be one of his greatest SEO secrets. The secret turns out to be the use of ""long tail"" keywords for optimization purposes. I say unusual because it's the exact same concept that Chris Anderson popularized in Wired Magazine back in October 2004 that webmasters have been discussing online ever since.Another surprise was that the author recommends getting links to your website on Wikipedia articles for SEO purposes. It's common knowledge amongst online marketers that Wikipedia implemented nofollow attributes to all links on their site back in 2007. Bottom line, any external or reference link from a Wikipedia article won't help you at all with Google.The book also mentions a few popular sites with heavy traffic, but doesn't mention that they succeeded by virtue of their original and entertaining content, not any particular SEO technique.The originality and quality of content on your site can largely determine how well you score links from other sites (improving your Google rank). Some might get the wrong impression that using SEO techniques is what got certain sites to rank well, when it really boiled down to content.Overall, this is a decent primer if you're completely new to web marketing. While much of the book focuses on web marketing in general, and not SEO, it provides some useful ideas. But if you've been in online marketing for a few years, don't expect any new ideas.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK07P01FK0FME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789741032#wasThisHelpful","RK07P01FK0FME","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a Louisiana native, this is hands-down one of the best reality shows that I've had the pleasure of watching. I have a soft spot for the Atchafalaya Basin, and have always enjoyed many aspects of Cajun culture.What makes Swamp People stand apart from other shows is the terrific cast of characters, and the banter that takes place between them. Living in Southeast Louisiana means knowing someone who lives a stone's throw from a cast member, and can vouch for their authenticity. Conversations about Season 2 with locals will largely involve who their favorite hunter is, and it's never an easy decision (someone give the Guist Brothers their own show).If I had any complaint about the show, it would be that there are a couple of scenes in Season 2 that are noticeably scripted. From T-Rex being dragged in the boat already tagged (S2E8), to Bruce falling in the water (S2E3), there are a few groan-worthy moments. But that been said, Swamp People is still a far cry from the obvious acting I've seen in plenty of other ""reality"" programs.Season 2 covers a short time in the lives of real Bayou folk just doing their everyday thing. Gator hunting is much like shrimping down here in that it's a job that keeps the bills paid. What makes this show enjoyable is the unexpected, but mostly the camaraderie and conversations.I love that Season 2 offers a glimpse of just one of many cultures of my state to people worldwide. Definitely add this season to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A568W1GQGKH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ELVC84#wasThisHelpful","R2A568W1GQGKH7","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Choose follows the story of Fiona Wagner, a young woman who tracks down a serial killer that forces his victims to choose between one of two gruesome fates.  With the help of her detective father and a mysterious therapist, Fiona tries to discover the identity of the killer as he drags her into a deadly game of cat and mouse.The good news about Choose is that it's shot better than most horror flicks that go straight to video.  The cinematography, color correction and cast make it a step above most Netflix fare.  B-List movie veterans Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) and Bruce Dern (The Burbs) bring a bit of film experience to the show.The bad news is that the concept behind the film isn't terribly original.  Choose borrows elements from Saw, Untraceable, and Seven.  The killer's gimmick gets old fast, and isn't consistent throughout the film.  The strongest part of the film is the intro, compared to the conclusion, and isn't saved by a final plot twist.Katheryn Winnick is ridiculously hot as Fiona.  But tight undershirts aside, there's no nudity in the film.  There's little gore, although there are at least two scenes in the movie that would cause audiences to jump.Choose is worth watching at least once if you're a diehard fan of horror thrillers.  But I definitely wouldn't recommend buying the DVD until after you've given it a rental.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ1XEBBC37Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051PLR06#wasThisHelpful","R1YZ1XEBBC37Y","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is from: Eddie Griffin: Freedom of Speech (DVD)As a fan of Eddie Griffin, I had hoped that his Freedom of Speech stand-up special would be a bit more edgy than his other performances. But overall, too much of the material seemed dated, recycled, and just not that funny.Voodoo Child was easily one of his best performances, partly because of the originality, and also how introspective the material was. But in Freedom of Speech, Eddie goes as far as digging up decades-old Black jokes (""branch manager"", ""snow tires"") to weave into ""personal"" stories as filler.There's also some recycling of his old routine on how ethnic women treat their men when they come home from work. The jokes about sugar sandwiches are also noticeably lifted from Martin Lawrence.The crowd isn't feeling this performance as his other stand-up shows, and big laughs are rare. When Eddie breaks into jokes about mathematics and science, you can hear a pin drop in the theater.Freedom of Speech is worth watching once, but it's probably Griffin's weakest performance to date. Definitely give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCE0472ZN9YK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00118VEJ6#wasThisHelpful","R2DCE0472ZN9YK","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a British crime flick that packs the punch of Snatch or Lock Stock, Sugarhouse may not be what you want.  It burns slow, has an extremely lean plot, and uses a skeleton crew of actors.  But what it lacks in fast pacing, it makes up for in acting, tension, and plot twists.Sugarhouse follows the story of a middle-class Brit who attempts to make a mysterious purchase from a paranoid crackhead.  But as the deal progresses, a violent and tatted-up local drug dealer ends up in the mix only to complicate things further.  What ensues is a cat-and-mouse game with a dangerous conclusion.The good news about Sugarhouse is that it always maintains a gritty feel, even when it plods along.  The cinematography is good, and the cast does a solid job.  Andy Serkis does such a convincing job as a thugged-out coke dealer that I hardly realized it was the same actor from the Lord of the Rings. Ashley Walters also does a spot-on performance as a crackhead with personal demons that go beyond drug addiction.What surprised me the most was that as the film progresses, the characters gain more depth.  By the movie's end, revelations are made which offer a different perspective on the characters involved.My biggest complaint about the film is that it tends to drag on.  There's a bit too much dialogue, and the movie just seems to plod along with only a few brief interjections of violence.  It felt as though the entire film could have been stuffed into a one-hour TV show with better effect.As a fan of foreign crime thrillers, I thought Sugarhouse was definitely worth the rental.  While it lacks the spark, witty dialogue and action of a Guy Ritchie flick, I still found it enjoyable.  Definitely gives this one a watch before you consider buying the DVD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG98Q4Q893F5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NFNFJE#wasThisHelpful","RG98Q4Q893F5Z","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid collection of Bachata tracks, though the album cover put together by Machete music is misleading.  The album cover suggests that most of the tracks are recent, when some of them were only on the radio four years back.The stand out tracks on the album are easily the ones by Zacarías Ferreira, 24 Horas, Marcy Place, and Ivy Queen.  ""La Vida es Asi"" by Ivy Queen is catchy, and 24 Horas is a good listen if you like Xtreme or Bachata Heightz.Todo lo Que Soy is easily my favorite track by Marcy Place, but that song came out back in 2008.  La Luz De Mis Ojos by Elvis Martinez is money, but that also dates back to 2007.For some strange reason, Amazon doesn't list the tracks for this album so here they are:1. Vas A Llorar - Xtreme2. Laudano - Elvis Martinez3. Dame Tu Amor - Zacarías Ferreira4. Epidemia De Amor - Kiko Rodriguez5. 24 Horas - 24 Horas6. Aunque Estes Con Él - Luis Fonsi7. Cafecito - Carlos y Alejandra8. La Vida Es Así - Ivy Queen9. Todo Lo Que Soy - Marcy Place10. Perdóname - Daniel Monción11. La Luz De Mis Ojos - Elvis MartinezThis is a nice collection of songs for a party, just keep in mind that a couple of the tracks have been out for years.  This is a really good mix of popular bachata artists, and a nice album to add to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWPMDADEF8X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049E83MK#wasThisHelpful","R2JWPMDADEF8X4","A33EN2ZL2MS0CI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EN2ZL2MS0CI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My skin is combo, very sensitive, acne prone. I've tried many cleansers from most of brands that you see in department store. But just this one and Clarins Shea butter are my precious gems. While Clarins gives me a soft, pampering feel; Ole Henrikson gives me refreshing, clarify skin that I prefer to use it in the morning and Clarins in the evening.It has thick, creamy foam with mild scent of orange peel which makes me feel so relaxing. It cleans well and clarify my skin but does not dries skin out any bit. My skin is more radiance after using this, oil also takes longer to appear. There was few cleansers could give me the same result but in the long term, they started drying out my skin horribly.

"This is without a doubt my favorite Moody Blues concert. Like good Scotch whiskey these guys just get better with age. Although Ray Thomas is absent, the energy and song lineup in this concert are fabulous. This isn't a repeat of Albert Hall or Red Rocks. This concert gives us die hard fans some real treats. Higher and Higher performed by Graeme Edge is fantastic. Forever Autumn, December Snow. Sitting Comfortably. It's like they sat down and said, what songs haven't we done live, and what are the favorites, throw them in this concert, put in on a Blu-Ray with fantastic sound and you have one hell of a good concert. If you like the Moody Blues and don't have this in your collection you are really missing something. I paid $50.00 for this used. And I don't regret a penny.

"I'm a serious audiophile and was offered the opportunity to review this headset. I couldn't pass it up. And I'm glad I didn't. First, this is the only pair of headsets I've tried that connect via USB port, period. For me, that's not a problem. Considering the main objective here is for serious gamers, or folks that communicate on Skype or media networking. If that's your bag, then these have your name written all over them. If you just like listening to music through really good headphones, that are very lightweight, and comfortable, then these are for you. Another nice feature is the 7 foot heavy duty cord. Which is a braided cord encased in a vinyl covering for added protection. The mic is neatly seated in the left side of the headphone, invisible until you pull it down. And then it's right where is needs to be. There are three control switches also on the back left side. One turns on the cool blue lights. Which does nothing as far as making them sound better, but it sure makes them look neat. Truthfully, they look neat anyway. Then there's the volume switch, and the off and on switch. But the main thing is the SOUND quality. The sound coming in, and the sound going out. The sound coming in is superb. Excellent deep bass, with a good balance of mid range and highs. Nicely accomplished with a pair of 40mm drivers. Sound quality coming through the mic is also excellent. Using the mic with my speech recognition program not one word was missed. Nor has anyone had difficulty understanding me.  All in all the ARTIX is a well made product, where as much thought was given to comfort in design as overall quality. And when you consider the price point, it makes it a good value. So I have no problem recommending this product to anyone. And I do recommend this product.  Good job all around. And I've got to say this. Music just sounds great through these headphones too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30J5DRPMFQF6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R30J5DRPMFQF6F","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Sentey THOR X Headphones are exceptionally good over the head headphones. Starting with the overall construction quality, and the 40mm drivers, these headphones rock. As comfortable as they feel, they also feel almost indestructible.  I'm an audiophile and have had headphones that I've paid $300.00 for that weren't as good as these by a long shot. Plus, the inline control makes these very versatile for use with PC's, Stereo's, but even more importantly nowadays Smart Phones. With the inline control you can answer calls, pause, skip to the next track. These are really cool. But I digress. Again it's all about the SOUND. And these have it. I have three songs I use for testing speakers and headphones. And they will either blow the speaker/drivers or sound great. These passed at full volume on a 140 Watt Stereo System. Couldn't leave it that way long, but they handled it. Separation is great whether through my PC, Smart Phone or Stereo.  Another really nice feature is a padded carrying case. If you are an audiophile yourself or want to make someone really happy, pick up a pair of these. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and I almost forgot, these babies are noise canceling too. You just can't beat this deal on these headphones. The price for these in my opinion is well under their value, especially in comparison with much higher priced Headphones.

"DO NOT BUY THIS !!!! I purchased mine from Wally World and it lasted 1 year. One whole year. This is absolutely the worst Keurig made. If you buy it, you better make sure every pod you buy has a Keurig logo on it or it WILL NOT WORK. And even then no guarantee it's going to last. I paid $189.00 when I purchased this sorry contraption. Three years prior I purchased three of the earlier models, all of which are still functioning just fine. And they make coffee from any brand, including my own ground coffee. I strongly urge you to reconsider buying this piece of crap. I wouldn't recommend this to someone I hated. Keurig really got greedy with this model. Plus the carafe, is cheap plastic that is totally worthless. The only thing it's good for is filling up the water reservoir.

"Sherlock Holmes & Ian McKellen are probably two of my most favorite characters. Although the one being fictional. I was so much looking forward to this movie having been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"" all my life. A character so many have played with such great success. From Basil Rathbone to Robert Downey Jr. . However this movie portrays Holmes in a completely contradictory role as that of the original character, and further attempts to insinuate that everything previously written prior has been falsified by Watson. From his physical appearance to his case history all being fabricated by Watson.  All the while McKellen (Holmes) now suffering from old age senility,  having temporary reflections of his past, while tending his bees, adds nothing whatsoever but boredom to the story. The first half of the movie is very slow moving and quite boring. Laura Linney is cast as Holmes housekeeper and seems very out of place in the story. Speaking with an American accent, yet having a child with British accent. This again seems to add nothing to the story. There are a few moments when Holmes reflections are lucid and we see the Holmes we have come to know, but quickly dispelled by Holmes shortcomings as a detective. Once again as if the whole purpose of this movie is to shatter the image of Sherlock Holmes the character himself into something far less than what we have all come to love about the character... My recommendations of this movie are this. If you feel you must see this.. Rent it.. Don't waste money buying it, you will be sorely disappointed. I am. Ian McKellen is one of the greatest character actors of the last 30 years. I have no idea what purpose HE had in making this film. The writers of this film should be sued by Sir Arthur Doyle's estate for the way they portrayed this iconic character. Mr. McKellen should stick to fantasy films after this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8RCQAE5L0GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PIQYJI#wasThisHelpful","R3P8RCQAE5L0GF","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this to slave off of my bedroom DVR Comcast Cable box, through the ceiling into the attic and into the pool room. Not quite 100 ft., but right at 90 ft.  I had already maxed out on the number of receivers my home can handle with the X1 Platform. Having a 55"" TV in the pool room running CATV just wasn't cutting it. So with the aid of an HDMI splitter, I purchased this 100 foot Twisted veins HDMI cable, after carefully reading all the specs and REVIEWS, by other customers. This works FANTASTIC. No loss of signal strength, or audio.. Picture is perfect. This is very heavy duty cable. Best cable I've seen, or bought.. I also purchased this in 50 ft. length. And of course, same quality. Great product. I highly recommend this if you are in the need of HDMI cable above and beyond the normal length.. Great price too. Also comes with two extra connectors and 3 tie downs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFFP1ILLQ4W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX8Q3NM#wasThisHelpful","RHFFP1ILLQ4W8","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Whether you choose to use this with a GoPro camera or a Smart phone, this Telescoping extension pole, with it's breakaway tripod parts, will allow a number of variations for using and taking photos and videos. The Go Pro will screw right in. The SmartPhone clamps into a nice padded spring loaded clamping holder that will pivot 360 degrees. Very ingenious design. Really cool product.

"I purchased this for my Mom. She's at the age where getting in and out of the tub has gotten to be extremely difficult. My dad and I had looked at bathtub chair lifts initially, until I saw this. Then I realized even with a lift, we would need this. So I thought, lets try this first. All three of us have been very pleased with the results. My mom can now get in and out of the tub, mostly out, with little effort now. She is very happy with this grab bar. So my dad and I are too. So simple to attach. Very sturdy metal with a vinyl covering over the top. The wedge type locking grip makes this impossible to come loose if you tighten it down properly. I installed it in minutes. And I tested it myself. I'm 195 lbs of muscle, and once I locked this in place, I couldn't budge it. Excellent product if you have a loved one that needs assistance getting in and out of the bathtub.

"I was fortunate enough to receive this for a review. This is long overdue and a fantastic product. The ROKU as everyone knows that has one, is very lightweight, and easily pulled by the cables. Especially HDMI cables. I have several of these. And the only negative thing about the ROKU is they constantly seem to slip of the top of whatever they are sitting on if anything gets moved or dusted. These mounts make that impossible now. The mount for the ROKU allows you to slide the box in, attach it basically anywhere you want. In sight, or out of sight. And with the available remote control holder, again, it's right where you put it all the time. It slides perfectly into the holder that will mount with double sided tape to anything your heart desires.

"I purchased this after reading the reviews for all four variations of this brand. I expected this particular one to be the best value for the money. The only I found that was $70.00 more didn't have any different specifications than this one did. And the difference between this topper and Amazon's rated number one seller Pinzon, was the material it was made from, and the reviews I read. So I figured this had to be the best overall value. WRONG. I should have picked the one for $89.00 or less and gotten the same thing, by the same manufacturer. I was embarrassed at myself when this arrived for the choice I had made. I bought this to replace my original mattress topper which I have had for 2-3 years now. I bought it at Belk's and paid around $129.00 for it. It's so much nicer still than the one I just bought I feel stupid. So now, instead of having a new ""Marriot"" comfort topper for my bed, this will go on one of the guest beds. And by the way, I slept on it last night for the purpose of this review. It does not help cool down the mattress or dissipate body heat one bit. The baffling is weaved, not boxed. And the loft is maybe an inch. The texture is not soft, but almost rough feeling. I am very disappointed in this product. I had thought, since I too am a Veteran, and seeing this was a Veteran owned company that perhaps this was the real deal. It is not. When the FedEx driver showed up and tossed me the box from the truck I knew I had made a mistake.

"Bought this for my 82 year old Father. He loves it. This shoe horn is made of heavy duty plastic, which is fairly rigid. But not so rigid it would break, like some of the cheaper shoe horns I've seen, and like the one my dad had which did break. This one has enough pliability to it, that it should hold up for years of daily use. The length of this shoe horn is probably the greatest feature other than the quality. You can be standing upright and use this shoehorn. Which keeps you from having to bend over, and for elderly people like my dad, who lose their balance easily, it's great. This is really a great idea and a great product. Great price too. I couldn't recommend a product more highly than this for anyone needing a shoe horn.

"I really like this. I've been burning scented candles, and melting scented wax for years. This takes just a small amount of your favorite fragrance essential oils, with some water, press a button to add a little color, like a nice soothing Blue, or Red, maybe Yellow depending on your mood, and you have a perfect combination for dispensing a wonderful fragrance throughout the room. This Oil diffuser adds a nice touch of ambience as well as a nice fragrance, and only a hint of a whisper of sound. One button to turn on the diffuser, and one button to adjust the color. Really pretty at night. Great product, and a great way to sit back and just relax. And a little oil goes along way with this diffuser. Which is a big plus. This is one item I can highly recommend.

"All in all this is probably about the best overall combination case for protecting a phone I've seen. Once you slip on the back and front cover, your phone is very well protected. And even though very secure, it slides easily into the casing, and just as easily out. The back of the case has the kick stand that allows you to stand the phone upright or sideways. Then when you go mobile, slide the outer shell onto the phone with the clip attachment, and your ready to go. The case itself is lightweight, but hard as nails. This is a rather ingenious design, unlike any other I have seen. And at a great price for the amount of protection it provides. And the features. Really a great product. So if your looking for something that gives you a coupe of good options, with good protection for your phone, then this case will certainly do it for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IO7443UZUP6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W847AA4#wasThisHelpful","R2IO7443UZUP6D","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best Coffee out there, so much so I order 2 cases of the decaf, and 2 cases of regular every month. If you haven't tried Donut Shop coffee's yet, you don't know what your missing. And you can get this through Amazon's subscribe and save program as well. I have dinner parties fairly often and I have yet to have anyone not ask me, what kind of coffee is this. It seems everyone loves it. So, like I said, if you haven't tried it, order some and see what you think... Just darn good coffee.

They continuously show repeat after repeat of the latest Hollywood garbage, and overlook classic movies like this. Good movie with John Wayne in a more lighthearted role.

"This is the third product I've ordered from Hoont. And I've been satisfied with all three. This particular product works great, especially if you have pesky animals that you don't want foraging around your house or garbage cans at night. This motion sensitive device works in 5 modes, either with flashing lights, or a combination of flashing lights with or w/out an audible noise. You can set it for whatever purpose you need. It runs off battery and DC as well. But I can tell you, my neighbors who won't keep their dogs in their own yard, don't come in mine now. And possums and raccoons don't get anywhere near my garbage cans at night. So I'm very satisfied with my Animal Repeller. For that matter, it might scare off other things bigger than skunks and polecats..

"I rec'd my Soundpeats Blue-Tooth headsets this week. After I charged them for about 3 hours, and put them on. I was thrilled.  First, they fit better than any Blue-tooth headsets I've EVER tried. And they stayed in my ears. I've never been able to find any that would stay in my ears, or stay on for that matter. The way these are designed helps them stay on. They actually hug around the back of your neck and fit close into the ears.  I have never been able to wear ear plug type headphones or headsets unless they were the traditional over the head headphones. These are great. They pair easily with all my Blue-tooth devices simply by pushing a button. You can select the next track on your playlist, receive an incoming call, just by pushing a button on the headset. And the sound quality is very impressive, just as good as a regular set of stereo headphones. Soundpeats has a winner with this set of Wireless Blue-Tooth headphones. Great price, great product.. One that I highly recommend. As a side note,  I cut my yard wearing these, and I heard music, crystal clear, not my lawnmower. Even more, driving up under some trees that scratched me to pieces, the headphones never came off. I couldn't be happier with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GHZFPVP2Y20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUMPF1O#wasThisHelpful","R13GHZFPVP2Y20","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this not knowing exactly how long it would take before I rec'd it. Much too my surprise it came within less than about a month. All 6 seasons. 30 DVD's. I am in heaven. This is my favorite Western of all time. And Hugh O'Brian ranks up there with John Wayne as one of my favorite all time American hero's. Purchasing these as individual seasons is much more expensive than buying this Complete Set, so this is a truly fantastic purchase at $119.00. Just a GREAT price. I've waited forever for this. I couldn't be happier with this, I feel 50 years younger just watching these episodes. What a shame we've drifted so far away from the values displayed in the simpler times characterized by this show, and the values Mr. O'Brien himself stood for. Aim only too wound and not kill. Drink milk, not whiskey. Semper Fi Mr. O'Brian. And for anyone out there that loves these old shows, this is a wonderful way to continue watching TV. Thanks AMAZON for making this available. Thanks Mr. O'Brian for everything you've done in your life.

"I rec'd my Aduro Power supply unit about a week ago. This is a great device for charging just about anything that uses a USB port to charge with. It's small, and  has 6 convenient plug in's. I have been able to successfully charge my Smart Phone, my Zune MP3 player, my  Laptop's and my Blu-tooth earphones all at the same time. It keeps me from having a multitude of extra cords cluttering things up. And everything is right where I want them. It's really a great little power hub. Once I plugged it in, hit the power button to turn it on, all I did was start plugging in my different devices into the appropriate ports on the charger. I am completely satisfied with this very handy little box. I wished I had had this along time ago. I've gone through more blasted phone chargers than I can remember. Now I just use the USB cable. This is a great gadget to have around the house, and one I highly recommend in this world of Smart Phones, and devices that charge via a USB cable. Truly a great value. Also, when friends come over, especially guests staying over, they always seem to leave their phone chargers. Now I have something they can use to charge their phones with as well. And that is another added plus for my guest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVMUI5CIMZV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNSP07C#wasThisHelpful","R2AVMUI5CIMZV0","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this book. I've always been a BIG fan of the Bible, and a fan of Tolkien. The authors did a wonderful job in writing this book. Once I picked it up, I read it straight through. Although I suspect, they like myself, may have discovered God's deeper truth's in this Middle Earth trilogy , as Tolkien himself in my opinion, may very well have discovered for himself in The Bible, but they , as Tolkien, do not detract or add too it from his original story. They do add a great deal of spiritual depth to the story line however. And make this ""Finding GOD"" a genuinely satisfying piece of work in my opinion. One that I truly think anyone having had a spiritual connection with TLOTR trilogy with, would enjoy reading this book. I certainly did.

"I saw two very negative reviews posted regarding this particular lawn mower, all others were great. When mine arrived, it was 15 minutes late within the target window. Not bad. It arrived in a crate on a pallet. The driver had a lift gate and lowered the pallet down, used a pallet jack and placed the mower exactly where I asked him to. It took 10 minutes uncrating the mower, and about 15 minutes more hooking up the battery, steering wheel, and sliding the seat into place. I checked the oil, put gas into the mower. Then read the instructions. Afterwards cut my grass. The mower performed flawlessly. It handles well, great turn radius for tight turns, which is one of the biggest reasons I chose this mower. And at close to 15 HP it will definitely scoot you around the yard. This is a good performing mower. It feels solid underneath you. Prior to purchasing this mower like anything I purchase, I check out all the competitors and sales ads. This was the best in price and performance for the dollar. I am very pleased with this purchase. And of course having it delivered right to my front door is always a very big plus. I have no problem recommending this mower at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKIPO2QF550U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY2A1BM#wasThisHelpful","R3UKIPO2QF550U","AEZ0X08KA6GPH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEZ0X08KA6GPH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Again, being a solid piece of glass versus a piece of peel and stick vinyl you just clean the surface of your phone and basically press it on.

"This is a GREAT CD Burner for Home Stereo use. And unfortunately becoming one of the few available of it's kind. In this class and for this price range. This is an exceptionally fine product that gives normally, a good 5 years plus of service under normal daily usage and maintenance. So if you have cassettes, vinyl, or basically any other format that you can plug into this, either as a stand-alone, or part of a Home Stereo or Surround System, this Teac recorder will fit the bill. And still at a very affordable price. The next option above this would be the Tascam. Both of which are good machines. This was purchased for my Dad, who after 2 Sony CD burners having played out on him ( which don't exist anymore) , now reordering his second Teac. Which proves by the way that the average life span of these machines have been around 5 years. Of either the Sony or Teac. I also might add I had a high dollar Harmon Kardon that lasted even less time than that. I now own the Tascam. The upper end. It's great, but not necessary.

"This is the latest and greatest in developments for us Wine drinkers. And an easy way to get that foil off the top of the bottle of wine. If you are like me, you've found that most wine bottles require more time peeling off the foil than popping the cork. The EDGY simplifies that in just a second. I rec'd mine last week, but waited until I had company coming in to pull it out and use it. I had several very special German vintages just waiting, along with a couple of domestic reds. In the past I have always had to pull out my pocket knife, like a , well I hate using this terminology, but like a redneck  to get the foil off the bottle of a $100.00 bottle of wine. No more.  This little baby just fits perfectly around the top of the bottle and squeeze, then just give it about 1/4 turn, and that's it. The foil is off. Clean as can be. Really an item long overdue in my humble opinion, but one that will get many years of service. I have only one problem with this Edgy, my friends wanted to depart with it...

"After I looked over the product and read all the other reviews I ordered 24. At $10.99 I felt it was a fair price. Before the product arrived I had several projects in mind. I really wanted to put these through the test. And I must say, these are really a fantastic product. My first project was making Custard Pies in these Silicone Cups. yep, 24 individual servings. Once they baked and cooled a bit, I popped them right out of the Liners, rinsed them off, which took maybe 5 minutes. Which is another great thing about these. Clean up is almost unnecessary. These liners are really great. They never lost shape at all. I used nothing in the way of bakers spray. Next I made 24 individual peach pies. Same results. They came out perfect. Took them out, cooled a bit and popped them right out. After rinsing them off, I made gelatin in them. Again, same results. Same procedure. These are the coolest thing in my kitchen right now. And the possibilities of what these can be used for are basically limitless. Pretty much whatever you can think of using them for. I'm thinking perhaps now, little side dishes for dinner parties. H'orderves of any kind. Bottom line, these are fantastic. 21st Century Cookware. Totally cool. If you don't own these, you really should. Every kitchen should have this product in it. I couldn't recommend a product more highly than these. These really do make your Kitchen Home Complete... This is one product if I could give 10 stars I would.

"Amsterdam Standard is Royal Talens' inexpensive line of student-grade acrylic paint. It's made in the Netherlands. Their professional line of acrylics is called Expert.These have a smooth, moderately-thick feel, similar to other student-grade acrylics. They will retain some brush and knife marks if applied thickly, but not quite as much as professional acrylics. As can be expected, most colors darken a bit as they dry - especially the dark ones. They dry to a satin finish.This color (Permanent Blue Violet), is a semi-transparent, intense 'grape' purple when spread out thinly. When applied thickly it dries to a purple so deep & rich it's almost black. The Sap Green and Phthalo Blue also have good depth of color. I also tried Nickel Titanate Yellow and it was a beautiful and useful color but disappointing opacity. That color has been reformulated with a different pigment - I haven't yet tried it.These come in several large sizes, and I like their tubes have a flip-top cap rather than the small, difficult-to-grip caps that some other acrylics have. You can also buy Amsterdam 'dosing nozzles' for the these which allow you to squeeze out raised lines of paint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DXBDOAZRP6KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RB7L6G#wasThisHelpful","R2DXBDOAZRP6KQ","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Art Noise paints are manufactured by Tri-Art in Canada. They are inexpensive, scholatic-grade paints. They're made with 100% acrylic binder and better pigmentation than a lot of craft paints.The large container sizes available make these great for murals and classrooms...anywhere you use a lot of paint. The thickness is about the same as most craft paints - the manufacturer says it's like lotion - which is a good way to describe it. It dries to a matte or satin finish with little or no texture or brush marks. For artwork on canvas, you might prefer student grade or artist grade acrylics if you want to retain brush marks.This 'Crimson' color is a deep maroon when applied thick, but spreading it thin shows a fiery reddish undertone, and when white is added it makes a nice pink. When mixed with most greens, you will get a dark grey or black.

"Unlike most LED night lights which emit a harsh white or blueish-white light, this one emits a tangerine orange light. This is good for minimizing the effect of 'waking up your brain' by inadvertently getting blue or white light (which contains a lot of blue) into your eyes in the middle of the night.It actually seems to be a white LED with a transparent orange diffuser, but the result is the same - a rich orange color. It is 'always-on' (no photosensor) but it uses so little energy (less than 1W) that it costs virtually nothing to operate 24/7.It's moderately bright; not as bright as 7 watt or even 4 watt incandescent bulbs, but bright enough to cast a glow a few feet around to see what you're doing. Probably not bright enough for brushing your teeth, but perfect in the bedroom and hallways. All the white LED night lights I've used before got dimmer over the years; time will tell if this one does. So far this is my favorite night light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TO12MAIOIEEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4WI1FW#wasThisHelpful","R1TO12MAIOIEEV","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a utilitarian office phone...it isn't pretty to look at. But I bought it for its features not its looks. It can stand up at two angles...regular or a high angle...depending on which direction you insert the plastic stand on the bottom.This is a 2-line phone but you can use it with only 1 line like a regular phone if you don't need 2 lines. If only 1 line is connected, the red status light for the unused line will always be on. Also, if someone is on the phone elsewhere in the house or office, the red light for that in-use line will be lit up...a useful feature. The ringer has 7 volume levels plus off. The lowest volume setting is somewhat quiet, but not as quiet as I had hoped.The LCD display illuminates with blue backlighting when you lift the receiver or when someone is calling - so you can use this phone in the dark. Otherwise the backlight is off. The text is medium-sized. You must plug in the wall adapter (included) for the display to function - there is no battery option.The caller ID is supposed to let you assign a custom name to any number that calls - but this feature only worked for one caller. For 8 others I tried, only their number displays when they call, no additional name shows up.Also, on my phone, it always displays ""0 new calls"" ...even if I did miss a call. I have to manually go into the call history menu to see if anyone did call. I don't know if these 2 problems are because something is wrong with my phone, or because these features don't work properly here in Canada.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NZWYXK1FWTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P8DKZ2#wasThisHelpful","R14NZWYXK1FWTO","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This map is made from completely waterproof plastic 'paper'. ITMB's waterproof maps are larger than other waterproof maps (such as National Geographic Destination maps and Rough Guide maps), but it's not as huge as the full-size paper maps you can buy anywhere.This map shows the central and Downtown region in good detail, but only shows the rest of the city in a small, low-detail inset map section.

"I bought these for loosening and tightening the large nuts and connections under sinks. These are often round and meant to be hand tightened, but often get too tight to loosen by hand. Almost all slip-joint or groove joint pliers I've seen before have jaws that are too flat and/or too short to properly grip these nuts. Oil filter pliers have jaws that are round but too big and not the right gripping shape.So I gave these a try and finally got a grip. The jaws can grip nuts up to around 3"" diameter. They actually open wider but 3"" is about the maximum for a good grip. The slip-joint mechanism on mine is very rough...the one thing about these pliers that is cheap. To open to the widest of the 4 settings, the pivot nut must be loosened a bit...but then it's loose on the 3 smaller settings. But the overall design and shape feels perfect in the hands...and it's not overly big & clumsy in tight spaces. It comes with 2 hard plastic jaw covers if you want to avoid scratching delicate plastic parts.If you live in North America, the shipping cost will probably make these pliers not a good value. But...pliers with jaws of this shape are hard to find, so I'm glad I bought these. They save a lot of aggravation when working under sinks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROH4XUTIQPQHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LFVA4O#wasThisHelpful","ROH4XUTIQPQHL","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The capability and features of this recorder are impressive for $150. The 2 tiny built-in mics are a great bonus and surprisingly good - with 'heavy' deep bass response. They allow quick, cable-free stereo recording.Some things I'm not crazy about...The use of tiny rotary knobs for the mixing levels doesn't look or feel right for that function. Traditional sliders (even short ones) would've been much nicer. Also, these tiny knobs feel a bit flimsy. I like that left/right balance and reverb have their own dedicated knobs for all 8 channels...no need to go into a menu.This unit was designed to minimize the need to navigate through menus by having direct-access buttons. But you still often do need to navigate deep into the menus anyways. And just starting a new song is a tedious procedure. Despite being advertised as easy to use, it isn't quite. But considering all the features and capabilities this unit has, this has to be expected to some extent.You can give each track a short name, but it seems that it does not show up while the song is being played - you have to go into the menu to see it.I don't like that you have to press & hold the tiny recessed on/off button for several seconds to turn the unit on & off. No AC adapter is included - its 4 AA batteries won't suffice for long recording sessions.I chose this over the smaller DP-004 or DP-006 because the display is backlit. It's crappy that Tascam didn't include this in the two smaller models. I wanted to get the competing Zoom R8 which in my opinion has nicer looks and user interface, but this Tascam has similar capabilites at half the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YLIXJPQ3NXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9060X6#wasThisHelpful","R12YLIXJPQ3NXY","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are acceptable if you want to try your hand at acrylics with a good selection of bright colors in tiny paint tubes. Some colors in this set are surprisingly brilliant - almost fluorescent - but are not very lightfast and will slowly fade over the years.Many colors are transparent - which can be difficult to work with if you paint opaquely, but can provide neat effects. Most colors darken noticeably as they dry - more than other acrylics I've tried. These also dry faster than any other acrylics I've tried, and they dry to a matte finish.These are moderate viscosity like most other student-grade acrylics.

"This Quikrete No. 1101 is a regular strength, general purpose concrete mix. It doesn't contain the coarse aggregate (large gravel) you might expect...it contains sand and small amounts of tiny pebbles. This 1101 concrete mix also comes in large bags but I don't know if they also use the same fine aggregate. These 10 lb bags are super-convenient when you only need small amounts or don't want to lift 60-80lb. bags. I've found these at Lowes for under $3.This mix is meant for applications thicker than 2 inches, but it has worked well for me for much thinner applications. But for less than 2 inches, Quikrete recommends their No. 1103 'Sand/Topping Mix' which contains cement and sand but no gravel. For very thin and smooth topping applications on walls, parging mix works best.You'll probably need to add more water than the instructions suggest. But only add as much water as you need to get the workability you need. Add a little bit at a time while mixing. Too much water will result in weaker concrete that is more likely to crack.This concrete sets at regular speed, so it gives lots of working time but takes quite a while to harden. Depending on the temperature, it will take 1 or 2 days to harden, but will still be weak and crumbly. After 1 week it will be strong, but will take about a month to reach its final 4000psi strength.With regular-set concrete such as this, it's important that it's not allowed to dry out for at least the first week if possible. Otherwise it won't reach its full potential strength. Plastic sheets and occasional watering as necessary helps to keep it from drying out during the important curing phase.Be careful not to store these on damp ground or surfaces. Moisture can leak through the plastic bags even if they seem intact, and prematurely harden the concrete inside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQKBUTPV981K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H0IP9G#wasThisHelpful","R3UQKBUTPV981K","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mine doesn't make any buzzing that others have experienced - even when dimmed.To my disappointment, it's white light is slightly cooler and more pinkish than a 60W incandescent.  Very similar, slightly un-natural color cast as most 2700K warm white CFL bulbs. And strangely, when dimmed down to low brightness, mine takes on a bizarre, eerie, cool color tinge.

"This tab book & play-along CD is not for complete beginners. The songs range in difficulty from moderately-easy to advanced. The included software can slow down or speed up the CD when played on your computer. This is a great bonus, especially useful for learning fast solos.There is a refresher page of the symbols and techniques used in the notation (such as bends, vibrato, pinch harmonics, etc.). Each song is notated in standard notation and tab, and includes lyrics. But the audio on the CD is instruments only - no vocals. I wish it did have vocals, but most guitar play-along CDs don't. That might be a good thing if you want to sing along. A lot of the songs have two guitars (lead and rhythm) but the tab shows one guitar only (usually the lead or main guitar). On the CD, each song comes in two recordings:first: all instruments except vocals (to learn how it's supposed to sound)second: all instruments except vocals and lead guitar (to play along)The sound quality, clarity, and playing is very good as you'd expect from  professional session recordings. But I was disappointed that some parts of the guitar playing aren't exactly the same as the original artist's album recording. This is because the transcribers have to use their judgment as to the way it's played in the original, as well as slight differences in playing style, equipment and settings.

"I bought this Dictionary & Thesaurus to avoid having to buy two separate books. It serves its function very nicely. Like other Oxford dictionaries, it's clear and easy to use, and I love that the synonyms are encircled in a box for clarity. It also includes antonyms and pronunciations for more difficult words.

Unfortunately, the construction is like a supermarket novel: ordinary paper covers and ordinary binding, and slightly thin non-glossy pages that feel a bit like newsprint. Though this keeps the weight down. [It's notable that Oxford's 'School' series dictionaries have thicker, stronger pages, more durable binding, and strong linen covers. Those are wonderful kids' /beginners' dictionaries]. It would also be nice if the headwords were in a color other than black for visual clarity and aesthetics - a lot of dictionaries do this nowadays.For a similar price, you can get better physical quality, but Oxford's content and presentation is top-notch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36V3XIKD8JZLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199558469#wasThisHelpful","R36V3XIKD8JZLZ","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These grammar study cards have questions (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or translation) on the white side, and the answer and explanation on the opposite blue side. They're meant for practicing and reinforcing grammar rather than teaching it the first time.This set is too difficult for complete beginners - if you've just started learning Spanish, it's better to start with vocabulary cards...the Berlitz vocabulary cards are simpler, funner, and less tedious than this set. With this set you have to actually think to get the right answer, whereas the vocabulary set is mostly simple word memorization.As others have mentioned, they aren't labeled by topic/category or difficulty, but they arrive grouped by topic. A lot of the questions involve conjugating the proper verb tense to fill in the blank...a boring but essential language skill.

"The official product photo is incorrect when I wrote this review - though the description is correct. You can check the product number on the H-B or Thomas Scientific website to know for sure which model you're getting.It's -5 to 50 Celsius, total immersion, 160mm long, and comes in an aluminum 'duplex' case. Duplex means the thermometer itself is wrapped in open-front aluminum inner armor that gives a modest amount of protection, and this is stored in a closed aluminum tube which offers a high level of protection. Though if you drop it, it's still very possible that it might shatter inside. You can also remove the thermometer from the inner armor and use it with no protection for faster response time.It has turquoise-colored liquid over white. It would be nice if it was marked in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, but most glass lab thermometers aren't. I don't like the cluttered half-degree increment markings, nor the fact that the 15, 25, 35, and 45 degree increments are all labeled as just '5'.Like most other Thomas/H-B liquid thermometers, it's shipped from amazon in its plastic peel-open factory packaging - with no additional protection like bubble wrap. Mine arrived undamaged, but with a bubble in the liquid column, which is common after a bumpy shipment. I was able to very carefully get the bubble out.A great little durable & accurate thermometer for experiments, environmental study, and expeditions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RY24GREU4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OCMHLS#wasThisHelpful","R7RY24GREU4H","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Berlitz Compact dictionary is almost small enough to be pocket-size. The Berlitz Pocket dictionaries are even smaller...truly tiny. The Concise versions are mid-size.The cover is nice vinyl plastic. The corners are rounded. The binding is high quality, so you can expect this dictionary to last for many years...perfect for students lugging it to class every day. And it's no more expensive than dictionaries with paper covers that fall apart.The text is quite small, but there are 50,000 definitions, which is enough to find most words you'll encounter - this is a 'real' dictionary, not a beginner one which is missing a lot of words. I like that the headwords (the words being defined) are in blue ink. Berlitz uses the same color and cover style for all languages; it would be nice if they varied the color for different languages. Inside the covers is an excellent, highlighted visual explanation of how to use this dictionary and what the abbreviations mean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDP5OLC1US8ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780042558#wasThisHelpful","RDP5OLC1US8ZP","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose the red version of this mesh bag. It's quite large...perfect for storing and carrying clothing, towels, and beach/swimming gear. The open mesh doesn't trap moisture, so it's also good as a laundry bag. There is an extra zipper pocket on the side.The red color is darker than in the official product pic, and the Finis logo is hard to see on it. Made in China. The polyester mesh is not soft, it's slightly stiff/rough. Hopefully it'll soften up a bit over time. There are no grommets where the drawstring enters the bag...only time will tell if the mesh holds up to the friction in those two places. The drawstring can clip to the bottom corner of the bag to make a shoulder strap; a neat feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZNV4E2TQGV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GQ2DCK#wasThisHelpful","R2MZNV4E2TQGV1","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat little liquid ball compass for a super-low price. It's about 1 inch in diameter. The main color is white, which I find is nicer-looking than black.On the one I got, the inner ball will sometimes momentarily stick a little bit as it catches a rough edge in the inside of the globe. But the bumpyness of a moving car will keep it moving freely. The bubble at the top of the liquid seems to be getting bigger - suggesting that the liquid might be slowly leaking out - I'll keep an eye on it to confirm that.The suction cup holds firmly on a car window, but I accidentally broke off the  mount by pulling on it too hard to remove it. Lesson learned: lift off the suction cup gently by first lifting up an edge.Note: unlike some other similar-looking ball compasses, this one is designed for automotive use; you look forward onto the face of the compass to read it. If you read it looking top-down, you will get a reversed reading.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Q636CMG41LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A59XPA#wasThisHelpful","R5Q636CMG41LQ","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm as delighted with this 4.5 - 6 Volt Dorcy LED bulb as I am with their 3 Volt (2-cell) version. The beam pattern of the LED itself (used outside of any flashlight) is wide, with perfectly gradual fall-off towards the edges...no central 'hot spot'. Once in any flashlight, the reflector and lens will affect the beam pattern - will concentrate it in the center or make a circular or ring pattern, etc. The spectral color is only slightly more blueish than the near perfectly-white Dorcy 2-cell version I have. Though there is color variation in white LEDs from one sample to the next.There are some complaints that it's not as bright as some incandescent bulbs. In my 4-cell flashlight, I can say it's the brightest bulb I've yet used. It's a lot brighter than I need, and I'd rather have lower brightness & power consumption to get even longer battery life. In a 3-cell flashlight, it is a bit dimmer, but still adequate for most purposes, unless you're a security guard looking for bad guys from 100 feet away.You can't go wrong with these replacement bulbs...you'll never go back to incandescent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T930LSLF1B5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MP8MGO#wasThisHelpful","R1T930LSLF1B5X","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to the somewhat high price, a lot of other atlases might be a better value. But over the years I've grown fond of the aesthetics and features of Goode's world atlases.Goode's is packed with lots of specialty world maps and information such as population, religions, climate, ocean currents, agriculture, mining, etc. I love that a lot of the major world cities have their own little city map (a tiny city map is better than none at all). However, most are found together on dedicated city map pages - I would much prefer to see the city maps on the same page as the country they are located, if possible. I am dismayed that there aren't any indications on the maps that show what page to find the continuation of the map in that particular direction.I like that this paperback version is printed on thinner, lighter, and less glossy paper than my old Goodes from the late 1970s...just my preference.

"When my X5 arrived, it barely illuminated. The batteries had a bit of powdery white corrosion on them (similar to old alkaline batteries). After wiping them clean with a dry tissue, I reinserted them, and wow! Finally the brilliant little flashlight I had hoped for.Since it uses 4 small 'button' batteries, battery life is limited. Not 130 hours as advertised, more like 2 hours nonstop on-time. I would prefer if it were designed to trade off brightness to get longer battery life. The beam is wide and perfectly round, with a concentrated spot in the middle.The instructions don't really explain how to replace the batteries. You must unscrew the lens end, and then push the rubber on/off button hard enough, and then the entire inner assembly pops out. The instructions call for LR44 batteries - this battery type goes by other names such as L1154. You can do a wikipedia search for 'LR44' to see the other names.This flashlight is solidly built, is about the size of an adult's thumb, and is a nice bright orange color. It comes with a lanyard which seems to be designed to break free if under enough tension, as a safety feature. Also included are green and red lenses which can replace the clear one that is pre-installed. Replacing the lenses is difficult because the reflector element must be removed first...it needs coaxing to pull out. The red lens makes for a superb little astronomy flashlight, or for any other time you want to preserve your night vision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28F2GXMX745GP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IUPLFU#wasThisHelpful","R28F2GXMX745GP","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this instead of a 'flat' compass because the advantage of a ball compass is that it doesn't have to lay horizontal...it should spin freely regardless of what position it's in. But unfortunately, this one occasionally 'sticks' momentarily. A light tap, bump, or movement will free it up again, but it shouldn't stick at all. I will try the Brunton model to see if it's better in this regard.The markings glow in the dark.

"I've been using this projector for about 10 years for projecting reference photos and line drawings onto canvas for painting. It can accept images that are up to 5x5 inches in size. You place the unit on top of the paper image (or book page, etc.) and move the projector forward or back to adjust the size of the image it makes. You adjust focus by sliding the lens in/out. It can slide right out if you pull it out too far, and it can fall out while carrying the projector.Moving the projector forward makes a smaller, brighter, and sharper image. Farther out makes a larger but dimmer and duller image. Regardless, you'll usually have to use it in the dark. Using a 100W bulb heats up the reference image to real hot...I wouldn't dare leave this thing on for long periods, or leave it on unattended. There is no carrying handle on top - which would make it easier to move around.Although it looks modern, cute, and funky, it's mechanically and ergonomically a crude design. At first it's fun to use and elicits a ""wow!"" response, but the more you use it, the more frustrating it becomes.

"This is a newly-released pocket-sized atlas of Toronto. Note that it only covers the city proper of Toronto - from Scarborough in the east to Etobicoke in the west.

"This is Ridgid's smaller portable drill bit set. The bits are cryogenically-treated, black oxide coated, high speed steel (HSS). I'll update later to tell how well they stay sharp over the long-term. The larger bits have shanks with 3 flattened sides - supposedly to grip better in the chuck.I chose this set over similar ones from Milwaukee, DeWalt, and others, mainly because the box has a little built-in storage compartment - which I use to hold my tiny bits smaller than 1/16"" - which would otherwise get lost. The box is made of hard ABS plastic and I like the design and the orange color - though it's a pumpkin orange rather than the intense red-orange in the official product pic here on amazon.A major irk: the two black bit holders are difficult to open - they require a lot of forceful prying to unlock and open outward. I don't know if they're all like this or only mine. An easy solution is to sand down the locking tabs a teeny tiny bit. A smaller irk: there are two 1/8"" bits.

"Although it's not nearly as detailed as larger globes or world maps, this is a real little globe, not just a toy or paperweight. The advantage of a globe over a map is that it should present the world in a realistic and distortion-free way that no kind of 2-dimensional map projection can (every flat map projection is a compromise). Nice to have handy for keeping up with world news events and seeing how the seasons are a result of the Earth's tilt.It shows most major world cities, although a lot of smaller countries don't show even one city. I was happy to see South Sudan is there. It has the main lines of latitude and longitude, arctic and antarctic circles, and tropic of cancer and capricorn.Strangely, the lines of latitude (supposedly all 10 degrees apart) are spaced/angled more widely apart towards the poles than near the equator! This is the first globe I've ever encountered with distortion. One can only guess if this was accidental or intentional for some reason.Unlike most larger globes, this one doesn't have raised relief to show mountain ranges. It has the absolute basics - no more. I was relieved that the equator line is not as thick as it looks in the official product photo.It's made entirely of plastic, so it's waterproof.

"When new, this knife is insanely sharp - treat it with caution. You'll be able to cut tomatoes in very thin slices with no pressure. But after a year of use, and treating it gingerly, mine has developed tiny nicks in the blade and is not quite so un-necessarily sharp, but still very sharp.Since the ceramic blade is brittle, you can't twist and pry with it like a steel knife. Also unlike a steel blade, it has very little flex...to me it feels too rigid and un'responsive' for lack of a better word. When using a kitchen tool as fundamental as a knife, you shouldn't fell as though you have to 'walk on eggshells' while using it. You shouldn't have to worry about damaging it when using it in the normal way you've used steel knives all your life.The knife is made in China but the blade in Japan. The handle is hard plastic. The white blade deceptively looks like plastic. The rounded end of the blade is sharpened, so you can cut even when the knife is pointing downward at a steep angle. The 4 1/4"" blade is too small for cutting larger items like grapefruits and bread. But it's perfect for precision cutting smaller vegetables & fruits.edit: after over 2 years, the cutting edge of the blade has developed several larger chips. I haven't exactly 'babied' this knife, but I treat it a lot more gingerly than an equivalent steel knife. So I downgraded my rating to 3 stars. After using it over 2 years, I don't see much benefit of a ceramic blade over steel. The only real advantage is to those who don't want to re-sharpen their knives - which is not that difficult anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RHBE6I0IN8YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PDODAM#wasThisHelpful","R3RHBE6I0IN8YP","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**************************************************************************************************************************************************IMPORTANT NOTE***** This seems to be a Japanese-labeled version of the SA-46. I bought mine (with English labeling) from Toys R Us in Canada in 2010.*********************************************************************************************************************************************The SA-46 is a small, basic, 32-key keyboard. It's the little brother of the SA-76 which is larger with 12 more keys, orange bottom, but otherwise similar. It doesn't have a built-in record or sampling function. Nor does it have a keyboard split (where the left half of the keyboard can play one tone and the right half plays another). Come on Casio...many small keyboards from 30 years ago had these features. On the plus side, it has 8-note polyphony - you can play up to 8 notes simultaneously.It has 100 tones, 50 rhythms, and 10 built-in songs. You can adjust the tempo of the songs or rhythm. I often use the drum beats like a metronome while practising guitar. The big green piano/organ button quickly switches between those two tones rather than have to enter them manually. It's useful if you use those two tones a lot, otherwise it's a bit of a gimmick. It also has a very basic 5-button 'drum pad', but the buttons are stiff, which limits its usefulness. The LCD display is small and non-illuminated.The tones are listed in several categories rather than individually. It would be much nicer if each of the 100 tones were printed individually on the keyboard...even if the lettering would be small. The tones are decently natural-sounding, but aren't as good as even the cheapest full-size keyboards from Casio or Yamaha. Some tones (such as the bass instruments) are actually quite decent. The vast majority of tones are of real instruments, but there are some electronic and silly novelty sounds thrown in. If you hook it up to a good sound system, you'll find surprisingly deep bass in the bass instruments and the drum beats. YouTube has some reviews & demos of the SA-46 if you want an idea of what the tones sound like.The 32 keys are small, but not tiny. They have a springy feel which I don't like - I prefer a more natural 'thunk' feel. The bottom half has smoothly rounded edges and is bright lime green. It has a carrying 'handle' indentation which is of limited usefulness. It uses 6 AA batteries and has good battery life.In all, this is a basic but decent keyboard...it's a step above 'toy' keyboards. As of 2013, Yamaha doesn't currently make any mini-sized keyboards, so as far as I know, this is one of the few (only?) decent keyboards of this size. If you want more keys but in a somewhat larger package, there is the silver Casio SA-75 (a slightly older model that is still available), and the aforementioned SA-76.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102ZFEBBYDFT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KZBFIS#wasThisHelpful","R102ZFEBBYDFT2","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like National Geographic's other Destination Maps, the Montréal Destination Map is designed to be easy-to-use and visually pleasant, rather than fitting in a maximum level of detail. Only the central area around downtown is covered in reasonably high detail. The city in its entirety is covered in a smaller, separate Montréal area map section, but in low detail - this is my only major complaint. So if you need to drive or navigate around the city, a full-size folding paper map will be a much better choice - if you can live with the unwieldy large size.But this map is great for newcomers and visitors to Montréal. It's colorful and gives useful descriptions and information about the must-see tourist locations. It has a closeup section of Vieux (Old) Montréal, as well as small mini maps of transit, the Montréal Souterrain (Underground), Olympic Park, Trudeau (Dorval) International Airport, and the Northeast USA/Québec region. The labeling of the streets and locations is mostly in French but the tourist/general information is in English. It unfolds to a medium size (not too big), and is made of plastic 'paper' that is completely waterproof - not just water resistant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U9HCC5BNAFJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597753122#wasThisHelpful","R2U9HCC5BNAFJY","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this as a low-cost, reasonably accurate reference thermometer for measuring outdoor air temperature. Its range of -35 to 50º Celsius is perfect for where I live in Canada.But upon arriving from amazon, it was broken - snapped in 3 pieces. It came in clear plastic peel-open packaging from the manufacturer which offers little protection, and no additional protection was provided by amazon. I would be happy to pay a little extra to have it packaged in bubble wrap and/or protective plastic tubing like most other manufacturers or retailers do.The labeling is very simple and clear, with one-degree increment markings (which I prefer over the half-degree increment markings on some Thomas/H-B thermometers). And the 12"" length makes the spacing between each degree quite wide (about 1/8"") which makes it easy to read. You could easily discern changes of fractions of a degree. Its accuracy is listed at 1.5ºC. It comes with a triangular, vinyl anti-roll ring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GNWFIF83ZUDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OCLN68#wasThisHelpful","R1GNWFIF83ZUDB","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of using flashcards to learn Spanish, and to a lesser extent, videos. But in my opinion a good workbook such as this is the best way to truly learn - because you're not relying on rote memorization...you have to actually think, and put pencil to paper.Basic Spanish is intended as a supplement to teaching, rather than being a sole source of instruction. But I've found it works quite well as a sole source because it doesn't assume much prior knowledge, and builds your abilities gradually...each lesson building on knowledge learned in the previous lessons. The only thing I've found lacking is pronunciation explanations.This workbook is not in color, and at first glance it looks quite dry, but it makes up for that by making the exercises fun...it's thoroughly infused with references to modern American pop culture (actual famous people, movies, celebrities and TV shows and characters).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Z24I1HE3CED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071458050#wasThisHelpful","R35Z24I1HE3CED","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 7-piece Chessex polyhedral dice set was purchased in early 2013, and it's made in England. On closer inspection, some dice have the paint applied sloppily in the numbers, as well as some paint smears - please see my pics. Though some (such as my d10) are perfect. In comparison, all the dice in my 10-year-old German-made 7-piece Chessex set (clear color with frosted surface finish) are perfect.The plastic container is hard to open, and the fragile edges are prone to cracking while removing the lid...but my rating is based on the dice only, not the packaging.A more serious problem is that two faces on my d20 dice are so non-flat (convex) that it wobbles on those faces rather than sitting firmly...this will definitely be a problem for generating random rolls.It's a shame because the color combination of ruby red with white numbers is beautiful (the reason I chose this set), and because my other Chessex dice set is perfect.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6RH8G8VBHSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015INKYO#wasThisHelpful","RQ6RH8G8VBHSN","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Zondervan NIV Bible could be described as personal-size...it's a bit bigger and heavier than a typical novel. Its 'Razzleberry' color is not quite as intense as it looks in some of the official product photos...it's a slightly more subdued raspberry color. Like a lot of other Zondervan Bibles, the edges are beautifully gilded in metallic silver color. The cover is soft synthetic leather that looks & feels like the real thing.The pages are very decently thick and durable (not like tissue paper like some Bibles), and are opaque bright white with no ghosting from the pages beneath. But the pages won't lay open by themselves. The print is very small...the same as my Zondervan compact Bible. This is what allows thicker pages while keeping the size and weight down. If it's too small for your eyes, Zondervan also sells Bibles in regular and large print.Like other gilded Zondervan Bibles, some pages cling together at the edges when new. This is normal. Once you open each page for the first time, it will no longer cling.This Bible has a few extras: a built-in white ribbon bookmark, Christ's words are printed in red, a very brief synopsis of each book in the Bible (very useful). And a glossary & concordance which includes a few maps and line drawings - but there are no illustrations in the Bible scripture itself.If you can live with the tiny print, this Bible makes a most wholesome gift.

"Firstly, note that amazon's product photo is incorrect as of the time I wrote this review. If you go by the product number rather than the photo, you'll know what you're getting.It is a 6"" total-immersion pocket thermometer, -5 to 50C, with black liquid over a yellow background (H-B/Thomas Easy-Read series). It comes in a hard plastic 'window' case (open front), not the armored metal case as shown. Mine is a purple-colored case, but I have also seen blue ones. It gives a modest amount of protection from impact. But if you need more protection (especially for outdoor field work), consider one of the metal-armored versions. It came in clear plastic peel-open factory packaging. I was expecting more packaging protection (either from the manufacturer or from amazon), but luckily mine arrived without any damage or liquid column separation.The novel black liquid looks neat and the column is wide. But the armor blocks a lot of light, so it's dim and not easy to see. If you remove the thermometer from the armor (by untwisting the cap VERY gently), it's much brighter and easier to read. I find the half-degree gradations and the '5' markings everywhere to be visually cluttering and reduce clarity. Although on all H-B/Thomas thermometers, the half-degree increments indicate half-degree accuracy...which is good.When used with the case, this thermometer responds more slowly to sudden temperature changes than non-armored ones. But that doesn't affect the accuracy. It's made in the USA and comes with a tiny printed statement of accuracy leaflet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OGU7N74WTU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OCMB6Y#wasThisHelpful","R19OGU7N74WTU6","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the smallest and lightest dictionary I own. It's tuly small enough to be called pocket-size. As can be expected, the font is small (about 1 mm), but luckily for me, my reading vision is good, so it's not a problem. This is a basic French-English dictionary, so it doesn't have many extras. But it does have a small list of verb conjugations and word abbreviations. It's perfect for travel if you know French well enough that you don't need a phrase book.The amazon pic shows square corners, but mine (which I bought at a Chapters/Indigo in Canada) has rounded outside corners which gives it a nice, ergonomic feel. I only wish the headwords were printed in a color other than black (some dictionaries use blue ink). But for around $5 you can't go wrong.

"I bought this little speaker to use with my portable CD player/discman (why don't those ever come with even a small built-in speaker?). I chose the pink version...though it's not quite as 'hot pink' as it looks in the official product photo...it's more of a silvery purplish-pink. The whole thing looks totally cool in an 'Apple' kind of way. The 'power on' indicicator LED is thankfully is not a harsh blue...it's a nice amber color.There is a little rubber pad on the back which allows the speaker to sit up even though the back is rounded. The audio cable is braided rather than cheap rubber, it's short...about 1 foot long...and it cleverly doubles as a carrying strap. But I don't know how long it will last if you use it as a strap. Prying open the back cover to replace the batteries is difficult.  With the 3 AAA batteries in, it's somewhat heavy for its size, but you can feel the quality...nothing about it looks or feels cheap. Its shape feels perfect to hold in the hand.It's a two-driver ('speaker') design, so it's in stereo. There is only a solid little on/off slide switch...no volume control. You control the volume on the device its plugged in to. And there is no auto-off, so check the power LED is off before putting it away. As can be expected, there is no real bass (only midrange and up), but it's very clear and bright sounding (except when you turn it up too loud, then distortion sets in). The amplifier is rated at 2 watts total power output, which is more than adequate for personal use.Kudos to Philips for getting it right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZR0L55Q1NRDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VGBDYG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZR0L55Q1NRDJ","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Broan 744 is a large unit, but once installed, it's simply looks like a regular recessed ceiling light. It's also quite quiet ...its sound is a muffled hum if installed properly using the included joist hangers and is not resting directly on the drywall. Some people have experienced noise and/or vibration - likely an unbalanced blower wheel or bent shaft, which is not fixable. Luckily, mine is quite smooth and quiet.The light socket accepts a PAR30 long-neck bulb up to 75 watts (not included) ...these give much nicer light than regular incandescents or CFLs. You can wire the light to turn on with the fan, or have the light and fan switched on/off separately.Its 70 CFM airflow rate is moderately-low, but it's adequate for small or maybe even midsize bathrooms ...IF the exhaust duct is 4"" diameter (preferably larger) AND is not too long AND doesn't have any sharp bends.The ceiling cutout hole is barely more than 6"" diameter, so this unit is really meant to be installed from above the ceiling. If you can only install from below, this fan is not a good choice because you will need to do cutting and repairing of drywall.The motor is easily accessible for cleaning, but the blower wheel is largely inaccessible in the adjacent housing. This makes the important regular cleaning of the actual fan difficult or impossible. If I knew this, I would not have bought this model. It's unfortunate, because with moderate use (about 2 hours each day), my fan gets filled with dust and needs to be cleaned about once a year.The damper is intentionally designed so that it gently balances in a slightly-open position and temporarily closes during  backdrafts. On cold winter days, you can feel a bit of cold air coming down out of the unit due to the partly-open damper. This is not acceptable...unless a Broan engineer can explain why this is a beneficial 'feature'.PROS:-stealthy looks and sound-built-in 75W PAR30 lightCONS:-not meant to be installed from below-cleaning the fan itself is difficult-intentionally leaky damper","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGZUZKFGUOK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OU1G98#wasThisHelpful","RBGZUZKFGUOK7","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Komachi sandwich knife is my most-used knife...it's great for most general cutting - sandwiches, bread, fruits & vegetables. But because of it's wavy serrated edge it's not meant for chopping tasks, or mincing small items. I also don't find it good for scooping spreads out of the jar as intended...it's too bulky and pointy to be useful for that.The blade is somewhat thick and non-flexible ...which is how I like cutting knives to be. This knife comes with a purple plastic sheath for storage, and the handle is hard plastic.Like serrated knives, it cuts decently well even after the outer edges of the scallops get dulled down - because the inner surfaces remain sharp. And like most other serrated knives, only one side of the blade is beveled - this causes a slight deflection when cutting downward - you eventually get used to applying an opposite twist to compensate.Safety issues: because the handle and blade are the same color, it's possible to unknowingly grab the wrong end. And the heel of the blade is so close to the handle, you can accidentally close your index finger on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DY9F1YBKQOCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029X8ILO#wasThisHelpful","R1DY9F1YBKQOCL","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Who knew that history can be made so interesting and fun to learn? You open this seemingly whimsical cartoon book at any page, and in 5 minutes you're so involved in it that you can't put it down. And you're learning about important world events and issues that shaped world history forever - that other books couldn't explain so succinctly and gracefully. And with such wit and humor. In all his Cartoon History and Guide books, Larry Gonick takes a unique approach to complex subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain. If I want a very brief but clear synopsis of what the French Revolution, or World War I or II or Vietnam, or the Israeli-Palestinan conflict is about, I open this book. It's great for all ages.In fairness, this is no substitute for a history text book (nor is it meant to be), but it's a great primer and overview of the major world events of the last 200+ years. The author sometimes injects critical viewpoints...especially on Western (particularly British and American) policies and economic systems.

"This lamp is meant for keeping unhatched and baby chickens warm but I bought it for temporarily lighting my attic while doing renovation work up there...way better than those automotive trouble lights. It could also be a great heavy-duty industrial or loft ceiling light. Or for growing plants, but it gives off more stray light to the sides than real plant lights.The E-240 I got is slightly different from amazon's description and pic. I measured the reflector at exactly 10"" diameter. It's lightweight (thin...so it dents easily) aluminum which will never rust. It comes with a 4-spoke steel safety cage which snaps on. You can use the light without the safety cage, but that's not a good idea...it's there to keep the bulb away from combustible materials. When you're using a 200, 250 or 300 watt bulb, that's major heat production. Thanks to its ceramic socket, it can use bulbs up to 300 watts, which is plenty bright. You can use regular bulbs, floodlight bulbs, or infrared heat bulbs. The cord is black and I measured it at 6' long.You can mount the light using the spring clamp, or you can remove the clamp and suspend the light using the hanging loop. The spring clamp holds the light strongly to whatever you clamp it to, but the pivot mechanism (which points your light to whatever direction you want) is flimsy and doesn't hold strongly at all.

Either way, I would much prefer a regular gloss plastic surface.I'm not crazy about the slightly stylized interpretation of the original Western Electric handset shape. The handle and earcups are more square-edged and less comfortable than on the original phones. I don't mind the hang-up button on inside surface of the handle. It's slightly recessed and takes firm pressure to press it. I haven't yet accidentally pressed it while making a call.The coiled cord easily stretches to around 3 feet. It can stretch much further, but beyond 3 feet it starts to be under quite a bit of tension. This short length is fine for cellphones, but I found it not enough for using with my desktop computer, so I had to buy a 4-conductor extension cable. The cord seems to be high quality silicone rubber (just a guess). The rubber and plastic of this handset don't have any toxic smell like some cheap plastic products do (yay!). The Pop Phone is somewhat heavy, but you can feel the solid materials and build quality.The sound is indeed loud, but it is mostly midrange and upper-midrange, without much bass or treble. This is a disappointment to me, considering the many favorable reviews about its sound quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRWPZAYADC15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046EDK3K#wasThisHelpful","R2HRWPZAYADC15","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ITMB is a Canadian-based company which makes the largest waterproof folding travel maps I know of...these are full size, and completely waterproof. And this one is very unique in what geographical areas it covers.On one side is a big map of Manhattan that goes as far North as the southern edge of Harlem, as well as a tiny bit of Brooklyn. The small New York City Region section covers the adjacent boroughs and New Jersey - but only the larger roads. There's also a small subway map section.Unlike most New York City maps, there aren't any closeups of areas such as Midtown or the Financial District, but the scale is large enough that it's not necessarily needed. The overall detail level of the Manhattan map is average. I find the jumble of different colors used for different types of roads and areas to be visually confusing and disconcerting. This is the one weakness of ITMB maps; they are aesthetically less nice, less refined than other brands. They are not the best choice for tourism. But they are among the best for navigating roads by car.On the other side is the entire U.S. east coast from Florida up to Maine, Ontario, and Québec, in large scale and impressive detail - including elevation. There are basic closeup maps of Washington D.C. region, two of Orlando, and the Florida Keys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDV8YMYCMLYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=155341683X#wasThisHelpful","R2TDV8YMYCMLYJ","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This title is volumes I and II on one DVD, and it's about an hour long. It's probably not a good choice for the youngest kids, it's a step above Sesame Street level because of the fast speed at which words are taught. I agree with the 'age 6 & up' age rating on the cover. It's better suited to slightly older kids up to adults who are new to Spanish, because the content is presented quickly. I have do a lot of pausing and rewinding to absorb the information. This is my only gripe.How it works: Individual words or full sentences are given in English, then Spanish. And then for practice, you are given similar sentences in English which you are to repeat in Spanish. A moment later, the correct answer is given. You'll probably have to repeat the lessons (or whole video) several times before you get most of the content learned decently well.This video is similar in concept to flash cards or a phrase book, but much more stimulating...it's rich in colors and sound, which helps with memorization. Some words and sentences are presented by actors or singers and sung to the beat of fun rock-pop music. Others are demonstrated via animations that are cute but not overly childish.This video isn't nearly enough to get you speaking Spanish fluently, but it's a great introduction to get your feet wet. After, you might want to buy some Spanish flash cards or a phrase book, and an English-Spanish dictionary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AGSJZUVY2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00023BLFI#wasThisHelpful","R10AGSJZUVY2E","A29ES5PXIOSU9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29ES5PXIOSU9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE HEN WHO DREAMED SHE COULD FLY, a modern South Korean fable by Sun-mi Hwang, tells the story of Sprout, a plucky, ambitious and charismatic hen who lives in a coop. However, Sprout is not content to lay eggs for others in a tiny cage for the farmer. She has a dream of hatching one egg and raising the chick herself. Sprout can see the animals in the barnyard who are allowed to roam free, and she wishes to join them and escape captivity. Once she is declared useless by the farmer and his wife, she is taken from the coop and left for dead. Sprout, though, has other ideas.Without getting into plot details, Sprout escapes the cruelty of the coop for the cold indifference of the animals of the barnyard. She does eventually manage to raise a chick, though not her own, and we follow the two as they struggle to overcome violent, harsh conditions. Additionally, we see Sprout struggle with loss, maternity and, no pun intended, empty nest syndrome.Beautifully and simply written, THE HEN WHO DREAMED SHE COULD FLY is a reflection on society, nature and the world at large. Sprout’s life in the coop represents the human fear and tendency of letting circumstances and society trap us in a life we do not want. The selfish animals of the barnyard bring to mind our ability to ignore the plight of those around us. Sprout's life in the wild demonstrates the physical and evolutionary dangers of the world in which we live. Just as Sprout struggles with predators and nature, we can never keep ourselves or our families entirely safe.At the center of all this is Sprout, one of the most likable protagonists of the year. With her defiance of the rules, curiosity and tireless efforts, Sprout stays with and inspires the reader long after the slim story is finished.- Josh Mallory","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFE03FKABNA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123203#wasThisHelpful","R1BFE03FKABNA8","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s a familiar maxim that “context is everything,” and that often holds true for established authors who spend their lives intentionally carving out and filling up very specific niches in the realm of human knowledge. British historian and global political analyst Paul Johnson is a brilliant and popular example. Over a career spanning more than half a century of incisive topical journalism and definitive academic work, Johnson has memorably illuminated a host of critical issues and titans of leadership, from ancient times to our own.And now, out of the intellectual blue it seems, along comes MOZART: A LIFE. Nowhere in Johnson’s prolific bibliography (or biography for that matter) could I find any overt reference to musical issues or a personal musical passion of any kind. Friends of mine who have studied political science, military history, economics and journalism have nearly all heard of him, read him and praised him. But music students and my fellow instrumental amateurs? Not a one!So it’s no exaggeration to say that this month’s release of Johnson’s latest achievement in the art of the biographer is more than the real deal; it’s a potential game-changer, one that could well knock many a dull or poorly researched precursor on the famous composer right into the dustbin.As someone who has spent all of my conscious life deeply connected with music, I know that it takes years of study and discipline to develop an expert’s affinity for any particular composer. It’s much more than simply liking what one hears --- and who is easier to like among the icons of western classical music than the tragically short-lived Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)?In this slim but intensely absorbing volume, Johnson explores far beyond and beneath the popular film imagery of Amadeus and the unfortunate reduction of masterworks like Eine Kleine Nachtmusik to aural wallpaper in elevators. With an economy and elegance of phrase that I’m sure would impress Mozart himself, the composer’s life unfolds in pristine detail (wonders along with the warts) like a finely crafted orchestral score where all the instruments and voices receive their due.No cacophony of unrelated facts, biased suppositions, or unfounded hearsay is allowed to blur the colour and timbre of Johnson’s own accomplished literary counterpoint. You never “lose the tune,” so to speak. Even the regular outcropping of lists (you really can’t avoid them in any biography or history worthy of the name; the Bible itself is laden with them) is elevated to an almost melodic charm. I can honestly affirm that I’ve never read sequences of compositions, places, dates, relationships, family members, jobs, even wardrobe items, connected and contextualized with such polished skill.As any leading historian should be, Johnson is also a proven myth-buster, focusing on negative traditions unworthy of Mozart and his legacy. The supposed rivalry with Antonio Salieri? Forget it. The two were not only well respected in their respective musical milieus, they also respected one another. Mozart’s wife, Constanze, as a whining hypochondriac or widowed she-wolf? Forget that one too. For most of their marriage, she was either pregnant or recovering from pregnancy. Only two of the couple’s six children survived into adulthood, and she bore up under all of it --- including (how ever did she do it?) maintaining her career as a highly regarded singer. Constanze lived to be more than twice her husband’s age and continued singing and caring for his legacy until well into the 19th century.Johnson deflates a cluster of other myths and misconceptions as well, handling them with entertaining ease and the revealing authority of a social historian who knows period customs and attitudes a good deal better than many musicologists. And it’s that effortless cross-disciplined mastery of a complex and wonderful artistic life that truly brings Paul Johnson’s MOZART: A LIFE to the fore. Like any of Mozart’s more than 600 works --- including the flute sonata on my stand, which is calling me to stop writing now and start practicing --- there isn’t a single wasted word or nuance.Read, play, learn, enjoy, repeat infinitely; that’s the Mozart Effect. Paul Johnson has achieved it down to the last deftly executed trill.

"For nearly 30 years, Deborah and Howard Morgan have lived according to their ideals. Eking out a living on their rural rental property, Stoneyridge, in England, the couple raised their son Adam, made art and welcomed guests to their bed and breakfast. But with Adam gone to pursue a high-pressure career they don’t really understand, paying guests few and far between, and their pottery and weaving all but forgotten, the two have neglected the property and the animals they were meant to care for. When Howard suffers a debilitating stroke, Deborah assumes the role of caregiver, and the Morgans become even more isolated, lonely, sad and frustrated at Stoneyridge.Morag Joss’s latest novel, OUR PICNICS IN THE SUN, is the story of Deborah and Howard at a physical and psychological turning point in their lives, a period further complicated by the arrival of an unusual guest.Despite her commitment to her husband, Deborah is frustrated with having to care for the helpless Howard after his stroke. The house and property are in ruins, the animals are dying, and Adam never seems to come home to visit. Deborah finds herself almost always alone and reflecting on the life she has built with Howard. She was young and impressionable when they met, and he romanced her with talk of a life well-lived. Unexpectedly pregnant, the two decided to live in the country, make art, do yoga and live off the land.Those dreams never quite came to fruition, and instead Adam’s own memories are of cold and damp winters, terrible food, rants against toys and material possessions, and learning very little in his homeschool education. His anger and disappointment with his parents drive him far from home, first to attend school and later to travel the world for work. Because he rarely visits, Adam is unaware of how life is for his parents and how vulnerable they have become.One night, two terrible guests arrive at the bed and breakfast on yet another night Adam fails to arrive, despite his mother’s longing for him. But only one guest leaves; the other stays behind. Theo, a young man about Adam’s age, comes to be Deborah’s companion. Her feelings for him and his presence at Stoneyridge threaten what little stability the Morgans have left and brings to the surface the secret they have kept for most of their marriage.OUR PICNICS IN THE SUN is a lovely book despite the darkness and looming sense of danger with which Joss infuses it. Deborah and Howard are at once annoying and sympathetic, and readers’ feelings for Adam will change as the story unfolds and the life of the Morgan family is examined. Theo is an enigmatic figure and a symbol of what Deborah and Howard have lost individually and as a couple. The dramatic ending is crafted in a way that leaves it open for some interpretation, Joss having given her readers quite a bit of welcome intellectual and emotional credit.A sad and thoughtful story of a marriage and unfulfilled emotional lives, OUR PICNICS IN THE SUN is also a chilling psychological thriller. This is a challenging and provocative novel, slow at times, but satisfying overall, well-written and highly charged.- Sarah Rachel Egelman","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363L0K3H0S02N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342764#wasThisHelpful","R363L0K3H0S02N","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any reservations I may have had about Sebastian Faulks doing justice to P.G. Wodehouse were canceled on page one. Bertie Wooster’s alarm clock shrieks him into wakefulness, he curses and shoves the wretched thing beneath his mattress, and regrets having too little of “nature’s sweet restorer,” as Jeeves calls it. Bertie is in a pickle because he is trying to help a friend and must turn to Jeeves for advice. Faulks has caught him: Bertie is back.Bertie explains the complex plot that has put Jeeves into the drawing room of Melbury Hall and the driver side of the Wooster two-seater, while he remains below as the manservant and the passenger. He will steal the well-thumbed volumes of peerage and baronetage (to protect Jeeves’s impersonation of Lord Etringham), and bring in ringers for a vital cricket match. All the while, he little knows “what the lead-filled sock of fate” has in store for him. It is an excellent Wodehousean beginning.Faulks has kept the Wooster outrage intact. When Jeeves suggests that members of the serving class wear a pair of side-whiskers, Bertie takes umbrage. Sort of. “There are times to take offence, but this was not one of them. I left my high horse unmounted --- though tethered pretty close.” He continues with his plan.And Bertie’s perfect assessment of his formidable aunts and other large matrons of society remains intact. “If you were a Sumerian tablet beneath Dame Judith’s scrutiny, one imagined, you would give up your secrets pretty quick, cuneiform or not.” His Aunt Agatha does not appear in JEEVES AND THE WEDDING BELLS, but her impending visit is an impetus for Bertie and Jeeves to leave for the country.Always important for a reader’s quiet delight, Bertie’s references to the classics remain in this homage. Under the influence of “the liquid contents of Sir Henry’s ottoman” or, more precisely, the cognac, at the end of the final day of masquerading as Jeeves’s manservant, Bertie must gain entrance to Melbury Hall. His thoughts run to Macbeth about the “odds on the raveled sleeve of care being knitted up to any appreciable extent,” but it does not matter who is awake or asleep. His ill-conceived appearance at the wrong window frightens the household.Later, Jeeves is revealed as “the willing Pandarus” while Bertie makes sense of the adventure. Even though Jeeves must annotate the references, Bertie is more literate than he knows. Jeeves is still the master of deduction, understatement and advance planning. Almost before it happened, he knew “there was only one candidate for the role of rooftop intruder wrapped in a builder’s dust sheet.”Most importantly, Bertie’s inherent sweetness and gallantry are left intact. Almost unbeknownst to himself (but not the ever-hopeful reader), he has fallen in love with a girl who loves him in return. It would seem that nothing could be simpler, but there is no simple in Bertie’s world. Faulks brings a heart-beating passion threatening to “burst the buttons” from his shirt, which had eluded him throughout the Wodehouse novels.Bertie’s genuine affection for Jeeves is also still evident as he asks why Jeeves has helped him along the circuitous path to true love. But he already knows why. “It occurred to me at that moment that the answer was obvious…. I had begun to feel a slight pressure behind the eyes and an odd thickening of the throat.” The British aristocracy that Wodehouse knew and detailed so brilliantly is gone, but the line of position is blurred completely as Bertie articulates the warmth of his and Jeeves’s friendship.The title JEEVES AND THE WEDDING BELLS hints at the finale, but we still blunder along with Bertie, laughing out loud in pleasure and surprise at the deftness of Faulks’s clever storyline and the faithfulness to Wodehouse’s best-known characters.Good show.- Jane Krebs","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17EH1IZGKX4P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047595#wasThisHelpful","R17EH1IZGKX4P8","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Littell is arguably best known for THE COMPANY, a dog-knocker of an espionage novel published in 2002 that mixed history with fiction and made the former more believable. However, Littell was well known to readers of thrillers before and since for having compiled an enviable qualitative canon of books over the course of four decades.Interestingly enough, his latest effort, A NASTY PIECE OF WORK, is different from THE COMPANY and just about everything else he has published thus far. To wit, it clocks in at well under 300 pages (but, in a very good and wonderful way, seems longer) and concerns a private investigator rather than spies. It also (except in flashback) eschews foreign ports of call for domestic ones. Readers familiar with Littell will marvel at his range, while newcomers will seek out his backlist.A NASTY PIECE OF WORK contains just about every cliche associated with noir private-eye fiction --- from Gunn’s persona as a rumpled white knight to the alluring and potentially dangerous damsel in distress to the flawed hero making a deal with at least one devil. What is impressive here is that Littell takes these elements and makes them his own to the extent that by the time one reaches the point in the book where it would be reasonable to anticipate the arrival of such elements, the reaction upon same is delight, due to the manner in which they are presented.That notwithstanding, Littell cannot resist a side visit into the world of spying and counterterrorism where he has previously made his bones. Private investigator Lemuel Gunn is an ex-CIA agent who was bounced from a field position in Afghanistan. He now works cheaply --- $95 a day --- out of a mobile home that he calls “Once in a Blue Moon” and has some historical importance of a sort. Gunn is stuck out of time, a courtly anachronism who eschews cell phones and has no idea what “googling” is.As A NASTY PIECE OF WORK begins, Gunn is being retained by a new client, the attractive Ornella Neppi. The lady, who Gunn immediately nicknames “Friday,” is in a jam. It seems that she is a bail bondsman who has a client named Emilio Gava, who, from all indications, is about to skip out on his court appearance, leaving her holding a six-figure bag. Gunn begins investigating, but what he does not find is far more significant than what he does. Specifically, the guy is a ghost, an individual who people can only vaguely describe but who seems to have an aversion to having his picture taken. Worse, the police file on the cad is mysteriously missing. Gunn, assisted by Friday, follows the whisper of a trail to Nevada and Arizona, keeping old friends with some difficulty and making enemies along the way.Before they are done, the FBI is involved, as well as a couple of mob families with conflicting interests and an uneasy truce that is a heartbeat away from being broken. And, of course, he is falling deep for Friday. You’ll be forgiven if you reach the conclusion before Gunn does that this is probably not a good idea, a state of affairs whose repercussions echo all the way to the conclusion of the book.Irony abounds in A NASTY PIECE OF WORK. The traumatic experiences that have caused diversion in Gunn’s life during the past and present are eerily similar, not to mention that Gunn, when confronted with important choices, often makes the wrong one. These elements are the lagniappe to a wonderfully told tale that is both immediately familiar in form and unique in substance.Littell also thoughtfully provides the reader with a section titled “The Principal Characters in This Book,” which lists just that and tells you exactly as much as you need to know about each of them, in the event that your one-sit reading is interrupted. Thank you, kind sir; those of us of a certain age occasionally forget who is doing what and to whom during the course of anything that exceeds 200 pages, so a glossary of this sort is most welcome. It turns out not to be necessary here, thanks to Littell’s straightforward plotting and memorable characterization.All things considered, A NASTY PIECE OF WORK is a very fine piece of work, indeed.- Joe Hartlaub","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ATRCYGS08AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021456#wasThisHelpful","R33ATRCYGS08AB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sioux “disdained farming and constructed no permanent dwellings.” They seemed so primitive that it was easy for “civilized” Americans to believe that they could be easily conquered, not understanding that for these tribespeople, men and women alike, killing in war represented the highest cultural value.Two experienced authors, Bob Drury and Tom Clavin, have joined forces to create this paean to a lesser-known Sioux chieftain who trained legendary warrior Crazy Horse and won more significant battles against his white foes in the last days of the conquest of the Western frontier. Red Cloud was an exemplary man of his tribe, a respected leader, and also demonstrated virtues unusual for his culture. He once beat, but did not kill, a man from a neighboring tribe who had assaulted a Sioux woman, using not weapons of war but a bludgeon. And he remained monogamous (perhaps loosely defined) rather than take another wife after his sweetheart hanged herself on the day he wed another. These strange actions, and others like them, seem to reveal a man who could stand outside of convention, a quality that may have been what served him so well in constantly ratcheting up his methods of warfare against what proved to be an indomitable foe.The players in THE HEART OF EVERYTHING THAT IS include such greats as Generals Sherman and Sheridan, and mountain man Jim Bridger, on the American side; and Red Cloud himself, Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse on the Indian side. All these men were battling for principle; the principles were different, but each of them was brave and willing to die. Dazzling descriptions of the grueling hours of battles are a highlight here: “Indian and American horseflesh continued to collide at close quarters, the Indians slashing with knives and spears and swinging tomahawks and war clubs…the unwieldy carbines were now useless, and cavalrymen fought back with revolvers…” An especially cinematic scene occurs when a volunteer, who rode 236 miles in four days to deliver the shocking news of Red Cloud’s victorious battle, is dragged half frozen and unable to speak into a ballroom full of soldiers celebrating Christmas night at Fort Laramie. He had ridden his horse to death.Once confronted with the complex workings of American civilization, on a trip to New York, Red Cloud lost his will to fight on, after many years of bloody struggle against the American incursion into the Black Hills he loved and revered. He died on a reservation, having “ultimately realized the futility of his aspirations” to keep his people a sovereign nation in territory they had always inhabited.Drury and Clavin’s book pulls together many aspects of Americana that will fascinate students of Western lore. Along with their intensively researched and dramatically detailed account of the complex relations between the determined settlers and their savage foes, the portrait the authors have created of a great leader fighting for a futile cause is timeless.- Barbara Bamberger Scott","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EW1I9AZV3F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451654669#wasThisHelpful","R35EW1I9AZV3F1","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although, according to Simon Winchester, there is only one woman who had any part to play in the creation of the United States as we know it (Sacagawea wins that distinction), feminist scholars are giving the author of THE MEN WHO UNITED THE STATES a good thorough ribbing --- and rightly so. How did Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Sanger and Lucy Stone not contribute directly to the democratic amalgamation that is now the United States of America? I am perplexed. However, Winchester is such an entertaining writer that I put aside my progressive historical predilections and dived in to see what he did think was the glue that brought us all together --- and what a glue it is.Winchester wrote one of my favorite history books ever --- THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN, about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary --- and he is, like America’s own Doris Kearns Goodwin, capable of finding the perfect balance between gossipy conversation and historical provocation. THE MEN WHO UNITED THE STATES moves from the East to Westward Ho! with an elegance and insouciant headiness that most readers will find compelling and entrancing.Lewis and Clark (and lone lady historical figure Sacagawea), the canal system, the interstate roadways and the telegraph are all occurrences and events that led America in its expansion from 13 warring colonies to the uneasy but still united conglomeration that is the present 50 states. Winchester finds interesting parallels between the inventiveness of some of his figures and the old-fashioned bravery and honor of others. Eccentrics stand toe to toe with topographers and other linear thinkers in a journey that benefited both from pragmatic business-like planning and out-of-the-box, shoot-for-the-stars thinking. THE MEN WHO UNITED THE STATES finds both types of explorer beneficial to our part of the continent.  ""If you have any interest in history, this book should do well by you. If you have not before, take a deep breath and plunge in. Most of what Winchester is saying wouldn’t make for a good Twitter tweet, but it will stay with you and inform your life in ways you can’t imagine until you try.""Lewis and Clark are obvious choices to man the journey of this book; they did man the most important westward expansion our young country had ever known, and their bravery is still felt today. However, the transcontinental railroad and the first geological map both present new characters about whom we don’t know as much, like Theodore Judah and William Maclure. Winchester follows in their footsteps, watching closely at each level of their intrepid explorership for the clues as to why their journeys were so successful in forming the world in which we still live today. The people jump off the page; we feel like we are reading daily records of their dealings and difficulties. Never has construction seemed quite so fascinating.In our tech-heavy world, we are all so bewitched by the little gadgets in our hands that connect us to the world (and marketing companies and the NSA to boot) that we can barely raise our heads to think about the PAST as opposed to the present. But THE MEN WHO UNITED THE STATES marks these important events of the past with such intellectual pursuit that Winchester’s energy draws us right back in time. Don’t read this one on a Nook. Buy the book, feel the weight of the words and drawings and maps and photos in your hand, and ponder them. Ponder the past and see the future arise from it at each turn. Like some kind of 3D IMAX film, this book makes history come alive.Winchester is a journalist at heart but a journalist from another time --- a time when it wasn’t about how many hits you got or how many times you could update a post to improve your hits. He comes from a world (The Atlantic Magazine, to be exact) where details are good and appreciated, where context is just as important as content, where bravery has nothing to do with artisanal cheese or some other such trending topic, but with true forward-thinking and the creativity of real human beings.If you have any interest in history, this book should do well by you. If you have not before, take a deep breath and plunge in. Most of what Winchester is saying wouldn’t make for a good Twitter tweet, but it will stay with you and inform your life in ways you can’t imagine until you try. Now if only a feminist scholar could write something as expansive and rich about women’s contributions to the world in which we live. Well, I can put that on my Santa list. In the meantime, put THE MEN WHO UNITED THE STATES on your holiday wish list right now. It will be an awesome new addition to your library of actual print books, something you will live in for days.

"I’ve said this before: I have a thing for urban fantasy, and that thing is that I can’t turn it down. Give me a realistic setting, some crazy characters, throw a veil of magic over it, and I’m all in.CITY OF LOST DREAMS is the follow-up to Magnus Flyte’s CITY OF DARK MAGIC, where once more we meet up with musicologist Sarah Weston. After finishing her education, she’s back in her hometown of Boston and desperately missing the friends she left behind in Prague, particularly Prince Max. It doesn’t help either that she recently broke up with him, unable to stand the distance in a long-distance relationship. What draws her back to the city, though, is Pollina. The blind music prodigy, whose health is failing rapidly, is with Max in Prague working on a new piece of music. Sarah is on her way to Vienna hoping she’ll be able to get in touch with a doctor whose research looks as though it might be beneficial to, and maybe even cure, Pollina. She is determined to find a treatment, unwilling to let Pollina succumb to something she believes she can change.On her arrival, things go downhill fast. Her friend, Nicolas Pertusato --- or Nico, as he’s known --- is filling her in on all the gossip, including Max’s new girlfriend and Pollina’s health, when a man suddenly ends up in the river and in goes Sarah to rescue him. Nico, who just happens to be over 400 years old, reports that the person Sarah fished out of the river shouldn’t be there --- he died several hundred years before. It’s as if this corpse magically appeared out of a time portal. With strange things churning, Sarah goes looking for a doctor who may have found a possible cure for Pollina and ends up finding more than she was ready for.As I said about the first book in this series, just forget all reality and go with it. It’s strange but also oddly entertaining at the same time. Characters who are exceptionally long lived --- several hundred years old, in fact --- keep showing up, and time portals magically appear. Don’t forget about the drug that allows one to experience the past, throw in a bit of art theft, and you have a story that defies one too many plot twists. Luckily for me, I liked all the crazy, and it keeps topping itself --- one page after the other.Sarah can’t walk down the street without something happening to her. Here’s the thing, though --- it’s all crazy, so the crazy that’s heaped on a single character doesn’t stand out too much. You stop wondering how it’s all going to work and just go with it. While the drug that allows people to essentially experience the past is in short supply this time around, it still plays a part. It’s an innovative way to drag the past to the present in a story that overlaps timelines.If you liked CITY OF DARK MAGIC, you’ll probably be willing to go on another trip with Sarah and the strange gang she has assembled. Be prepared for the outlandish, and be entertained.- Amy Gwiazdowski","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHZY0ERGYAO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123270#wasThisHelpful","R2PHZY0ERGYAO8","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past 10 years, there have been two constants during this festive time of year. The first is the global trek Santa Claus will make on Christmas Eve as he visits children from around the world. The second is a new Christmas-inspired mystery from the master of the Victorian era, Anne Perry.The interesting thing about A CHRISTMAS HOPE, as well as the previous 10 novels in the Christmas series, is that they all feature various characters from the literary universe Perry has created. With small exception, all of her mysteries feature either William Monk or Charlotte and Thomas Pitt. The era is the same for both, and occasionally characters drift in and out of the two series.A CHRISTMAS HOPE stars Claudine Burroughs, who has worked at the same clinic as William Monk’s wife, Hester. She is a periphery character of the Monk series who now has the opportunity to step up as the protagonist in this new holiday mystery. Claudine is an unhappy woman who is only alive and happy when she is working at the clinic.It is the Yuletide season, and Claudine and her husband, Wallace, are guests at an exclusive holiday party. Wallace is comfortable rubbing shoulders with the wealthy and powerful of London society, and does not approve of the work Claudine does at the clinic. While mingling at this gathering, a horrific event takes place. Someone has snuck in a streetwalker to the party, and she ends up getting attacked.The end result of this violent action is the unconsciousness and nearly lifeless body of the streetwalker --- a woman identified as Winnie Briggs. When Winnie ends up dying from her head wounds, the police are in search of her killer. All fingers are pointed at a local poet named Dai Tregarron. Claudine spent some time chatting with Dai and found him to be charming and far from a violent killer or molester of women.Claudine believes that Winnie was actually brought to the party by a trio of young men --- all from wealthy families --- and that they are behind her unfortunate end, as well as pinning it on Dai. She is not sure who to turn to and decides to enlist the assistance of the clinic’s bookkeeper, Squeaky Robinson, himself a recurring character in the Monk series. Squeaky reluctantly decides to aid Claudine as he also believes in Dai’s innocence.With public opinion clamoring for justice to be done and having the gallows awaiting him, the newly apprehended Dai will be spending Christmas in prison and a sure death sentence to follow. Claudine informs her husband, who is in favor of Dai being brought to justice, that “Christmas is about offering hope to all people, not just those like ourselves.”With A CHRISTMAS HOPE, Anne Perry once again plays her part in adding another one of her signature Victorian mysteries to the Christmas series, which has now become an annual visitor in her readers’ homes. The messages of hope, justice and peace on earth continue to ring true.- Ray Palen","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPKZFVE0MGJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345530756#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPKZFVE0MGJJ","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The publication of CROSS MY HEART marks 21 volumes in 20 years in the Alex Cross canon. James Patterson’s career trajectory has risen and widened remarkably --- phenomenally, in fact --- in the ensuing two decades since Alex Cross was introduced in ALONG CAME A SPIDER. While Patterson, both before and after Cross’s conception, has created many popular characters, his most enduring has been Cross. This, in no small part, has been due to the continuing changes in Cross’s professional and personal lives, which have taken place across the length of the series. Cross is now a psychologist in private practice who frequently consults with the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, attempting to balance the rigors and demands of this work with his considerable duties as a husband and father --- and grandchild as well --- to his family.It is those familial duties that provide the underlying propellant for CROSS MY HEART, in which Cross is under significant pressure to solve two cases. The first involves a series of attacks carried out in massage parlors in the Washington, D.C. area. Someone is entering the establishments and killing employees and customers at will. When one of the victims is discovered to be a very popular professional football player, the Metro D.C. Police come under public and private pressure to solve the killings and bring the perpetrator to justice. This particular murder becomes a symbol of D.C.’s skyrocketing crime rate, and each day that goes by without the arrest of a suspect is like a stroke tally of failure for the department.Even more frustrating for Cross is the other case, which concerns the kidnapping of infants by a seemingly brazen woman who convinces parents and caregivers to literally surrender control of their offspring to her. Cross feels a deep personal responsibility to solve and stop the kidnappings, and when he makes a startling discovery that links the abductions to other offenses, a pattern begins to emerge. His investigation, though, comes at a price --- time with his family --- while each member is in need of his presence and wise counsel for various reasons, not the least of which is a long-planned and extensive home remodeling project that has Cross’s grandmother, the woman who raised him, at her wit’s end.While all of those elements are in play, events of great significance, of which Cross is not immediately aware, are about to change his life forever. A brilliant criminologist who is also a dangerous killer is obsessed with committing perfect crimes, and he is determined to take down and destroy Cross for good. With almost inhuman patience, Marcus Sunday, known as The Writer, is observing Cross and his family, learning their patterns, interests, and everything else about them that can possibly be acquired through observation and surveillance. Sunday, with the aid of an equally deranged --- and seductive --- accomplice, waits for just the right moment and then strikes, systematically taking Cross’s life apart in one fell swoop, leaving him with nothing and almost no one. By the end of the book, Cross’s life is forever changed.Patterson has never shied away from making dramatic changes in Cross’s life, and for this 20th anniversary book, he pulls out all the stops even more so than usual. In an Author’s Note at the conclusion of CROSS MY HEART, he assures us that Cross, at least, will be back in another volume. Who else will make the cut, literally? We will have to wait until next year to find out. Be rest assured, though, that the results will be anything but predictable.- Joe Hartlaub","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WCJ515BBV48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316210919#wasThisHelpful","R35WCJ515BBV48","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is the night that will change everything in shoemaker Valentine Roncalli's life. On this Christmas Eve, handsome native Italian Gianluca Vechiarelli has asked Italian-American Valentine to marry him, and she has accepted. Gianluca is a master artist leather tanner, so it seems to Valentine to be the perfect match in all ways, even though he is 18 years older than she is, has been previously married, and has a grown daughter. The fact that Gianluca's father is married to Valentine's grandmother adds a certain quirky twist to the family tree, but certainly doesn't bother either Valentine or Gianluca.They have managed to overcome the fact that their engagement evening got off to a rocky start, with Valentine's soon-to-be fiancé encountering Valentine comforting her close friend, Bret. Now Valentine warns Gianluca about the maelstrom soon to come, as they meet up with her boisterous family. Her sister Tess's house is decked out, to the max, for the holiday, and --- no surprise to Valentine --- the place is in an uproar, with one brother-in-law announcing he's been laid off and elderly Aunt Feen calling him a loser. Happily, Valentine and Gianluca quell the brouhaha with their news. The formerly battling relatives are instantly joined in joy, rejoicing that nearly-40-year-old Valentine has beaten the odds and won't remain a spinster. Of course, Valentine's mother has been unleashed, instantly ready to plan out an extremely elaborate wedding.Valentine, though hoping for sedate nuptials, is pulled into her mother's preparations. The wedding date will be February 14th, which accelerates the frenzy. Despite her mother's couture dreams, Valentine has ideas of her own as to what her wedding gown will be. Of course, real life being what it is, her romantic daydreams are frequently interrupted with concerns. Some of the problems are not surprising, considering the cultural differences between Valentine and her intended. Gianluca has issues with Valentine working with Bret, which makes the situation at Valentine's family shoemaking business awkward since Bret is their financial expert. Although the difference in ages doesn't trouble Valentine, others (including Gianluca) refer to it often. In addition, Gianluca has made it clear that he prefers to live in Italy, but Valentine is a businesswoman through and through. She can't leave the shop and must stay in New York --- a view that leads to heated discussions with Gianluca, warning her that if she sacrifices living for work, she'll be unhappy, while Valentine doesn't feel that she needs to choose between work and life.In spite of their differences, February 14th and what Valentine calls ""the world's fair of weddings"" looms ever closer. When the day finally arrives, Valentine is filled with joy, even as two guests give her news that will impact her life and her business in profound ways. Now it is up to Valentine to pick her way carefully along the tightrope between her role as ""wife"" and that of ""businesswoman.""THE SUPREME MACARONI COMPANY is a diverting read, ultimately delivering a powerful emotional punch, enhanced by Adriana Trigiani's charming writing style. I have to confess that I have not read the first two books in this trilogy (I know! Where have I been?), and so I was a bit lost at some of the references here. While I found the plot to lag a bit when discussing Valentine's business, established fans of the series are likely to be much more interested, since they're already invested in Valentine's life. For these reasons, I think it would be worthwhile to consider reading the trilogy from the beginning, which should be three books worth of pure pleasure. However, even as a behind-the-times Valentine newbie, I enjoyed this book (it’s so easy to see why Trigiani is a bestselling author), particularly the depictions of Valentine's relatives, which are genius: hilarious and poignant.- Terry Miller Shannon","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75Y14H4ZF9O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062136585#wasThisHelpful","R75Y14H4ZF9O2","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 1987, in the days of the black spider suit, Spider-Man got a one-way ticket to a mental institution. Unfortunately for him, it was an institution run by the evil Kingpin, who used it as a front for drugging and then manipulating inmates into committing his crimes. Even worse for Spider-Man, he would take another trip back to the mental institution in 1992 in a sequel to the epic storyline.All the stories of Spider-Man’s mental incarceration are collected here in LIFE IN THE MAD DOG WARD, from writer Ann Nocenti and artists Cynthia Martin and Chris Marrinan. There’s a long (for a superhero comic) buildup to the reasons for Spider-Man going into the asylum, and it’s a stretch of writing where Nocenti gets to shine. We open on a frightened, seemingly dementia-ridden woman talking to the voices in her head and planning to leave her husband and take their two kids with her. When he comes home early and surprises her, you can almost hear the strains of chilling suspense music playing in the background. Turns out he’s a crook working for the Kingpin, and his wife is about to pay a steep price for her betrayal.The late ’80s and early ’90s weren’t the best time for Spider-Man stories. Soap-opera-style drama often played out on the pages (literally at times: Peter Parker’s wife, Mary Jane, was a soap opera actress), but Nocenti has always had a great ear for dialogue that makes for relatable characters, so she elevates this material beyond its simple premise (the “superhero in a mental institution” is a standard comics trope and a dangerously predictable slope to head down). Cynthia Martin’s vividly cartoonish art is so perfectly ’80s that it’s hard not to love; it seems like a melding of John Romita Jr. and Paul Smith’s styles. The Bill Sienkiewicz covers collected with the issues are a real treat as well.- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XHF5QFS938CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785185038#wasThisHelpful","R2XHF5QFS938CB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liliko is the hottest fashion model and celebrity in Japan. But she’s literally falling apart. It takes countless surgeries to keep her looking like a star, and now that constant work on her face and body is having serious repercussions.Kyoko Okazaki has been a pioneer of women’s-issue-focused manga for decades. She is fearless in her depictions of sex, cultural and political issues, and her examinations of fame and our societal obsessions. She tears through boundaries in Helter Skelter: Fashion Unfriendly, which shows the very ugliest side of fame and fortune.This story was first serialized in the mid-’90s and then published in 2003; Vertical has rereleased the book following its adaptation into a film. It is definitely for adults, featuring graphic sex, language, and nudity.It’s more than just a grim look at fashion, however. As Liliko continues to need more cosmetic surgeries, she is forced to rely more and more on the work of a shady surgeon. But that surgeon is up to some very suspicious things, and that has caught the eye of a police investigator. Meanwhile, Liliko’s relationship with her wealthy fiancé ends abruptly, causing her to go off the deep end even more. Violence and intrigue ensue.The overall effect of HELTER SKELTER’s story is grim, horrifying, and even a little off-putting at points. It’s not a story for everyone, but its intense commentary on modern obsessions with celebrity is often spot-on.- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39Y33LTX1C5YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935654837#wasThisHelpful","R39Y33LTX1C5YN","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM, the action-packed and visually stunning anime from 1979, inspires another graphic series…this time, one that journeys back in time to the year “Universal Century 0079” to explain the beginnings of war.This nicely done book --- nearly 450 pages of beautifully rendered story, plus two informative essays on the history of MSG --- from writer/illustrator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, one of the designers from the original show, is a treat for the eyes. No real knowledge or understanding of the original MSG is needed; this is a simple, straightforward sci-fi adventure featuring a war between the people of Earth and the people formerly of Earth.In this advanced age, humanity has built gigantic terraformed spaceships to house members of the overpopulated human race. When one of these colonies breaks away and declares itself a free nation, it begins waging war on the home planet. A 15-year-old Earth boy, Amuro Ray, is caught in the midst of one of the epic battles and accidentally stumbles upon Earth’s latest weapon in the war: the Mobile Suit Gundam.What follows are hundreds of pages of suspenseful war drama and sci-fi explosiveness, all of which is well and good (seriously good, actually; this is an intensely fun sci-fi epic), but it’s the visuals that you are truly getting this book for. Yasuhiko is a master of mind-blowing visuals, beginning with the beautifully painted introduction to the book (those six pages are in color; the rest is in black and white).This retelling of the classic MSG narrative is the first volume in an 11-volume arc. That’s a ton of story your eyes can look forward to.- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D80BMI3MKO16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193565487X#wasThisHelpful","R2D80BMI3MKO16","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a book that elegantly shows the potential for comic book storytelling. Deep and emotionally complex, WHEN DAVID LOST HIS VOICE subtly unfolds into a gripping, lovely work.David receives the grim news --- stage 3 cancer --- at the very onset of WHEN DAVID LOST HIS VOICE. Still, there’s hope. Chemotherapy and radiation offer a chance to beat this, despite his fear. With anxieties mounting, David struggles with how to tell his family --- which includes his wife, Paula, and their 9-year-old daughter, Tamar, as well as David’s adult daughter, Miriam, from a previous relationship --- the news. More to the point: How to discuss his deep anxieties and all the competing thoughts running through his head? Meanwhile, Miriam, pregnant from a brief, casual relationship, delivers a son, Louis.This sets the scene for the family turmoil that comes about after David’s diagnosis. Each character deals with their fear and their sadness in different ways. Each has a different attitude toward sickness and death. Each is unique. The various perspectives are well done.This is a special book. It doesn’t shy away from its topic, nor does it meander into sentimentality.

"They’re no longer a supercouple, but Superman and Lois Lane had a good run for much of Superman’s 75 years in existence. That’s why Lois is getting her own hardcover retrospective in the collection LOIS LANE: A CELEBRATION OF 75 YEARS.This book begins with Lois’s first appearance, which is also the same as Superman’s: Action Comics #1. From the very beginning, Lois has been a shrew to Clark Kent…the very first words the character ever utters in print are these, in response to Clark’s request for a date: “I suppose I’ll give you a break…for a change.” Thanks, Lois, that’s awfully sweet of you. (While Clark takes Lois’s jabs on the chin, he gets to be a cad to her in return when he’s in the role of Superman; on one of their very first encounters, she asks when she’ll see him again and he replies, “Perhaps tomorrow…perhaps never!” It’s no wonder these two couldn’t make things work.)Nearly two dozen Lois Lane stories are reprinted here, and it’s a fascinating retrospective of the character, as well as of comic books themselves. The silly stories of the 1950s and ’60s are hard to take seriously in any way now, but they have some nostalgic pleasures. The more interesting stories come later, in the ’90s and ’00s, especially a classic issue of Wonder Woman in which Lois interviews the Amazing Amazon and freely discusses the jealousy she feels. It’s in instances like these that we start to see what Superman has seen in Lois Lane all along.- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0LGDPY2CD56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401247032#wasThisHelpful","R1R0LGDPY2CD56","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With great power comes great responsibility. With a great Paul Pope superhero book comes a whole lot of fun.The city of Arcopolis is overrun with “monsters” --- incredibly evil gangs of masked men who kidnap children. They pluck children off the street with wild abandon, and the city is seemingly powerless to stop them. Only the hero known as Haggard West --- great name --- dares to fight these monsters. With his Batman-like powers and persona, he fights (and kills) monsters whenever he can, along with his trusted sidekick, his young daughter Aurora. But when the monsters kill Haggard West, the city of Aurora seems to have no hope.Except that a new hero is about to emerge --- one from a world very far away. Battling Boy has been sent here by his father on the eve of his thirteenth birthday to prove his mettle as he begins his journey into adulthood. Gifted with T-shirts made of enchanted fabric (with the pictures of various animals depicted on them), Battling Boy can assume the powers and abilities of a T-Rex, lion, leopard, orangutan, boa constrictor, fox, wolf, griffin, bull, pterodactyl, elephant, and, uh, a field mouse. He’ll need all of them to battle the evil around town, as well as to put up with the town leaders, who want to turn him into a marketing tool.Even worse, our hero is decidedly unsure of himself and of his powers. More than that, though, he really has no idea how to fight his battles (ironic, given his name). His lack of skills is endearing, but it’s also a great storytelling device that leaves him with much to overcome as he tries to assume the mantle of hero.The amazing Pope combines multiple styles of storytelling for BATTLING BOY. It’s by turns action-packed and hilarious, as well as poignantly evocative. That mix of pacing is superbly done, as is the incredibly thrilling artwork- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQHO3GWQ0ZGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596431458#wasThisHelpful","R2AQHO3GWQ0ZGP","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is this the most, well, graphic cover of a graphic novel ever? Quite possibly!MADISON SQUARE TRAGEDY starts in 1901 New York City, which is innovating the country and the world with phenomenal advancements in business, the arts, and architecture. One of the top architecture firms in the city is McKim, Mead and White, whose most visible partner is Stanford White, a towering man who lived a very public lifestyle. One night, while out to dinner, White is brutally gunned down by millionaire Harry Thaw, who said he committed the murder to avenge his wife’s honor. Hmmm. There must have been some really strong grievance there.It was a strange murder case, and one that kept the city enthralled. Rick Geary delightfully examines it in the latest installment of his A TREASURY OF 20TH CENTURY MURDER series. It’s delightful because Geary is such an excellent historical storyteller, not to mention a gifted artist. But White’s life, which Geary probes along with that of Thaw and Thaw’s former-showgirl wife, had some decidedly provocative elements.Geary’s series is one of the most interesting examinations of historical events going on in comics. While comics are proving somewhat popular for historical fiction and nonfiction these days, few get it right the way Geary does --- thoroughly researched, with bibliographies, and a keen eye for detail. Despite some of the lurid details in here, there’s really nothing inappropriate for teen and older readers in MADISON SQUARE TRAGEDY.- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S31335FMK5HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561637629#wasThisHelpful","R3S31335FMK5HB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The colors pop and the artwork sings throughout the seven stories featured in EXPLORER: THE LOST ISLANDS, the second anthology from editor Kazu Kibuishi (the creator behind the wonderful Amulet series). Kibuishi’s AMULET is known for these eye-grabbing splashes, which take full advantage of the spectrum of four-color creativity that comics allows, so it’s no surprise to see them on display here as well.The anthology opens with Jake Parker’s “Rabbit Island,” a parable about laziness overtaking a teamwork-filled island of bunnies. Parker is the creator behind the kid-friendly MISSILE MOUSE, and his story shares some of the fun and innocence found in those books.From there we launch right into the spooky and somewhat eerie “The Mask Dance” from Chrystin Garland. A girl searching for her father is offered a free ferry ride to a bizarre island, where she is told her father awaits. But there is something far more sinister in store.Jason Caffoe’s delightful “Carapace” is next. A boy lost on an island finds adventure and friendship with a crab spirit and learns how to fend for himself in an inhospitable environment.“Desert Island Playlist,” by Dave Roman and Raina Telgemeier, is a standout tale of three females --- a baby, a teenager, and an old woman --- all trapped on a desert island with just three songs each and a book they love to keep them entertained. But as they get to know each other better, they discover some strange connections between them all.Michel Gagné’s “Loah” is simply gorgeous. Lush aquamarine colors fill seas inhabited by orange, brown, and red fish in a sparsely worded tale. “Radio Adrift” by Katie Shanahan and Steven Shanahan is the story of a mage in training who is trying to hatch a pixie egg. But she needs a certain sound to do it, and that means she needs the guy on the radio to keep talking --- except the station is about to drift away.The final story is Kibuishi’s own “The Fishermen,” and it’s as color-filled and splendidly engaging as the rest of the book. A captain obsessed with finding a giant fish puts his own life and that of his crew at risk. When they find an uncharted island, they don’t realize the grave danger they’re in --- but a fisherman and his young grandson do.All of these stories function as parables in a way, but even more, they’re a solid mix of fun and adventure often told with an eerie twist. I recommend it for kids and for anyone appreciative of the colorful creativity of this brilliant team of writers and artists.- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1KSJ3H2L8FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141970883X#wasThisHelpful","R2F1KSJ3H2L8FB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Self Made Hero, a publisher that continues to push the boundaries of what graphic novels can be, releases another winner with a evocative, beautifully rich book. REBETIKO, named after a style of music in Greece (""the Greek blues""), is immediately captivating with its sun-kissed yellow hues and sparse black lines delineating a time and a place almost forgotten in the modern world.In Greece in the mid-1930s, a young and rather mischievous rebate --- a musician who plays rebetiko --- named Stavros is forced to evade the authorities who have come to crack down on this style of music and the lifestyle that accompanies it.

"Strange as it may sound, Nightwing is by far a more interesting character than his mentor, Batman. While Batman possesses almost all-powerful superhuman skills and an inexhaustible supply of odd villains, Nightwing is simply more human, more relatable, and ultimately more fallible. These flaws make the character much more likable and interesting to read.With DC's New 52 relaunch now two years old, Nightwing has begun to grow into a fun book. Volume 2 of his series stands solidly on its own, tying into the Court of the Owls storyline going on in Batman's books, but giving Dick Grayson the opportunity to have his own life and his own story. There's romance in the offing (albeit somewhat tritely: The daughter of his parents' murderer is now a banking executive, and Grayson needs to secure a business loan), there's a chance for Nightwing to show off his sleuthing skills, and there's extreme tension (here's where the book really shines: Nightwing's status as an outlaw hunted by a police officer with a grudge keeps the book's plot swiftly moving).The creators here deserve credit for several bright spots in Nightwing. First, in this age of endless comic tie-ins, it's nice to read a collection that stands on its own. Second, it's wonderful to see Gotham City and its gritty cityscapes depicted here. While it doesn't quite strive for the heights of the great Brubaker/Rucker Gotham Central stories, it hits some of the same notes, which is nice. And third, as this collection shows, Nightwing's solo book is a treat for comics fans who like a solid storyline without superpowers.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CBG7760KQEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401240275#wasThisHelpful","R12CBG7760KQEP","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Joffo's amazing real-life story is depicted in this graphic novel suitable for teens and younger readers (as well as adults). Joffo was born in Paris in 1931, and he and his brother faced a great deal of pain growing up Jewish. When their parents realize it's no longer safe for them in France, they decide to flee, and their journey causes the two brothers to act bravely in the face of a horrible looming threat.This is not a quick read. It's a densely packed comic that does not scrimp on story or details. It is intense (but not too intense for young readers), and it is thorough. It's also very educational, perfectly suited for young readers: a map depicts Joseph and his brother's travel through Europe, and a glossary at the end reveals the meaning of several French terms. There's also a segment about France under the occupation, which gives readers a simple overview. This powerful book is well worth exploring for readers of any age.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BD1JK538XEBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467715166#wasThisHelpful","R1BD1JK538XEBG","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karl Stevens spent several years as the official cartoonist for The Boston Phoenix, drawing amazingly realistic renditions of people and creating small slice-of-life profiles of wit and profundity. His award-winning series came to an abrupt end, however, after he depicted a character offering some rather harsh criticism of Bud Light.That panel, along with all the others, makes it way to this nice collection. It's a shame that Stevens calls this book Failure, because it's unequivocally a great success, one that has such demented treasures as Pope Cat and other talking animals, weird dreams featuring Prince and Michelangelo, profound and profanity-laden discussions about life, and more. This isn't a structured narrative, but instead a collection of free-flowing thoughts and images, almost all of which are enjoyable for their gorgeously depicted simplicity.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5ORT8I5CGBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934460028#wasThisHelpful","RI5ORT8I5CGBB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Opening on the morning of President Obama's inauguration in January 2009, Rep. John Lewis's memoir, March, is a powerful recollection of a man's life growing up in a changing world.The son of a sharecropper, Lewis grew up raising chickens, a time that still affects him powerfully. (As a boy, he even preached the Bible to his captive chicken audience.) He even keeps a collection of chicken statues in his Washington, D.C., office. It's clear that Lewis never forgets the past from which he came.It's a heartbreaking past. March is a tribute to the courage of those who fought, spoke out, marched, and sat down in the front of the bus at a time when virtually any act could lead to arrest...or far worse. Seeing just how painful and awful it all was makes it all the more poignant when Jim Lawson tells Lewis, in 1958, ""Do not let them shake your faith in nonviolence--love them!""Lewis and co-writer Andrew Aydin (who works for Lewis handling telecommunications and technology policy) frame the book as a conversation that Lewis having with a mother and her two sons, who have shown up at his D.C. office. Their questions lead into Lewis's narrative and give him ample opportunity to recollect his life story, from childhood onto first meeting Martin Luther King Jr. and getting involved with the nonviolent movement. The art, from Nate Powell, is stunning and some of the best of Powell's career. He evokes a mood that is reverent and powerful and perfectly suited for Lewis's gentle retelling.March is a wonderful recounting of a horrible time in American history. Its beauty as a graphic novel stands in sharp contrast to the sad nature of its contents, but that too makes the book all the more remarkable.-- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1BBTN3D663/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603093001#wasThisHelpful","R2R1BBTN3D663","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gather the family around the radio and marvel at the amazing exploits to be found in The Thrilling Adventure Hour!Created by the writing team of Ben Acker and Ben Blacker, The Thrilling Adventure Hour is a trip back in time to the classic days of radio programs that delighted entire families. The pair, who met while working together writing TV shows, created the program in Los Angeles, where it is acted out by top talents before sold-out audiences. The comic version, written by the two Bens and illustrated by a slew of talented comic stars, lives up to the stage program's stellar reputation.It's a fun throwback to a much simpler time (there are even cigarette ads --- fake ones, to be sure --- strewn throughout the book). There's an air of olden times on every page, much to the delight of readers.The book opens with the adventures of Sparks Nevada (""Marshal on Mars""), who has some unwanted assistance from an unlikely --- and unwanted --- helper. We plunge ahead with Phillip Fathom, a deep-sea detective, and then meet other heroic chaps, like Colonel Tick-Tock, Captain Laserbeam, Jefferson Reid, and even Amelia Earhart. Each story is fun; none overstays its welcome.The best tale is saved for last. Frank and Sadie Doyle are the booziest couple to ever see dead people, and they're also two of the funniest. Their dry wit takes the book to a lively end with the undead and leaves the audience clamoring for more. Here's hoping for another volume soon.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9DJZK9GGYZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936393964#wasThisHelpful","RN9DJZK9GGYZ0","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wendell, the kid at the center of The Reason for Dragons, is tough to figure out. He's not given an age, but he seems to be about 13 or so. He doesn't get along great with his stepfather, but his stepdad isn't a bad guy at all. Wendall's mother also seems to be a pretty good mom...maybe a little busy and distracted, but still good. Wendell's father is deceased, and apparently, while alive, he was a very good man. And therein lies the problem. Wendell is trying to emulate a hero who died before he could ever really get to know him and trying to live up to some very high standards...at the expense of learning to just be himself.Chris Northrop writes this charming book that is decidedly unpredictable. Jeff Stokely's squiggly yet vividly detailed art helps capture the dual tones of Renaissance Faire levity and coming-of-age seriousness perfectly.Northrop's story bounces in many directions, giving parts of his story time to breathe. He opens with a scene about Warren's stepfather --- a scene that seemingly has very little to do with the main plot of the book, and one that many other writers would have left out. It's these little storytelling jaunts that offer many of the pleasant surprises in The Reason for Dragons.When a misunderstanding causes Wendell to run away, some local bullies taunt him into venturing out to an allegedly haunted Renaissance Faire grounds, where he meets a knight who claims to be fighting an evil dragon. Is he delusional? Is he real? By the time Northrop answers this question for us, we've been charmed.A few short stories close out the book, each one giving further insight into the characters and making us hope Northrop has reason revisits this dragon world again soon.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25LUG920UVG02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936393743#wasThisHelpful","R25LUG920UVG02","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wonderful Percy Gloom (""slow to courage, quick to nausea"") returns to learn more about his seemingly immortal life and to discover romance with the beatifically rumped Miss Margaret.Despite being hundreds of years old, Percy Gloom is delightfully nave. He's a bit plain looking, too. A little simple-minded, too, but there's nothing wrong with that. In this second volume, he is coming to terms with his extreme longevity while also falling far Margaret, to whom he's given not only his heart but also a trinket that was handcrafted by his mother. But when he falls into one of his centuries-long slumbers, he finds himself waking up in a strange new world...one without Margaret.It's clear from the beginning that Percy Gloom's story is a fable, and as such, the joy here is in watching Cathy Malkasian's gentle, humorous, and heart-filled story unfold with simplicity --- and also with profound truths. Of course, you will come for the beautiful story, but you will probably linger for the gorgeous artwork. Malkasian's deft touch draws the reader seamlessly from page to page, eyes filled with wondrous sights. You'll fall in love with Percy Gloom.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJSMCGN9KH3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160699638X#wasThisHelpful","R2BJSMCGN9KH3B","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ariol makes his American debut in two new collections from Papercutz. The books, Just a Donkey Like You and Me and Thunder Horse, are French imports by writer Emmanuel Guibert and artist Marc Boutavant.The two colorful collections each feature multiple short stories starring the lovable little blue donkey and the various animals that fill out his life (a pig for a best friend; a dog for a teacher; and a heifer, of course, for his crush). The books are hilarious and charming (adults will enjoy reading them almost as much as kids).Guibert's work here is delightful. After all the serious connotations in his previous works (the amazing The Photographer and Alan's War, for example), it's a pleasure to read these simple, silly stories. Kids will love them, as well as Boutavant's pleasant drawings.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EX7ZC15SP24A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597073997#wasThisHelpful","R2EX7ZC15SP24A","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the 1990s, a semiautobiographical comic series named Minimum Wage began. It depicted both New York City and the 20somethings who lived there with brutal clarity and utter charm.Minimum Wage represented a new indie age in comics. The classic comix of the '60s, '70s, and early '80s gave way to a new breed of auteur, one that was bold and daring yet not always as outrageous. Indie comics became less rebellious and more mainstream, more easily attainable, and as such, they mirrored other pop-culture artistic movements, like the birth of grunge rock or the (later to come) burgeoning of mumblecore in film.What makes Minimum Wage so lovable (and readable) is its easygoing affability as it documents the New York City love affair of Rob and Sylvia, two 20somethings trying to advance (or start) their careers while navigating the city.Rob Hoffman is a thinly veiled pseudonym for Bob Fingerman, the writer and artist behind the story. Fingerman makes it clear that the story of Minimum Wage is only semiautobiographical. Much of the elements are based on truth and real-life events, but they're not necessarily true in and of themselves. What is true, however, is the capturing of the vast aesthetic of New York City in the early to mid-'90s, a unique time in the city's history and one perfectly transported to and brought alive on the page.Fingerman's depictions of young men and women struggling to get ahead and to forge a path as adults is true to life as well. There's plenty of sex (and nudity), but it's certainly not graphic. It's simply honest. So are the various storylines, like dealing with an unplanned pregnancy, falling in love and then doubting that love, meeting the friends and parents of those you date, and simply trying to figure out how you fit into all of this life you've begun to create.Maximum Minimum Wage is packed with extras, so it's a treasure trove for old fans and it's a lovely adventure for new fans. Extras include an intro from Robert Kirkman (of Walking Dead fame), tons of pinups from a slew of creators, a cover gallery, behind-the-scenes glimpses from Fingerman, a working script of an issue that never came together, and much more. This is a worthy tribute to a classic '90s comics, and if there's any justice, it will introduce a whole new generation of readers to Fingerman's seminal work.-- John Hogan","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SXJ8JZTYDAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607066742#wasThisHelpful","R28SXJ8JZTYDAI","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When we last left everyone's favorite delinquent-turned-schoolteacher, he was about to be bludgeoned to death by masked bikers who had been hired by Miki Katsuragi, one of his more belligerent new charges. Fortunately, Onizuka has more lives than an army of cats and more toughness than a solid steel wall. Of course he could put the girl through the ringer for trying to have him killed, but that would accomplish nothing, so he opens up to her like she never thought he could, feeling he may have gotten through.However, things do not stay peaceful for long. Due to her abuse of the emergency call he has been using to summon her father (a high-ranking cop), he has turned a deaf ear to any future calls. And in true Boy Who Cried Wolf, or rather ""Girl Who Cried Pervert,"" fashion, as soon as she decides to go out late at night, a seemingly handsome guy is shortly thereafter revealed to be a kidnapper and abducts her. He has been collecting young girls and women for an illegal pornography service, one that drugs the girls and films them being raped with someone wearing whatever the highest bidder wishes.As Onizuka learns of her kidnapping, he immediately spreads the word to his former gang friends and another bike gang and puts them to work, stopping any van similar to the one that took her away. Before leaving to search himself, he literally takes the case to Miki's father by plowing right into police headquarters, where he is working on the very case his daughter has been caught up in.With gang, police and teacher all working to find the criminals, there may not be as much success as one may think, but maybe Ms. Shiratori can help Onizuka tip the scales in their favor. The race is on to find Miki and save her before she is scarred for life, and we all know Onizuka won't rest until he plants his foot in that pretty boy's face.-- David Gromer","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34DSCT60ZVDKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932234896#wasThisHelpful","R34DSCT60ZVDKL","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's so much to love about Kazu Kibuishi's epic, thrilling Amulet series. It pulls inspiration from so many wonderful places (Star Wars, obviously, and Tolkien's works, but other fantasy epics as well), but it also remains an original and thoroughly enjoyable series that stands truly on its own.In Prince of the Elves, Kibuishi lets his imagination fly free, taking young heroine Emily further along her path as she attempts to master the powerful stone in her possession. Emily and her companions, including her brother Navin, are at war with the Elf King, who is about to acquire a new stone that could allow him to finally conquer all of Windsor.Kibuishi wastes no time getting into the heart of the action, and five volumes into the series, we are not even close to getting tired of watching these battles unfold. And we're certainly not tired of seeing Kibuishi's beautifully lush artwork; he's only getting better as the series moves on. As a storyteller and writer, he's also growing. Little flourishes throughout show the immense character growth he's imparted to the various members of his story. It's a welcome treat, especially since this is a pivotal volume in the series in terms of revealing answers to long-lingering questions.Amulet is perfect for kids, but the story is incredibly fun for teen and adult readers as well. It's hard to imagine any comics fan outgrowing something so unabashedly entertaining.-- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKF6XM329MFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545208890#wasThisHelpful","R3BKF6XM329MFP","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's just call this: Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang's current take on Wonder Woman is the best version of the Amazing Amazon in years. Decades, even. It's simply that good.Chiang's art, already so good in the previous volume, Blood, reaches new heights here. Diana looks beautiful, proud, strong, sinewy, exactly as she should, and his keen eye for portraying the supporting characters (a Sandman-esque band of gods and demigods, as well as a pregnant human woman named Zola unwittingly carrying Zeus's child --- and therefore marked for death by Hera) shine through here. Eros, Hermes, Apollo, Poseidon, Hades...all are given modern updates with robust verve. (Eros in particular is a favorite, now wielding guns rather than a bow and arrow...things have changed for this pantheon.)The events of Blood saw Wonder Woman and friends avoid a war between the gods, but their victory came at a harsh price: her friend Zola and her unborn child were taken into Hades' underworld, seemingly forever. Guts pits Wonder Woman against Hades (and Hera, and others) as Diana travels into hell to rescue her friend...if she can.Azzarello's work is sharp, cynical, funny, jaded, and simply engrossing. Page after page flies by, and the synergy his work shares with Chiang's is wonderful to watch. It's a delight to see Princess Diana finally restored to her great potential. I hope this series continues for a good long time.-- John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ANNA4MBR8AP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401238092#wasThisHelpful","R2ANNA4MBR8AP6","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For months now, the industry has been buzzing about the epic graphic novel Anomaly. Epic? It's enormous. 368 pages enormous, not to mention how massively oversized it is (opened up, it has more than a 32-inch wingspan; not the kind of book that's easy to read on a crowded subway).What Anomaly lacks in convenience it makes up for in storytelling and art. Co-creator Brian Haberlin has his hands in both pieces, writing the story along with cocreator Skip Brittenham and supplying art along with Beirrod Van Dyke. All told, it was a project that took the creative team years to assemble...and, interestingly enough, the creative work is still going on, even after publication. This being a fully realized 21st-century graphic novel, Anomaly is not just a book, but an interactive experience (although it reads just fine as a standalone book). Readers are invited to enhance their experiences with Ultimate Augmented Reality, an app that can be downloaded for free. Pages in the book that are ""live"" can then be scanned by the reader's mobile device, which makes objects on the page not only 3D, but also interactive...meaning readers can play along and take on some pretty cool monsters and machines on the pages.What makes Anomaly more fun than all of this suggests, however, is that it's not just all bells and whistles (the bells and whistles are very cool, though). The sci-fi story focuses on a dying world overrun with corporate greed, as all nations and corporations have been merged into one behemoth known as The Conglomerate. Humans vie for scarce resources.Our protagonist, Jon, is a former Enforcer for The Conglomerate and has now been disgraced. To redeem himself, he undertakes a seemingly simple mission of safeguarding a Conglomerate executive's daughter as they sail off to make first contact with a world that may be inhabitable (and may offer more resources to plume). This being a sci-fi novel, you can imagine that things go wrong. When they arrive on the planet, the group is faced with remarkable challenges from the planet's inhabitants and must battle for survival.While the story is not groundbreaking, it is solid and entertaining. The art is exactly as you'd expect: static in that computer-generated way, but with very cool depth and color. But when it comes alive through the app, it's a nice experience.Reviewed by John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUEZO9A5UEW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985334207#wasThisHelpful","RAUEZO9A5UEW5","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been 50 years since Madeleine L'Engle's classic A Wrinkle in Time was first published, and as part of the anniversary celebration of the award-winning children's book, FSG has published Hope Larson's graphic-novel adaptation. It shines in glorious blue, black, and white hues, faithfully adapting an epic tale that multitudes of people hold near and dear to their hearts. Of course, as everyone knows, like and equal are not the same thing: So is it an audacious attempt to transform a classic book into something other than what it originally was? No. It's a beautifully respectful companion to the book, a loving tribute that visually captures the stunning adventure in all its trippy wonder.For many young readers, A Wrinkle in Time introduced the wild concepts of quantum physics, tesseracts, moving through space and time, and much more. The book is filled with incredible concepts (couched in late 1950s/early 1960s mindsets); reading it now is like a time-travel adventure in and of itself. That Larson (Chiggers, Mercury) is able to capture not only the style of the novel (she wisely preserves much of the original dialogue), but also the style of the era that gave birth to it is a tribute to her great skills. Her artwork complements the story perfectly, capturing the goofy beginnings (such as when Mrs Whatsit drops in for a late-night visit early on and quite promptly sprains her dignity) and the later dangers and threats (the Black Thing and IT).The message and central themes of the novel are preserved, of course. The novel's marriage of scientific and religious concepts are perfectly intact. 50 years after publication, the novel still shines and captivates. Now, there's a graphic novel shining along with it.Reviewed by John Hogan","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192N7K5SN7RLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374386153#wasThisHelpful","R192N7K5SN7RLP","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever thought to yourself, ""Gee, I wonder what it would be like to be a little kitten""? Well, wonder no more. Chi's Sweet Home gives us an up-close look at the life of an adorable kitten named Chi (not to be confused with the girl from the hit manga Chobits), following her throughout her everyday life. And the funny thing is, you always know what Chi is thinking (or saying) when she meows, which really got me to thinking, ""Is this how most cats think in this situation?"" Who knows?Everybody thinks the life of a pet is tedious, simple and repetitive. Well, not this cat! Chi leads the reader through the life of a cat one short story after another. Chi has all kinds of adventures in her home and in her neighborhood, whether she is alone or together with her best friend, Cocchi, a male cat with an arrogant personality. Whether it's something as simple as looking for attention from her family or looking for something to do around town, Chi is always having fun. They say cats have nine lives, but I would say Chi doesn't need them - all she needs is one, because no matter how many close calls she ends up in, cats always land on their feet, both literally and metaphorically.Konami Kanata all-color manga is a must-read for all cat-lovers. The use of watercolor is a breath of fresh air to anyone who has been immersed on black & white manga for years. This is definitely a manga that will be loved by both children and their parents, thanks to super-cute Chi!Reviewed by David Gromer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDFNARK0R7E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935654357#wasThisHelpful","R2VDFNARK0R7E3","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second volume of Durarara!! not only follows our friend Mikado Ryuugamine, but multiple other characters as well. More insight is given in Celty's situation, including her own partial account of how she became a Dullahan. She allows us to look into her past life, what she originally did, but we never get to see what her head and face looked like. That, however, is nonetheless revealed in this volume, so take heed.On Mikado's end, he is compelled to volunteer as one of the two representatives for his class, alongside Anri Sonohara, whom I think Mikado has taken a liking to, though he doesn't show it very well. He even comes upon her on the street as she's being bullied. Initially intending to ignore it, he quickly changes his mind, thanks to a helpful shove from Izaya Orihara, our delightfully crazed friend who has more attitudes than Rich Little and changes them at the drop of a hat. We also meet another interesting youth, a man Mikado was told to never get involved with, Shizuo Heiwajima. He is incredibly strong, and more volatile than the Incredible Hulk, but that's just my opinion.We later find out whatever became of Celty's head --- a pharmaceutical company was keeping it for study and conducting tests on it. Apparently, however, due to the obsessions of the younger brother of one of the company's top scientists, the head was surgically attached to a body and given life. We even find out the identity of the said body, as it's being chased by Celty in the middle of a bid to reclaim what it rightfully hers.The creators of this manga started off strong, and they are still going strong. The same characters now have some new things to contend with, especially that superpowered bartender, Shizuo! The saying goes, ""the more the merrier,"" and things are getting more fun every time I pick up these books.Reviewed by David Gromer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DIY24E1VAAD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316209317#wasThisHelpful","R1DIY24E1VAAD8","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the wake of the Flock's battle in and escape from New York City the Flock encounters something that makes their blood chill while en route to Washington, D.C.: flying Erasers. It seems every time the Erasers come after them, there is always a most unwelcome new feature to them. During the ensuing dogfight, Fang is seriously injured, forcing the Flock to leave him in the care of a human hospital.During Fang's stay, an FBI agent appears and strikes a deal with Max: shelter in exchange for a chance to ""learn about the Flock in noninvasive ways.""Naturally, Max doesn't want to decide until Fang is healthy again, but during the night, Max witnesses a horrifying sight: she sees herself as an Eraser when she looks in a mirror. For now, she passes it off as a hallucination, and when Fang fully recovers the next morning, Max decides to take Anne up on her offer. Anne brings the Flock to her home, a farmhouse on 50 acres of land containing everything they could ever need to live in peace. However, as they explore their new home, watching from afar is a certain Eraser who knows Max very well!This is not all, as our heroes make more discoveries within a short time: that Angel's dog, Total, can speak English, and that Max now haves the ability to fly at the speed of light! While on a late night excursion to the city, they begin to investigate clues to Iggy's home, but to no avail.Affairs do not improve for them very much, as Ari reveals himself once more and attacks the Flock. Will things ever get easier for them?Despite it being a graphic novel, so many things happened in this volume, I felt like I was reading a full-length novel. Narae Lee certainly has a way of bringing James Patterson's brilliant and imaginative creation to illustrative life. Anyone who picks up this series will not be disappointed, only becoming more engrossed with each passing installment.Reviewed by David Gromer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22L9FJHQRQGDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0759529698#wasThisHelpful","R22L9FJHQRQGDB","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many discoveries are made in this volume of Maximum Ride. A couple of them are good, and the rest ... no so good, and one of them comes when Max is right in the middle of a date! Wait - Max had a date? Yes, she met a nice boy in the previous volume named Sam who wanted to take her out. Still, regardless of how nice Sam is to her, she refuses to soften, as she feels the entire Flock is, due to living with Anne like normal humans.Soon, Max's haunting image of herself as an Eraser becomes too much to keep hidden any longer and she tells Fang everything. He comforts her in her time of need - what a guy! As the two investigate a lead they happened to come upon, they find a woman who is the spitting image of Iggy, possibly his birth mother. Around the same time, Iggy and Gazzy come upon some startling information. Until two years ago, their school was an insane asylum, The Standish Home for Incurables. The name says it all, doesn't it? I bet the principal of this school used to be a part of the asylum - it would explain his hatred for some certain students.After giving it a great deal of thought, Max brings the Flock to an abandoned bat cave (not to be confused with Batman's favorite hiding place) to voice her concerns to them - that they must leave Anne's place, lest they become soft. However, due to the overwhelming desire of several of its members to have a real Thanksgiving dinner, she folds and settles for leaving after that. Following a very peaceful holiday, the entire Flock escorts Iggy to his parents' house for an old fashioned family reunion.Good times don't last, and the situation starts going downhill fast on many fronts. Treachery is afoot, and it approaches from all sides, so the Flock is in for the tensest times of their young lives. But if Max is destined to save the world in the future, she must stay vigilant. The question is, CAN she stay vigilant with all the chaos happening all around her? And what will happen when a clone of Max shows up?Action, drama, suspense, intrigue and comedy collide to make another excellent addition to James Patterson's Maximum Ride résumé.Reviewed by David Gromer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQ8Z4T3OIS9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0759529701#wasThisHelpful","R2DQ8Z4T3OIS9F","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not easy being a spinster in Victorian Era London, but for Alexia Tarabotti, it's a nightmare. She is a preternatural, a being considered to be ""soulless,"" and capable of reducing supernaturals, such as vampires and werewolves, to mere mortals by making physical contact with them.It all started when Alexia is attacked by a roaming Vampire and kills him. If that had been as simple as it gets, there wouldn't be any need for a panic. However, this is not the case. Lord Maccon, werewolf Alpha, is sent by Queen Victoria to investigate, but of course, he and Alexia fight like cats and ... werewolves.Though initially not interested in getting involved in this supernatural affair, Alexia is quickly engulfed in a shady plot involving an unknown menace, one which is definitely unnatural, but seems immune to her powers. Add in the natural frictions between Vampires and Werewolves and stir well, and you've got a prime recipe for chaos. Bring that to a simmer, and add a touch of natural comedy, followed by a drop of unexpected romance between Alexia and Lord Maccon and you've got a thrilling story full of intrigue, violence, and love.Then, there is the fact that the most important events of this volume take place on the night of a full moon, a.k.a. the worst time to be a werewolf. It is a good thing Alexia can turn werewolves human again with her touch, because what would happen if she was pitted against the one she loved in his most ferocious incarnation? And if she makes it through that experience, what will follow? Certainly not a wedding, right? Right?!This story started out as a beautifully-written novel series by Gail Carriger, and has now found its way into the manga world, thanks to the REM and Yen Press. The book is a little bit larger and thicker than your average manga, so you can expect that much more substance packed into it. This manga touches on the evil that mankind is capable of committing - the non-supernatural humans. It's a story of trust across boundaries such as race, nature, etc.Reviewed by David Gromer","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOZEGQTO7T13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031618201X#wasThisHelpful","R1EOZEGQTO7T13","A3O5RMXRQBWWVX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O5RMXRQBWWVX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My family writes on a chalkboard to keep us motivated throughout the week. It's actually pretty cool and actually does work. However I hated it being my time to write on it before. Touching chalk is one of my least favorite experiences. (I know i am weird) However with these markers you don't have to worry about that. The color is bright and true to what it should be. You don't have to worry about the dull faded version of color anymore. Now when you pick your color you can be sure that it will truly be the color you expected. My favorite are the green and pink.

"book 1:Samantha Moon is a story about a woman who is turned into vampire. But she still manages life, she quits her job and becomes a P.I. and raises her children. But things get a little messy with the case shes working on. Her investigation skills also let her know her husband is cheating on her. I love this book, its unique and keeps your on your toes. I've previously read other books by this author and knew it would be a great read. Glad I waited until he had multiple books out in this series so i can do a straight a read through!book 2:I am hooked! Samantha Moon is attacked by a vampire 6 years before the first book, and was turned. She quits her job as a cop and becomes a PI. In book one we follow her relationship with her husband that turns sour, then her relationship with ""Fang"" and Kingsley a werewolf. In book two we pick up where we left off. Each book has contained Samantha working a case as a PI and also her blossoming relationships. This book ends on a major cliffhanger, so I am grateful there are quite a few more books to go in the series before I am caught up.

So I decided to buy the entire series up to this point, boy am I glad I did. This series is about Samantha Moon, Vampire, mom, and PI. Each book is about a different case she is working, but also centers around her home life. In this book we cheer Samantha for overcoming her horrible husband's gauntlet. But then deeply saddened by her other personal issues. I wish the author went into more detail about the case she was working, how Maddie knew to reach out to her in the first place, etc. The book ends on a major cliff hanger, which would be killing me had I not waited to start this seriesbook 4:the series does need to be read in order for complete understanding. In this book Samantha moon is hell bound to save her son. We get to meet an old vampire who wants the same amulet that she needs. the book brings Kingsley back into Samantha love life.

"I hate having spray foil every time I want to grill. With these I don't have to worry about food sticking, or wasting foil. I save calories from not adding more oil to my foods, which also saves money in the long run.

"I have recently started making my own soaps/lotions/body washes etc and have fallen in love with essential oils. I had never tried thyme essential oil, but have cooked with the herb for years and loved it so I figured why not?! Immediately upon opening this oil you get the strong earthy and to me refreshing scent of thyme. It is not over powering but has the ability to center you based on smell alone. I have read where most people you it to gain focus and mental clarity, which I can see after one smell how it would help. I have to admit I am used to buying bigger bottles of essential oils, but this one will last awhile, a little goes a long way.

I am trying to take better care of myself and after becoming a gluten free vegan ten months ago I have started reading the ingredients on everything. Let me just say you would be amazed at what all goes into products, and for no reason other than a filler. It's disgusting what we have allowed to go into our products! I am excited to make my own lotions and soaps with this product. The product is naturally really thick so you just have to warm it up and add your oils for lotion.

"BOB WELCH-GREATEST HITS: Six stringer/soulful singer Bob Welch bridged the musical gap betwixt Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green-helmed blooze-saturated beginning and the snappy, crackly pop of the Lindsey Buckingham/Stevie Nicks mega-years. Best remembered for Big Mac's mesmerizing chestnut HYPNOTIZED and the sublime original version of SENTIMENTAL LADY, WELCH scored straight out of the solo chute via the ethereal album FRENCH KISS. That exquisitely crafted debut boasted a smartly streamlined LADY remake (featuring warm vocal colorization from Christine McVie, who also figured prominently on the original), plus the infectious follow up hits EBONY EYES and HOT LOVE, COLD WORLD. Later discs yielded diminishing returns, although the irresistibly hook-laden THREE HEARTS and the Pop 40 shoe-in PRECIOUS LOVE remain pristine highlights in his catalogue of coolly rendered chestnuts. Welch may be a ""Where Are They Now"" candidate these days, but this all too brief anthology showcases an underrated rebel rouser who had integrity, charm, and chops to spare.RATING: THREE HEARTS","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGX5IC5RWQ6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MR59ZK#wasThisHelpful","RKGX5IC5RWQ6M","A14W8HXP3RM3ZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14W8HXP3RM3ZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You'll also experience nonsense novelty NAU NINNY NAU, an inevitable 1000 DANCES knock-off, plus solid covers of MOTOWN staples SHOTGUN and MY GIRL, LA BAMBA, BOY FROM NEW YORK CITY and JAMES BROWN's OUT OF SIGHT, which, while hardly usurping the originals, bristle with frat rock energy, soul power and skin tight three part harmonies. FRANKIE GARCIA's lead vocals even grace a couple of dreamy ballads, the polar opposite of HEADHUNTERS DANCE PARTY, a loose, horn-lacerated lo-fi treat.

Too bad one platter wasn't solely devoted to each vocalist, if only for comparison's sake. ROTH's lecherous, overly theatrical attack on YOU REALLY GOT ME, DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY and PANAMA doesn't mesh well with VAN HAGAR's more generic WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE, RIGHT NOW and POUNDCAKE (the band's brief, still-born GARY CHERRONE phase is completely ignored completely). Throughout the ruckus, EDDIE VAN HALEN's nimble-fingered fretboard histrionics, brother ALEX' thundering drums and bass player MICHAEL ANTHONY's high harmony vocals are the common denominator and there's no question that the DLR stuff is a lot more engaging and fun...although HAGAR enjoyed the stronger solo career before and after VH. In spite of three medicore live tracks and an equal number of ""new"" songs (all fronted by HAGAR), BEST OF BOTH WORLDS ponies up  a helluva lot more classic bombast than the spotty BEST OF VAN HALEN released in 1995.RATING: HEADBANGERS","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6RILPZ3Y69J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000286S8S#wasThisHelpful","R1B6RILPZ3Y69J","A14W8HXP3RM3ZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14W8HXP3RM3ZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Flanked by  guitarists JOE PERRY and JOHNNY DEPP (who's already played every other conceivable role), this euphoric party platter kicks off via an ominous narrative from horror icon CHRISTOPHER LEE, and RAISE THE DEAD, an appropriate title given the covers of rock's ""gone too soon"" elite that follows. Rather obvious LED ZEP, DOORS and WHO reboots (plus SPIRIT's I GOT A LINE ON YOU, which The Coop has previously tackled) are offset by the more interesting choices like T-REX chestnut JEEPSTER, SMALL FACES' quasi-psychedelic ITCHYCOO PARK, and a dark regurgitation of LENNON's COLD TURKEY. Throughout, COOPER's sleazy rasp still sounds born to belt archaic anthems...there's even an update of SCHOOL'S OUT with a few bars of ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL tacked on for good measure.

"COUNT FIVE-PSYCHOTIC REACTION/THE VERY BEST OF COUNT FIVE: 99% of music fans have never heard anything from San Jose's COUNT FIVE aside from their Top Ten '66 hit PSYCHOTIC REACTION, the coolest rave up THE YARDBIRDS never did. The true classification of a ""One Hit Wonder"", all of their follow up singles tanked and they never recorded past their debut album, which is included in its entirety on this collection, plus bonus cuts. Unlike most garage rockers of the era, the majority of their output consisted of band originals (mostly from guitarist SEAN BYRNE), not a batch of predictable covers. At least two of the three remakes are fairly daring choices...CURTIS MAYFIELD's authoritative YOU MUST BELIEVE ME and the obscure WHO track OUT IN THE STREET (they also roll out a stutter free replica of MY GENERATION). This is merely competent, minimal chord rock and roll, fronted by singer KENN ELLNER's snotty snarl and BYRNE's six string outbursts...suffice to say they are better remembered for appearing onstage in high collared vampire capes than anything beyond their big hit (which punk wackos THE CRAMPS had the smarts to revive two decades later).

"THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW-CAROL'S CRACK UPS: For decades, we've been subjected to a thirty minute syndicated version of the hour long CAROL BURNETT SHOW (under the title CAROL BURNETT & FRIENDS), favoring comedy skits over the elaborate musical productions inherent to every original episode. In spite of the slightly misleading title, these are full length episodes (meaning you get song and dance numbers mixed in with all the funny stuff) of the greatest variety show of all time. It's also fun to relive the entire Question and Answer periods that opened each program (often trimmed to mere seconds in syndication), not to mention CAROL's sentimental closing song, signature ""ear tug"" and autograph signings by her special guests like HELEN REDDY, JACK CASSIDY and ANDY GRIFFITH. Of course, BURNETT, HARVEY KORMAN, TIM CONWAY and VICKI LAWRENCE bring their immeasurable talents to the party throughout (with an able assist from last season regular DICK VAN DYKE). But CRACK UPS gives a fuller, long forgotten picture of the CAROL BURNETT SHOW...namely, rarely seen complete  episodes of spellbinding magic from an era when Saturday night was truly worth staying home for.

The juke joint juices start flowing early on this 1989 outing as the Lubbock, Texas legend mixes cocky covers of RNB gems like LIPSTICK TRACES and STANDING ON SHAKY GROUND with heady original tunes MAYBE SOMEDAY BABY, I WANNA THANK YOU BABY and B MOVIE BOX CAR BLUES (which THE BLUES BROTHERS immortalized on their debut). He's no slouch with a slow-burner either, channeling OTIS REDDING's passionate pleas in I'VE GOT DREAMS TO REMEMBER with the gusto of the well seasoned show man he so obviously is. This sizzling set of suds, sweat and cheer wraps up with the rowdiest take on YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE ever waxed and MCCLINTON's lone Top 40 pop hit, the hot-steppin' funk-fest GIVIN' IT UP FOR YOUR LOVE...a euphoric, soul-strewn last call that won't soon fade from memory.RATING: FOUR SAWDUST FLOORS","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1BI4ZMN52GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000009Z8#wasThisHelpful","R1E1BI4ZMN52GK","A14W8HXP3RM3ZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14W8HXP3RM3ZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THREE DOG NIGHT-THREE DOG NIGHT:THREE DOG NIGHT's explosive self titled platter ranks as one of the finest debuts of its era, a tone-cool combination of sharp, edgy vocal harmonies and exquisite cover tune taste.  This sizzling 1969 set kick offs in style with a grandiose Top Five interpretation of HARRY NILSSON's starkly drawn ONE, followed by more faithful versions of TRAFFIC's HEAVEN IS IN YOUR MIND, THE BAND's organ-driven CHEST FEVER and the NEIL YOUNG chestnut THE LONER. RANDY NEWMAN, whose MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME would be a future chart topper for the group, TIM HARDIN and JOHNNY ""GUITAR"" WATSON also get the patented 3DN treatment. The triple threat white soul belting frontline of CHUCK NEGRON, CORY WELLS and DANNY HUTTON has never been bettered in pop music, complemented by the rock steady backing of guitarist MIKE ALLSUP, keyboardist JIMMY GREENSPOON and rhythm section of JOE SHERMY and FLOYD SNEAD. Culminating with a scorching read of OTIS REDDING's passion play TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS (CORY WELLS at his unhinged gospel-stoked best), this exquisitely remastered album makes an excellent starting point for fans who'd like toexplore THREE DOG NIGHT beyond their played out copies of GREATEST HITS.RATING: FOUR DOGS","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHDCB8CF18UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGBV5D4#wasThisHelpful","R1VHDCB8CF18UT","A14W8HXP3RM3ZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14W8HXP3RM3ZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS' 2007 tribute COUNTRYPOLITAN FAVORITES is all over the musical map...a dash of pop, a dollop of blues, a splash of rock and lots of tasty twang. As might be expected from the North Carolina trio that previously resurrected the nearly forgotten chestnuts THE NITTY GRITTY and HOUSE OF BAMBOO,  SCOTS' taste in oldies is as exquisitely funky as RICK MILLER's greasy six string sizzle/down homey vocals and MARY HUFF's soul-drenched, sex kittie pipes. On the Nashville side of the coin, RENO & SMILEY's NO LONGER A SWEETHEART OF MINE and LYNN ANDERSON's  ROSE GARDEN get no nonsense work outs, while CLAUDE KING's saga WOLVERTON MOUNTAIN is kicked up a notch via the fragrant fire of HUFF's achingly gorgeous yodels. The rock repertoire runs deliciously deep...is there a KINKS track more suited to SCOTS' quirky sense of humor than MUSWELL HILLBILLY?..toss in T REX, BYRDS and JOHN FOGERTY obscurities and that swampy SLIM HARPO tongue-twister TE NI NEE NI NU and you've got a barn-burner of a roadhouse set list, Bubba!

The scorching super nova title track (often referred to as SON OF A BITCH due to that line's frequent appearance) showcases DAN MCCAFFERTY...maybe the rawest, most explosive screecher in seventies hard rock...in all his ranting, unhinged glory.

"DWIGHT YOAKAM-UNDER THE COVERS: Country maverick DWIGHT YOAKAM has always worn his wide ranging musical influences on the sleeve of his rhinestone Nudie suit...he's scored hits with covers of QUEEN's CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE and CHEAP TRICK's I WANT YOU TO WANT ME, and released an entire album of Bakersfield chestnuts by his idol (and occasional duet pardner) BUCK OWENS. 1997's cleverly titled UNDER THE COVERS finds the hip guru of honky tonk reinventing THE CLASH's punk-pop anthem TRAIN IN VAIN as a punchy bluegrass ditty, tripling the tempo of THE STONES' country rocker THE LAST TIME and playing SONNY BONO to husky-voiced SHERYL CROW's CHER on BABY DON'T GO. Best of all may be his finger poppin' lounge lizard take on that under rated KINKS oldie TIRED OF WAITING, complete with big band horn blasts and funky BOBBY DARIN undercurrent.

"BATMAN-THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON: By its third and final season, the once unfathomably popular BATMAN had its budget slashed, was reduced to one airing a week (no more intricate cliff hanger traps) and got played for laughs more than ever . The main difference of course, was the addition of COMMISSIONER GORDON's self assured librarian daughter BARBARA aka BATGIRL, who looked as fetching in her skin tight purple outfit as JULIE NEWMAR (replaced by a snarling EARTHA KITT this time around) had in her cat suit. The welcome return of FRANK GORSHIN as THE RIDDLER only emphasized how weak the new crop of arch criminals invading Gotham City were...MILTON BERLE's horticulturist heavy LOUIE THE LILAC and JOAN COLLINS' ear-melting SIREN were about the best of the lot...but the less said about LOLA LASAGNA, NORA CLAVICLE and a three episode LORD FOGG arc the better. The once elaborate hideouts morphed into nothing more than simple props on darkened stages, while the plot lines, especially ones involving the JOKER (flying saucers and a surf contest with BATMAN to name two) were the most outrageous yet.

"DAVE EDMUNDS-SUBTLE AS A FLYING MALLET: Few artists carried the retro rock torch higher or more convincingly than its ultimate revivalist, Welsh rocker DAVE EDMUNDS. Boasting one of the coolest titles in album history, SUBTLE AS A FLYING MALLET is a charismatic hybrid of rockabilly, RNB and other pop styles...hardly a surprise from the man whose biggest hit was an echo-laden reboot of HUEY ""PIANO"" SMITH's Big Easy gemstone I HEAR YOU KNOCKING. The acclaimed producer (he's twisted the knobs for everyone from FOGHAT to DION to kd lang) recreates PHIL SPECTOR's famous ""wall of sound"" on DA DO RON RON and BABY I LOVE YOU, gets his twang on via the traditional folk saga BILLY THE KID, and lovingly channels his idols THE EVERLY BROTHERS and CHUCK BERRY. For a change of pace from the ""virtual jukebox"" set list, EDMUNDS, who plays almost every instrument here, lends his high lonesome pipes to the pretty ballad SHE'S MY BABY...written by a certain NICK LOWE, with whom he had a highly influential collaboration as the oldies-inspired super group ROCKPILE a few years later.RATING: FOUR MALLETS","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I7PM14GP6MAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012EBUB6#wasThisHelpful","R3I7PM14GP6MAS","A14W8HXP3RM3ZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14W8HXP3RM3ZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BACHMAN & TURNER-LIVE AT ROSELAND BALLROOM: Gearheads, rejoice! RANDY BACHMAN & FRED TURNER, the creative half of that powerhouse seventies foursome BTO...are alive and well in this 2010 concert reunion. All the old sledgehammer classics are on loud 'n proud display, with BACHMAN's GUESS WHO era juggernauts SHAKIN' ALL OVER and AMERICAN WOMAN lobbed like soul-searing grenades for good measure. TURNER's gruff, banshee wail has weathered surprisingly well over time, as stoked rundowns of LET IT RIDE, ROLL ON DOWN THE HIGHWAY and NOT FRAGILE will attest. Tasty guitar slinger BACHMAN, a much more subdued vocalist, antes up the chugging AM anthems TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS and YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET, wisely avoiding the uppermost notes on his hardest rocker STAYED AWAKE ALL NIGHT. B & T's well oiled machine bogs down only when obligatory ""new tunes"" are trotted out...perhaps the hoarsely croaked sludge-fest WAITING GAME should have been all left off the set list altogether.

"THE WHO-MEATY BEATY BIG & BOUNCY-Covering the singles oriented era before they unleashed WHO'S NEXT, one of rock & roll's most perfect rock albums, MEATY BEATY BIG & BOUNCY rounds up fourteen gemstones from THE WHO's incredibly fertile late sixties period. MY GENERATION, PINBALL WIZARD, I CAN SEE FOR MILES and MAGIC BUS may be the best known landmarks here, but equally amazing are the wry lyrical landscapes explored on SUBSTITUTE, I CAN'T EXPLAIN and I'M A BOY, easily some of PETE TOWNSHEND's wittiest, most cutting work. JOHN ENTWHISTLE, the underused GEORGE HARRISON of the group, spits out the sticky tale BORIS THE SPIDER (his signature ""in concert"" song for decades), while A LEGAL MATTER shows the high pitched TOWNSHEND to be just as interesting and capable a lead singer as ROGER DALTRY.

Always one of ""Hair Metal""'s more palatable exponents, the quintet tackles the underexposed gems such as URIAH HEEP's STEALIN', THIN LIZZY's BAD REPUATION  and UFO's ROCK BOTTOM, coming across like the best Saturday night bar band you ever boogied your beer belly to. Trouble is, it's all a little TOO perfect, right down to JEFF KEITH's vocal simulations of JOE WALSH, ERIC CLAPTON and STEVE WINWOOD and the carbon copy instrumental arrangements...only the staunchest TESLA supporter would say these outshine the originals, but it's a helluva lot of fun nonetheless. A second volume trots out further seventies treasures by everyone from BTO and ZZ TOP to AEROSMITH and BLACK SABBATH, once again sidestepping the most obvious choices.

"BATMAN-SEASON 2, PART 2: While largely maintaining the frenetic fun of the first half of season two, BATMAN was starting to show chinks in the old Bat-Armor at this point. Legendary character actors abound, notably ELI WALLACH as the third (and least chilling) MR. FREEZE, MAURICE EVANS' Shakespeare-quoting, balloon toting PUZZLER and WALTER SLEZAK's CLOCK KING (not to mention his LIFEBOAT co-star TALLULAH BANKHEAD in her final performance as BLACK WIDOW). For the first time, ""double trouble"" team ups come into play...THE PENGUIN joins forces with both THE JOKER and MARSHA, QUEEN OF DIAMONDS in separate three segment story arcs, while MICHAEL RENNIE's suave SANDMAN cuddles up to JULIE NEWMAR's delicious dominatrix CATWOMAN (always BATMAN's most interesting, fleshed out foe). The stunt casting of the GREEN HORNET and KATO (VAN WILLIAMS and BRUCE LEE) is inspired, even if ROGER C. CARMEL's portrayal of COLONEL GUMM in the same adventure is not...meanwhile, JOHN ASTIN's lone shot as THE RIDDLER falls flat (as if anyone could fill FRANK GORSHIN's ballet slippers).

"BATMAN-SEASON 2, PART 1: The first half of BATMAN's sophomore year adds an ever growing list of baddies...the colorful gimmick by which the series lived or died each week...to the core cache of CAESAR ROMERO's maniacal JOKER, BURGESS MEREDITH's cackling PENGUIN and JULIE NEWMAR's skin-tight seductress CATWOMAN (FRANK GORSHIN's deliriously hyperactive RIDDLER is sorely missed). The normally reliable ART CARNEY falls flat as THE ARCHER, CAROLYN JONES channels MORTICIA ADDAMS for MARSHA, QUEEN OF DIAMONDS, and LIBERACE's evil ivory-tickler CHANDEL is inspired stunt casting if nothing else. Much more memorable are CLIFF ROBERTSON's bullet-headed cowpoke SHAME, scene-chewing SHELLY WINTERS as MA BARKER, VINCENT PRICE's brainy, pun-spouting EGGHEAD and OTTO PREMINGER's eyebrow-raising turn as MR. FREEZE (which ups the kitsch ante on GEORGE SANDERS' first season appearance and puts ELI WALLACH's later take on ice). Obviously played less close to the vest this time around, the cliffhanger traps are far more elaborate (making their escapes all the more incredulous), celebrities pop out of windows during every Bat-climb, and CHAD & JEREMY have their singing voices ""stolen"" and held for ransom by CATWOMAN.

It was all I could do to plow through the mere hundred or so pages of large print, double-spaced prose...something I can't say about the half dozen other ANDY GRIFFITH books I've enjoyed over the years. Our beloved Sheriff of Mayberry, one of the small screen's most iconic figures, surely deserves a better tribute than this.

"GLORY DAYS OF ROCK & ROLL/NEW ORLEANS: Funky as hell instrumental group THE METERS notwithstanding, TIME LIFE's double disc collection GLORY DAYS OF ROCK & ROLL: NEW ORLEANS serves up virtually every important artist from the Crescent City's profound late fifties/early sixties hey day.

Helmed by greasy growler/guitarist RICKY MEDLOCKE (who held down the drum chair in an early version of SKYNYRD), the Native American quartet's peak period is well represented by the epic twin guitar shoot out HIGHWAY SONG, the ferocious TRAIN TRAIN (with hell bent harp solos from MEDLOCKE's grandpa SHORTY and BROWNSVILLE STATION's CUB KODA) and the incendiary stomper FLY AWAY.

"THE THREE STOOGES-THE OUTLAWS IS COMING!: The final full length THREE STOOGES flick proved a fitting swan song for Hollywood's longest lived comedy team, a wacky Wild West treat for kids...not to mention adult fans who cheerfully refused to grow up. Co-starring ADAM WEST in one of his numerous pre-BATMAN gigs (which included NESTLE'S QUIK ads and the sci-fi outing ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS), the rather thin plot concerns the eradication of the American buffalo by unscrupulous gunslingers, which naturally takes a back seat to the messy, time honored antics of MOE, LARRY and CURLY JOE. LAUGH-IN star HENRY GIBSON puts in a memorable appearance as a hipster Indian, while a posse of children's TV hosts (the same ones who used to run the trio's old comedies on local stations) portray legendary outlaws from JESSE JAMES to BILLY THE KID.

"VAN MORRISON-PAY THE DEVIL: Throughout the decades, a number of pop stars, from JERRY LEE LEWIS to B. J.

Of course, like RAY CHARLES, whose groundbreaking MODERN SOUNDS IN COUNTRY AND WESTERN MUSIC made inroads in the sixties, VAN MORRISON is no ordinary ""pop star""...not with an output saturated in jazz, RNB and Celtic soul, to name but three genres. PAY THE DEVIL finds the Belfast Cowboy confidently tackling WEBB PIERCE's honky tonk standard THERE STANDS THE GLASS, HANK WILLIAMS' immortal weeper YOUR CHEATIN' HEART and RODNEY CROWELL's more recent TIL I GAIN CONTROL AGAIN, punctuating each with his reedy, impeccable set of world weary pipes.

"When local factory owner Henry Kaufman hits the Kopp sisters’ buggy with his car, middle sister Constance sends him a bill for the damages. When her note goes unanswered, Constance visits Kaufman’s factory, and he doesn’t take kindly to her appearance.  Soon the Kopp’s home is being deluged with threatening letters, rocks thrown through windows, and the disturbing sounds of strange men driving by late at night. Oldest sister Norma is furious and wishes Constance would drop the complaint so that Kaufman will leave them alone; youngest sister Fleurette is excited by the drama after being raised by her paranoid mother and spinster siblings.  Their brother, who lives in town with his wife, worries that his sisters can’t manage the farm on their own and wants them to live with him, but the three women are determined to hold onto their independence.  When the police seem disinclined or unable to end their harassment, Constance decides to take the investigation into her own hands and find a way to prevent Kaufman from disrupting others’ lives as he has done to her family.GIRL WAITS WITH GUN  is based on a real family, whose true story Amy Stewart stumbled across while researching a previous book.  The real Constance Kopp became one of the country’s first female deputies.  Records of her life are scanty at best, but Stewart tried to stay as accurate to the historical record as she could.  When nothing was said, she stepped in as storyteller to fill in the gaps.  In doing so, Stewart creates three unforgettable, strong women united by blood and by a family secret that drove them to their reclusive lives for fifteen years.Each sister has a distinctive personality that complements the other two.  Norma inherited their mother’s paranoid tendencies, and likes to live a life that is predictable and orderly.  Baby sister Fleurette, a vivacious and pretty teenager, loves to sing and dance and dress in the latest fashion.  Fleurette shines with youth and a cleverness that surprises those who dismiss her as a silly kid.  Constance is practical and has trouble overlooking injustice. Her headstrong determination to collect Kaufman’s debt – largely because the sisters can’t afford to repair the buggy otherwise – triggers a series of events that forces the sisters out of their seclusion and back into the world.  Together, the sisters are just so much fun, and their interactions are always the best scenes in the book.If only Constance’s crime-fighting career was as compelling as her domestic life.  Her promotion to deputy doesn’t happen until the final page of the book, and her amateur attempts at sleuthing move glacially.  There’s very little excitement to be had, even when Kaufman comes roaring by with his gangs shooting guns from their car doors.  The middle section of the book moved at an especially slow pace.  There was a lot of great stuff buried in the repetitious passages of attacks on Kopp property and Constance trying to convince the police to act against Kaufman.  The secret that haunts the Kopp sisters is unveiled through flashbacks and small clues, and when it all ties together the payoff is fantastic.  But other plot threads don’t add to the overall story; Constance spends a lot of time hunting down a kidnapped child for a former factory worker, but the only impact the quest has on the main plot is to reveal that Kaufman is a bad man – a fact already abundantly clear.There’s a lot to like here – I’d read another Kopp sisters novel – but the pacing problem does keep me from loving GIRL WAITS WITH GUN unreservedly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DQQGJJR6E9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R26DQQGJJR6E9W","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A slave working in the Roman mines, Nic spends his days beneath the earth performing backbreaking labor.  Were it not for his sister, he would have nothing.  When a great treasure trove belonging to Julius Caesar is discovered underground, Nic is summoned to retrieve a special relic – a bulla, or charm, that once belonged to Caesar and is rumored to grant power to its bearer - for a powerful Roman general.  Nic succeeds in retrieving the bulla, but he must face a great monster to escape. In the struggle, he is marked by the gods and gains great magic.  His new powers and possession of the bulla makes Nic the target of every powerful man in Rome, and they all want him dead.  Unable to control his magic and hounded by senators, soldiers, and the Emperor himself, Nic must find his sister and stop General Radulf from taking Rome for himself.If you were disappointed when Rick Riordan’s The Heroes of Olympus series ended, Mark of the Thief is a great new series for you.  It uses a combination of real historical figures, Roman mythology, and engaging characters to bring the adventure to life.As a slave, Nic knows little of life in the city of Rome, but events soon bring him to the great city. His wonder and thrill of discovery as he enters the city walls quickly spreads to the reader, and as he gapes at the buildings and the crowds, you feel like you’re walking right next to him.  Rome has never seemed grander.  But Nic also witnesses the harsh side of the Empire, whether it’s the hard life of the slave or the quiet suffering of the impoverished.At Nic’s side for much of the story is a girl named Aurelia.  She’s not a slave like Nic, but her family abandoned her when she was a baby so she has struggled to make her way in the world.  Brash, bold, and tough as nails, Aurelia is never a damsel in distress.  Although the love-hate relationship between the two of them borders on cliché at times, their banter is entertaining and it’s great to see a strong female character striding with the hero.The fantasy elements of the story are very well-handled, too.  Not everyone can wield magic. In this world, magic is a gift and curse granted by the mercurial gods.  The deities never appear in the story, but knowledge of their spheres of influence is helpful in understanding why Nic can one minute rattle the earth and make the ground shake beneath his feet, and at other times the same emotions or gestures yield no results.It is a dark story that might frighten younger readers. It’s not scary, per se, but it is quite grim.  Children fighting in combat with gladiators and wild animals and innocent peoples’ homes destroyed for no reason other than to demonstrate the villain’s power. Nic is frequently beaten and his injuries are described graphically.  The book is recommended for readers ten to fourteen, but parents will be the best judges of whether their children are mature enough for the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWXC4ECP9EQ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054556154X#wasThisHelpful","RWXC4ECP9EQ7W","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Welcome to Tabula Ra$a, a futuristic city in the heart of the desert built as a pleasure-filled den of sin for the exceptionally wealthy. The most powerful man in town is Arthur Livingston, who built his empire through cunning investment and shady backdoor dealings. When he is killed, a race breaks out to locate his heir, the only one who can unlock Livingston’s hidden vault and reveal the future of his company. The one who inherits all is Zoey Ashe, a girl who grew up in a trailer park and wants nothing to do with her absentee deadbeat dad or his legacy. Zoey is thrust from the poverty line to the hedonistic mansion of her father with only a smelly cat for companionship, but all the protection Livingston’s money can buy might not be enough to protect her from those who want to kill her for fame, fortune, or reasons far more sinister.Not only is Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits a great title for a book, it’s a fantastic story. Zoey’s fish-outta-water story absolutely addictive. Initially overwhelmed by the pace and unbelievable wealth of Tabula Rasa, Zoey wants nothing more than to return to her trailer park and her life as a barista. It is only when she realizes that going home is a sure way to guarantee the death of her mother that she decides to remain ensconced in her father’s wealth. Initially overwhelmed, Zoey proves to be a chip off the ol’ block, as unorthodox in her management style as her father was. Snarky and funny, generous and compassionate, still somewhat innocent but surprisingly clever and observant, Zoey is a joy to read.Extremely fast-paced and full of explosive energy, the book has the urgency and intensity of a super-realistic video game. Sex and violence are mingled in a hyper-gory experience that definitely isn’t for everyone. But if you can stomach the carnage, it’s good.As a critique of modern culture, FVFS punches hard at social media and our increasing reliance on it. Everyone in this world seems addicted to Blink, a Youtube/Twitch sort of hybrid on which everyone vies to get the most viewers. When a disaster strikes, people flood the scene – not to assist folks in need but to get the best footage so they will gain the most followers to their stream. The misbehavior of Internet trolling has been taken to a terrible extreme in which serial killers murder their victims on camera for hordes of fans. Sociopaths who might go on a shooting spree in a school today can now augment their bodies with technology giving them god-like powers, so the death of hundreds can buy them notoriety and fame. It’s a dark, scary world in Tabula Rasa.Did I mention that the book is funny? I don’t think I have, but it is one of the most biting and entertaining novels I have read all year. David Wong, the alias of [...] editor Jason Pargin, has created a science fiction thriller that’s impossible to put down – and this is coming from someone who normally doesn’t read much in that genre. I loved this book and can’t wait to check out his previous novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GPQDMF83G92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040191#wasThisHelpful","R8GPQDMF83G92","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

An afternoon in the local outdoors equipment store quickly erodes Bryson's illusions about the trail, but he decides to continue with the project anyway.  When spring comes, he hits the trail with his rotund buddy Stephen Katz.  After a rough start, the two men find their rhythm on the trail, bonding over the trials of the hiking and the stupidity of the men and women they encounter along the way.The movie adaptation of this book, starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte, was released at the beginning of September.  I haven't seen it, but knowing that it was coming provided the impetus to finally pick up a copy of A Walk in the Woods and start reading.  Part humorous romp through the woods, part critique of handling of American's natural preserves and a plea for better oversight, Bill Bryson's travelogue was impossible to put down.  His biting descriptions of fellow hikers are hilarious.  An episode in which he and Katz were joined for several days by an annoying woman who constantly chattered at them and asserted her authority on any topic under the sun.  When she finally falls behind them on the trail, they feel relieved – and then guilty, because she's a single woman hiking alone.  The next day, they run into another hiker who informs them that not only is she doing just fine, she's claiming that she left them because they hiked too slow and were holding her back.But it's not just mocking humanity that makes the book so gripping.  Bryson's descriptions of the trail are hypnotic, and he laces history, botany, and trivia into the story as he stolidly marches along.  When he notes the destruction of the grassy balds unique to the southern Appalachians, it is easy to be swept up in his sorrow and outrage.A recurring theme in the book that always made me smile was Bryson's obsession with bears.  He constantly brings them up, whether recalling a particularly gruesome story about a bear attack or trembling in fear because he's certain he hears one lumbering through the trees outside his tent.  Bears are something you learn to live with when you grow up visiting national parks like Yosemite on a regular basis, but Bryson's fascination is quite common amongst infrequent and new hikers.  Bears are amazing creatures and the appreciation he lavishes on them is well-deserved.Does Bryson's narrative inspire me to go out and embark on a similar adventure?  Yes and no.  I find myself longing to go on a season-long hike, but the Appalachian Trail didn't sound quite right for me.  (Too long, for starters – no way I'd come close to finishing.)  But if the opportunity ever came where I could take some time off of work and hike the John Muir or Pacific Crest trails, I'd go and do it in a heartbeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6NFTV8Z3WM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307279464#wasThisHelpful","R2G6NFTV8Z3WM6","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katie has decided to stay in Japan so that she and Tomo can be together.  Her presence stirs up Tomo's powers, making it harder for him to control the ink.  He resolves to stop drawing so that he can protect her, but the ink finds other ways to manifest and it becomes clear that they need help.  Desperate, Katie turns to Jun, another kami who claims he just wants to help them control Tomo's abilities.  Katie keeps their meetings secret from Tomo as she and Jun figure out why the ink reacts so strongly to her and a new possible origin for Tomo's powers.  As Tomo grows more dangerous, Katie's growing attraction Jun makes her wonder if she's chosen the wrong kami to love.  As romantic rivals try to win the hearts of Katie, Tomo, and Jun, the conflicts between the yakuza and the kami threaten to break out again.There's not much to add to my review of the first book, Ink.  Katie's decision to stay in Japan is frankly selfish, since she puts herself and others in danger by spending time with Tomo and inciting his ink-powers to erupt.  She self-justifies that she's going to help him and that together, they'll control the ink – but she has absolutely nothing to base this on and ignores all the evidence that she's making Tomo's problems worse.  For this reason, I didn't care for her, but throw in her gift for stirring up drama and overfondness for secrets and I found her completely unlikable.  She's a terrible heroine and I can't root for her.The story also suffers from that middle-book disorder in which the second book in a trilogy doesn't really advance the plot but instead manufactures small problems and dumps information rapidly to prepare the reader for the final volume.  Katie's life revolves around spending time with Tomo (often with one or both of them winding up injured in the process), running off to meet secretly with Jun, and study sessions so she doesn't flunk out of school.  This is repeated over and over, with the only difference seeming to be whether she gets told off by the rival for Tomo's heart or Jun's on a particular day.When Katie's new theory about the kami's history is revealed, it's a well-considered and thoughtful twist that made me feel a flicker of pride for her.  She quickly wasted it with another foolish decision made with her heart instead of her head, but at least she's learning.Still, I wish that more time could have been given to developing the other characters in the story.  Yuki and Tanaka, Katie's friends from the first book, barely make an appearance, which is a pity because their humor and warmth is often needed.  Shiori and Ikeda aren't given any personality or purpose beyond romantic rival, unfortunate when both girls have the potential to be more interesting.  I hope they'll get more page time in the next book Storm (The Paper Gods).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZAG4FL35Y2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211112#wasThisHelpful","R2ZAG4FL35Y2L","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Victorian London, Devil Wix dreams of one day owning a theater in which he can star.  When he discovers the talented Carlo Bonomi, a dwarf whose skill with magic and illusion is unparalleled, he sets in motion a daring plan to catapult himself to success and fame.  At his side is the lovely Eliza, an independent young woman working as an artist's model.  The passion between Devil and Eliza crackles, but the clever young woman always puts the business first.  With the aid of an exceptionally gifted sculptor and an engineer obsessed with automata, their theater troupe should be unstoppable.  But death stalks the dark streets that surround their theater, and vengeful rivals and ghosts from Devil's troubled past threaten to derail their best efforts.I wanted to like this book – who can resist the rich atmosphere of Victorian London, especially with the added mystique of magicians?  But ""The Illusionists"" suffers from an uneven pacing that proves increasingly frustrating as the book chugs on.  The story has such a mishmash of themes. It wants to be a murder mystery (but the clues are telegraphed so blatantly that there's no mystery at all) and a bodice-ripping romance novel, a tale of a self-made man defeating his demons and a plucky young woman surviving incredible odds in a patriarchal society.  For long stretches of the narrative, not much happens in the way of plot.  Even jumping the novel ahead by weeks or months does little to help these slower segments.  Then, the story will suddenly kickstart a new plot thread or theme that briefly revives the book until the plot thread once again grows sluggish or is outright abandoned.""The Illusionists"" reaches its climax and a suitable end point...and just keeps going for another hundred pages or so.  I can't help but wish an editor had judiciously intervened and cut down this extraneous content.  It would have done much to tighten the story and preserve the tension.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IUGV1Q923UX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468310984#wasThisHelpful","R6IUGV1Q923UX","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the exception of the occasional ""shopvac"" I've only ever used the traditional up-right style vacuum cleaner -- so when the UltraFlex showed up, I was a little confused and maybe disappointed. This cleaner is segmented into the vacuum engine, and a hose with extensions and various cleaner nozzles. The idea of having to drag around a ""second"" component of the cleaner was discouraging, but my opinion almost instantly changed afeter I started using it.When I first turned on the Electrolux with the brush-roll nozzle attached, it almost leaped out of my hands. That sounds bad, but I loved it -- the separated design makes the hose and nozzle extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver. It's easier to get under tables and around furniture, and I like being able to feel the brush-roll massaging my carpet while the machine sucks dirt off the floor.Dragging around the sepearate suction unit is a little annoying, as the entire unit doesn't always move with you, but the hose and cord are both long enough to make it realtively easy. It didn't take me long to adjust to the cleaning style.In addition to the long hose, the handheld section extends to three different lengths, and it was easy for me to find a comfortable setting that accommodated my height.At first, I was worried that the dust storage container would be too small. It is smaller than my other vacuum, but as long as I empty it at the end of each cleaning session, it's fine. Disconnecting the container from the body of the machine is easy, but sometimes dust gets trapped in the pathway and can fall out during removal, which is a bit annoying. Emptying the container is very easy -- there's a latch that drops the bottom of the box out and allows the contents to fall directly into the trash can. If you empty it partially into the can, it can minimize the amount of dust that floats out. It's a good design, and instantly gives you feedback as to how much dirt was lifted out of the carpets and other floors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WV401PIXAJP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105TXVRE#wasThisHelpful","R2WV401PIXAJP6","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two women separated by two centuries are connected by one house: the Reading Room Cottage.  In the present day, Rachel struggles with postpartum depression and loss following the death of her mother.  She arrives at Reading Room Cottage intent on clearing out her mother’s belongings, but she finds the task overwhelming.  She is distracted by a constant low vibration in the air and by a woman glanced out of the corner of her eye that vanishes when she turns to face her.  In alternating chapters, a historical story slowly unfolds.  When a mysterious lodger, Robert Moore, moves into her family’s home, nineteen year old Elizabeth is forced out of her room.  But she soon appreciates his presence, for he begins leaving books from his library out for her to borrow.  As her mental horizons expand, her world constricts as pressure mounts for her to marry a local farmer’s son and her employer orders her to spy on Moore, whom he suspects to be a political agitator.  As Rachel searches for the identity of the ghost that haunts the Reading Room Cottage, Elizabeth is torn between her duty to her family and the wonderful new life she discovers in conversations with Moore.Rachel strives to hide her mental illness, chanting the mantra ""Be normal be normal be normal"" over and over as she walks through the village or visits the neighbors.  She misses and resents her husband, who is often impatient and distant when they talk on the phone. She often wants to give up on everything, but her love for her daughter and her curiosity about the house give her a focal point to keep fighting.  It’s a depiction of depression that is very visceral and relatable.By contrast, Elizabeth’s problems are against external forces.  Her mother, father, and sister conspire to see her matched with a local boy, but marriage is the last thing Elizabeth wants.  Her best friend Agnes becomes a mother and the child her world; Elizabeth hates to think that something similar might happen to her.  Her journey of learning under the guidance of Robert Moore and his “reading room” is very engrossing.  I know a character is well-developed when two-thirds of the way through the novel, I have to stop and Google the character’s name to see if he was, in fact, a real person.  (If I had waited ‘til the end, I would have seen Jo Baker’s historical note confirming that Robert Moore is, indeed, a product of her imagination, although based on a couple of real men from the Chartist movement.)  He, Elizabeth, and the other characters in the 19th century half of the book are far more realized and lively than in the modern day narrative.The two characters are written to have very distinct voices.  Elizabeth speaks with a simple clarity.  She observes the movement of nature and the rhythms of village life in a way that draws readers into her world.  Rachel’s mental distraction creates a much sketchier version of the town that focuses on small details but never quite captures the whole.While not a traditional ghost story, ""The Telling"" is such a rich book.  I really enjoyed getting to know Elizabeth and Rachel, and I never stopped rooting for them to overcome their difficulties.  The ultimate connection between the women felt a bit forced, but I enjoyed the stories and didn’t really mind that their two narratives never really came together in a complete, cohesive way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTBNWGLRK3SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417265X#wasThisHelpful","R3NTBNWGLRK3SL","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the death of her mother, Katie Greene is sent to live with her aunt in Shizuoka, Japan.  Halfway across the world from everything she knows and loves, Katie struggles to learn the language and make friends in her new home.  One day, she witnesses the school’s bad boy Tomohiro breaking up with his girlfriend, and stumbles across his secret: Tomo creates drawings that move on the paper.  Are the drawings alive? Katie and Tomo become friends, and the friendship quickly escalates into something more.  But danger follows Tomo everywhere: his drawings come to life and he can’t always control them, the yakuza want to recruit him, and a secret organization is searching for talented people like him.  But no matter how much Tomo tries to push Katie away, she’s determined to stay by his side.Amanda Sun has set up a very interesting premise with this book.  Tomo is able to draw on the power of the kami, the powerful beings that once controlled Japan and are remembered by most Japanese as the spirits that embody nature.  For each person, the kami’s magic manifests differently, and Tomo’s ability to create life through his art can be extremely formidable if channeled properly.  Something about Katie magnifies Tomo’s ability, but when he uses it his character transforms, as if his true self is erased due to possession by the otherworldly kami.When I was in junior high or high school, I would have loved this book.  I was at the height of my anime obsession, and the combination of supernatural powers, Japanese life, and teenage romance would have had me captivated.  But I’m not fifteen anymore, and it’s hard to overlook some of the glaring flaws in the story.The biggest problem is the heroine, Katie Greene.  She has very little personality – her only distinguishing characteristics are mourning her mother and an initial aversion to Japanese culture – and throughout the story she makes foolish, impulsive decisions.  She is constantly crying and irrationally jumping to conclusions.  She flings herself into the relationship with Tomo, allowing it to consume her until she’s nothing but a satellite revolving around him.  By the end of the book, she’s willing to forsake everything and everyone she knows for him.  It’s hard to read her obsession as anything but a coping mechanism for the loss she feels over her mother’s death.The dialogue is peppered throughout with random Japanese phrases, and the context is not always apparent from the surrounding text.  True, there is a glossary at the back for readers to reference, but it still interrupts the momentum every time I have to stop to check a word’s meaning.  But again, while this annoys me as an adult I think my fangirl teenage self would have LOVED this, because if I look at diaries from that time that’s how I was writing.So while this isn’t an outstanding novel, I think that for a certain segment of the young adult market the book series will be hugely successful.  If you’re an anime or manga fan who wants a story set in Japan that has romance, magical powers, and a dark, brooding hero with a sensitive, artistic side I think you will love this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF974X2JNBQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037321071X#wasThisHelpful","RF974X2JNBQ3","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the age of twenty-five, Josh Sundquist – Paralympic ski racer, cancer survivor, vlogger and motivational speaker – was still single.  His longest relationship had lasted less than a day.  Why?  Josh decides to approach the problem scientifically by contacting his former girlfriends and romantic interests to uncover where he went wrong.  By gathering data, testing hypotheses, interviewing former flames, and charting everything Josh is certain he’ll unlock the secret to finding a girl.  Along the way he revisits his extremely conservative upbringing, social awkwardness as he transitioned from home school to public school, and the uneven whirl of his encounters with the opposite sex.  It’s funny and heartfelt, bringing hope to any who worry they’ll never find “the one”.It would be so easy for Josh to blame his disability for the reason he can’t get any dates.  When he was nine, he lost his left leg to cancer.  But having only one limb barely slows him down.  Josh throws himself into life with gusto, and he isn’t afraid to laugh at himself as he looks back on his teen years.  Whether it’s an embarrassing date at a mini-golf course or a harsh rejection on the dance floor, Josh doesn’t hold back from sharing every humiliating detail.  His accounts become even more interesting when he tracks down each girl and interviews her.  In many cases, the girls don’t even remember the events that Josh found so horrible.  Each interview helps him to move on and eventually isolate the true problem that has doomed relationship after relationship.  It’s all told in a very engaging, self-deprecating style that makes it easy to laugh with Josh about funny moments from the past.The format of each chapter is really cute.  Josh begins with the background, describing his life around the time of his infatuation with each girl.  He introduces her, why he liked her, and what he knew about her.  These stories are often accompanied by graphs or charts illustrating key points.  After reaching the inevitable failure, he presents his hypothesis for why the friendship didn’t blossom into romance. He then embarks on an investigation, contacting the girl in the present and finding out what she remembers.  These conversations are often awkward and a little strange – because who wouldn’t find it a bit odd that some guy from ten years ago wants to know why he was rejected? – but hidden in these women’s recollections are clues to Josh’s problem, and as he journeys the path to self-awareness the reader is right there with him.This is a fantastic book for teenagers or young adults who find themselves frustrated by dating and worry that they’ll never find someone compatible.  It’s a reminder that you are not alone, that others are just as confused as you.  It’s also hilarious, and adult readers will surely feel nostalgic for their younger selves’ own attempts to find happiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVWFI5BRCL0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031625102X#wasThisHelpful","R2KVWFI5BRCL0Y","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always a bit nervous about cleansing oils; a good one does an effective job of gently removing makeup, but poor quality oils will clog up the pores.  Neutrogena is generally a pretty reliable company, so I was happy to try their latest facial cleanser.The oil is applied to dry skin, and foams up slightly when you start splashing water on to rinse, but it definitely doesn't have a strong ""suds"" factor.  Fine by me!  I don't need lots of lather to feel clean.  What the cleanser DOES have is a very strong odor.  The best comparison I can think of is the medicinal-sweet smell that cherry cough medicine has.  Somewhat fruity and somewhat astringent, the fragrance isn't very pleasant, but it fades quickly and doesn't linger on the skin after washing.The oil was able to remove makeup somewhat efficiently.  Foundation, blush and eyeshadow all washed away very easily, but lipstick and mascara proved a bit more stubborn.  Still, the oil was gentle and didn't cause my sensitive skin to flare up, and that's always a major consideration for me.  It's not the best cleanser I've ever used, but for a low price point item it isn't half-bad.  I'd use it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDYKVJOQL8XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQZC4#wasThisHelpful","R2MDYKVJOQL8XU","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time, a small village became isolated at the top of a mountain. The residents lost their hearing, and the frequent avalanches and blocked roads prevented them from leaving.  In exchange for the precious metals the villagers mine from the heart of the mountain, food and supplies are sent up a cable from the kingdom of Beiguo, far below.  But now blindness spreads through the village, and the miners can no longer meet the quota set by the linekeeper.  As the deliveries shrink, a young woman named Fei fears for her village.  One night, she is awakened from a nightmare and realizes that her hearing has been restored.  Though she struggles to cope with the strange new sensations of sound, Fei knows that this gift may help her achieve what no one has attempted in living memory: descending the mountain to find help for her people.Fei won’t make this journey alone; she’ll be accompanied by Li Wei.  Once, they were sweethearts; but when Fei was offered the chance to work as an artist, recording the history of the village instead of toiling in the mines, she took it.  Her choice meant a marriage between herself and Li Wei would be forbidden, but long-buried feelings are awakened during the arduous journey down the mountain.A grand adventure and two hearts sharing an unbreakable bond – this is the stuff great tales are made of, and Fei’s story lives up to expectations.  From the first page, as she helps her sister chronicle the history of the village, Fei’s compassionate and protective nature is revealed.  It’s clear her life is privileged, as the village goes; artists don’t suffer the brutal labor of working the mines, and as the most talented painter in her generation she’s guaranteed the best of everything the village can offer.  It would be so easy for her to turn a blind eye to problems, but she doesn’t.  Instead, Fei takes on the burden of the village, and by drawing strength from her loved ones she finds courage and strength to do the impossible.  It’s impossible not to admire and believe in her.Fei couldn’t even begin her journey without Li Wei.  He is passionate and strong, a young revolutionary in the making.  The strength of his conviction that change must come to the village breaks through Fei’s reluctance to move against the status quo.  His physical strength combined with her new hearing is the only reason they survive the struggle down the mountain’s cliffs.  It’s a great partnership.  Their sacrifice becomes all the more admirable because it would be so easy for the two heroes to abandon the village and stay in Beiguo, where they are free to marry and be together.My favorite moments weren’t the romance, though.  Instead, I appreciated the little moments as Fei experiences sound for the first time.  I can’t imagine what it would be like to suddenly gain a new sense, a foreign new way of interacting with the world around me.  With Fei, I think Mead does a good job of describing what that process would be like.  Fei’s initial shock at sound, her inability to articulate the experience to others, and the way the new stimuli overwhelm her all felt extremely realistic.  I also found the idea of an entire village of deaf people intriguing, and enjoyed how they communicated without speaking.Throughout the book, the existence of a race of magical creatures called pixius is mentioned as an old folktale.  In a classic deus ex machine, they appear at the end of the book to help save the day.  There were short descriptions of the legendary creatures but there’s was no other indication of otherworldliness in the story.  No magic, no other mythical beasts.  I guess that’s not entirely true – Fei’s experienced unusual, possibly prophetic dreams throughout the book – but the pixius presence is still so sudden and strange that it’s jarring.But no matter.  I still loved this book.  Soundless has just the right balance of adventure and romance, realism and fantasy.  Once I started the book, I just couldn’t put it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CI6I85CQ0J3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147632#wasThisHelpful","R1CI6I85CQ0J3Q","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The heart pendent weighs practically nothing - it's so thin that I fear it will be easy to damage, as the slightest pressure bends the metal - but it has just enough heft to ensure the necklace always hangs straight.

"I'm always hesitant to go all-in with Bluetooth -- I've had bad experiences with the wireless technology degrading sound, disconnecting generally working poorly. I also have an abnormally large head... so when I was given the chance to try Pansonic's RT-BTD5 bluetooth headphones, I was cautious. ""They probably won't work,"" I told myself ""and if they do, they certainly won't fit."" I'm pretty happy to say I was wrong on both counts.The instant I pulled the BTD5s on my head, I started to change my tune -- most headphones squeeze my head too tight, but the Panasonic set extended to a comfortable but firm fit. They are lightweight enough that I can wear them for long periods of time without fatigue, and the soft padding on the speakers don't irritate my earlobes. Physically, I had almost no problem with these headphones -- although they do have a tendency to tangle and snag in my long hair if I wear them on my neck for too long.I'm no audiophile, but as far as sound goes, these seem fine. Most of my music came through clear and undistorted. I imagine they're fine for most average listeners, but I also know that they don't put out a very deep bass. Nothing I listed to on them sounded particularly bad, but I've heard better on dedicated wired headphones of a similar price-point. They're more than adequate for my purposes, but true audiophiles can find better sounding headphones for their $75 than these. These sound fine, but are far from hi-fi amazing.As bluetooth headphones, the RP-BTD5 certainly gets the job done -- holding down the power button produces a short beep, indicating that they are ready to pair. Most of the time, it automatically reconnects to the phone I first paired it to without any trouble, though it sometimes has difficulty reconnecting if I leave a song on pause too long, causing it disconnect via time-out.I'm a little disappointed by the controls on the headset's side -- they do a fine job of controlling music playback, but there doesn't seem to be a way to use it to toggle voice control. Not a deal breaker, but a bit of a disappointment compared to wired headsets I've owned in the past. Speaking of which, the microphone quality isn't great -- in a pinch I've used these to take a call, but most of the time the other party had trouble hearing me and I wound up switching to my cellphone's regular speakers.The battery life, however, is great. I used these headphones for over three weeks without bothering to recharge them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPG40JJE649MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMVLUNK#wasThisHelpful","RPG40JJE649MZ","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I'm a woman.  I wanted a pack of men's shirts so I could chop them up and use them for various t-shirt experiements.  That said...These shirts are good, basic t-shirts.  The fabric is a bit thin, but I've owned many white shirts that were even easier to see through so this didn't bother me at all.  It doesn't deter me from wearing the shirts out in public, although if I was a man I might be more sensitive to transparency issues and might feel like these could only be worn under another shirt.  But compared to women's clothes?  Bah humbug.  Most of our fashion frocks are made of even thinner material!What I did find rather strange was the length of these shirts...they're really long.  On me, we're talking tunic length!  I thought maybe it was because I'm a woman of only average height, but I compared them to my husband's Large undershirts and they were still longer.  I guess this is good if you tuck your shirts in - the extra length will keep the shirts from popping out of your pants every time you raise your arms above your head.  Or if you've got a bit of a pot belly maybe it helps keep that puppy covered.No tags is nice, and I appreciate that the seams aren't scratchy.  They're basic features that all t-shirts should have, but some manufacturers still cling to tags (itchy, annoying) or sew crooked seams that irritate sensitive skin.  So good job on avoiding that, Fruit of the Loom!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXZJJ7A8JQNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTVAR2U#wasThisHelpful","R2EXZJJ7A8JQNA","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this product 4-5 times each week for nearly a month, but saw absolutely no difference in the appearance of my skin.  It was a big time commitment - almost half an hour each time I used it - so I expected to at least see some small change, but there's no visual difference.  Perhaps if I had more defined lines and wrinkles, there'd be something to see, but as of right now I'm inclined to think the product is a scam (or else my unit is defective).","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQF767CW6RQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077R67CE#wasThisHelpful","R2GQF767CW6RQZ","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Supervillain Lord Ballister Blackheart reluctantly accepts Nimona, an impulsive teen with a talent for shapeshifting, as his sidekick after she sneaks into the lab at the heart of his evil lair and begs for a chance to join him.  Blackheart seeks to bring down the Institution of Law Enforcement and Heroics, but the organization is defended by his archnemesis, Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin.  They two have been locked in an evenly matched battle for years, but Nimona quickly upsets that balance.  Suddenly, Blackheart’s goal is achievable, but he is disturbed by his sidekick’s ruthlessness.  As the dark sides of the Institution and Nimona’s abilities are revealed, the line between hero and villain is blurred.When we first got it into the bookstore, my boss shelved it with other children’s books.  Neither of us looked at it very closely.  It was over a month before I got around to actually reading the book – at which point I quickly realized that it’s definitely not for kids.  (Characters named Goldenloin and Ballister?  I’m surprised we didn’t get a parental complaint!)  It’s definitely for a teenage audience – and for that audience, it’s a fantastic, energetic mashup of science fiction and fantasy.  Nimona has action, adventure, drama, humor, heartache, and great characters.Let’s start with the title character, Nimona.  When she first pops up, she’s a hyperactive burst of youth and vigor, helping Lord Ballister break free of the routine into which he’s settled.  But as pages turn, chinks appear in her bubbly armor, revealing something sinister and amoral.  Her true self shifts as freely as her outer appearance, making her impossible to pin down.  Thanks to Nimona’s meddling, Lord Ballister is finding a way to be the hero he always longed to be, but his sidekick may be a greater danger than the Institution he swore to eliminate?  Meanwhile, golden boy Ambrosius – literally, he wears golden armor and his perfect mane of blond locks is never out of place – grows disturbed as he is asked to perform increasingly drastic tasks to protect the Institution’s secrets.  This friendships and rivalries between these three form the heart of the story, as each member of the trio moves from hero to villain to something in-between.The art’s great, too.  Stevenson’s panels are bright and clean, conveying the story at a rapid Saturday morning cartoon pace.  The characters all have distinctive appearances.  I loved the way Nimona’s punkish shaved head reflecting her anarchic nature, and that grizzled Blackheart and handsome Goldenloin matched the fantasy-world tropes of golden hero and dark villain so perfectly.  You knew what each character was like the moment he or she appeared.  The only weird thing?  I was occasionally distracted by the characters’ impossibly tiny hands.Originally a webcomic, the print version of Nimona includes revised art, a new epilogue not found online, concept sketches, and other bonus material.  It’s one of the best comics I’ve read this year (so far) and I can’t wait to get it back in stock at the store – although this time, I’ll make sure we stick Nimona in the young adult or adult graphic novel section.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8MFG2PRKJBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062278231#wasThisHelpful","R2W8MFG2PRKJBY","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even the Happiest Place on Earth is not immune to death.  Tragic accidents happen due to mechanical failure, visitor negligence, and just plain bad luck.  Keaton Moll leads readers through Disney resorts, pointing out the tragic deaths that have occurred on rides, in hotels, and in isolated corners of Disney property.  He also reports on the restless spirits that haunt attractions and can be spotted by cast members or guests.  When it comes to the deaths, Moll sticks to the truth: every story has verified against newspaper accounts, and rumors have not been included.  However, when it comes to the supernatural, all reported incidents are hearsay.  Moll includes the stories as he has heard them, neither doctored to be scarier or edited to seem less ridiculous.If you've ever wondered about the body count in Disneyland – and after sixty years, it's truly a wonder that there haven't been *more* accidents – then this book will answer your questions.  It describes the gruesome details of the Big Thunder Railroad's derailment, a Samoan gang fight, and the drownings in the Rivers of America.  Sometimes the park is at fault due to poor maintenance or the error of a cast member, but far more frequently the guest is at fault.  It doesn't make the deaths any less tragic for their family, but it is reassuring to know that if you follow the safety precautions the odds of coming to harm are very, very small.These death reports are succinct and to the point, detailed without being exploitative.  It's a very macabre history of the Disney parks, but it's still a part of the Disney legacy worth exploring.Of less interest to me were the ghost stories.  Sure, some of them are fun campfire tales, but a lot of them are just too silly to believed.  For example, there's a story of a fat ghost who lurks at the back of an attraction in California Adventure.  He's rarely seen except for a shadow on the wall, but he's known to “lurk” over the shoulders of guests, change the movements of the animatronics, and even alter the weather in this section of the park.  Puh-leeze!  I want a ghost story that makes me shiver, not giggle.One interesting effect of the book is what it reveals about the reader.  When my husband reads the book, he'll make a small gasp or a sad “Aww” sound whenever he reads about a child's death.  When I read the same stories earlier, I didn't react audibly but read in a detached, clinical way.  We've always known that of the two of us, he's got far more empathy for other people, but it was interesting to see this play out as we were reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3741YD9ZGR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941500129#wasThisHelpful","R3S3741YD9ZGR0","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"China Miéville is a name that has loomed large at the corner of my awareness; an author that I *must* read, *must* investigate, if I am to consider myself any sort of ""real"" reader.  Yet he's never quite made it to the top of the queue, so I have yet to experience any of his novels.  When I saw this collection of short stories on Vine, I thought it'd be a good chance to try him out.His short stories seem to fall into two categories:1. Brief sketches that describe an idea but don't flesh it out into a full story.  This includes stories (can I call it a story?) like ""The Crawl"", which is basically a second-by-second description of a movie trailer.  This also includes longer stories that are full of rich descriptions, or introduce an intriguing scenario, but don't really develop any characters within the proposed setting - so, in the end, it's especially interesting set dressing and nothing more.2. Fully realized stories.  Two immediately spring to mind: ""In the Slopes"", a story of rival archaeological digs between scientists with very different techniques for preservation, and ""Sacken"", a horror story that's both well-paced and teases with an interesting premise.  There are others, of course, but these ""finished"" tales don't make up the majority of the book's contents.No, most of the stories in the collection feel unpolished and incomplete.  For some, it's intentional: a movie trailer just doesn't feel like a ""proper"" story, and while some readers may embrace the playful experimentation with the short story form, it's definitely not for me.  Other stories start well and just stop.  They don't resolve and don't find resolution; Miéville just stops writing, like he walked away from the keyboard one day and when he returned he didn't feel like picking up the thread again.I see the talent, and appreciate the author's cleverness, but if these fragments are examples of his storytelling style, I fear I'll find his novels too unfinished to appreciate them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2886HOU2ZFTLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110188472X#wasThisHelpful","R2886HOU2ZFTLP","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Scential Health offers pure essential oils and essential oil blends that are crafted in the USA and contain no preservatives or filler ingredients. Today I am looking at their Spikenard essential oil.Spikenard is a new essential oil to me.  It intrigued me because the oil is referred to several times in the Bible, but there is disagreement today on what plant the ancients were referring to.  Some attribute Biblical spikenard to lavender or lemongrass.  This oil is derived from Nardostachys jatamansi, the plant labeled spikenard today.It has a rich, earthy scent with an initial sharpness that pierces into the nostrils and lingers.  (I exaggerate a bit.  Maybe.)  It is something like patchouli mixed with a mint.  But after that sharp top note fades the scent changes to an earthy spiciness more akin to patchouli and cinnamon.Spikenard is supposed to have healing properties, so I have been mixing it with a carrier oil and applying it to some dry patches of skin (psoriasis)  and a couple of scratches I got from a rose bush last week.  The scratches do seem to be healing faster than usual, and while I don't mark a visual difference on the psoriasis the patches don't itch nearly as much  as they usually do.  So I'd definitely consider this a success!The scent is quite strong, and lingers for days on the clothes and sheets that I use.  I don't mind, but it's something you'll definitely want to be aware of if you don't care for the scent or plan to use other essential oils at the same time.I was sent a sample of this oil in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BH4YWDMBU7AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SQ810B6#wasThisHelpful","R2BH4YWDMBU7AJ","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this face mask, a little goes a long way, and with such an enormous pot of product I do mean a LONG, LONG way.  I've been using this to close to a month now and I've only used up about a quarter of the container.The face mask has a fresh, clean scent.  It's definitely of chemical origin, but the fragrance is light and fades pretty quickly.  The mask itself is white and has the consistency of a gel rather than a thick cream or paste.  Once applied, it slowly sinks into the skin instead of hardening or congealing into a solid, peel-of substance.  This means this mask is ideal for lazy people like me, who don't want to be bothered with washing off a mask ever night before bed.During the first week of use, I didn't notice much of a difference. I began to wonder if the mask was just a pleasant distraction from a real skincare regime.  I mean, rubbing the mask on each nice is refreshing and soothing because the gel is always cool to the touch, but was that all it was?  However, as the second week progressed I began to detect a subtle change.  My skin was becoming softer and more luminous.  As I continued to use the mask it became smoother and healthier-looking.  True, there are a couple of dry patches that remain stubbornly rough, but the mask has done wonders for my ""normal"" skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYI682G196TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD650W#wasThisHelpful","R2FYI682G196TS","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband loves curry, so I make it for him frequently.  But I usually use various premixed sauces or Japanese box curries; to spice things up (ha!) and change up the flavors a bit, I decided to try this Maggi Green Curry Paste.The curry paste is very easy to use - just scoop out a spoonful or two, mix it with coconut milk, and simmer the liquid fora few minutes. Then add the meat, vegetables, etc.  The curry flavor has a bit of heat due to the jalapenos, but it the lemongrass that I found really dominated the paste.  It wasn't bad-tasting, just very different from the yellow curry I usually get.I noticed that other reviewers are commenting on the saltiness of the product, so here's my two cents: I didn't notice any exceptional saltiness to the curry, BUT I also never added salt at any point in the cooking process.  I assumed that the curry blend would already contain all the flavoring agents I needed, and without extra salt it tasted great so I have to believe my instinct was right.Since you only need a couple of spoonfuls each time you cook, a little curry paste goes a long way.  I have no idea how people finish this entire tub before the paste expires!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJ3WBWWPM7P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6EGFG#wasThisHelpful","R1XJ3WBWWPM7P5","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the series, but I haven't read the previous volume and I had no trouble picking up the story and running with the characters.Eddie Red has a picture perfect memory; if he sees something once, he’ll remember it in every detail later.  But Eddie’s talent is extra useful because he’s also a talented artist, and he can reproduce what he has seen for other people.  This combination of skills has led him to become a crime-solving sleuth who has already helped the NYPD crack a case.  While vacationing in Mexico, Eddie is given a chance to sleuth again when his father is accused of stealing an ancient mask.  Teaming up with his best friend Jonah and a clever local girl, the three kids rush to solve the mystery before Eddie’s father is thrown in jail.This is a fun book for kids in the upper middle grades.  It’s pretty fast-paced as Eddie and Jonah rush all over San Pablo del Nino hunting for clues and suspects – a bit unbelievable to an adult (what kind of parents let their kids roam free in Mexico?) but a child will have no trouble getting sucked in.  Facts about the Aztecs, Maya, and art history are slipped in so naturally that kids will end up learning a thing or two without even trying.A huge bonus to the book is the inclusion of Eddie’s sketches, provided by the talented pencils of Marcos Calo.  They’re detailed and crisp, and kids will enjoy poring over them as they try to solve the mystery before the book’s heroes do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9LRIQNLZTVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544302060#wasThisHelpful","R3G9LRIQNLZTVF","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Callanish lives in isolation as a gracekeeper, one who lays the dead to rest.  When someone dies at sea – and in her post-apocalyptic world that Callanish lives in, nearly all the world is covered in water – the gracekeeper performs the ceremonies of the dead and maintains the watery graves.  She is teased by the memory of a long-ago circus, one that starred a dancing bear that went rogue and killed its trainers. Across the sea, the daughter of the bear-dancers continues to perform in the circus.  Called North, she lives with a nautical troupe of circus performers and travels from one island to the next, dancing with her bear to the delight of island-dwelling landlockers.  She is betrothed to the ringmaster’s son, although neither young person is in love.  She is desperate to escape the marriage before the secret North guards so carefully is revealed.  When tragedy brings Callanish and North face to face, a connection is formed between the two young women that will eventually lead them both to freedom.The world is split into two classes: the landlockers, who live on the island archipelagos, and the damplings, who live on boats with no permanent home.  Ostentatiously, the landlockers are better off than those at sea, but their power is largely symbolic.  Both groups suffer from want and lack, recycling even the smallest scraps because there is very little manufacturing and even if new things were available, no one could afford them.North and her fellow circus performers are unwelcome on land, tolerated only for the entertainment they bring with each performance.  The ringmaster’s dream is to own a piece of land large enough for a small house for his son, a fact known to all in the circus. The ringmaster’s pregnant wife, however, believes he means the son in her belly and not his adult son Ainsel.  When she realizes her mistake, all her anger and frustration turns on Ainsel’s betrothed, North, and the disharmony threatens to tear the small circus apart.The drama and excitement of the traveling circus contrasts sharply with the quiet, ascetic life of Callanish.  Callanish spends her days caring for the birds that play an important role in her ceremonies, and conducting her ceremonial gracekeeper duties.  She’s basically a nun. Days can pass without seeing a soul. In exile because she failed her mother, Callanish writes endless letters that she cannot bear to send.Each character in the book wrestles with some form of loneliness.  But something about the two main characters held me back; although I could clearly sense the connection between the two of them, that link did not extend out to me, the reader.  I always felt distant and held somewhat at length from them.Logan has a lovely writing style, gentle and soothing like the rise and fall of waves.  When great events happen, her words speed up, whipping the reader like a storm, but always returning to that calming rhythm.  It gives the story a mythic quality even before people blessed – or cursed – with selkie-like qualities recall old Scottish folklore.  It also suits the world of the circus, enhancing the illusion and make-believe and mystery.But it is very, very slow.  Too slow, at times, so that my attention would wander and I’d start thinking about what I should cook for dinner or whether I’d remembered to buy stamps at the grocery store.  So it’s a lovely story, but not an engrossing one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37C0T2XUQC8VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446614#wasThisHelpful","R37C0T2XUQC8VP","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered a pair of these earrings in white gold so that the metal would match my wedding ring.The earrings were very well packaged.  They came in a red velvet box, which is further protected by a white cardboard box.  So each pair should arrive in perfect condition.When I first opened the box I was stunned by the earrings.  They are so much prettier in person than the pictures led me to believe!  Each stone dangles about an inch from the hook earring on a slim silver chain that is actually a solid piece, so the earring won't get tangled into a knot or lost in your hair.  The decorative rings are a separate piece that can be removed, but I love how it drapes over the stone like coils of rope.Charms could easily be added to the earrings if you want to diversify the look, but it's pretty cool looking already.  But if you do decide to customize the earrings, they're very lightweight so a charm or two won't overwhelm your ears.The cubic zirconia gems are great for catching light, and they're SUPER sparkly.

So each pair should arrive in perfect condition.When I first opened the box I was pleased by the quality of the earrings. The stud is very solidly attached to a bar of metal that crosses the back of the earring, so light is still able to go through the large stone for maximum sparkle potential.

"I ordered a pair of these earrings in 18K yellow gold.  The gold was nice and bright and offset the white gems very well.  The clover shape combined with the colors reminded me of medieval and Byzantine jewelry.  It has a very classic, historic quality.The earrings were very well packaged.  They came in a black velvet box, which is further protected by a white cardboard box.  So each pair should arrive in perfect condition.The studs are pretty lightweight, and I because of the flat design I had very few problems with my hair getting caught or snagged throughout the day.

"In the months before his death, Walt Disney unveiled his plans for an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (called EPCOT for short), a centrally planned city that utilized the latest technological innovations to create a new kind of urban center.  Developing a city may seem far-fetched for a man best known for his innovations in animation, but author Sam Gennawey traces Disney’s interest in urban planning and designing public spaces from its roots in his backyard steam train and the design of his Burbank Studio all the way through to Disneyland and beyond.  Along the way, the reader is introduced to failed projects, like a proposed ski resort, as well as the successes.  Walt Disney died before his proposed city could be built, but Gennawey extrapolates what may have in Florida today had Disney’s plan been carried out as he envisioned it.I found this book to be absolutely fascinating and eye-opening.  As a frequent visitor to Disneyland, I’m very familiar with Main Street USA, the “land” at the entrance to the park.  It has an old-timey, classic appeal and as you walk down the street, toward the Sleeping Beauty Castle, it’s a comforting and calming experience.  Sam Gennawey explains many of the architectural tricks and cues that help create this experience for guests, and as I read I found a new appreciation for the care and attention to detail that Disney and his Imagineers devoted to the appearance and layout of the buildings.  As Gennawey continued to other areas of the park, I mentally followed in his footsteps.  He also talks about some of the innovations Disney brought to his theme park, like the dedication to preventing litter and maintaining the appearance of the buildings, and how his ideas spread to other parks and eventually became standard practice.I also loved reading about lesser-known Disney projects.  We’re all familiar with the phenomenal success of Disneyland, but I’ve only heard of his proposed Mineral King project in footnotes or asides.  It was a proposed ski resort, to be located near Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  I hesitate to call it “Disneyland in the mountains” but in many ways that’s exactly what was planned.  The resort was to be an entertainment destination, with wilderness lectures, outdoor activities, restaurants, a conference center, and planned ‘attractions’ similar to the ones at Disneyland.  The project was eventually shut down by the United States Forest Service after protests and a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club.  As a Disney fan, I’m so curious about what Mineral King would have been like, but as a Sierra Club member I’m also horrified at the thought of the impact of the described resort on the environment just outside one of the most beautiful parks in California.  It would have been interesting, but I’m glad the decision was made not to go with the Disney proposal.Of course, most of the book is devoted to EPCOT.  I really enjoyed Sam Gennawey’s projection of what EPCOT would look like if it had been completed; it’s a great thought exercise that showcases Disney’s creativity and his forward-thinking. I certainly enjoy the EPCOT theme park and what it offers today, but neither it nor the Disney city of Celebration really encapsulates Disney’s vision.  Anyone who has enjoyed walking around Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom, admiring the architecture and the themed lands, will learn a lot from this book.  Those who are curious about the urban planning and want to explore a centrally-planned city will also find it difficult to put this book down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VSSLTD1HQGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941500269#wasThisHelpful","R17VSSLTD1HQGO","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All her life, sixteen-year-old Gwen has believed that her cousin Charlotte is destined for greatness, while she is fated to live an ordinary life.  That’s how their family raised them.  As the inheritor of the time travel gene, Charlotte has been trained since birth so that she can pass undetected through the past.  But when a dizzy spell sends Gwen jumping through time, a secret society for time travelers scrambles to prepare her for her role as the Ruby.  Her reluctant assistant is the mysterious Gideon, a young man who spent his entire childhood preparing alongside Charlotte.  The more Gwen learns about her abilities and her fellow time travelers, the more questions she has about the secret society and the decisions made in the past.Ruby Red is a German young adult series, translated by Anthea Bell into English.  It’s a fun adventure romp that neatly manages many YA tropes: an ordinary girl who discovers she’s actually super-special, a brooding hero whose initial dislike of the heroine turns to love by the end of the first volume, fancy dresses, and a gal pal to giggle and gossip with.  The time travel and the secret society are explained very thoroughly and help to distinguish the story from other YA novels.Gwen is a fun narrator because she’s such a believable teenager.  She is a bit flighty and not terribly bright, and she’s quick to fall into a new crush.  Her ordinariness contrasts sharply with the destiny assigned her, and her attempts to adapt to her new life are entertaining because she is often so giggling and cavalier about it.  She’s a bit silly, but the story needs that humor because everyone else tends to be so serious.Although the fact that she can see ghosts and has underdeveloped psychic powers…well, I’m curious to see where that’s going.One of the things I don’t like about the book is that it really doesn’t stand on its own.  Most of the book seems devoted to setting the stage for a big, grand adventure, but that never comes.  Gwen has a couple of exploratory trips into the past, but certain scenes from the beginning of the book hint at something huge that never comes.  When the book ends on a cliffhanger, it’s a little frustrating because nothing much has happened yet.  But irritated as I am by this fact, I also want to hurry up and find the next volume of the series so I find out what happens next, so perhaps Gier picked a winning strategy by cutting things off before the going got good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DN3NO4ODB7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312551517#wasThisHelpful","R37DN3NO4ODB7E","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Seymour may not be the greatest beauty of Henry VIII's glittering court, but she and her long-time sweetheart Will hope to wed.  But as setback after another pushes their wedding date  away, Jane begins to despair of becoming his wife.  Her loyalty shifts to her mistress, Catherine of Aragon, whom she serves with great devotion.  As the king's attention shifts from his wife to the temptress Anne Boleyn, Jane's family rises in power as her brother Ned seeks a solution to nullifying the marriage between Catherine and Henry.  By the time Catherine is deposed and Anne Boleyn has been set upon the throne, Jane is resigned to her role as spinster.  But when she least expects it, Jane at last finds love where she never intended.This is my first time reading a Carolly Erickson book.  Although several of her biographies came heavily recommended to me, it is this novel that I start with, and it has so turned me off this author that I don't know if I'll ever pick up another one of her books.  When an author uses real historical figures and places in their books, I expect the story to follow historical events to some degree.  Now, I'm no expert on the life of Henry VIII and his queens but this novel consistently ignores the most basic facts of Tudor England.Some of these breaches are more egregious than others.  One of the most guffaw-inducing are multiple references to the “Maiden's  Bower”, a sort of secret harem kept hidden in Henry VIII's castles to service the king's every sexual whims.  WHAT.  I've never seen a mention of such a thing in any history of the king's court, because Henry VIII never needed it.  In addition to his infamous collection of wives, Henry VIII also had several mistresses over the years.  For the most part they were daughters of his nobles, and there was always an element of romance to the affair.  He didn't have a posse of prostitutes waiting in the wings – if he had, there'd be a lot more royal bastards running around.Another inconsistency is that Jane Seymour's brother Thomas completely vanishes from the story, a disappointing decision given how pivotal he is to later English history.  Her brother Edward is given a fair amount of attention, and both his first wife and himself figuring prominently in Jane's life, but Thomas doesn't even rank a bedside appearance at his father's deathbed.  Curiously, Edward's second wife Anne Stanhope never appears either, despite there being evidence that she and Jane Seymour were close.At one point, a sweating sickness sweeps through London, killing many.  Anne Boleyn is one of those struck by the disease.  This is fact.  In an attempt to heighten the drama, Erickson has Boleyn fall ill while in seclusion with Catherine of Aragon and nearly tossed out the window to her death by a guard to prevent the spread of the disease.  The aging queen intervenes, sparing Anne's life and personally caring for her in her illness.  It's total romantic twaddle to show Catherine at her best and Anne at her worst, and feels forced in the worst possible way.Many of the characters' personalities seemed inconsistent with what we know of them.  Anne Boleyn was known to be haughty and unpleasant, true; but here she's little more than a spoiled brat, stomping her way from one tantrum to the next.  Catherine is so saintly it's nearly sickening.  Jane Seymour, our witness to events, has a thrilling sexual affair with a working class man that lasts for months, yet somehow passes as a virgin to the coterie of midwives to inspect her body.  Despite the title of the book, there's never any evidence that Jane is a favored queen when she takes the throne; Henry VIII doesn't treat her any better than his previous wives. Most disappointing to me, the author didn't include an afterward where she explained her deviations from the historical record.  As long as the author explains their changes, I'm usually able to live with fictionalized accounts of history.  (This is why I remain a Philippa Gregory fan even though I know her novels take great liberties indeed.)  All Erickson does is throw a sentence or two at the end describing her book as a “historical entertainment” and a “reimagining of the past”.  Perhaps this especially rankles because Erickson has written non-fiction works and describes herself as a historian.  Surely she didn't need to sensationalize her stories to make them exciting; there's enough drama in the surviving records without inventing new things out of nowhere.I give the book two stars because Erickson is an entertaining writer, and her narrative flows smoothly enough.  But if the reader is unfamiliar with the Tudor period, he or she will end up with some very strange and inaccurate ideas about Henry VIII's wives and the English court at that time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UBNYQMGT0V8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WJ06MW#wasThisHelpful","R1UBNYQMGT0V8T","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a classic fairy tale from China that I've encountered many times in children's books and folklore compilations. Marilee Heyer's version is pretty consistent with the others; I don't see any ""modernizing"" or attempts to re-spin the story. The illustrations by Heyer are absolutely stunning. It's a beautiful realistic style that focuses on small details. As she describes the suffering of the widow as she weaves her magical tapestry, the image focuses in on her hands hard at work as blood drips down uponthem. When the main hero receives a gift of shoes, she focuses in on the magical boots, not on him or the giver. It helps draw the reader in and emphasizes what he or she should focus on. Her human figures are well-designed, too. Each of the three brothers has a distinct face that reveals something of his personality, and the aged mother still has traces of the beauty that must have made her stunning in her youth. The Chinese fairy is ethereal and beautiful, seeming to float in the image but looking real enough to match the other characters. It makes the story all the more believable to young readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULZYOT08OXO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140505288#wasThisHelpful","RULZYOT08OXO9","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always liked using glass teaware so that I can watch my tea leaves unfurl as they brew, but it's devilishly hard to use glass teapots or cups when you're on the go!  The Dechunxian tea tumbler solves this problem by encasing a narrow glass cup in a black outer casing that both protects the glass and helps insulate fingers from the hot surface.  With a metal infuser to prevent the leaves from reaching your mouth and a screw on top to secure the beverage for travel, it's very effective.I was a little nervous when I first received the tumbler because there were no English instructions provided.  On a little paper insert found with the product's packaging, Chinese instructions were provided.  Curiously, the titles of each section of the instruction manual had been translated as ""Features"", ""Tips"" and so on - but the actual content blocks remained in Chinese.  So I had to guess on the best way to use the tumbler, and since I'm not sure of the care instructions I've been sure to only wash it by hand, and not in the dishwasher.Still, use is pretty straightforward.  Tea leaves go in the glass.  Hot water follows.  Insert the metal infuser, which snaps into place at the top of the bottle.  Wait a few minutes and voila - the tea is ready!I love the sleek and modern design of the tumbler - it looks great sitting on my desk next to my laptop.  I've also tried holding the tumbler upside down and shaking it, and no leaking drops of tea splattered onto my clothes.  I'm very confident in the security of this thing.  I know that if I drop the tumbler and it lands wrong, the glass will crack and that's the end of it.  But I think that with care, this will last just as long as any other glass should.I received a sample of this tea infuser in exchange for an honest review.PS - If you're looking for some great loose tea to use with this product, I recommend Adagio Teas!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBDXUW5FBHT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGMC5UE#wasThisHelpful","R2BBDXUW5FBHT3","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After the death of his grandfather, sixteen-year-old Jacob is devastated.  He convinces his parents to let him travel to the remote island off the coast of Wales where his grandfather lived after he was orphaned as a child.  Jacob hopes it will bring him closure, but he's also haunted by stories his grandfather told him about his childhood, tales of children with special powers and sinister monsters.  At the center of all the mysteries is Miss Peregrine, and Jacob is determined to track her down so that he can understand his grandfather's fate.The conceit of this book is interesting: take a collection of vintage found photographs and craft a story around them.  It works really well.  Scattered throughout the novel are reproductions of the images, so as Jacob's grandfather describes his childhood friends and shows his grandson pictures of them, the reader sees them too.  Riggs claims that for the most part, his creepy photos of children haven't been altered (beyond whatever the original photographers might have done) and appear just as he discovered them.The pacing of the story is really, really slow.  The beginning is downright sluggish, even when events should make it exciting.  Eventually, the book finds its momentum, but at that point the reader has had to slog through two-thirds of the story.  I almost quit several times, but I'd heard a lot of praise for this book and its sequel, Hollow City, so I kept hoping things would pick up.  Nope.  Not even magic and time travel could bring energy to the narrative.Jacob is an interesting teenager.  His manner of dealing with grief and loss is very realistic, and the book is his coming of age story.  His growth as a character is worth watching.  Sadly, he's the only character fleshed out enough to have something like a personality.  Most of the `peculiar' children that he meets at Miss Peregrine's orphanage are flat, cardboard cutouts with no nuance or depth to their personalities.  The most intriguing character, Jacob's grandfather, is killed off in the first chapter, but the dribbles of information we're fed about his life make me want to read a book that's all about him.There's some lovely writing describing the beauty of the island and some very atmospheric moments in the orphanage.  I'm happy to praise the book for that.  But in the end, it just couldn't hold my interest for long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21IM6RA5TGC35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746036#wasThisHelpful","R21IM6RA5TGC35","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In May of 2001, twenty-six men attempted to cross the border between Mexico and the United States, passing through a desert in Arizona so desolate and deadly that it’s known as the Devil’s Highway.  On foot and woefully underprepared for the harsh conditions, the men were attempting the illegal crossing to better their lives in America.  Instead, guided by a coyote inexperienced in the area, the men walked in circles until, one by one, they succumbed to dehydration and exhaustion and crumpled to their deaths.  In the end, only a dozen men were saved.Luis Alberto Urrea’s report of events is at times almost clinical, but it’s absolutely haunting.  He profiles each man to the best of his ability – some of the men were never identified – and briefly explains why he was making the trip.  Some men were seasoned workers who had been to the United States before; others were young teens, leaving their home village for the first time.  One boy went to help his aging father; later, it is the father left holding his dead son in his arms. Collectively, the twenty-six men are just more cases to add to an ever-rising number of people who die crossing the border.  But with each story, creating personalities and family relationships, they become real people, and the true weight of their deaths can be felt.Urrea is sympathetic to both illegal immigrants and the border patrol tasked with keeping them out.  Again and again, he shows the humane side of the officers, who pay to erect and stock water stations in the desert for migrants to use and rush into the desert when there are reports of dying men.  Excepting a few bad eggs, they aren’t evil men seeking to punish the Mexicans – they’re just doing their jobs.  Blame for the men’s fate falls squarely on the coyotes who led them into the desert without adequate supplies and then, upon realizing he was lost, first refused to turn back and ultimately abandoned his flock to their fates, looking only to save himself.Reading this book is hard.  Graphic descriptions of the way the body breaks down as it is dehydrated and cooked is simply horrific.  Descriptions of the corpses and the pitiful effects they carried as they moved toward a new life in the United States are heartbreaking.  The shocking amount of money the United States and Mexico spend on the bodies of the dead, flying them back to their villages in expensive coffins and with great ceremony, is mind-boggling.  Why can’t some of this money be spent on the men while they’re alive?Of course, the true tragedy is that this incident isn’t an isolated one.  Hundreds of desperate people die each year making the same trek.  Urrea doesn’t offer any solutions, because there is no easy answer, but he forces readers normally isolated from such events to look them full in the face and consider the true human cost of our current border policies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KAIVZESRK3SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316010804#wasThisHelpful","R1KAIVZESRK3SV","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, the earrings look lovely.  The stone is clear and a pretty shade of blue.  However, a closer inspection of the earrings reveal some small flaws.The gemstones themselves have no problem.  The cushion cut blue topaz stones catch the light and sparkle beautifully.  They're a nice size and comfortable to wear.  The white gold setting compliments the topaz beautifully.However, the setting is cheap and the earring hooks are terrible.  When I opened the clasp, I could see a sharp edge on the edge of the hook.  It's clear that a pair of wire cutters were used to cut the hook, and the worker didn't take the time to smooth out the rough edges.  It makes the hook very sharp, and when I tried to put the earrings in my ear was scratched just by brushing up against the hook.  I've never had an earring injure me before!Compared to a classic french hook, these earrings can be difficult to take on and off.  The clasp behind the ear gets in the way.  Once the earrings are on, the heavy clasps detract from the delicacy of the stones and the minimal setting they are placed in.  I wish that the manufacturer had gone a different route, because it is a shame that these blue topaz aren't showcased in a better way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168EVG1JE2JH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQB1L5M#wasThisHelpful","R168EVG1JE2JH9","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Images are usually printed on both sides of the block.  On a few of my blocks, the image transfer didn't work quite right, and bits of the picture are missing. It follows the pattern of the wood grain, which makes me think the texture was a problem.  But out of the 34 blocks, only 2 or 3 are really affected, and it's unlikely that it would impact play.The blocks came packaged in a wooden tray they fit into perfectly, although it might take a bit of Tetris-style shuffling to get them back in.  Unfortunately, there's nothing to hold the figures in the tray, so if a kid knocks it over the blocks will go flying in all directions.  I wish that the manufacturers had provided a lid for the box to prevent this from happening.  But again, the kids will still love it and be able to play with the blocks - a lid would have just made things easier for Mom when playtime is over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCN5BDX1PJPHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085309DM#wasThisHelpful","RCN5BDX1PJPHE","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFIC TO THE ABRIDGED AUDIO CD VERSION OF THE BOOK.Talk about one messed-up woman!I'm a little disappointed in the abridgment of this book. The original book was 560 pages in mass market, so a pretty good size - chopping it down to 2.5 hours means that any background about Pat's childhood was totally cut and the rest of the story has very little detail. I wanted to know if there were any indications that Pat was a troubled child, and what exactly happened with her first marriage. (She has adult children by the time she's in her mid-thirties so there's clearly some sort of story there.) Unfortunately, all that information was cut, and the story more or less starts with Pat meeting her second husband while living with her parents. The crimes are detailed pretty well, and the trial at the end is thorough. It's just disappointing that there's so little information about Pat's early life or her husband's relationship with his ex-wife and his parents, because that would have really helped flesh out the story. It's almost enough to make me want to go find the physical book so that I can (hopefully) fill in some of the details.So if you're interested in this story, don't waste time on the audio CD.  Just go ahead and pick up the physical book.An interesting footnote: in 1999, Pat was released from prison after serving her sentence for the crimes covered in this book. She moved in with her stepfather and his new wife, Pat's aunt, and owned a doll shop. (Creepy!) In 2008, she was arrested and charged once again, this time for acquiring pain pills illegally for unauthorized distribution. Not sure if she ended up in prison again; couldn't find record of it online.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRFDK6343MGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074353767X#wasThisHelpful","R1SRFDK6343MGS","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When eighteen year old Petronella Oortman arrives on the doorstep of her new home in Amsterdam, she's eager to be a loving wife to her new husband, wealthy merchant Johannes Brandt.  To her surprise, the charming lover who courted her has vanished, replaced with a kind but distant man who allows his spinster sister to run the household.  Nella is further shocked when her husband gifts her an extraordinary dollhouse, an exact miniature of their home.  She engages the services of a miniaturist to furnish the cabinet building, but when the artist sends items Nella didn't request the secrets of the Brandt household are slowly revealed.  Unfortunately, Nella isn't the only one who sees what the Brandts desperately seek to hide, and danger awaits them all if she can't decipher the warning sent by the miniaturist.Something about this novel just didn't work for me, but it took me a while to figure out what it was.  The setting is great.  The atmosphere is great.  Burton works magic with her words to bring the bustling streets and delicate work of the miniaturist to life.  I could picture everything perfectly, and I believed in her version of 17th century Amsterdam.  So that wasn't the problem.The miniaturist was a problem.  Throughout the book, Nella is fascinated by this mysterious woman who makes tiny dolls and objects that seem to predict the future.  Nella becomes convinced that the miniaturist is some sort of gifted prophetess.  The plot thread never really pays off.  By the end of the book, it seems as if every housewife in Amsterdam is obsessed with the artist, but so little is known about her that their attention seems unjustified.  The miniaturist remains elusive, and slips away leaving many questions and few answers.  It was unsatisfying.There's a lot of ""oh look what a repressive society Amsterdam was"" crammed into the story.  We have a closeted homosexual, a strong independent woman unable to fulfill her desires to run a business and travel the world, an interracial relationship kept hidden, more backlash about women distinguishing themselves outside the home, a secret lovechild, and more.  It seems hard to believe that so many current social issues could converge in a single 17th century household.  At times, all the secrets and drama gives the book the feel of a soap opera.  Some quick Googling shows that some of the stranger events, like a ban on gingerbread baked in the shape of men, really did happen, but events had to be moved around freely in time to create the boiling stew of Burton's Amsterdam.In the end, I found the book to be merely OK.  While some of the descriptions of food or Amsterdam life were beautiful, the unrelenting drama mixed with characters either too predictable or too mysterious left me struggling to finish the book. People looking for art-themed historical fiction sent in this time period will be much happier with Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring: A Novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLQDMQ1W97DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062306812#wasThisHelpful","RWLQDMQ1W97DQ","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered a pair of white gold stud earrings so that the metal would match my wedding ring. Since I wear a lot of pearl necklaces, I've been looking for a nice pair of earrings that could tie together the necklace with the sparkle of diamonds.  These earrings looked like just the thing!The earrings were very well packaged.  They came in a black velvet box, which is further protected by a white cardboard box.  So each pair should arrive in perfect condition.When I first opened the box I was pleased by the quality of the earrings. Each earring post was firmly attached to the earring, and the post was straight. On a lot of cheaper earrings I purchased, the posts are applied crooked. The backs don't slide around or slip off, so the earrings should stay in place all day.Shell pearls don't have the shine and luster of real pearls, but for inexpensive costume jewelry they work just fine.  The pearls here are the perfect size for stud earrings - not so small that you can't see them, but not so large that they look heavy and overwhelm the surrounding cubic zirconia gemstones.

"Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant living in Washington in the late 1890s, was mired in debt and her family of nine were in danger of losing their home when a mysterious sponsor offered her $10,000 if she and her daughter could walk across the United States, from their home in Eastern Washington to a New York City newspaper office, to prove that women were capable of surviving the trek.  Desperate to earn the prize and save her family’s farm, Estby agrees.  She and her eldest daughter set off on the adventure of a lifetime as the rest of the family stays behind.  However, things go terribly wrong, and Estby is unable to return home to her other children.  As tragedy mounts at home, her children become so resentful that after their mother returns, her great journey is never spoken of again, hushed up for generations.  When chance led Linda Lawrence Hunt to hear of Estby’s extraordinary journey, she threw herself into reconstructing the story of Helga and Clara Estby, the first two women to successfully cross the American continent on foot.Two stories unfold here.  The first is the biography of Helga as wife, mother and adventurer, a tale of a brave woman willing to sacrifice much to get the money her family so desperately needs.  Following the railroad tracks so that they wouldn’t get lost, Helga and Clara could only carry a few supplies and had to work along the way to pay for food and lodging.  As word spread of their attempt, people would buy photographs of the adventurers and leave water by the train tracks to sustain the women.  No one thought that they would succeed in their adventure, especially not in the deadline set by the contest’s sponsor.  Unfortunately, events spiral out of control and Helga and Clara are left stranded in New York City.  It’s heartbreaking that no one is willing to help them get home, not the newspapers who were so keen to publicize their adventure or the sponsor who lured them across the country in the first place.The second story is the tragedy that so many amazing stories like Helga’s slide into history forgotten because one generation refuses to discuss it.  In Helga’s case, the manuscript of her memoirs was destroyed by the children still angry that she abandoned them when she and Clara accepted the challenge.  Her grandchildren were only able to reconstruct fragments of the story.Hunt went to great lengths to reconstruct Helga’s life, but there are still great gaps.  Details are scarce about the day-to-day life on the road, and Helga’s true worries and fears can only be guessed at since she and Clara presented mostly cheerful accounts to the newsmen they spoke with.  At times, Hunt seems to be projecting her ideas of Helga onto the story, casting her as a proto-feminist when the evidence of such leanings is quite thin.  But for the most part, she remains fairly neutral.  While clearly sympathetic to Helga’s choices and the rejection she faced when she returned to the Norwegian-American community, the inhabitants of which greatly disapproved her decision to leave her family, Hunt also takes care to show why her children were so justified in their life-long resentment toward their mother and how events shaped their situation.Hunt’s research was able to unveil more of Helga’s quest, which had been well-publicized in newspapers of the day, but the bare bones reconstruction only leaves the reader wanting more.  It may also spark a curiosity about one’s own family tree and the secrets hidden by past generations.  Although Helga Estby’s accomplishments were quickly forgotten in her own lifetime, they are still worth remembering today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEI7MGG4R5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400079934#wasThisHelpful","RDEI7MGG4R5Z","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like any set of short essays, Ray Waddles' collection in ""Undistorted Gods"" has its hits and its misses.  Each chapter explores some aspect of God as interpreted through Waddles' experiences.  In the best essays, Waddles taps into something universal, a part of the shared experience of humanity that helps reveal the ethereal and holy hidden in every day life.  In the worst, it's glorified naval-gazing.My favorite essay was ""Rhythm of God: Mystery Tour"".  In this piece, Waddles describes the cultural revolution of the 1960s, in which secular culture became the new focal point of American life, replacing church through mediums like rock 'n' roll music.  As part of the essay, he compares the deep emotional impact of music and of Christianity, comparing how each helps a person form a 'soul'.  It was an excellent parallel exploration.But other chapters were very much focused on Waddles' personal experiences, and these just couldn't capture my interest.  I think he meant to illustrate just some of the many ways that spiritual moments can happen, but something was lost in the process of committing the ineffable moment  to paper.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6M70USP7OIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426767161#wasThisHelpful","RJ6M70USP7OIJ","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a bit of trouble getting into this one.  Usually, I'm a big fan of retellings of mythology and fairy tales, so when I was offered Odysseus: The Oath I jumped at the chance to pick it up.  I found the beginning of the book very disjointed as it jumped through Odysseus' childhood, and it made it a little difficult to really feel absorbed into the world of Ancient Greece.The text is easy to read, but at times the dialogue can be very stilted. I don't know if that's a translation issue - the book was originally written in Italian - or just Manfredi's style, but the conversations often didn't flow like natural speech.  But that's OK - there's plenty of adventure and action to keep the story moving through Odysseus' life as he crosses paths with Hercules, Achilles, and his future wife Penelope.The story ends with the Trojan War.  Osysseus' adventures continue in Odysseus: The Return.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW520EFYSDJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468309218#wasThisHelpful","R1BW520EFYSDJG","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love food, but when it comes to cooking I'm a pretty lazy chef so any time I see a cookbook that will help simplify the preparation process, I can't resist it.  The recipes in this book were easy to follow.Some recipes are divided in two: ""To Prep/To Store"" and ""To Finish and Serve"".  I really liked having the recipes broken down like this.  On a day when I have a spare hour, I can do all of the prep work.  The food is then ready in the fridge and in 10-15 minutes I can finish the recipe and serve it to my husband and myself.Other sections had meals designed to be both cooked and served on the same day. Some had fast prep times but slow cooking, like baked potato dishes, while others were recipes that could be prepared relatively quickly (pork tacos in half an hour, anyone?).But the emphasis is on doing lots of prep work when you have the time so that you can finish the meal in a rush.  If the problem you have is lack of time, most of the recipes in here aren't all that quick once you account for the prep time.  It's definitely not a ""30 minute meals"" sort of cookbook.  Even though I'm intrigued by many of the recipes, I still haven't found the time to try them.  However, the dishes I've prepared tasted great so I'm confident that when I finally have the time, I'll enjoy the other recipes, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FSLBNM2E1XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493845#wasThisHelpful","R33FSLBNM2E1XV","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To the French, she spoke to angels, leading their troops to victory over impossible odds.  To the English, she was a witch communing with demons. Few women have captured the public imagination like Joan of Arc.  Countless artists in paintings, books, and movies have explored her life, asking whether she was divinely inspired or schizophrenic, a nave peasant or a calculating warrior.  In each retelling, her legend is embellished and enlarged.  In this latest biography, Kathryn Harrison combines history, folklore, scripture, and scholarly interpretation of Joan’s deeds to create Joan so mythological in scope that her life can be compared to only one other: that of Jesus Christ himself.It’s an unexpected comparison, Joan of Arc and Christ of Nazareth.  The first time Harrison brought it up, I thought she was stretching credulity.  But as the pages went by, and the parallels continued to manifest, I began to agree with her observations.  Whether Joan of Arc intentionally patterned her life after the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ ministry, or her chroniclers structured it that way after her death, or it was all mere coincidence, her narrative mirrors that of Christ in a way most befitting of a Holy Maid.That’s only one aspect of this dense biography.  Kathryn Harrison’s account also weaves together the many fictional Joans that have appeared in the works of Mark Twain, Voltaire, George Bernard Shaw, Robert Bresson, and other artists, revealing what each version said about the time in which she was created. Their fictional words are used to give voice to the thoughts unrecorded by the historic Joan as the book moves through her life.  Yet Harrison also takes care to distinguish the historical facts about Joan, clearly delineating where fiction ends and history takes over to reveal the brave, defiant girl who lived in the 15th century.So it’s a historical biography.  It’s a biography of Joan’s life after death, the evolution of her story through the centuries as it passed through poets and painters and writers.  It’s a critical interpretation of her life and its parallels to Jesus Christ, a spiritual biography of the young woman in communication with angels.  Joan of Arc shines with the powerful faith, courage, confidence, and cleverness that has made her so captivating to so many different audiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O628KWFEANBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531206#wasThisHelpful","R2O628KWFEANBE","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always feel a bit nervous when I use Vitamin C products. I have drier skin and there have been times when Vitamin C serums suck every last drop of moisture out of my skin.  Luckily, I didn't experience any such problems with Oz Natural's Vitamin C Serum.The serum is very thin and watery, which makes it easy to apply.  Just apply a few drops and let them dry - it soaks in very quickly so this step doesn't take long at all.Then proceed on to your usual moisturizer.I didn't notice an immediate change the first day or two, but after about a week my skin was definitely looking brighter.  My pores were much less clogged, too.  (I don't know if that is an effect of using a serum much lighter than my previous one, or the direct result of one of the ingredients in the Oz Naturals formula.)So how long does each bottle last?

"The story of Rapunzel is reinvented in Bitter Greens, interwoven with the story of Charlotte-Rose de la Force, the French woman responsible for recording the version of the fairy tale known around the world today.  As Charlotte-Rose stews in a convent where she was banished by the King of France, one of the nuns entertains her by sharing a story about a powerful sorceress in Venice who imprisoned young women in a tower so that she could draw their life force and attain eternal youth. Charlotte-Rose also muses over her lost life at the French court, her failed romances and constant struggle to afford the lavish lifestyle required to keep up with her fellow courtiers.  As the two parallel stories unfold, the common threads of desire, love, and black magic bind them together.Half of this book is brilliant.  This is one of the best reinventions of a fairy tale that I’ve read in a long time. I love Forsyth’s conception of the witch and how she integrated the character into 16th century Venetian society.  Rapunzel – called Margherita – is sold to the witch by her parents and trapped in a doorless tower.  Her imprisonment is very realistic and her struggle to make her food stores and other supplies last between visits from the witch really drive home the character’s desperate situation.  A gristly discovery in the bottom of the tower further reveals the witch’s obsession with youth and the great lengths she will go to keep it.I love the Rapunzel story.The part that doesn’t work as effectively is the life of Charlotte-Rose de la Force.  While the author of “Persinette”, forerunner of “Rapunzel”, was surely an interesting woman, the frequent detours into her life seem disruptive and tend to really slow down the pace.  Each time she appears, we’re introduced to a new cast of historical figures, and keeping track of the rapidly expanding cast can be challenging after an extended detour into the secondary Rapunzel plot.  Charlotte-Rose’s life also has the chaotic habit of jumping around in time, further adding to the confusion.Still, it’s an enjoyable novel – one of the best I’ve read this year, in fact.  I would definitely recommend it for the revision of the Rapunzel story – if you don’t like historical fiction set in the French court, just skip those chapters completely.  But if you are curious about the life and love affairs of the French poet and authoress Charlotte-Rose de la Force, the way her life is integrated with the work for which she is best known today is a truly lovely accomplishment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLFCN6NA3673/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047536#wasThisHelpful","RCLFCN6NA3673","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a desperately impoverished village, Elena Rudina struggles to feed her sick mother.  Her father is dead; her brothers driven away by poverty and the demands of the Tsar.  With no food and allies in the same pathetic position, Elena has little hope of improving her situation.  Then a train breaks down in town, and Elena catches the attention of Ekaterina - ""Cat"" for short - the wealthy girl being brought by her great aunt to the Tsar's grand ball.  After a sudden accident, the two girls find their roles reversed.  Elena impersonates Cat and settles into a life of luxury while the former princess struggles through the rough life of a Russian peasant child.  Events are thrown into further chaos when Cat stumbles across the lair of Baba Yaga and they discover that one of Russia's great magical beings, the Firebird, has gone missing.  This disaster threatens to unravel Russian and unseat the Tsar if they cannot locate and restore the missing bird, setting in motion a great quest that will either save Russia or destroy the world.Combining The Prince and the Pauper with traditional Russian folklore, Maguire crafts a modernist fairy tale immersed in the weight and beauty of Russia tradition.  This world is one where a house can walk on chicken feet, an enormous dragon sleeps trapped in ice, and matryoshka dolls come to life to dance with toy soldiers.  The trademark lyricism and precision of word choice that hallmarks his writing is in full force, and it suits the fairy tale atmosphere very, very well.  The only nod to modernity is the wise-cracking Baba Yaga, who exists out of sync with time and constantly slips anachronistic slang into her speech.  She's a bit weird and unhinged, but would you want her any other way?  Of course not.The story is narrated by a monk, imprisoned by the Tsar for a crime left unrevealed until near the end of the novel.  He makes little comments and observations to the reader, comparing the lives of Elena and Cat to traditional Russian folklore and his own life experiences.  It honestly doesn't add much flavor or character to the narrative.  No, the monk's asides merely slow the pacing in key scenes in a manner distracting rather than dramatic.If given a choice between reading the novel traditionally on paper or listening to it via audio book, please do yourself a favor and go with the novel.  I read the first few chapters and quite enjoyed them, but when I spotted the audio CDs at the library I decided to check them out so I could listen to the story on the road.  While I'm sure narrator Michael Page will entertain small children with his flamboyant, energetic performance it comes off as too silly and cartoon-like to work for an adult listener.  I ended up going back to the print story because I just couldn't take his strange theatrics.Poor narrator choices aside, it's a decent adventure story.  I enjoyed it far more than Maguire's Wicked series.  The two girls are very realistic, created with the prejudices and attitudes appropriate to their class and then forced to grow beyond their normal boundaries.  Baba Yaga is always entertaining, and her magical world melds so seamlessly in the wild Russian woods with the ""real"" world that you do end up believing, if only for a few minutes, in ice dragons and firebirds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKH6B6SA5E8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763672203#wasThisHelpful","R1BKH6B6SA5E8G","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the summer of 1905, entrepreneur Truman Hunt offered 51 members of the Igorrotes the opportunity of a lifetime: come to the United States and make a fortune teaching Americans about the lifestyle of a primitive tribe from the Philippines.  They agreed, and in a few months the Igorrote group was a headline attraction in Luna Park at Coney Island.  At first, things seemed to go well: the Igorrotes built a village like the one they’d left behind and performed the rituals of their tribe before an appreciative audience.  But as time passed, it became clear that Hunt was exploiting the tribe, refusing to pay their wages and constantly uprooting them as he landed bigger contracts with other theme parks.  After charges of bigamy brought the eye of the law upon him, Hunt split up the tribe and took their show on the road, often housing the Igorrote in appalling conditions.  Fearing an international incident, the US government became determined to track him down, but Hunt proved to be a surprisingly cunning and slippery adversary.The exploitation faced by the Igorrotes would be unthinkable today, and it’s shocking to read just how desperate their situation was.  Not only were they unfamiliar with American manners and faced with the racism of 19th century culture, only one member of the tribe spoke English fluently.  Hunt withheld their wages, claiming he would pay them when they were ready to return to the Philippines – but despite their desperate pleading he refused to arrange return passage for any of them.  If they managed to hide some cash from him – visitors would often gift them with coins or pay them for small handcrafted goods – Hunt was not above beating the Igorrotes until he found their hidden stash of coins.  Without federal intervention, he likely would have worked them to death, or abandoned them when their sideshow ceased to draw in the crowds.Hunt himself seems to have been a classic huckster.  Before he brought the Igorrote over to the United States, he had a great reputation in the Philippines.  Hunt was known to be a benevolent doctor who helped care for the natives.  But once he got them over here, he fed outrageous lies to the newspapers to drum up business for his “savages” and made a mockery of some of the Igorrotes’ customs.  One of the passages that really stuck with me was one describing the Igorrote asking Hunt to please reduce the number of “dog feasts” that they must celebrate, as the frequency of the practice seemed disrespectful of their culture and they wanted to go back to their traditional diet.  He refused because the dog feasts were a huge crowd pleaser.  Worse, Hunt spent his money quickly and lavishly, and was often in debt.  If he had wanted to pay the Igorrotes their wages, he lacked the financial means to do so, even though they were the most popular attraction on Coney Island and making money hand over fist.The story of the Igorrote is largely forgotten today, but this obscure history makes for fascinating reading.  A tale of true crime and cultural exploitation, ""The Lost Tribe of Coney Island"" it was one of the most interesting things I read in 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R175BWAF6TI82S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054426228X#wasThisHelpful","R175BWAF6TI82S","A3CNJR9MD5BFKL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CNJR9MD5BFKL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great quality, and charges as it is supposed to. It does a great job for a desktop charger or one sitting in a convenient place to give you battery an extra boost. The downside to the charger is it does not maintain your battery once it has reached a full charge (meaning that once your device is charged, the charger cuts off.) So if you charge over night your device will have reached a full charge and probably start to discharge by the time you wake up.

"I get oily on my nose and t-zone which has caused the skin to break out and turn red. After using this product for a week I noticed less skin discoloration and it looks healthier and smoother. After applying the product there is no oil on my face for about 6 hours. Then when oil does start to appear it's much less noticeable.

"I have been taking these for a week now. I take two twice a day. I am satisfied with the results so far. The tablets are smaller than average making them easier to swallow. As far as an appetite suppressant they are excellent. I can really see them working. I eat, but less now. I don't think about eating as much. I am not constantly looking for a snack. When I do snack that is all it is, not an event like before. My energy levels have been better. Not speedy, just not that afternoon crash I get sometimes. I have taken a number of prescription diet pills and have to say these are close to the effectiveness of Adipex. If you are looking for a non prescription diet pill give these a try.

"These fit my bed perfectly. I had my bed all made and I was ready to test my new sheets. I actually went to bed early, that's how excited I was to try these. A soft set of sheets, I was so thrilled. So, when I crawled in bed, I felt like a total princess. I have never been more comfortable in my life. I am one of those people who is always cold, but my boyfriend is one that is always hot. These sheets kept him cool and me warm believe it or not. I know, it sounds totally crazy, but it's true. This is my very first 100% bamboo sheet set. I have owned some clothing out of bamboo, but these sheets are just unbelievably pampering. I have been lucky enough in my past to stay at a couple 5 star, top of the line hotels.

"We travel often and pick pockets/credit card skimmers are always a concern of mine. We started using RFID protected money pouches for all our travels after a nightmare trip last year when someone suddenly began making purchases with my boyfriend's credit card information while we were on vacation. The police told us his wallet must have been skimmed by someone on the street who captured the info from the card's magnetic strip, all while it was tucked away in his back pocket. Since then we like to be prepared and always use a pouch like this one with RFID protection built in for peace of mind. I've tried a few different brands of these pouches and this particular bag is quite nice. Its compact yet roomy and has plenty of pockets. I can easily fit my phone, a passport, credit cards, chapstick etc. The belt on this model can be adjusted to fit me comfortably and it easily adjust to fit my boyfriend.

"I like this product because it solves a problem in my home. However, I do have some concerns. This is very easy to install on furniture. Reading the directions you heat the plastic so that you can mold it to the furniture where you need protection. The included screws/pins are inserted into the holes around the plastic and screw into the furniture to hold the protective sheet in place. I had to do several adjustments to make sure this was held securely in place and this is where I ran into a problem. My cat was curious about this when I placed it on the edge of the couch where he likes to scratch. He immediately started chewing on the screws and was able to manipulate them out slightly and I was concerned he would remove it completely and could possible harm himself by swallowing the sharp screw or possibly choking. I removed the screws one at a time and screwed them back in making sure they were all screwed until they were lying flat/flush with the couch. Once I did that my cat could not chew them to get them out.If you have a curious cat/dog/animal watch them carefully when you first install this in your home. It does work as intended and is protecting my furniture well but there were some concerns about safety.I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEY5JNBXZAID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YVCMSW#wasThisHelpful","R2VEY5JNBXZAID","AEX0AXZQWRN3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEX0AXZQWRN3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As I've continued to use this for the past week I've noticed my skin is much more hydrated and the flakiness I had around my nose has disappeared. I use about half a dropper full in the evening after I wash my face and before I use my regular moisturizer. I don't rub it in all the way, I leave it still moist and it dries quickly.

"This stuff is great. It's a thick, creamy consistency that really sticks to your hair in the shower.

"I've been using this water bottle for a few weeks now. I really like that the main bottle is glass. I'm really sensitive to smells and plastic water bottles tend to retain smells after a while so I like that this has no smell or odor. The bottom is covered with a rubber/plastic material that is easy to grip and provides some protection from bumps and short drops to keep the bottle from cracking or breaking. I also like the handle for carrying. What I don't like is the top. It doesn't screw on well. If you screw it too far it just pops off. When opening the top to drink the entire lid will pop off if you're not careful. Once the lid is on it doesn't leak but it's easy to pull the lid off. The mouthpiece is fine but if you're trying to get a big drink of water the other side of the bottle will bump your nose. Overall I like it and will continue to use this but it does take some practice to keep from popping off the lid.

"I spent a summer in the south of France. I picked lavender from the plant and saw dried lavender in every fashion in quaint little markets. I know what lavender smells like and this lotion captures the smell of genuine lavender perfectly. Closing my eyes I'd swear I was back in France. If you're using lavender to help your children sleep you're going to love this. It's moisturizing and has a light formula so it won't feel heavy or greasy on your skin.

"This is a great hoodie. I love the heathered black color and the fabric feels very soft. It's not a lightweight yet not heavy weight, I guess that leaves midweight. The fabric does not have much stretch to it so definitely order up a size or even two if you want it baggy. The sizing seems more inline with juniors/young men's sizing. I like the sleeve length, they're long enough to reach a bit beyond the wrist. The overall length is average, it hits at about hip length. The waist on this tapers in so if you're wide around the middle, again, you'll want to size up at least one size. This would be great for working out but is also stylish enough for casual wear.

"This is awesome. I have a cat and he's a character. He's young and mischievous and very energetic at all times. When I first brought him into my home he made a mess around the litter box. Every time I filled the box with fresh litter he would kick it out of the box making a huge mess to clean up. Now that I've added this around the box I'm not as concerned with litter being everywhere because it's much easier to clean up.

"First, the hat itself is large and even on an adult would be a baggy/loose style. I actually like that so it's not an issue for me, this would also work well for someone with a large head. The material is soft and stretchy and even after wearing a while is still comfortable. Okay, so now on to the technology. There is a speaker on each side of the hat around where your ears are so you can hear the sound fairly well. I like that the sound isn't in my ear like and earbud so I can still hear what's going on around me when I'm out walking. I didn't have any issues getting the bluetooth to sync with my phone so I could listen to my music. The controls aren't overly bulky on the side and blend in well with the style of the hat. I really like that I can leave my phone safely in my pocket or purse without having the earbud strings hanging out making me a target for theft.

I use conditioner and leave in conditioner and creams and lotions but sometimes I need something with a little more oompf. That's where hair masks and treatments come in and this is a very nice one. I like the consistency of this one; it's a cross between jello and a thick cream. It sticks to my hair once applied and I love applying it then adding heat from my hair dryer ( outside of the shower of course). That added heat really makes my hair feel amazingly soft and moisturized. I actually like using this several times per week. There is a scent to this but it doesn't last after it's rinsed out.

These can be sterilized between uses to keep your face clean and improve the appearance. There are different tools for different uses but they're all easy to use. I use some more than others but I use this mostly for black and white heads, especially on and around my nose. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CZ9WB1VURZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEADF4U#wasThisHelpful","R33CZ9WB1VURZW","AEX0AXZQWRN3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEX0AXZQWRN3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this for several weeks. My skin feels amazingly soft and firm throughout the day. I haven't experienced any oiliness in my skin since using this, in fact my skin seems to be less oil. I love how hydrated my face feels and it looks noticeably brighter. There is plenty in the jar to last beyond  a month because it only takes a little to moisturize the entire face. Now, the smell of this is not pleasant. It's not terrible but there is a definite odor to this when you first apply but it disappears shortly thereafter. I would highly recommend this for oily, dry, or combination skin. You will notice a difference after just one use of this. I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FYQRCQMZHOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4ATXUI#wasThisHelpful","R28FYQRCQMZHOL","AEX0AXZQWRN3Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEX0AXZQWRN3Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are the greatest covers for outside patio chairs.  I have 3 of these and from the nip in the air , I got them not a minute too soon.  These are made from heavy duty materials and have a waterproof coating  plus tie downs so you can anchor them to the actual chair.  In my case, this veranda chair cover was so commodious I have been able to put my 4 upright chairs under with plenty of protective covering.  These are so handy because now I don't have to stack and tape down tarps to protect things from the winter to come.They remove in a snap, allowing me to hook them over the back of the chair and put them back on with a minimum of fuss.  Obviously this Veranda chair size can be used for more than one chair  as I have done or just cover one very large chair.  I think these are a good investment as they will last many years and will extend the life of my patio furniture.

"From the first page to the last, this book keeps you turning pages.  I loved it and while I had never read this author before, I will definitely remedy that situation.  It's London and England in 1876, where the city and its social circles are abuzz with the mysterious  disappearance of the German pianist Muller.  Charles Lenox and his detective agency are called in by the police to figure out how the pianist vanished without anyone seeing him leave the Theatre.In the meantime Charles' brother Edmund is despondent over the recent death of his beloved wife Molly. Charles feels that his duty is to be with Edmund so he hands over the job of finding Muller to his partners in the agency and travels down to Markethouse. Strange things are happening in Markethouse however.  Small thefts of chickens, blankets and even a spaniel occur and Charles is off on the hunt.  Suddenly the district insurance agent Hadley sees a shadowy face in his window, finds that his house has been gone through by persons unknown and a strange drawing is chalked on his doorstep.This is a riveting tale that kept me up late on more than one night.

"I have dry skin and I live in a dry climate so washing my face with soap is out.  I've tried various creams and lotions but most are so very messy and to look at my washcloth afterward, you'd think I'd been wallowing in grime. I decided to ditch the washcloth and see if these wipes would be a good alternative.  They certain are preferable when you are traveling and can't haul a wet washcloth everywhere you go.I like these!  After using them my skin doesn't feel tight, something that has happened with other cleaning products.  The price is reasonable and you can flush them away rather than having to wash and rewash.I travel a lot and in many countries wash cloths aren't provided so I find these the perfect solution.  You aren't reintroducing previous grime to your complexion as you do with a washcloth and once you use them, you pitch them.

"I am hooked on this author's works.  They are like being in southern France and are a wonderful window into that world.  The stories revolve around the life and activities of Bruno, the chief and only policeman in the small southern French town of St. Denis.

The last mystery dealt with islamic terrorists while this one begins with the lavish birthday celebration of Bruno's childhood hero, national famous World War 2 flying ace, Marco Desaix.  Thrown into the mix is conflict between animal rights advocate and the local hunters,along with corrupt politicians both national and international.  Add a pinch of international ( read Russian) intrigue and you have a volatile mix guaranteed to keep you turning pages.Martin Walker knows his stuff being a senior member of a private think tank in Washington D.C and an international affairs columnist for UPI.

"Another five-star vote for this grand book about Capt Robert Trimble, a WWII bomber pilot who ""just wanted to fly airplanes,"" and took an assignment perhaps even harder than his bomber duties: retrieving American planes which had landed in Soviet territory, and then rescuing allied POW's from former Nazi-controlled prisons which came under control of the advancing Soviet ""allies.""  Trimble used creativity, hard work, courage, and dedication ""beyond the call of duty."" He risked his life, sanity, and reputation to bring his charges home from the terrors of war (including death threats from the Soviets) and the diplomatic indifference of the US government.  The book also provides a unique perspective into the start of the Cold War, in the very territory where it began as the US and the USSR shifted from informal allies to formal adversaries. Finally, it helps explain why some children of WWII combat veterans may feel their fathers were distant and reluctant to dwell on their past.The book combines excellent story-telling with an emotional flavor which helps us understand what Trimble experienced. The author combined personal interviews with Trimble (his dad), archival research into incidents associated with his dad's career, and editing by Mr Dronfield.  For most of his life, the author thought of his dad as an ordinary (if often indifferent) father. When his dad finally communicated his experiences (which were verified by research), he emerged as a hero with a story worth telling. Trimble suffered from post-event trauma, not only witnessing unspeakable atrocities as a young man, but also feeling guilty he could not rescue even more people than he did. Because of this trauma, his dad nearly committed suicide before the author was even born.  When Trimble finally began talking about his experiences (which were verified by research), his son understood his reticence.The book's remarkable, uplifting epigraph relates how Trimble was recognized for his valor and his humaneness in a way that ordinary medals cannot do, and how he finally opened to his children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2INC9U2L6RW3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9AXVAG#wasThisHelpful","R2INC9U2L6RW3O","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, the proviso: your  experiences may not duplicate ours, or anyone else's, for this or any supplement reviewed on the web. Use precautions about web reviews, individual side effects or unexpected results, etc. and don't expect research to show any supplement is as good as the body's own natural melatonin. That said ...Our two testers were indeed happy with this product -- this worked well  They say you are getting old if a good night's sleep is more appealing than a good night partying, but good sleep is a precious gift!  One of us is a small person and found the full dosage too strong so half a capsule gave a very good night's sleep, with a bit of hangover the next day but far less than with something like Ambien.  It calmed quite a bit so it isn't needed every night.  The ability to fall back asleep once awakened is priceless and this product does this very well.The other tester also had great results, which was unexpected, because he previously found Melatonin made returning to sleep difficult, and B vitamins increased his energy, so he was skeptical.  The first night he experienced incredibly vivid dreams but woke up well-rested with fewer morning aches and pains than normal, and was able to go on an extended hike without feeling tired or energy-depleted.  It was as if sleep became more relaxed and restorative. He said it was fantastic. Over the next few nights, he concluded it does not work like that every single night, and it works best when taken around the start of darkness, with a normal time for sleeping -- in other words, it doesn't seem to pack eight hours worth of sleep into six and won't compensate for too few hours, but that's ""natural.""  It does not seem to have a rebound effect -- when he stopped taking it, or took it for several nights in a row, it didn't make his sleep suffer. He found no ""hangover"" or morning drowsiness IF he gave himself at least seven hours of sleep. Now that he has tried it for a couple of weeks, it seems the effectiveness wears off with time (as does nearly anything with a subjective effect) but the product is worth considering for occasional use and it seems to do no harm.I'll be going overseas soon and will certainly take this with me to help with the effects of jet lag.

"This is certainly the most entertaining theological reading I have done in a long time.  Nadia is funny and profanely profound at the same turn,  her feet are very firmly planted and she is very compassionate while saying that she isn't.  She has certainly been there and done that and her way of looking at Christianity is very appealing to a large number of folks who ""don't do Theology"".  Her honesty about her personal experiences, her weaknesses, and her beliefs come out clearly and resonate with a lot of common sense.  Obviously she is not your run of the mill preacher.I feel that those who are attracted to her probably don't want a lot of dry theology thrown in but should they want more than she has given  through personal experiences it would be nice to give readers somewhere else to turn for comfort and enlightenment.  Does she like C. S. Lewis? Might there be other theologians that readers could turn to, how about suggested readings.  I liked the discussion questions in the back and the conversation with the author but I feel that there should be more here, guidance, direction.All in all an excellent introductory book that will appeal to those beginning their search or those turned off by theology period.

"Elliot Carlson has provided a well-documented, well-written examination describing one of WWII's major unsung heroes, Capt Joe Rochefort, and the war he fought against the Japanese and against Naval bureaucracy. As you can see from the many complimentary academic reviews, compared with the few reviews on Amazon, this is more a scholarly book than one for light reading although it's suitable for amateur historians who want a well-developed book on a focused subject. For example, a serious military officer or WWII buff should find this a wonderful way to spend a few hours!At a ceremony posthumously awarding Capt Rochefort the Distinguished Service Medal (the nation's second highest military honor), President Reagan noted ""If ever there was a battle ... in which victory was attributable to one man, this one was attributable to Joseph J. Rochefort."" The President referred to Rochefort's success leading Allied efforts to decipher Japan's ""unbreakable"" war code, which helped America win one of history's greatest battles, and was similar to the far better-publicized ""breaking"" of the German code by the Bletchley Park team. Rochefort's leadership and persistence saved many lives and altered the War's momentum.Rochefort was an unusual Navy officer:  he was not an Annapolis grad (he was not even a high school grad), he was a cryptographer when most fellow officers considered cryptographers strange or practically useless, he cultivated few influential friends but supported his staff tirelessly, he used an avuncular and supportive leadership rather than the strong-handed model the Navy favored at that time, and he was relatively humble in a world full of egos and strongly held opinions.  Nevertheless, the author makes it seem Rochefort always landed on his feet in a situation that truly mattered (""management of good luck""). As a consequence, he excelled at orchestrating a team of highly disparate cryptographers, mathematicians, linguists, cultural analysts, and ancillary staff with creativity and dedicated common sense. Rochefort commanded Station Hypo, which worked out of a clammy and disguised Pearl Harbor basement as his team painstakingly deciphered major parts of the Japanese strategic code. Hypo never really ""broke"" the code but they peered into it enough to give many priceless pieces of information -- including the Japanese decision to attack Midway Island as their next strategic target. Knowing this allowed the Navy to concentrate its force against an enemy which previously retained the element of surprise with its highly mobile carrier force.Carlson discusses two ""wars"" Rochefort fought. The first, of course, was the Pacific conflict. The second was the war with the Navy bureaucracy. Much of the book details the internal struggles which took so much of the time and effort that Rochefort should have been able to give to the Pacific war.  Of course, some of those struggles involved necessary (and useful) skepticism for Rochefort's conclusions by higher staff, but much was malicious and counterproductive stupidity by competing agencies.  This is among the first books I've read which goes into so much detail about the regrettable jockeying, turf establishment, stress generation, and backstabbing which can take place in a bureaucracy, even one fighting an active war against a common enemy. The bureaucratic battle often goes not to those who are right, but to those willing to put their own posture forward (including being adequately venal to those who prove them wrong), and sometimes, Rochefort was simply not self-serving enough to do this.Aside from minor glitches not worth mentioning, Carlson has done a thoroughly admirable job of gathering information about a shamefully obscure topic, organizing it well, and making it both educational and entertaining.  His book should prove interesting not only to military history aficionados, but to anyone who wants to observe the dark side of bureaucracy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAARJBXLB3U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591141613#wasThisHelpful","R1FAARJBXLB3U6","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a nail biter all my life and have not been able to break the habit.  This stuff really gets my attention so I think it is working well.  I think it does promote nail growth and because it is a nail ""polish""  you can't wash it off as had happened so many times when I try other preparations.  The taste will really get your attention and it lasts quite a while( 3-5 days) between applications.  My nails have a nice shine and hopefully I'll train myself to stop this awful habit.  I painted this on my cuticles as well and am pleased to see them starting to heal.All in all I recommend this.A down side is that if you are eating finger food you will taste it where the food comes in contact with your fingers.

"Another five-star vote for this unusual story from a genre I'm unfamiliar with. An older man returns to a place which transformed his life when he was an unwanted and lonely child, and he becomes overwhelmed with intense memories he thinks he hasn't had in years. He also finds these memories may be inaccurate, after talking with those who were with him. The ocean forms part of his story, but it has little resemblance to the ocean we consider ""normal.""  The story ends well, but it ends as unusually as it began.In short, this is a very strange tale indeed, but it has a certain endearing quality that makes me quite happy I encountered it.

"My regular shaver is too bulky and delicate-looking for extended travel, so I took the HQ40 on a six-week trip. Its performance was surprisingly good -- has a good shave, is quiet, was kind to my face, contains the shaved hairs, cleans easily with a toothbrush and occasional disinfectant, and survived several hard re-packings and jostling without problems.  After six weeks it's on the same set of lithium AA's (you can also use rechargeable AA's).If you are on a budget or have light facial hair, you might consider this as an everyday shaver, although it's a dry shave only.My only qualms are the lack of a travel shut-off switch (I'd suggest packing with the ""on"" switch protected or putting some paper between the battery contacts so the power switch won't accidentally turn on), and the inability to trim sideburns.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYYTFGWOIIBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GJTYF0#wasThisHelpful","R2KYYTFGWOIIBJ","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this generator to provide supplemental power for our outdoor Jazz shows.  We needed more power than we were able to ""borrow"" from our building so this is perfect.  The only negative I have about this product is it's rather hefty price tag but it has so many amenities that I still give it 5 stars. Most generators are too heavy for me to lift, move etc but this one comes with its just like luggage trolley built in.  Look between the front wheels and you pull the handle out and you are set to go.  I tested this to see how much I could load on.  I plugged in a drill (5.4amp), a compressor (10.5 amp), a grinder (9 amps) and a sander (2.4 amps) and with a total of 27.4 amps I was still only at 75% capacity.This is the quietest generator I have ever experienced.  It is also the easiest generator to operate with no having to mix oil and gas although it does want premium grade,(91 Oct) and the fuel tank holds 1 1/2 gallons.  I had no trouble with the pull mechanism which is like a gas lawnmower and the owners manual is very good, unlike most that assume you already know it all.  This also has an auto battery charger with cables, a 220 adaptor and USB port coupled with a digital display showing hours of operation and % of capacity.

"Wheeee, Maisie is back but this is a sadder and perhaps wiser and experienced Maisie than of old.  Since we last heard from Maisie, she has suffered the painful death of James Compton, her new husband and the loss of her unborn baby girl.  She tries to lose herself in traveling but as she sets sail for home, finds that she just can't face the sympathetic faces.  As the ship docks in Gibraltar on the voyage from India, she decides to jump ship.  It is now the year of 1937, the year of the Spanish Civil War, and Gibraltar is right in the thick of things even if it is officially neutral.  The first night of her stay, she discoveres the dead body of photographer Sebastian Babayoff, a Sephardic Jew.  Soon ""old"" Scotland Yard ""friends"" start showing up so she knows that the Comptons, both Sir James and Lady Rowan, have pulled strings to find out where she is and what she is doing.  All her friends in England are concerned but Maisie feels that she must solve this death.  She loses herself in the problem of who killed Sebastian and the why as shown in his photographs.In the midst of her investigation of Sebastian's death she becomes aware of snuggling and gun running activities.... which might have been a part of the death.  The description of events of the Spanish Civil War are good and exciting and ultimately tie in with the solution but  I grew impatient with sad Maisie and flipped over the middle to get to the end.  I missed Billy and his perceptive comments.I gave this a four instead of my usual 5 because I felt that it bogged down in the middle.

"Any review for a book on Israel will inevitably offend someone so I apologize in advance. Given the polarization associated with Israel, it's hard to find much about the country which refrains from emotionalism or polemics, and it's refreshing when one is found. This well-written book is among them, and it's worth examining as a post-1967 history of Israeli national politics, even if it is restricted to politics.The author is obviously pro-Israel, but he develops his arguments with cogency and detachment; it is surely worthwhile to hear his side of the story even if you disagree with him.  He suggests Israel is a deeply diverse (and divided) society which has discovered how to use this diversity as an advantage, that it has genuinely tried to seek peace with security (but perhaps with an intolerable arrogance), and that it has managed to confront terror and anarchy with considerable decency and success (but that it is always on the edge and is always paying a price).  Surprisingly, the book has little insight into how Israelis seem able to maintain their legendary resiliency and spirited optimism despite all the pressures against them, which is too bad since this could have helped us learn something very important.  The book is well-documented and reasonable, even if few primary sources appear in the Bibliography.Prof Stein begins with a brief (and worthwhile) summary of the nineteen years before 1967, and ends by nicely summarizing the goals and status of current Israeli society.  I would estimate about 3/4 of the book discusses Israeli politics at the national level (and Israeli political machinations seem about as unexciting, convoluted, and dysfunctional as politics anywhere else; from the book's descriptions, Israeli political competency cannot explain Israel's survival). Prof Stein does, of course, describe Israeli military events, but generally as an adjunct to politics and without depth (for example, he states during the 1982 Syrian war the Israeli Air Force simply prevailed in a single massive aerial dogfight, when it actually used a notably brilliant and innovative strategy of electronic and drone warfare which is still studied by military tactitians).  The next-to-last chapter contains a summary of social and economic events, but those who want a moderately deep discussion explaining Israeli economic and technological performance, Israel's social resilience, or issues like religion and local politics, will surely be disappointed.I finally rated the book at three stars (still a commendable rating) because I was disappointed in its excessive use of secondary source material, because of inaccuracies, and because I did not think the book strayed far enough from national politics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXNL5KE3Q08I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074564726X#wasThisHelpful","R2TXNL5KE3Q08I","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is never a dull moment in this book. The action is nonstop and the plot is very topical, that of Islamists infiltrating a local large Mosque.  Bruno, an orphan, is the chief of Police, in fact, the only policeman of the tiny French town of St. Denis in the south of France.  The action unfolds as a plot to take out a returning autistic child/man, Sammy.  Sammy knows far too many things about jihadis in Afghanistan and is an expert on explosives.  In light of recent attacks in Paris, London and in Belgium, this should be a must read.I love this series and can hardly wait for the next. For a quiet sleepy southern French town, there is a lot going on. I suggest that you read these in order, as they do build on one another. The food will have you drooling and searching for recipes but the action will keep the pages turning until you reach the end.  I am very pleased to see that Walker has a new book coming out in the fall.January 2015 - After I wrote this review for Children of War in September,  I was surprised to see it had been retitled for US publication as The Children Return.

"This book didn't grab me.  I found the plot rather uneven, sometimes full of twists and turns, other times, just uninteresting.  I felt that the author really stretched it out longer than need be.  The basic plot line is that Aimee, a single mother trying to run her deceased father's detective agency, is confronted by a gypsy boy who tells her that his mother is dying of cancer and needs to talk to her about how her father died.  When Aimee gets to the hospital she finds that the mother has been abducted by wheeling her out of the hospital through the backdoor.  As we follow the plot, it seems that Aimee grasps at a lot of straws before finally getting close to a solution.  She also seemed remarkably naïve for someone in the detective business.  I will say that unless you peek ahead, it is hard to guess the ending.As this is # 15 in this series, you might want to start at the beginning, getting to know Aimee.

"I have a 23 year old large, Panasonic which is 1300 watts but doesn't  fit nearly as well in my microwave slot  as this smaller one.  This oven has a browning unit included and a nice ceramic interior which is a real plus in cleaning.  It is a dark interior which also helps not show splatters.  My previous oven had an off white interior and always looked dirty no matter what.  The Samsung comes with a grilling rack which I tried out with bacon. The rack has tall legs to put what needs to be browned close to the browning element.  I haven't  used real bacon in a long time but this seemed a good test.  It took just a 1.5 min to cook the bacon but 6 minutes to brown it.  I don't know about you but it took all my willpower to not snatch a piece out and eat it then and there.  The browning element is an interesting, and I think, a unique twist that ends pale reheated pizza, anemic bacon, etc.  The oven comes with a browning plate if what you want cooked and browned not work on the grill.  There is also a microwave/browning button to let you just set it and forget it so you don't have to stand there and do it manually .  This is a handy oven.  I wish it had a bit more power and was a bit wider.  My dinner plates just! fit in the oven but I'll need to get a smaller casserole to fit this.  I should also say that the turntable is 11.5"" wide so you don't have much lee way.All in all, I think that this is a good value for the price and the browning element makes this oven stand out from the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLNWO3L6LJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRHIO8#wasThisHelpful","RZLNWO3L6LJ1","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a dicey time of the year to review lawn products as it took 10 days for the snow to melt so I could find my mulch.  I have a front yard that is half wood chips and ""gorilla"" hair, and it is on a slope.  The weed cloth underneath is fairly slick which means that when the wind blows ( often) or the snow melts on it ( 10 days last month) the mulch shifts leaving bare spots.  I would go out once a week and cover the bare spots etc and this gets very old, very fast especially when it is cold out.We got 2 lovely 50 degree days this week, so I thought I would try this product.  There seems to be few directions but the spray works like most lawn products, pump air into it and spray it on from the applicator.  I would have liked some idea of how thick to apply it etc but the bottle contains just  health warnings.  The  fine print said to spray it on and let it cure for 24 to 48 hours to firm it up so since there was plenty in the bottle I started spraying thinly and then went back over the whole area again. My yard is 120 ft by 5 deep and I had half a bottle left after a generous application.  I noticed that after 4 hours of set up time, the surface felt much more solid and the mulch wasn't shifting as we walked on it.  The application process was very straightforward and easy.I will revisit this review in another month to see how it looks after that time but I think that this is a pretty good product to just keep mulch from shifting around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13UFV1QQRWLOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8R71H4#wasThisHelpful","R13UFV1QQRWLOV","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great shaver.  I bought this one after my 10 year-old top-of-the-line foil shaver bit the dust. I had also become tired of hearing its loud buzz so close to my ears, so decided to give this one a try, but wondered if a rotary could approach the foil's closeness.First thing I noticed was, this shaver is SO Q-U-I-E-T. This is worth the price of admission, and much better than the new foils I looked at!  Second thing, even though Philips advises a month to adjust to a new shaver design, this shaves nicely (although probably not as well as a good foil), and it also gets hair along curved areas on the neck much better than the foil (which never did that very well). I am a clinical worker and cannot take a chance of bleeding from a razor, and this item fits the bill. The shaver can charge on a cord or the station, and can be cleaned with warm water. I also thought the cleaning station, although bulky and full of curious buzzes and whirrs, worked quite well for occasional disinfection (although I'd suggest Philips investigate a simple drying cycle for people who just want to use water to clean the shaver). I could not compare it with a modern foil aside from the noise, but it does a good job of shaving, especially when used wet.  I also have a smaller portable Norelco to take to work, and that one shaves so well, I don't think you need all the (expensive) multiple angles and floating heads of the more expensive models, but the disinfection stand is worth considering.If you are new to a rotary I would suggest some of the three or four minute You Tube videos to help you get the most from the shaver, since it does take a slightly different technique than a razor or a foil.Drawbacks? The pouch is too small to carry the charging cord and trimmer along with the shaver, and seems too soft to cushion the delicate-looking heads during heavy travel packing (the shaver will probably go into a tupperware container on long trips). You have to carry a separate trimmer for the sideburns, and replacement heads are not cheap. It looks more delicate than my foil, but that just means you have to be careful. That's about it, and they are minor drawbacks.In short, a nice, quiet, efficient shaver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXK24RINWJ5VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1E5G9S#wasThisHelpful","RXK24RINWJ5VY","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took a while for this plot to get rolling as the author had to bring we new readers up to speed on Joe Sandilands and Joe's possible/potential/on again,off again relationship.  Once the plot got rolling you couldn't put it down.  Joe Sandilands is an Assistant Commissioner of Police for Scotland Yard and is conned/summoned to dance attendance for influential minister, Sir James Truelove, possible future Home Secretary.  Cut to new scene of Lavinia Truelove's( Sir James' wife) mysterious death under the hooves of horse.  Accident or murder...ahhh!  Joe finds himself investigating this death at the behest of the same Minister, James Truelove and is called to Sir James's country estate where the murder took place.  It seems that Sir James wants to clear his name to better his political and matrimonial chances.  In the course of the investigation, a Green Man appears, another murdered woman is revealed and after a while, Joe's love interest, Dorcas Joliffe, appears.  Joe finds himself both the investigator and the investigated in this mess.This is a good book and a real page turner.  Personally I am going back to start at the beginning of the series and am very glad to find a writer whose plot twists you can't guess right off the bat.  Don't miss this, it is well worth your time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2617C5VNISWLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954086#wasThisHelpful","R2617C5VNISWLC","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am the first to admit that my knowledge of computers is not vast but I do know how to dial for help so when the download process never got off step 1, I called the McAfee help line.  I was put through after a number of holds, to a helpful person who then passed me on to a MAC specialist who told me that the problem was not mine but the product and to please  give McAfee 2 days to resolve the issues and call back to reinstall. I called back after 3 days and went through the same deal ending up with Ganesha.  Throughout the process I found that VERY careful listening was necessary as the accents were difficult.  I have now spent a total of 3 +hours on the phone with Technical support and I still do not have the product installed.Technical help was patient and kind but even they seemed to be swatting in the dark for answers.  They acted in good faith and even taking remote control of parts of my computer.  NB:  The help screen that pops up is very useful in telling you how the remote control will be handled, what to expect and how to quit it at any time.

A middle aged book editor with a deadly book on her hands suddenly finds herself going toe to toe with a powerful tycoon big business type and the police in the form of DI Jake Field.  Samatha ""Sam"" Clair, is a boring mundane daily routine  book editor who is handed a bombshell of a tell all book by Kit Lovell.  Suddenly Kit disappears and Sam is the only one taking it seriously.  She begins to investigate and hooks up with DI Jake Field who later becomes more to her than just an officer of the law.  Next thing Sam knows, her apartment is burgled, she is pushed down the stairs and is befriended by a mysterious tenant upstairs in her apartment house.  Her life goes from routinely boring business meetings, competition for the best books to edit into non stop action to save her friend Kit, solve a money laundering scheme etc.  Non stop action delivered in a wise cracking dialogue from a funny smart anything but a detective.  This is a wonderful commentary on the publishing business as well as a good story.

"This is the third in the series and I would recommend that you start at the beginning of the series to keep the characters straight.  Elizabeth I, so far,  has survived all the plots to prevent her assuming the Monarchy but someone wants to have another crack at her chances for being crowned. Elizabeth calls in her favorite investigator and cousin, Brendan Prescott, who has spent 6 years away from his true love,  Kate, a lady in waiting to Elizabeth.  Under the guidance of William Cecil and Lord Walsingham, Brendan foils yet another chance to kill Elizabeth,  who was about to handle a  gift of poisoned gloves.  Before he can get his teeth into the who of this latest attempt, Elizabeth summons him to a private interview and sets him to the task of finding her missing and favorite lady in waiting, Lady Parry, whom Elizabeth had sent on a private mission.  Blocking  Brendan's efforts on Elizabeth's behalf is Lord Dudley, who will book no interference with Elizabeth's favor.  Brendan is delighted to be sent out of London, away from Lord Dudley and all the pitfalls of the royal court.As Brendan struggles to find Lady Parry and why she has disappeared, he arrives at the lonely and shabby Vaughan Hall and the fun begins.  Where is Lady Parry, who is Raff the lonely little boy, and why is Lady Vaughan so abusive?I liked this book but was a bit lost with some of the characters, not having read the other 2.  The plot has lots of twists, turns, and action but I could have done without the steamy scene with which the book opens.  Good historical background and convincing action make this a page turner.

"This is a lovely Nora Bonesteel novella set in the Appalachians.  Nora is a long time main character in many of McCrumb's novels.  Nora is a ""seer"", a local wise mountain woman who is sometimes able to see events before they unfold, taking a cake or casserole to a family before tragedy strikes.  In this novella, which is actually 2 stories interwoven, is only 157 pages, but once you pick it up, as I did last night, you won't put it down until you have enjoyed every last page.Nora is consulted by a summer resident who thinks her home is haunted because, for no apparent reason, their flamingo pink aluminum Christmas tree with accompanying Florida themed ornament is twice sabatoged by an unknown hand.  Nora knows the house from of old and realizes that there is an unhappy specter at work.  The other intertwining story is set in the mountains when 2 Sheriffs go up the mountain on Christmas eve to arrest a hit and run driver who ran from the crash after hitting  the Senator's wife's car.Nora is an intriguing character, the writing draws you in and the only flaw I find is that I wanted more.

"I Loved! this book, and so did a WW II vet who said this book brought back many happy memories of how much books meant to him at that time.  This is a fascinating account of the effort to get reading material to the soldiers and sailors stationed world wide during World War II.  It is also the tale of the birth of our now staple book, the paperback.The Nazi book burning campaign inspired the American Library Association to begin a donation campaign to get books to American soldiers and sailors beginning in 1941.  It was widely recognized  throughout the military that reading was a chance for the military to break out of ""do everything together"" mode and find personal space.  The ALA , United Service Organization (USO) and the American Red Cross set a goal of collecting 10 million books from the nation for use by the Armed Forces, but by March of 1942 only 4 million were in hand and 1.5 million of those were not suitable for distribution.  Hauling around hardback books along with the rest of military gear was impractical so the paperback, that we know today, was born.I am a Librarian and the grit and determination to get not just one book but a variety of books on every subject imaginable into the hands of the serving military is a wonderful story.  In the back is a listing of the printed titles which were printed throughout the war and makes a dandy reading list for those interested in what was noteworthy reading  during the war.I highly recommend this book not just for the topic but for its readable style and content","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SICV9ZGUWJ8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544535022#wasThisHelpful","R1SICV9ZGUWJ8H","A37MT7AGRZRLH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37MT7AGRZRLH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For half a decade ""Numb3rs"" followed mathematician Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and his FBI agent brother Don (Rob Morrow).  Charlie's phenomenal math insights helped solve more than a hundred crimes over the course of the series, and this DVD set of the sixth and final season contains all 16 of that season's episodes that were originally aired from September 2009 to the series finale in March 2010.Season Six was relatively short, but there were many strong episodes--the team encountered worlds such as Russian roulette, gambling, cloning, and the paranormal, and used Charlie's tips in the mathematical concepts of game theory, ultimatum game, and risk analysis among others to solve crimes involving a sniper, robbery, kidnapping, computer hacking, identity theft, a hostage situation, and more.Henry Winkler guest starred in an episode this season, and this set includes special features discussing the filming of the show.  ""Numb3rs"" had great chemistry among the lead characters and superb writing, and the final episodes tied up the storylines for the main characters and showed the direction they planned on taking in the future.While fans of the series were disappointed when ""Numb3rs"" ended, the show's run of 118 episodes was creditable for a show of its type and provided much enjoyment with its unique mathematical spin on police drama.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CO44LXSWUAOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FSTN84#wasThisHelpful","R3CO44LXSWUAOO","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We hear figures and statistics in the news all the time, and use our mathematical abilities to process them.  We do not always interpret them correctly, though, and this leads to incorrect beliefs about the world.

In ""How Not To Be Wrong,"" Ellenberg shows us how to avoid misinterpreting the math in our lives and coming to wrong conclusions.In this wide-ranging, erudite book, Ellenberg examines areas in math such as linearity, regression, the Law of Large Numbers, probability, randomness, prime numbers, geometry, and correlation, providing  examples in such areas as economics, war, religion, medicine, terrorism, sports, politics, and state lotteries to help the reader avoid making common mathematical errors.

"Conservative author Rod Dreher returned to his home parish in Louisiana in his middle age after the death of his sister, and was hoping to renew family ties there.  When that dream turned into a nightmare, it brought on a spiritual crisis that even affected his physical health.  Dreher turned to what he describes as an unlikely source, Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" to help him get out of the ditch in which he found himself.Dreher's family never accepted him for who he was instead of who they thought he should be, and it became clear to the author that he would never have the type of family life he envisioned.  In ""How Dante Can Save Your Life,"" the author discusses how Dante helped him to see areas in which he was tripped up by his trial and how to move through those issues.It is not necessary to have read Dante before taking up this volume.  The book offers numerous wise insights and much terrific advice concerning losses and ruptured relationships that happen in almost all lives, but you do not have to be going through a crisis as severe as the one Dreher faced to appreciate the book.

"In his storybook basketball career, Bill Russell won two NCAA championships, an Olympic gold medal, and an unbelievable eleven NBA championships.  He did face numerous difficult challenges in segregated America while young, and in ""Go Up for Glory"" the man whom many think is still the greatest basketball center ever looks at his life to that point on the hardwood and in American society.The book was written in 1965, most of the way through Russell's NBA career, when the star was in his early thirties.  Russell's family left Louisiana to settle in the Bay Area, and a stellar career at the University of San Francisco and a triumph at the 1956 Olympics followed, and the author reflects on those times early in the book.Russell is most famous for his role in establishing the Boston Celtics as a marquee NBA franchise during the team's dynasty of the 1950s and 1960s.  These pages offer brief sketches of Russell's key teammates, thoughts on his relationship with coach Red Auerbach, interesting vignettes into what it was like to play NBA basketball more than a half-century ago, and recollections of a couple of the pivotal plays that kept the Celtics' streak of titles intact.Civil rights was foremost in the country's attention in the mid-1960s.  The movement had made great (but still incomplete) progress when the book was written, and Russell describes his hopes for the future of civil rights near the end of the book.  ""Go Up for Glory"" is fascinating whether you read it for the basketball aspect or the sociology aspect, and anyone with a keen interest in the history of the NBA would definitely find it worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBAMQMBX2OSAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010KWX54#wasThisHelpful","RBAMQMBX2OSAH","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In American history courses in school, we see that Richmond fell early in April 1865 and that a mere week later Lee had surrendered to Grant at Appomattox.  While it is natural to infer from this that the surrender was a foregone conclusion after Richmond's fall, in ""April 1865"" author Jay Winik teaches that that was by no means the case, and that there were several points both in that week and in that most fateful month that events could have gone off the rails to the great detriment of the future of America and the world.While the eleven states that formed the Confederate States of America were the only states to secede in American history, Winik notes that the generations of antebellum Americans had always viewed the unity of the nation as fragile and that secession movements, not all of them Southern, were plotted from the earliest days of the Republic.As April approached in 1865, the Confederacy was in increasingly desperate straits, so much so that many Southerners voiced what four years earlier had been unthinkable--giving blacks freedom in return for military service in the Confederate Army.  That measure was taken too late to save the Confederacy, though, and after Richmond fell Lee attempted to join up with Johnston's troops in North Carolina.  Within days, however, Lee's army was surrounded, and Winik rightly lauds the general for making the pivotal decision to surrender rather than attempt guerilla warfare.Winik's portrait of the surrender at Appomattox and its aftermath is superb.  Lincoln and Grant were wise enough to know that knitting North and South back together into one nation called for magnanimity and the refusal to destroy the dignity of the South and Southerners.  Most know that the South was devastated  as a result of the war, but the author's assessment of the total extent of that devastation is truly arresting.Even with the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, the war was not quite over and there were a few remaining anxious moments for all who hoped for peace, and Winik describes the surrender of the rest of the Confederate forces.Five days after Lee's surrender, President Lincoln was assassinated in Washington, and this volume tells the story of that tragedy in great detail.  Winik notes that precedents for the transfer of power were still not robust in the 1860s and recalls how Andrew Johnson became Lincoln's successor, with the attendant effects on postwar politics.""April 1865"" also offers biographical sketches of Lincoln, Davis, Grant, Lee, and other figures who played key roles during that month.  This volume as much as any other I have ever read is a refutation of the Marxist doctrine of determinism and control of history by impersonal forces--Lincoln, Grant, and Lee especially show how much individuals and the decisions that they make (as well as fate and good or bad luck) can turn history on a dime and have effects that last generations if not centuries.This book has a great picture section, and it was enjoyable to read and elegantly written, challenging the vocabulary of even serious readers.  For those history buffs who love reading about the Civil War and who want to gain a deeper understanding of key figures of the war and of the importance of the conflict coming to a close in the manner that it did, I cannot recommend ""April 1865"" more highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGHR82BHIF7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060899689#wasThisHelpful","R3RGHR82BHIF7N","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 2014 midterm elections saw the Republican Party outperform most expectations.  The GOP captured nine Senate seats and took comfortable control of the upper chamber, while also picking up thirteen House seats--its total of 247 in the lower chamber is its high-water mark since the Roaring Twenties.  The party did well in the governorships, too, even winning a shocker in Maryland.In ""The Surge,"" more than a dozen political analysts examine this historic midterm in a series of essays looking back on what Republicans did to reap the gains that they realized last November and looking forward to the huge 2016 presidential election that will determine who succeeds President Obama.2014 began with the primary season, and one essay recalls how the GOP was more successful this cycle in striking a winning balance between ideology and electability when selecting its Senate nominees.The fall campaign was memorable, and other essayists look back at the races for the Senate, House, and governorships, as well as some of the issues and conditions in the country that influenced the contests.  There were a few key October events that contributed to the Republicans' late surge.  The party won three Senate seats and eight House seats by less than four percentage points, suggesting that if the Obama approval rating had been a mere two points higher on Election Day, the GOP would likely have just barely captured the Senate and not even recaptured all of the House seats that it lost in 2012, a result that would have looked and felt much different.Financing and polling are important topics in midterm as well as presidential elections, and ""The Surge"" explores the impact of the campaign finance rule changes of recent years as well as some of the challenges that the Internet and cell phones are posing to pollsters as they try to gauge the intents of voters.Now that we are well into 2015 and the country has digested the results of the midterms, those interested in politics are of course looking forward to the presidential contest late next year.  There are essays looking forward to the election as well as at the futures of both the Democratic and Republican parties.Another essay looks at some of the rules changes for the 2016 primary calendar and nomination contest process, and fans of Sean Trende will enjoy that always-superb analyst's look at the Electoral College and whether we can expect any significant shift anytime soon in the coalitions of blue and red states that we have become familiar with in recent elections.One point not fully explored in ""The Surge"" is the typical performance of the ""out"" party in elections in which the incumbent party is seeking its third straight term in the White House.  In the last hundred years, there have been nine such elections (1920, 1928, 1940, 1960, 1968, 1976, 1988, 2000, and 2008).  In each and every one of those nine contests, the party not holding the presidency improved its standing in the popular vote by four to fourteen percentage points compared to its performance in the previous election.This phenomenon has occurred not only when the country was in trouble, but also when things seemed well.  In 2000, George W. Bush brought the Republicans' percentage of the popular vote up seven points from the previous election, from 41 to 48.  Twelve years earlier, Michael Dukakis was criticized for a bland, ineffectual campaign, but even in the midst of the peace, prosperity, and thawing Cold War tensions of 1988 he was able to convince enough voters that it was time for a change that he brought the Democrats' share of the popular vote up from 41 to 46.  Mitt Romney took 47 percent of the popular vote in 2012, and if this pattern holds for the tenth straight ""third term"" election, Republican gatherings on the night of November 8, 2016 will be happy indeed.""The Surge"" contains raw vote totals for senatorial and gubernatorial contests, crosstabs galore from the exit polls, and tables, charts, graphs, and a scatter plot to help the reader interpret the analysis in the book.

"""Miami Vice"" was one of the most unique and influential television series of the 1980s.  Viewers were attracted to this police drama that was filmed in Miami with its tropical scenes and that integrated popular songs into the storylines as no other show had before.  This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of the first season of the series that were originally broadcast on NBC from September 1984 to May 1985.Don Johnson vaulted to fame for his portrayal of lead character Sonny Crockett, a vice cop who with his partner, Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas), solved crimes involving drugs, murder, gambling, smuggling, arms dealing, prostitution, kidnapping, burglary, home invasion, and organized crime.  Sonny dressed as no other TV policeman ever had, sporting Caribbean pastels that matched those of some the architecture seen in Miami.  Edward James Olmos played Lieutenant Martin Castillo, the taciturn, no-nonsense head of the vice department.Bruce Willis, Glenn Frey, and Pam Grier guest starred during the first season, and the aforementioned music was stellar, with Phil Collins, Russ Ballard, Tina Turner, the Pointer Sisters, Steppenwolf, The Animals, Autograph, ZZ Top, Glen Frey, Peter Gabriel, Foreigner, Sheila E., U2, and others accentuating the storylines with their songs.The bonus material on this set looks at the filming, style, and music of ""Miami Vice"" as well as the effect that the series had on the Florida city.  The show was one of the most iconic of the whole decade, and even the theme song was one of the best in television history.  Gen Xers who saw the show and who purchase this set will enjoy remembering some of the classic episodes, and those in younger generations who are fascinated by the Eighties will be treated to one of the most memorable contributions to that decade's pop culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KF5TT9Q4TT55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JLEY#wasThisHelpful","R1KF5TT9Q4TT55","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1960s was the decade of psychedelia, but the Maryland-based United States of Existence recorded songs of that genre from 1978 to 1986.  This collection of songs is strong almost from top to bottom, with a good number of the songs having a very fast tempo and strong beat.  The group blends psychedelia and surf together on several of the songs as almost no other group that I am aware of has done, and the leadoff song, ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" was regarded enough to be included on the Children of Nuggets boxed set.  This collection would definitely be enjoyed by fans of psychedelic and surf rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOP6GXNRTO97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002N69N2#wasThisHelpful","RNOP6GXNRTO97","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the spring of 1991, floral ties seemed to be ubiquitous.  NBA coaches were wearing them during the playoffs, college guys sported them at their graduation ceremonies, and even some in the business world adopted the look.  I remember my mother telling me at that time that floral ties had also been popular around 1967--if that is the case, and fashions really do return every so often, there may again be a time before too long when everyone seems to be wearing them.This floral tie looks sharp, and is made of cotton and feels very durable.  The description above says that the tie is ""not-too-skinny,"" but the prospective buyer should note that it is fairly skinny, more so than you might expect when viewing it here.

"Most Americans are not fans of our lengthy presidential selection process that begins each cycle soon after the midterm elections are over.  A minority of the country, though, sees the gauntlet that candidates must run as a healthy test of our prospective presidents' characters.  In ""What It Takes,"" Richard Ben Cramer tells the story of six of the men who were first-tier candidates for their parties' nominations in the election of 1988:  George Bush, Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole, Richard Gephardt, Joe Biden, and Gary Hart.""What It Takes"" demonstrates that the marathon in fact begins years before the candidates declare, if not early in their lives.  Cramer seeks to understand what makes the candidates tick, going back to their upbringings, family lives, and experiences that forged their characters long before they ever hit the campaign trail.  He also tries to fathom the motivations that would drive them to run such an exhausting race, how they overcame adversity, and the strengths and weaknesses of each man and how they came into play during Campaign '88.Strategy plays a part in campaigns, but those who have followed politics for a long time know the far more commanding role that money and organization play in determining the nominees of the two major parties every four years.  Many thought that Dole would upset Bush for the Republican nod, but Cramer illustrates the enormous advantages that Bush enjoyed that enabled the vice president to hold Dole off.  Even though personalities and characters do have an effect on a campaign, ""What It Takes"" shows why no dark horse has captured a major-party nomination in decades and likely won't in the foreseeable future, either.Most of the book gives the backstory of the campaign that most people (viz. those who aren't political junkies) miss--all that takes place before the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries.  Over the course of this long book Cramer recalls all of the major evens of the campaign, including the exits of Biden (for plagiarism) and Hart (for adultery), Bush's turnaround in New Hampshire, Dukakis outlasting the other Democratic contenders to capture his nomination, and Bush's strategy that turned his summer poll deficits into a 40-state near-landslide in November.Especially poignant is the description of the moments at which the losing candidates knew that their years-long (in some cases, life-long) dream was coming to an end.  Another theme of the book is that prominence is no guarantee against tragedy in one's personal or family life, as each of these six first-tier candidates profiled had to deal with something exceptionally difficult at some point in their lives.""What It Takes"" has been called by many the best book ever dealing with a presidential campaign.  While there are other contenders for that title as well, and the book's length might seem off-putting, any political junkie ought to read it once in his or her life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUGCL0VAWGXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679746498#wasThisHelpful","R1UUGCL0VAWGXM","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Theodore White had a roaring success with his 1961 release ""The Making of the President, 1960.""  The retrospective of the presidential campaign was read by multitudes of Americans, and was so well-received that White produced a similar look back after the next three elections as well.The author took a bit of a different tack for the election of 1980.  In ""America in Search of Itself,"" White recalled the 1956 election, his first to cover as a reporter.  He describes what he called the Old Country of the Fifties and early Sixties and then proceeds to explain both the social changes and changes in government that brought the country to its fateful decision of 1980.White looks at a few key states of the Union and recalls the impact that they had on national politics, recalls the shift of voting patterns of important demographic groups during the decades leading up to 1980, and notes the impact that television had made on politics by the time of the Reagan-Carter showdown--however, his stressing of how important the nightly network news was may have been on-target 35 years ago but certainly seems quaint from our standpoint today.The author tracks Jimmy Carter's rise to power and notes the disagreements that he had with the Democratic Congress of that era that led to gridlock and helped lead to Edward Kennedy's primary challenge in 1980.  White looks at the tactical errors of the Carter administration in both domestic and foreign affairs which led to widespread malaise.Near the end of Carter's term, our standing in the world had diminished precipitately and inflation had reached intolerable levels.  The traditional Democratic coalition had eroded, and White recalls the effects of this in the section of the book that recollects both parties' primaries and the general election.  The author examines the Reagan landslide and the results from the 1980 census.White was known as a liberal but made several comments over the course of the book critical of some of the liberal excesses of the Sixties and Seventies, and two key problems that he mentioned that were caused by the liberalism of that era have only gotten far worse in the third of a century since this book was released.  ""America in Search of Itself"" is a worthwhile look back at the elections of 1956 and 1980 and the huge changes that occurred in America in the interim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DQYL0O11MLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060390077#wasThisHelpful","R36DQYL0O11MLA","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heading into the 1964 season in Major League Baseball, the New York Yankees had been to the World Series 28 times in the previous 43 seasons.  It was a level of dominance that will never be seen again, and the mid-Sixties saw the long run of Yankee excellence reach its end.  David Halberstam recalls the club's last World Series appearance of the mid-century era in ""October 1964.""To the casual fan of that time, New York's run likely seemed as though it would go on forever, but Halberstam notes that astute baseball insiders realized that by the mid-Sixties the Yankees' farm system was not what it had been in previous decades.  The team had also not kept up with many other franchises in baseball in signing talented young black players.Halberstam examines the changes that were happening in 1960s America, including changes in race relations and the nature of authority, as well as the impact that television was making on society.  The author notes that the St. Louis Cardinals, the team that would face the Yankees in the World Series in 1964, were far ahead of most clubs in signing and integrating black players--blacks were not merely accepted, Halberstam notes, but the Cardinals had a greater number of genuine interracial friendships than most teams did at the time.This helped the Cardinals immensely in 1964, as did their focus on speed and their acquisition of Lou Brock.  Starting then and for a long time after, St. Louis became known as a team that tried to win with speed.  The Cardinals were involved in an epic National League pennant race in 1964, and Halberstam's recollection of it is superb.Important figures of both the Yankees and Cardinals are profiled, giving the reader important information about their backstories.  Halberstam talks about much more than baseball in this volume, providing great insights into human nature as well as into what happened on the diamond.St. Louis and New York put on a show in a classic World Series, and Halberstam's description of those seven games, including the key plays that swung the Series and won the title for the Cardinals, is outstanding.  It would be the last World Series appearance for the Yankees for over a decade, and the author's epilogue talks about what happened to both franchises and many of the key players on both teams in the years that followed.There is also a good picture section in the book.  Society always impacts sports and sports always impacts society, but Halberstam's volume recalls a moment when that was even more the case than usual.  Baseball fans would enjoy this remembrance of a classic season and classic World Series between two classic franchises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQ2IB1RR8ENA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449983676#wasThisHelpful","R3PQ2IB1RR8ENA","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first Bob Ryan writing that I ever remember encountering was in an NBA season preview magazine in the fall of 1987 when I was a senior in high school in rural Texas.  I really enjoyed the piece, and as I became more and more absorbed by the history of the NBA I saw his name pop up many times.  I subsequently always considered it a treat to read anything he wrote or to hear him interviewed on radio or television.So I was enthused when I saw that he was coming out with this memoir, ""Scribe,"" that looks back on his sterling sportswriting career that stretches back to the late 1960s.  Ryan begins by describing his upbringing in Trenton, and sports was a big part of the author's life from its earliest stages.  His account of his time at Lawrenceville School and Boston College is absorbing, as is his personal recollection of being in Boston in 1967 during the Red Sox pennant drive and World Series.Shortly thereafter, Ryan was hired by the Boston Globe, where he covered the Celtics.  Those who are well-versed in Celtics history of the Seventies and Eighties will already know much of the information covered concerning those years, but the author offers enough unique takes and fresh anecdotes to make that section of the book more than worthwhile.While Ryan is best-known for his work in relation to the Celtics and the NBA, it was far from his only assignment during his decades in Boston.  Among other things, he was briefly a Red Sox beat writer, appeared on local television, and went to numerous Olympics--his recollection of the 1992 Dream Team is a good one.Ryan also provides insightful observations about football, hockey, golf, and even music, and the personalities he discusses include John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Red Auerbach, Larry Bird, Bob Knight, and Chuck Daly.Toward the end of the volume he talks of the drought-ending 2004 Red Sox and 2008 Celtics and compares LeBron James and Michael Jordan.  The book's lone blemish is that there are several errors concerning dates, scores, and the like, but if you have long admired Bob Ryan's work you will not regret adding ""Scribe"" to your sports library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFEB9GTZNO3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620405067#wasThisHelpful","R1CFEB9GTZNO3K","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Those with even a basic knowledge of American history know that the United States saw a huge wave of immigrants in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Far fewer know that in the depths of the Great Depression, there was actually an aggregate outflow--remarkable as it may seem, there was a short period where more were emigrating from the United States than were immigrating into it.  Even more unbelievably, many of those who left our shores in search of hope headed to the Soviet Union, one of the few most despotic regimes in history.In ""The Forsaken,"" Tim Tzouliadis tells the little-known story of those who made the tragic mistake of going of their own volition to Stalinist Russia.  Many from all walks of life and from all parts of the country made that journey, including those who worked at a Ford plant that temporarily existed in the USSR and young baseball players in their late teens and early twenties (before the Terror of the 1930s, the author relates that for a brief moment baseball was on its way to becoming a major sport in the Soviet Union, complete with Russian-language radio coverage).As the 1930s progressed, the brief moments when the American emigrants were enjoying their new lives were eclipsed by increasing apprehension and then horror as the Terror set in.  As anyone familiar with Communism knows, it is not in keeping with human nature, so Communist states always end up resorting to violence in order to maintain control (""we're building a perfect society...and if you disagree, you die"").Such regimes always think that individual eggs are worth breaking in their (obviously eventually unavailing) attempts to make their utopian omelets, and the author provides a vivid description of the murders and imprisonments of the Terror and of the desperation of the remaining Americans who were trapped in that hell to find a way to escape.After 1937, however, it was virtually impossible to escape the Soviet Union.  Matters weren't helped by American journalists, ambassadors, and politicians who exhibited next to no sympathy for the Americans' plight.  Some Americans looked at the situation with a sense of realpolitik, but other high officials were simply duped by the USSR--Stalin eventually at times had contempt for President Roosevelt's navete concerning his nation, and this volume is a reminder of how horrifyingly close that putative adult Henry Wallace came to becoming president--after the vice president's visit to the Soviet gulag camps, one of the Russian prisoners told one of the U.S. prisoners that ""you Americans are really stupid.""The gulag was indeed about as close as one could come to hell on earth, and Tzouliadis is unsparing in his description of just how horrifying those camps were.  Unfortunates of many nationalities ended up as prisoners in the Soviet gulag system, including innumerable prisoners of war that ended up in Russian hands.  The author tells the inspiring story of two Americans who persevered for years and against all odds ended up being able to return to the United States.Readers of this book will feel sympathy for all who ended up in the gulag, both the POWs who were taken there by force and those who made the naïve but exceptionally foolish decision to emigrate to the USSR.  Many of the latter who were baseball players were very young.  While few make a decision as dumb as thinking that the Soviet Union would be a great place to live, most if not all of us did a few stupid things and made a few dumb decisions way back in our own late teens/early twenties yesteryears--but virtually all of the unfortunate baseball players never got a chance to live to middle or old age and look back on their youthful mistakes as things long, long lived down.""The Forsaken"" certainly can't be described as an uplifting read, but it is compelling.  It records an event in history that should be remembered lest it be repeated, and serves as a reminder of how truly hideous Soviet Russia was, of how little bureaucrats in free societies care about those they represent in many cases, and of just how lucky America was to have Harry Truman, whatever his failings, as president instead of Henry Wallace in the earliest stages of the Cold War.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYMTRF7LRPGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143115421#wasThisHelpful","R3FYMTRF7LRPGW","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most Americans today are probably not aware that President Woodrow Wilson sent troops to Russia during that country's civil war in an attempt to nip Bolshevism in the bud.  In ""America's Secret War Against Bolshevism,"" author David Foglesong chronicles our unavailing effort to stop the establishment of Communism in what became the Soviet Union.Wilson rightly saw Bolshevism as a menace to the world, and Foglesong recalls the president's reasoning as to why.  Wilson thought that intervention in Russia passed a cost-benefit analysis, but there was a tension between his general foreign policy belief in self-determination and wisely making an exception in the case of what would ultimately metastasize into world Communism.  The author covers all of the reasons for intervention and the methods, economic and intelligence as well as military, used.The president was hemmed in by factors such as American public opinion and the possible response of the Germans at the close of World War I.  However, troops were ultimately sent to Siberia and North Russia.  Foglesong recalls the role that the British, Japanese, and Czechs played in the intervention, describes the trajectory of events before the ultimate withdrawal of Allied troops, and offers his opinion on the efficacy of the operation.President Wilson was correct in believing that the end of the Bolshevik regime was inevitable, but the Soviet government killed millions, forced the rest of the population to ""live"" in terror, and remained a purulent blight on the earth for most of the rest of the century.  Winston Churchill was, as was often the case, foresighted and called for greater intervention.While it would have been worth it to strangle Communism before it really got established, it is understandable to see how the war-weary Western nations in 1918 and 1919 might not have agreed.  ""America's Secret War Against Bolshevism"" is a definitive account of this little-known episode in the history of the twentieth century.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J59GLJSG7BM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807849588#wasThisHelpful","R3J59GLJSG7BM4","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

By its ninth season, it was the top-rated show in America, and this DVD set contains all 27 episodes of that season that were originally aired from September 1990 to May 1991.Ted Danson stars as Sam Malone, an ex-baseball player who owns and bartends at Cheers.  The great characters that comprise the bar's employees and regular clientele come from different social classes and walks of life, but form a community of sorts.The cast gets into all sorts of funny situations during the course of these episodes--a recurring theme this season is the conflict between Sam and the owner of the restaurant upstairs from the bar.  Singer Bobby Hatfield and Boston Celtic great Kevin McHale each guest star in an episode, and Arsenio Hall and Michael Dukakis make cameo appearances.  At the end of the season, Sam expresses a desire to become a father.""Cheers"" reached the 200-episode mark during Season Nine, and John McLaughlin hosted a retrospective with the main characters that discussed how the show emerged in spite of its inauspicious beginning, showed highlights of episodes in seasons past, and talked about the relationships between the characters.Gen Xers will also recall some of the cool fashions that were ""in"" during the early Nineties while watching these episodes.

"Most who follow politics in America see that Democrats play to win but that Republicans fight back with nowhere near the same level of intensity.  As a result, government has grown to gargantuan levels and we have traveled a long way down the road from liberty to tyranny.  Like millions of other Americans, David Horowitz deplores this development--he wrote this volume that offers a sage plan that the GOP could take into battle.Conservatives sometimes naïvely think that if they offer superior solutions to our nation's problems they will automatically prevail at the ballot box.  Horowitz, however, opines on the factor that he thinks really swings elections and shows where the Republicans fall short in influencing that factor.  The author notes that the standard array of attacks by Democrats has not changed in decades, but, remarkably, in all that time the GOP has never found effective rejoinders.Horowitz points out liberal failures in foreign policy and describes at length how on the domestic front liberal policies have hurt those who the Left claims to help.  In spite of that, liberals see themselves as morally superior to conservatives, and because they do, adopt an ends-justifies-the-means ethos in implementing their plans.  The author provides the all-important tips on how conservatives could effectively and persuasively argue in moral terms themselves and at long last turn the tables.  Also included is a chapter concerning unity between the Tea Party and the Republican Party.Conservatives and Republicans pride themselves on being problem-solvers and solution-oriented, but continually fall down in finding a solution to a (the?) task of prime importance--doing whatever it takes to expose as false the fraudulent Moral Superiority pose liberals and Democrats adopt.  David Horowitz's ""Take No Prisoners"" should be required reading for all GOP presidential candidates in preparation for 2016.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5B2J1PHAL4FA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621572560#wasThisHelpful","R5B2J1PHAL4FA","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Streets of San Francisco"" established itself in its first season on ABC and became even more popular in its second season, finishing 1973-74 ranked in the Top 30.  This DVD set contains the first eleven episodes from Season Two that were originally broadcast in the fall of 1973.In these episodes of this superb crime drama, Lt. Mike Stone (Karl Malden) and his young, college-educated colleague Steve Keller (Michael Douglas) have great chemistry both in spite of and because of their age difference.  The two solve crimes such as murder, bank robbery, larceny, prostitution, organized crime, and a jail break.The series was filmed on location in San Francisco, with great views of the city and surrounding bay and ocean framing the action, and the setting was further enhanced by incorporating period houses, bars, wharves, hospitals, and even the city zoo.  Alcatraz Island even made an appearance in an episode on this set.Several notable guest stars including Michael Constantine, Martin Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Tom Bosley, and Ricky Nelson appear on this set, and the Seventies cars and clothes here are cool.  Those who enjoyed Season One of ""Streets"" would enjoy these episodes as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RT9Z0C303T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001675ZJ2#wasThisHelpful","R35RT9Z0C303T","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this film, Colin Firth plays a man who flees his life in Florida and takes on a new identity, that of Arthur Newman.  On his way to Indiana, ""Arthur"" meets another person living under an assumed name, ""Michaela"" Fitzgerald (Emily Blunt), and the two become involved.  The premise behind the film was interesting and I wanted to like ""Arthur Newman,"" but was disappointed.I gave it a chance because Firth and Blunt are A-listers who have been great in everything they've been in--both of them did a creditable job considering the script, which I thought was just slow-moving with an underdeveloped plot.  Even the key scenes, exchanges, and attempts at humor fell flat, and it just seemed as though this was only about 60 or 70 percent of a movie.  This wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but is certainly forgettable.

"David Horowitz was a key figure of the New Left in the 1960s, but had second thoughts about liberalism as many young people do as they grow older.  By 1997, the year he wrote ""Radical Son,"" he was an influential conservative and this autobiography tells the story of his journey across the political spectrum.Horowitz describes his Marxist upbringing in New York City and how even at age 11 he had already worked out rationalizations he used to condemn the inequalities that are baked into human existence.  By his young adulthood he ended up on the other coast, in the heart of the liberal movement at Berkeley in the Sixties, and he speaks of his activism there as well as of the unsavory alliances the New Left made and the illicit drug use some in the movement partook of then.The author provides insights into the liberal mindset he had in his twenties--he and his cohorts arrogantly thought that ""the world is cursed by ignorance, and the task of progressives like us is to set everybody right.""He eventually realized that the ignorance was on his own side, later comparing modern liberalism to a ""quasi-religious cult""--he describes how Leftists don't know how markets work, are utopian, employ double standards, and launch ad hominem circumstantial arguments when they (inevitably) are losing debates.  In the book Horowitz also recognizes the economic destruction wrought by socialism.The murder of a colleague helped Horowitz see that physical violence was endemic to the Left, as you cannot have communism without violence--after he made other observations that made him question the Left's belief that human character and behavior can be shaped without limit, he rejected Marxism completely and left the Left after a long process of soul-searching.The author also talks of more than politics in these pages, providing exceptionally rich insights in his recollections of his marriages, his relationships with his parents and children, and some of the trials in his personal life.Many think that Democrats will dominate the future politically because of the Millennials, but similar predictions were made following the 1976 election, when it was said that Democrats would prosper because polling showed that the young then were even a bit more liberal than they are today.As the story of David Horowitz shows, though, there is hope.  As people get older, they generally become more conservative--it happened in the Eighties as a result of the Carter years, and polls show that it is occurring today with the Millennials, as the implementation of ObamaCare is teaching them that while liberals always try to sell liberalism as the rich being soaked to help the middle class, it is the middle class that always suffers most under redistributionist policies.""Radical Son"" is simply one of the best biographies I have ever read--it is unbelievably rich in insights into human nature and the human condition, but as Horowitz himself ruefully notes in the acknowledgments, the Leftists who would most benefit by reading it would never consider doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0BOD8KUOGMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684840057#wasThisHelpful","RP0BOD8KUOGMD","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original version of Hawaii Five-O was regarded as one of the great police dramas ever.  It ended its twelve-year run in 1980, and three decades later CBS brought the series back as a 'reboot.'  This DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the first season of the new version of the series originally broadcast from September 2010 to May 2011.In this version of the show Steve McGarrett is a former Navy Seal played by Alex O'Loughlin.  After his father is murdered, Steve is joined on the Five-0 team by Danny Williams (Scott Caan), Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), and Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park).  There is great rapport, banter, and humor between Steve and Danny, and the series portrays side issues like Danny's relationship with his ex and battles for custody of his daughter.  The team is based in Honolulu and solves the crimes of murder, kidnapping, gang war, jail break, robbery, and piracy, and also chases arch-villain Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos).The series incorporates high tech into the forensics that the team uses to solve crimes, and the writing in these episodes is great--it is so tightly written that if you let your mind wander for even a minute or two you can lose track of important parts of the storyline.  In many series today men are portrayed as buffoons, but the new ""Hawaii Five-0"" is old school in that the lead character embodies the traditional masculine traits of toughness, courage, competence, honor, and decisiveness.  The music is also good, and recognizable guest stars this season include Greg Germann and Rick Springfield.  Season One even has a great finale/cliffhanger.Special features on this DVD set include promos, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and features on the show's theme song, on life in Hawaii, on comparisons to the original show, and on the production of the series.It seems that most of the time (we can all think of examples), when a network remakes a show it is far inferior to the original version.  But with its great writing, technology, action, and superb cinematography of Hawaii, this new iteration of ""Hawaii Five-0"" is even a little bit better than its predecessor, great as it was.  One thing both versions have in common, though, is the best theme song in television history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VAYEIMOJNMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R4ZMNQ#wasThisHelpful","R29VAYEIMOJNMB","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Claudia Hammond notes that the word 'time' is used more frequently than any other noun in the English language.  The concept of time is central to how we live in Western culture today, and ""Time Warped"" is a look at how we perceive time and at the impact it has on our lives.Hammond looks at the role of the brain in time perception, noting effects such as the perceived slowing of time during episodes of fear or illness.  She notes the differences in how people organize time in their mind--some people view the months of the year in circular fashion as with a clock, while others view them in the form of a line; some see themselves as moving through time, while others see time as moving toward them.It is frequently observed that time seems to speed up as one gets older--the author examines this phenomenon and why most people can recall their lives from ages 15 to 25 more vividly than they can any other period.  Time perception can also be skewed by vacations and periods of sickness, and the author also covers the topic of why we often underestimate the amount of time that has passed since events from the past.It is a mark of human nature to be too optimistic with respect to our futures, and Hammond brings up the example of our underestimating the amount of time we will need to finish projects.  The author notes how much wonderful or catastrophic events have on our long-term happiness and opines on whether we recall positive or negative events from the past more vividly.Hammond even takes up the topic of whether animals can remember things, and closes this fascinating volume by offering suggestions to problems that the issue of time poses in people's lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHX76S5641O8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062225200#wasThisHelpful","RHX76S5641O8A","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in an era of 24-hour cable news and instant news via the Internet.  Pundits and journalists are more likely than ever to assert that even minor events during presidential campaigns are ""game-changers"" that will decide the contest.  But in ""The Gamble,"" authors John Sides and Lynn Vavreck demonstrate that most elections are quite stable, proceeding according to the underlying fundamentals of campaigns that to a great extent are baked in the cake many months before voters head to the polls.The authors take a ""Moneyball"" approach to primaries and general elections, describing what does and does not move votes and using many tables, charts, graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate their assertions.  Sides and Vavreck rightly note that conditions in the country matter infinitely more to the outcome of elections than do campaign tactics, but they may assign a bit too much emphasis to the state of the election-year economy--one can think of exceptions such as 1968, when the economy was churning along but a quagmire in Vietnam, social unrest at home, and a deeply divided party cost the incumbent Democrats the White House.Sides and Vavreck recount the 2012 Republican primary race, discussing the ""invisible primary"" that takes place long before Iowa and New Hampshire and the role of endorsements of candidates by party leaders--I never really thought that such endorsements mattered much, but the authors look at history to show what having a great number of endorsements tends to predict for a candidate.  They also note that primaries operate according to fundamentals just as general elections do.""The Gamble"" shows that general-election campaigns do matter, but because both parties typically nominate decent candidates with professional campaign personnel, the efforts of the two campaigns tend to cancel each other out for the most part.  Elections operate according to fundamentals--the authors use math to show just how little gaffes, advertising, debates, the number of campaign offices across the country, and even events like Hurricane Sandy really move the needle, and appendices at the back of the book show the math the authors used to arrive at their conclusions.  The last true game-changer for the 2012 election was likely the capture of Osama bin Laden 18 months prior to Election Day.It is commonly thought that Romney lost mainly due to demographics, but the authors again use math to show just how little some of the events that were said to mobilize certain demographic groups on Obama's behalf really mattered.  Also shown is why some of the Dutch-uncle advice offered to the GOP in the days after the election is simply off-base and why long-term realignments do not really exist, the latter point also made in Sean Trende's brilliant The Lost Majority.The message of ""The Gamble"" is reassuring in that it shows that voters are adept at filtering out much of the ""noise"" of campaigns and for the most part focus in on large issues.  It rebuts many of the hoary myths concerning how elections work and is vital reading for anyone seriously interested in presidential elections.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAFS3L5NW0H9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691156883#wasThisHelpful","RAFS3L5NW0H9N","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1991 was one of the wettest years in Texas history, and it was capped off in mid-to-late December by one of the worst flooding events ever in the Lone Star State.  Thirteen lives were lost due to the floods, and property losses totaled $100 million.  Large areas of the state received 5 inches of rain from December 18 to 23, a few areas saw 10 inches, and one location near San Antonio was deluged with 17.This report of the disaster compiled by the National Weather Service contains abundant maps and tables and describes the meteorological conditions that led to the heavy rains.  Different forecast models made different predictions about where the rain would be heaviest and about river and crest forecasts, and the report shows how the models fared.There is an appendix that contains all of the flash flood statements, watches, and warnings issued by the local NWS forecast offices across the state, so the reader can follow the flood event area by area.  There are also accounts of some of the fatalities, including an unbelievable story about how many stalled cars one woman passed before she still decided to cross multiple barricades and drive into a flooded area in Bosque County.The media gave the National Weather Service high ratings for disseminating timely warnings, and the report states that there was a great degree of professionalism in the coordination efforts between the NWS and television and radio stations and newspapers.  NWS officials met after the flood event and discussed data collection and other issues and made recommendations on what could be done better in similar events in the future.Also included is a map showing which counties were declared disaster areas--I either forgot or never knew that my home county was so declared.  The rains didn't seem life-threatening in my immediate area, although I recall driving from Tolar to Granbury during the event and seeing asphalt on U.S. 377 start to be chipped away from the road due to the water.  Things were certainly worse elsewhere in the state, and Southeast Texas was plagued by river flooding even into January 1992.  This thorough report contains just about anything someone would want to know about this historic Texas flood event.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EGN98QW0EYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WYJM56#wasThisHelpful","R23EGN98QW0EYH","A2IS16K96YSFDV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IS16K96YSFDV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Late in 1991, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" began blasting from CD players, boom boxes, and car radios all over America and all around the world.  It was the initial song of ""Nevermind,"" the Nirvana album that was a true landmark of the rock era in that it changed the music scene as few if any other albums of the last four decades has.But this collection of pop-punk-metal is strong from top to bottom and much more than its most famous song.  ""Come As You Are"" was another Top 40 hit, ""On a Plain"" is three-plus minutes of concentrated joy and power, ""Something in the Way"" is a great ballad that sounds like something (the music, if not the lyrics) the Beach Boys might have written had they hung out for a few rainy winter days in the Pacific Northwest, and the cool distortions on ""Drain You"" even hint of psychedelia.Rolling Stone named ""Nevermind"" one of the 20 best of albums the rock era and even the Library of Congress recognized it as significant.

"I have bought a lot of mattress pads over my lifetime.  Most of them are practically what you would have to call ""disposable"" since they often don't even survive one washing and rarely two washings.  The sides are usually made from non-woven fabric, similar to what is used for interfacings and the bottoms of box springs.  The top portion is usually also polyester, and certainly is unpleasant to touch if you have dry, calloused hands like mine.This one is nothing like those mattress pads, even though it is still what one would call a budget-wise mattress pad.  It's cotton, and while it may not be high thread count fabric, it still is much more pleasant to touch than those polyester ones are.  It's quilted, and not super plush, but I'm not buying mattress pads for their cushioning ability--I want one to protect the expensive mattress below it.I didn't want to spend a lot on this mattress pad, as the mattress itself will be going away as soon as we finish some home renovation projects and put up our new bed.  It didn't make sense to spend a lot on a mattress pad that we won't use over a few months at the most.  At the same time, we have an aging dog that sometimes manages to get onto the bed, and that usually results in all of the bedding, including the mattress pad, needing to be washed.  The old pad died, and we had to have a new one to protect the mattress.  (The dog is very old and in failing health.  Mattresses don't have the same emotional ties that our aging pet has.  At the same time, she isn't supposed to get on the bed, and tends to leak from one end or the other...so I need to be able to wash everything.)I'm super impressed with this mattress pad.  It does the job it is supposed to.  It's not waterproof, but we have a waterproof layer--this is to make sure we're not sweating with just a sheet between us and impervious layer.  We're comfortable, I feel as though things can be safely washed and dried, and life is good.  It keeps things on budget and simple.  At its current price, it is VERY budget friendly.I did purchase this with a small promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a very nice size wok, and it is HEAVY.  It's a wok to make a statement with, and nobody will ever even think they can take it lightly.I've used a lot of cast iron in my life.  I love the stuff, and usually prefer to haunt flea markets and antique shops for the old stuff.  It's smooth and dense.  This isn't that kind of cast iron, but then again, not many cowboys were cooking with woks on an open fire either.Modern cast iron arrives with a rough surface.  It may SAY it is pre-seasoned, but I have yet to find one that really was.  Seasoning takes time, and this wok comes with directions on how to do just that.  Even better, the directions are clear and easy to understand, and that is nearly an amazing achievement in itself these days.That seasoning that will turn this into an awesome wok will take months, most likely.  Essentially, it's like a cooked on layer of old oil, which sounds gross but really isn't.  I'll cook a lot of oily things in this, washing it only with water, and reseasoning it often until it gets ""pretty good"".  Then, my personal favorite way to go from ""pretty good"" to totally awesome is to bake a loaf of bread in the cast iron.  Since this wok is pretty big, that's going to be a pretty big loaf of bread!Good cast iron is expensive.  I haven't used this enough to know if I will call it ""good"" or not yet, but it shows every sign of having that potential.  It's the seasoning that ultimately makes the cast iron work, and that is my responsibility.  There is also no quick fix to get it, no ""Instant Seasoning Spray"" either.  Everybody has their own favored methods of doing it--mine happens to favor shortening or lard for the job over soybean oil.  I think it does a better job with less ""gunkiness"".  A new pan also takes repeated seasonings before it gets truly thoroughly seasoned, and until it reaches that point, only oily foods are going to work or everything will stick, requiring scouring to remove it along with previous coats of seasoning.So, if you want instant non-stick, forget cast iron.  Buy a coated pan that you throw away in 3-9 months because it is peeling.  If you want a pan to last decades (or longer) and are willing to spend the time taking care of it, then buy cast iron.  This wok is a great shape for stir frying or deep frying.  It has handles to make lifting and moving it easier, as well as a solid disk on the bottom to make it more stable on traditional stoves than a curved bottom is.  If you have ever used a wok, you know how the heat varies from the center up the sides (hot to cooler).  The rough surface makes the foods that you push up the sides stick to the cooler area to cook it more slowly or just keep it hot while other pieces are cooking in the hotter portion, which helps everything be done and hot at the same time.  If you are deep frying, the shape concentrates the oil in the center, so you actually need less oil to achieve the same effect.  I use a wok for a LOT of things, not just Asian style cooking.  It's also my go-to all purpose pan for camping--the shape manages everything from scrambled eggs to fried chicken to a creamy sauce and on over to fry bread.I haven't ever seen a better cast iron wok than this one from Utopia Kitchen.  I've looked at about every style of cast iron pan, hoping to find one similar to one that belonged to my granddad and dated from the 1800s.  It was deeper than a wok, but had the same curved bottom, as though a wok and a dutch oven had a child, but nobody makes one, and I've not found one at an antique shop either.  This is as close as I can get, and I am pleased with it even though I haven't had it long.  The price is VERY reasonable for a cast iron pan of this size and quality.  I was fortunate enough to be offered a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews always are my honest opinion, but this has to be one of my favorites of the year.  Just remember to read the directions, as well as realizing that seasoning is an ongoing process, even though this is ""pre-seasoned"", that doesn't mean you don't have some work to do before it's fully seasoned, and that it will require upkeep for its entire life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WH36AL5ZACOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145TT8RC#wasThisHelpful","R1WH36AL5ZACOM","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past, I had only used manual pepper grinders.  The idea of a battery powered one was intriguing, as some days, it's pretty tough to manage the grinding of pepper/salt with a manual grinder.I like this grinder, but I'm not ready to get rid of my manual grinders.It just doesn't grind much pepper at a time, which probably helps to prevent over-seasoning things, but it totally sucks when I need a half teaspoon right now for a recipe.  I would go insane if I had to use this for cooking in the kitchen.So, it's a nice looking grinder, guests love it, and I don't have to love it all the time.  It makes me crazy that it takes SIX batteries to operate it.  It's large, easy for them to spot on the table, and it apparently impresses.  Since I'm not impressed often when it's just my hubby and I for dinner, I can use my favorite hand operated mills and grimace at the pain.My overall opinion is that it is probably great for people  who aren't crazy users of pepper and don't mind that it is a miser when it comes to dispensing pepper.  It is attractive, and both peppercorns and batteries will probably last a fair amount of time.I purchased this with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"These are very nice rather orangish red silicone muffin pans, one in regular size, and the other in mini size.  the mini size is a bit wider and shallower than the mini-muffin metal pan I have, but seems to hold about the same amount.  The wider but shallower shape is a great boon to those who love the muffin tops--there is more top per muffin this way.From what I have learned about silicone pans is that one should never use non-stick sprays on them, as it causes them to get a build up of something we'll use the not-so-scientific term of calling ""gunk"".  Baked goods seem to pop right out of the pans without anything so why bother anyhow?These pans bake muffins nicely, and they remove easily.  If I do have any that seem reluctant to separate from their silicone cup, I simply let them stand on the counter for a few minutes, which helps the muffin/cupcake steam some, and then it will pop out nicely.  It's also a good idea to use a baking sheet under them, mostly because they lack the structural strength to support themselves and the batter or cakes inside of them.These aren't my first silicone muffin pans, but my old ones had been ruined by the non-stick sprays I had used on them.  Since I know better now, I anticipate a longer useful lifespan for these cupcake pans than I had for my previous set.I purchased these cupcake pans with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is absolutely the best made shoulder sling bag I have seen.  It's rather unisex, so I think it would work as a man-bag as well, and if nothing else, shouldn't give any male an overdose of estrogen to carry it for someone.It has a ton of zippers with compartments, giving you ample locations to sort things, and the clip is metal, not plastic, to hold the upper flap in place.  It's adjustable, so it can fit anyone from a petite female to a burly guy, and that includes well rounded grandmas like me.  Made of nylon, it will likely repel most dirt and moisture without effort too, which will add a great deal to the bag's longevity.  I could sling it over one shoulder to have it hang in the front, or the opposite shoulder to have it on my back, or just carry it by the handle--it's fairly versatile in how you choose to use it.All of the seams seemed well stitched, the materials from which it was made appeared to be of very good quality as well.  It is marked as made in China, but seems to be well made with good  quality control.  Overall, this is a very nice bag, whether you are purchasing it to keep or as a gift for someone else.  It has a certain fashion flare with its pseudo-military decoration and imprint, as well as its color.I purchased this bag with a promotional discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.

"I've bought other frothers before, since I happen to despise cleaning the spouts on the steam frothers that most home espresso makers have.  Since I now use an Aeropress for my coffees, I obviously don't have that option.  If I wanted frothy tops, I was stuck with the canned whip cream option.This little frother has a much slimmer handle/motor section than any I had had in the past.  It also came with a neat little bracket to hold it, along with two screws, to allow it to be mounted on the wall or cabinet.  That was unexpected--I hadn't noticed that when I had purchased the frother.  I just have to wait--we're midway through our kitchen renovations and it's NOT a good time to add anything that I want to keep.  (Demolition will continue later this week.)With two AAA batteries (we use Amazon Basics rechargeables) I had instant frothy milk, at a much lower calorie level than canned whipping cream too.  I can also make some frothy hot chocolate for my granddaughter, scoring many ""cool"" points in the eyes of a five year old.  Even strawberry flavored milk can be frothed in the glass, increasing its visual appeal and therefore its drink-ability in the eyes of a child.

"We are huge coffee drinkers, but despite our addiction, our usual blend is Folgers, in Black Silk, 100% Columbian, or Classic Roast.  We do indulge in the occasional bag of whole bean coffee, which on our budget, is outrageously expensive.  (Pre-ground name brand coffee is about $8 per pound in the larger cans, while gourmet beans run about $15+ per pound.)  That means when we buy coffee beans, they had best be good.Of course, buying the beans is the least of it.  They need to be used before they become stale too.  They need ground properly, without overheating them to destroy the flavor.  Then, they need brewed.We're prepared for that too.  I have a beautiful little hand mill that is ideal for grinding enough coffee for us each to have a large cup.  We have our preferred single serve brewers too--me & my Aeropress, hubby & his silicone drip pour over coffee maker.  We use a T-Fal cordless tea kettle for our hot water, it's faster than even a microwave!  So I opened the bag, filled the little grinder (that's the hardest part!) and started cranking.  For the record, one full load of beans in our coffee grinder is more than enough for two large mugs of strong coffee.I then measured out the usual amount of coffee for each brewer, and poured in the water to brew as usual.  In a minute or so, I had two beautiful mugs of freshly brewed coffee.On the aroma front, this was incredibly aromatic from the moment I opened the box it arrived in.  I didn't crack the seal on the bag until I was about to grind and brew our coffee though, and when I did, the aroma filled the entire kitchen.  It was that quintessential wake up kind of smell, intense and dark, full of expectations.  In the drip brewer, I could actually see the oils rising up from the grounds on the top of the mixture.Freshly brewed in the mug, it didn't have any of that.  In fact, the aroma was anything but enticing, and that was a bit perplexing.  I then added my creamer, sugar, and milk as usual, stirring it to blend, and doctored the hubby's coffee the way her prefers it with just creamer & milk.  The aroma improved, which was even MORE confusing.I delayed that tasting until I was sitting down with my mug, sticking to my normal post-dinner routine.  Then, the tasting started.  it is a dark, rich coffee, although the coffee seemed lighter in color and weaker bodied than what I was accustomed to seeing.  It's smooth, and I did really like it.But that was it.I didn't get rich quick.  I didn't even get richer.  Nothing happened at all.  I just sat there and enjoyed an evening cup of coffee that was very good.  I really enjoyed it, and it was a decadent kind of pleasure, since I knew that this was freshly ground coffee that I had just brewed for our evening coffee.  I yawned several times as I sipped the brew though.I'm not sure that it has any more caffeine than our usual coffee does, but thankfully, coffee does not give either of us insomnia.  We often have coffee before bed, and then sleep like logs all night.  I don't use coffee for more energy, although I do think it helps me be much more focused.All I can say is that it is a delicious coffee, although I was hoping for the side effect of wealth to occur, I'm really not surprised that it didn't.  I feel good about drinking it because it IS shade grown, organic and fair trade.  Those are all great features that I'm reasonably sure that I'm NOT getting with a can of Folgers.  It's a reasonably priced bag of coffee as well, running about the same as other premium whole bean coffees, including some that aren't Fair Trade or organic.I was fortunate enough to be able to buy this with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my unbiased and honest opinion, and this one is no different.  We really did like this coffee a great deal, and we really didn't get rich quick by drinking it.  Still, it was a lovely coffee experience that we have enjoyed immensely, and will continue to enjoy until the bag is empty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TBBP454L4QDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014TXYS56#wasThisHelpful","R1TBBP454L4QDF","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a rather disappointing kit.  It comes with a small bottle of distilled white vinegar, a packet of flaked cheese salt, a small package of citric acid, a thermometer, some sisal twine, and a piece of cheese cloth, all in a small box with some straw-like stuff at the bottom.  The cheesecloth has a lot of threads and straw bits stuck to the outer side, which makes you wonder how much cleaning you'll have to do of the fabric before using it.  There is also a laminated card with the directions, which are very minimal.  Nothing tells me what to do with the citric acid, leaving me wondering  what it was included for.  I could actually get the directions online in a better written form.I haven't made the cheese, which calls for two quarts of milk, as I just got the box and opened it anxiously.  I really expected something more, I guess.  This was one of the most disappointing DIY kits I have ever bought.I had originally intended this as something to do with my 5 year old granddaughter, who loves cheese.  I'll probably do this cheese with her, but I'll look for another brand for more elaborate cheesemaking projects, and I certainly wouldn't give a kit from this brand after this one disappointed me.

"I read silicone tea kettle, and I was absolutely certain that it was a poorly written description.  There was no way a tea kettle could be made of silicone, I thought.I was wrong.This has a metal base, which allows it to be used over a flame to heat the kettle.  I'd not want to have flames shooting up the sides onto the silicone, but it does work.  That makes this a fantastic camping/road trip companion to use in conjunction with a camp stove.  I wouldn't recommend using this over a campfire, btw.  It's too hard to control where the flames and heat hit with an open fire.  I did try this with a propane and a butane stove.  I'd also feel comfortable using this with an alcohol or other liquid fuel stove.It's not ultra-light by any means.  It IS ultra compact, however, and sometimes, space is as important as weight.

"These are brightly colored, just like in the photo with the description.  Lightweight, fairly shallow, they are made of plastic like many ash trays.  I suspect that like others of this type, they will break if they get knocked off of a table and hit a hard floor.In the meantime, they are compact, cute ash trays.

"I love this ""blanket""!For those who are familiar with them, the mats sold to RVers and often used by those attending outdoor events such as dog shows are very similar to this ""blanket"" only those mats are larger than this blanket.  I didn't buy this blanket with any intention of using it as a ""picnic blanket"".  I wanted it to serve as a rug inside our tent, and for this purpose it is ideal, while the larger ones sold in RV stores are too big for using in the tent.  I'm no expert on manmade fiber, but my description of it is that it is a plastic fiber that has been woven into a mat.  This mat is impervious to dirt and water, and cleans by just hosing it off and letting it air dry.  Don't even think about putting this into a washing machine, as it will ruin it.As for our using it inside the tent, it will act as both a cushion and an insulating layer, so even when we are camping in cold weather, our feet won't instantly turn into foot-cicles when we go to get up out of our cots.  It also protects the floor from damage (we use a tarp under the tent as a foot print to keep moisture migration to a minimum too.)  When using portable furniture with small feet, it's best to stick a square of cardboard or something under the feet to prevent them from damaging this blanket.For using it outside, it is a great item to use to sit or lay on to keep the grass, dew, and dirt away from you.  It's a great floor under a shade too, for the same reasons.  The size of this blanket means that it is a much smaller bundle to take along than one of the large mats, and it has much more convenient velcro-and-strap closure, along with handles.  The convenient stakes that are included with it will keep it from shifting position when outdoors as well.Our granddaughter LOVES going to the beach, but grandma & grandpa just aren't so crazy about sitting in the sand, and it ends up in everything, from our shoes to a can of soda.  Forget even thinking about eating there--everything ends up gritty.  As for carrying large, bulky, and heavy items from the parking area to the beach, we just aren't so thrilled with that either.  Enter this compact and lightweight blanket--it's perfect for those beach events when we grab a fast food meal and make one little girl VERY happy.  I'm happy because we scored ""cool"" points with our pint-sized princess too.  When the beach trip is over, the sand shakes out without any problems, and if it's really persistent, a blast from the hose when we get home takes care of it in short order.I can't say enough good stuff about this miraculous little blanket except it would not work well to wrap up in after a swim in the water--it really is best used strictly as a mat to sit or lay on.I did purchase this picnic blanket with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a really cute retractable lead.  It's easy to hold, works well with the 15 lb. dog I use it with too.  My only complaint is that the clip on the lead is a bit large for small dogs' collars, ,which makes it tricky to attach to the collar with a bouncing dog that is anxious to get out the door.When we're outside, she can move around without the lead dragging on the ground, getting caught on her legs, or worse yet, getting peed on.  It extends out easily to let her feel as though she has plenty of room to roam, yet when I need to stop her from going any further, the button presses easily to lock the lead.  I am really pleased with the ease of using this leash, although it won't replace the traditional kind entirely.  This type of leash is fantastic in our familiar yard, where it's unlikely that someone is going to suddenly approach us.  I've found that retractable leads aren't as much fun or as easy to use when walking in a park where there are lots of pedestrians and other dogs, mostly because of safety concerns.  In campgrounds, with the leash restrictions of 6 feet (the usual length allowed) this leash also fails to meet the approval of rangers, and it's just a lot easier to use a traditional 6 foot lead.  Still, this one is fun when we're playing in our unfenced yard, and it is compact, does not tangle, and the bright color makes it easy to spot even if someone has failed to put it where it is supposed to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28CQKU96AUKRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BW77Y0#wasThisHelpful","R28CQKU96AUKRQ","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nylabone products are always high quality, but not all dogs like all of their chewing products, despite the additional safety of using a Nylabone instead of a traditional product such as antler.  We presented this antler to a devout 10 month old dachshund mix chewing machine.  She chews it, but still prefers furniture, clothing, bedding, etc. over this chew toy.  The biggest advantage of offering her this toy is that it is less likely to present a choking hazard.She's got a lot of other chew toys, but most of them require supervision, as she is apt to chew off chunks.  When she doesn't have one of these chew toys, she's going to be chewing something else that she has managed to get access to, such as bedding (our bed, not hers) or clothing or furniture.  Even in her crate, she has what I swear is a prehensile muzzle and manages to get things that I would have sworn were impossible for her to get access to.  Desperation means that she has to have SOMETHING in there to chew on when we have to leave the house, and I'd far rather take my chances with a Nylabone than whatever that prehensile muzzle manages to reach.This is a large Nylabone product, suitable for larger dogs.  She's a 10 lb. puppy, so I'm reasonably confident that she won't manage to chew off a chunk to choke on, even when she is crated when we have to be away all day.  (No, crates are not cruel when used appropriately--imagine what kind of injury she could inflict on herself if she had free run of the house all day!)I just wish she was a bit more enthusiastic about this chew.  Right now, quilts are rating high on their chewing pleasure in her book (maybe it's the batting inside?) along with electronics wires (let's not discuss how many sets of earphones, ear buds, etc. she has eaten)  If she had even a tenth of the enthusiasm for this antler that she does for ""unauthorized"" items, I'd be thrilled.  However, the only thing she has chewed enthusiastically without having it taken away because of potential choking has been cow hooves.  I'm just hoping that over the next few days, she gets a bit more enthusiastic about this antler toy.  It's sort of if-that's-all-i-can-reach-then-i-will-chew-on-it thing right now.  She's the most enthusiastic and persistent chewer I have ever had.This isn't a ""cheap"" chew toy.  I just wish she was more enthusiastic about it, as I do generally like Nylabone products and regard them as far safer than many so-called ""edible"" chews such as rawhide.  They are also more sanitary than raw bones, with fewer odors to offend the humans.  Oh and less slimy--many natural chewing products are slimy to the touch, and this one doesn't get slimy after she has chewed on it for a while.I'm going to have to keep looking for a chew toy that she isn't going to quickly destroy but that she really likes to gnaw on.  I have no idea what will thrill her in the end, but I hope its not a collar, leash, harness, etc. since I'm getting tired of purchasing new ones to replace the ones she has eaten.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4PGH4AE055Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X591CH8#wasThisHelpful","R2H4PGH4AE055Y","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This pillow arrives rolled up in a compact bolster-like roll.  Once opened, it's a rather floppy underfilled pillow, but the magic has yet to occur.The directions have you putting it in the dryer for fifteen minutes, and when it comes out, it's a fluffy, well filled pillow.  It's also supposed to be a machine washable and dryable pillow, a great asset to extending a pillow's life.

My complaint about those pillows is that sometimes I wake up during the night with a flat pillow that has to be refluffed/scrunched to support my head and neck.  This pillow may alleviate that complaint during the night.  (I'm hoping anyhow!)I hate a ""hot"" pillow, especially in our long steamy summers.  That has had me discard many pillows in the past, allowing them to migrate to my husband's side of the bed (he's always cold) or the spare bedroom.  Even feather pillows will often need flipped during the night to allow me to use the ""cool"" side.  I'm curious about how I will react to this pillow over time, but so far, it seems comfortable.I did purchase this pillow with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this one is no different.UPDATE: After using this for several nights, I still like the pillow, but I do have some additional things to say.  It is very cool to sleep on, and in cooler weather, almost uncomfortably cool.  I've never had a pillow that breathed this well, and I'm accustomed to the level of warmth a feather/down pillow gives.  This is great on hot flash occasions though!  The other observation that I have made is that it lacks the necessary firmness for a side sleeper like me.  I have awakened during the night several times to find that my neck was aching and the pillow was just too flat to support my head and neck while sleeping, although it is wonderful when I am laying on my back.  I suspect that this pillow may end up on the other side of the bed with my husband because of this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLPI09PMWUZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC0SPIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QLPI09PMWUZJ","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot to love with this utensil set.The spatula, spoonula, cooking spoon, and ladles are all entirely smooth surfaced, with no nooks, crannies, or seams to hide bacteria or fungi.  That's great news when you are trying to make sure you aren't going to make anyone sick with your cooking too!  It also means that they are easy to clean.  The tongs do have seams, as only the tips are coated with the silicone.  That should be just fine, as tongs are typically used to pickup or turn foods, rather than mixing, stirring, or serving liquid-y foods.  It means that for the first time, I have tongs that are safe to use with non-stick cookware!Silicone means that these utensils are heat/cold resistant, won't melt with normal use, and can be safely washed in the dishwasher or even sterilized in boiling water.  That means that these are safe to use, even when preparing food for someone with an impaired immune system.  It means that they will last far longer than the cheap nylon ones that melt at about 300 degrees F.They are more expensive than the dollar store versions, but they are much higher quality and will last hundreds of times longer.  I can't count the number of times that a dollar store utensil has failed within a week and landed in the trash!The turning spatula is a bit straight for my tastes, as well as a tad thick at the edge.  I haven't tried it with pancakes, crepes, etc. yet, so I'm not sure how well it will actually perform when put to the test with that type of food.  The spatula and spoonula are both full sized, capable of handling the average bowl of cake or cookie batter.  The ladles, which another reviewer stated were small, are a bit smaller than the usual sizes seen.  They seem ideal for ladling out sauces and gravies, even if they are a bit undersized for big bowls of hearty soups and stews.  Maybe they will encourage us all to eat a bit less?The bright pink color is radically different from most utensils.  It's cute and different.  It's a touch of whimsical femininity in an unexpected place, and I like that.  I usually use a sturdy plastic planter pot for a utensil container--I may have to find one in white and do a bit of DIY trimming on it with a hot glue gun and some ruffled lace or ribbon just to build on the whimsy these bright pink utensils have brought into my very utilitarian kitchen.I did purchase these utensils using a promotional discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this one is no different.

"This absolutely was not met with a great  deal of excitement from our dogs.  Maybe it was the density of my skull, but I actually thought this was pouches of food similar to the canned foods of the same flavor.It's not.It's pouches of soft chewy kibble.Our dogs looked at us when they were presented with this mixed with their regular kibble, convinced that we had lost our minds.  They ate it, but it didn't meet their expectations of wet canned food mixed with kibble.  We have three dogs, all different sizes, and a granddog that happens to be staying with us that is still yet another size.  Not one of them were thrilled with it.  One actually had a tantrum and dumped her food dish upside down (that's her thing when meals are disappointing.)While some dogs may like this and find the addition of these ""soft meaty"" pieces appealing, ours did not.  We would not purchase this again as a food additive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M14109I80E1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126F8Y7M#wasThisHelpful","R2M14109I80E1T","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these cups, except for one issue.  They are just too small.Like many other people, I see the measurements, and it doesn't really create an accurate mental picture.  I had thought that these would be ideal for cocoa, tea, and coffee when camping, and best of all, we'd no longer have burnt lips from a scalding hot metal cup rim.Since we use an Aeropress for our coffee, I knew I'd have to carry at least one rigid cup to use for brewing, as these cups obviously cannot withstand the pressure from pressing down on the Aeropress to brew our coffee.  That isn't a real big deal--I often carry a metal cup to use for that purpose when we are on a road trip.  The real problem is found in that one cup of brewed coffee would probably fill two of these folding cups.  They just aren't going to hold a cup of anything.It's a great idea.  It works well if you brew your beverage in a different container and then dole it out.  They are a great size for little hands, but we just don't have a lot of kids (only one very spoiled granddaughter) to take on camping trips with us.  So leaving the size alone, let's move onto their great qualities.They aren't going to cool off as fast as a metal cup, so that means your hot beverage will stay hot longer, even without a lid or any thermal qualities.  They also aren't going to get hot as fast, so if your drink is cold, it will stay cold long enough to finish it for the same reason.  They are lightweight and compact too.  These collapsible cups also will clean well, don't absorb odors and flavors (that's very important since spiced chai flavored coffee is never going to win awards with me!) and are able to resist both cold and heat while remaining flexible and usable.  The handle is ingenious and really makes the difference in ease of use.To unfold them is an easy and intuitive process, and then the handle flips around to press against a small raised area on the cup's lower ring, creating a reasonably sturdy handle connection.  There is a small square of stiffer silicone material that forms the base, and it seems reasonably secure when standing on a table with liquid in the cup.  Obviously, since they are made of a single piece of silicone (except for the handle), they don't leak either.If they were about twice as big, they'd be a five star product.  That is literally their sole negative, that they don't hold enough for most adults.I purchased these with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this one is no different.  These are really convenient cups, although they are very small for most adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ADYV33R26Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130S1RTQ#wasThisHelpful","R39ADYV33R26Y2","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description of this holder is not particularly clear, so I'm going to start off this review with some clarification.The base is like a small steel bearing with a base that can be attached to your dash or desk.  Then, there is a magnetic disk that sticks to that bearing like nothing I could believe.  Each of  your devices that you wish to use with this then gets a metallic disk, which allows you to use the mount to hold them securely on the mount.  The magnet can be slid around to get the perfect angle, but is darn near impossible to pull off of that bearing.  Like a ball-and-socket joint, there is a LOT of flexibility in position so you get that perfect angle.There is nothing to dislike.

"These are absolutely lovely silicone utensils.  Completely coated (and not a thin coat either) so that there are no hidden crevices or obscure joints to hold molds, mildew or bacteria.  The handles are substantial, so that they will stand up to the job of scraping, scooping, mixing or stirring.  They are an ideal set to use with non-stick cookware to ensure that there will be no nicks, scratches, or scrapes on your expensive cookware.  The only one that I'm a bit uncertain about yet is the turning spatula.  It may be a bit thick to use with things such as cookies or pancakes, etc.  I haven't made them recently, so I can't say yes it does work for those or not.Silicone ladles are almost unheard of, and cooking spoons are the same thing.  I have a number of nylon ones, but the handles are suspicious sources of potential bacterial contamination of our food, so I have been wanting to replace them.  (We have a family member with a compromised immune system that is hoping to get an organ transplant so we've become germ-phobic lately.)  I have been looking at kitchen equipment and tools with a whole new perspective lately, and a number of things have had to go away.  I can't even begin to stop gushing how much I love this ladle and cooking spoon.The spatula and spoonula are also full sized, big enough to use with a two or three layer cake batter and not seem ridiculously small.  I have some other silicone utensils that are petite sized, and really are inadequate for many cooking and baking tasks.  These are ALL of substantial size, suitable for use by the family cook.These utensils are a germ-phobic person's friend.  Smooth surfaces without joints means that they can actually be thoroughly cleaned.  Their heat resistance means that they can safely be sterilized too, and also safely make a trip through a dishwasher.  For the aspiring gourmet cook, they are also fantastic utensils for everything from mixing to dividing among dishes.I purchased these with a promotional discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this time, I consider myself to have really ""scored"" on the utensil front.

"I wasn't sure about ""mid-rise"" panties.  As a granny, my days of preferring hip hugger or bikinis are long gone, and the famous granny panties have taken over my lingerie drawer.  These days, it's all about comfort and I really don't care about ""cute"" in regards to my underwear anymore.  I was afraid that these would be too low cut for someone who has had her waistline expand to far larger than she would have had  nightmares about in her youth.I was entirely wrong.  For me, these are about ideal, as I don't have a wad of underwear extending above the waist of my pants.  I may not be as stylish as I once was, but at the same time, I have enough sense that I don't want my underwear hanging out of the waistband of my pants.The fabric is VERY thin and cool.  While some may find that a negative, I live in the South where it's usually very hot and humid.  I also do not do well with heat and overheat easily.  These are surprisingly light and cool--it's almost like you have forgotten to put your panties on, they are that comfortable.The waist band is narrow.  Far narrower than my usual preferred brand uses, it's closer to the waistband of my granddaughter's little girl panties.  I'm not sure about that yet.  It hasn't ever ""dug in"", but it still seems quite narrow.  I would probably prefer a wider band, but this still seems ""okay"" at least.  The cut of the panties seems to provide ""full coverage"" without creeping to become wannabe thongs or bagging so that you feel like  you are wearing a diaper.  The crotch is also of sufficient size that it fits well no matter what kind of movement you are indulging in.Overall, I do like these panties.  They are comfortable and wash well.  I'm not sure how they will be in terms of durability yet, but if they start fraying I will revise my review.  In the meantime, I think I may have found my new preferred ""granny panties"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOSXLW1ZBXXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JPAUQA#wasThisHelpful","RUOSXLW1ZBXXD","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When this pizza stone brush arrived on my doorstep, it was packed in a box that was about twice its length.  Before opening it, I'm questioning why anyone would make such a gigantic pizza stone brush.Thankfully, this is not 3 feet long.  It's a large brush, but not that large.  It's bigger than my old one though, which is not a bad thing.  This one also has a scraper blade at the end of the brush to make removal of baked on cheese a bit easier.  It has a loop to hang it, which is a much easier way to store it than by a drawer, as it would have to store diagonally in most drawers because of its length.Brushwise, the brushes are exactly like my old brush, and is a natural fiber.  They are stiff, and do the job well--scouring off bits of baked on dough, burned cornmeal, etc.  Unlike our original brush, this one didn't require us to put in a screw to fix things more firmly.  It's much better made, and costs roughly the same.  That definitely makes it a much better purchase than the one we bought before.The longer handle means that when I'm cleaning the stone and the oven is still hot, my arm is not being cooked.  For me, that's great, since that means that once the oven is cooled completely, it is ready to put away.  (Pizzaque--great oven for the  money, btw.)

"I got these to work with a iPhone 5 that my son in law uses.  He has hearing issues, but does not use a hearing aid.  He also likes music, mostly older rock and country, and needs to be able to actually hear conversations on his phone, which he depends on for his work.  He's not used headphones, bluetooth devices, or ear buds much in the past, plus he is a real devout cheapskate, so this was a new experience for him entirely.He loves these earphones.  They are comfortable, provide him with very clear audio whether it is music or a phone call, and he is heard well too. He was really impressed with how much better these earphones were compared to the cheap ones from dollar stores or that small town Mart. He actually admitted that there was a noticeable difference, which almost knocked me over to begin with.  (Yes, we have the classic stereotype mother-in-law/son-in-law relationship, which is to say we can conflict over the weather.)Believe me, if he admitted that they were good earphones when I was the one that gave them to him, they are really that good.I did get these with a promotional discount, which meant it was a reduced price or free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, which probably contributed to me being generous to my son in law.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this one is no different other than my test subject was my son in law.  If you use an iPhone or iPad, they are wonderful.

"I got these for my husband, who likes to use Skype on his tablet & phone, his cell phone, and a variety of programs on his laptop, as well as watch movies and listen to music.  In the name of marital peace, with our tastes being radically different, especially late at night, I thought these might spare us some growling about his movie or music.So, he was grinning ear to ear like a 5 year old on Christmas morning when I handed him this small package.  Best of all, these don't come in a ridiculously complex and large package.  (We have obtained some that were really ostentatious, as though we were about to access the crown jewels, not a pair of ear buds!)  He had them open without needing any tools in just a minute and immediately put them to work.He loves them.  His first comment was that they had better volume and sound than most ear buds do.  Considering that these are budget friendly earbuds at just under $12 right now, and we have earbuds that retail for $100 or more, that's a huge compliment!  He also protected them from possible use by me as though they were his most prized possession (okay, it was partly in jest, but he really doesn't want to give up this pair.)They are apparently very comfortable.  He's had them in his ears for some time without complaint, and if they weren't comfortable, I would have heard about it too.  Ear buds, while they may not be as comfortable for long term use or provide as good of an audio experience, are much more convenient to take with you than a pair of earphones.  They are also less obvious to wear when in public, when you may opt for using them for a phone call or to pass the time waiting for an appointment by listening to music or watching a video.While I purchased these with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, these are well worth the full purchase price too.  It's an excellent pair of ear buds for the money, making them a good choice for a gift too.  They would be ideal for teens and young adults, as well as older adults such as ourselves.

"I got this in purple, and I liked it.  I put it on our grand dog, and while it wasn't a great fit, I thought it was a workable fit.  Unfortunately, she liked it too, but she liked to chew on it.Within thirty minutes, it was completely in shreds.  Literally nothing more than a few inches long was left of the harness.So, I can't say that it would actually secure a dog for walking on a leash, especially a youngster that is prone to chewing.  I certainly do not suggest letting the dog get out of your line of sight with it on--we should have gotten suspicious when she was  quiet for a bit.The harness has no adjustments for the neck, which meant the harness we bought (size large) was a bit too loose.  She couldn't wiggle forward out of it, but apparently, she could turn around and start chewing in it.  It didn't take long for her to destroy it beyond any possibility of repairing it either.  Granted, she is a 9 month old puppy (dachshund mix), and very agile but she isn't the most houdini-like of dogs either--I have known worse.

"Like a lot of people, as I hit middle age, I was also stricken with a long list of health problems.  Unfortunately, they also interfere with getting a good night's sleep, which is the first line of defense to reduce puffiness and lines around the eyes.

"Skin care products are an important part of looking as youthful as possible, and there are an incredibly diverse selection of products that promise to be the next best thing to the fountain of youth.  It's really hard to decide what is best for your skin from that very confusing array of products, whether you are standing in the beauty products aisle at a department store or searching online.In my case, I was searching for something to help my skin regain its smooth texture more than anything, as it had become somewhat coarse feeling.  Wrinkles are actually the least of it, my face just felt more like a flat tire than anything resembling ""youthful"".  To make it even worse, my husband has a baby face, and without his usual beard, looks like he's about to finish puberty.  It made me feel that I looked even older standing beside him, and it wasn't helped with the frequent assumptions by clerks that he was my son rather than my husband.  (Grrrrrrrrrr, as if I needed THAT, right?)At the same time, I am smart enough to know that skin care products are not going to create a miracle.  I have a lot of scar tissue on my face, which I was told long ago would cause me to age faster.  (I highly recommend seat belts and avoiding exiting a vehicle via the windshield.  It really does put a damper on your day.)  I don't have a lot of wrinkles, beyond a few laugh lines around my eyes and mouth.  I also have some health problems that contribute to poor skin texture and dry skin.  It also takes time for these skin care products to start improving your appearance.I have been using this for a week.  While it isn't the fountain of youth and it can't magically erase scarring, my face does seem noticeably smoother without making it feel oily or causing a post-menopausal acne outbreak.  (That is some kind of cruel joke.  I battle it more now than I ever did as a teen!)  It's added just a few minutes to my daily routine.  As for my laugh lines, it hasn't erased them, but they aren't my big ""worries"" either.  I was much more looking for something to help my skin texture, and this seems to be doing the trick.I did purchase this with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and this one is no different.  I really do think this product is improving my overall skin texture on my face without any negative effects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TD5MZ9TORHWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5NGPE#wasThisHelpful","R1TD5MZ9TORHWO","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never used a ScanNCut before, although I had used a Cricut machine at work several years ago.  That means my only comparison is to the Cricut machine as it was then--I don't know if they work the same way now.With that said, this ScanNCut was leaps and bounds ahead of the Cricut.  I had found the Cricut so frustrating and expensive to use that I had never been interested in owning one myself.  For every design, you had to buy another expensive cartridge, which would have just a handful of patterns you were actually interested in, with a lot of things that you were never going to use.  In addition to these expensive purchases of cartridges, there was also the expense of blades and sticky mats that seemed to need replacing far too often for the price.  The final issue with those Cricuts was that there was an immense amount of paper waste because of how it would lay out patterns on the mat.  It was just a very limited set of software instructions.I have used the Brother far less so far--it does take a bit of time and effort to learn how to use a tool like this effectively.  It's also much more complex than many crafting tools or even that older Cricut ever was.  It has a LOT of features that simply blow away the older cutter too, from the ability to scan a design to being able to create your own design from scratch.After spending the equivalent of a day with the machine, I'm even more excited about the possibilities for creative crafting and sewing it offers.  I'm already contemplating some reverse applique projects for a quilt using this machine's abilities to cut fabric (even though I have not tried cutting fabric with it yet!)  For paper crafting, whether doing a poster for a kid's school project or making a sign for a more adult crowd, it's a fantastic asset as well.I can really see this machine in the classroom (or the teacher's home) for using to create some visually impressive designs for bulletin boards and wall decorations too.  I'm not a teacher, but I had a number of relatives who were, and I know how excited they would have been to have a tool like this at their disposal.Another big asset, especially for people such as teachers who may want to bring a machine like this to and from school for projects, is that it is not a massive piece of equipment.  I no longer work where I was using the old Cricut cutter, but my memory has it being far bigger than this one is.  That's always a plus for others such as myself as well--I live in a house, but it is a fairly small one, and my crafting/sewing space does double duty.  That means I have to put away materials and equipment between uses, and having efficiently sized machines really goes a long ways towards making that easier.I'm far from an expert, and wouldn't even call myself a somewhat experienced novice at using this machine yet.  I'm still at the ""playing"" stage, learning about its features and how to use them.  In other words, I'm at the same place that most buyers will be when they purchase this machine, especially if they have not owned a ScanNCut before.  Just don't expect to become an instant expert and be prepared to spend time with your owner's manual, the Brother website, the ScanNCut, and making some simple test projects as you learn how to use it.  If  you expect to sit down and instantly be creating pieces that have the entire PTA drooling over your creativity, you may be setting yourself up for some frustration and irritation.  I highly recommend my route--brew a pot of my favorite tea, and sit down with the machine and learn about it, with the hopes that it will be my best friend by the time the holiday season is here.  (I do have some big plans for some paper ornaments for the holidays.)  If I haven't mastered it by this holiday season, well, there is always next year, right?  Maybe I'm too old to set impossible time frames for this friendship, and maybe I'm just old enough that I realize that it takes a bit of time to acquire the skills I want.Overall, I can see this machine as being a very useful tool for a long list of people.  I can see it becoming a favorite crafting tool in many families too.  It offers a host of possibilities for very professional looking results whether you are working on a 4H project or a big civic one, as well as for making a lot of memories or even just embellishing scrap books.It isn't a cheap tool, but despite the costs, it can deliver some really impressive results.  It will have ongoing expenses, from replacing cutting blades and mats to purchasing the paper or fabric you want to make your cut-outs out of.  Being ""older"", this machine replaces very time consuming tasks of cutting things out with an Exacto knife.  A single sheet of paper, using that old fashioned hand method, could easily consume all day, only to have it ruined with a slip of the knife as  you neared completion.  (I know all too well how that goes, since Murphy's Law seems to be my personal law.)  This will reduce that type of effort to a mere few minutes, and even if something tears and is ruined for its intended use (it can happen when you are removing the paper from the mat after cutting)  it doesn't take all that long to have the machine cut out a second one.So far, I'm in love, even if that love affair is in the early stages yet.  I'm already budgeting to allow the mats and knives to be replaced as needed.  That is about the only negative to this, but it is an unavoidable one.  I'm going to need a lot more ""fancy"" paper too!If you enjoy paper crafting of any sort or sew decoratively either by embellishing garments or quilting projects, I can imagine a long list of justifications to get this machine.  If you are a DIY grandma sort (that's me!) then this offers a lot of opportunity to bond with your grandchildren as you impress them with your technical abilities.  (All of those learning curve ""oops"" bits and pieces, placed in a large pencil box, can become a source of fascinating art projects with a glue stick and some construction paper at the kitchen table too.  Kids can have a lot of fun with those brightly colored errors, whether they are letters, numbers, or some other shape.)As the ScanNCut & I become friends, I'm sure I'll have further updates to add to this review and maybe even a few hints.  My only suggestion right now is to simply take your time at creating that relationship for yourself, and believe me, when you have one of these machines on your crafting table at home, you are going to wonder how you ever got by without it!  If you are on the fence about buying it, take the plunge and just get it.  You really won't regret it.  As for the other machine from Cricut, unless they have done a LOT of improvements, it doesn't even compare.  (I really was never interested in owning one of those myself, as I regarded it as a money vampire that had too many limitations.)If you are looking for the ultimate gift for your crafting spouse (yes, you husbands out there!) this is one that will surely get you on her good side a lot further than buying her a vacuum cleaner or new steam cleaner.  It's also a lot more fun than a piece of jewelry that rarely gets worn because you rarely go anywhere dressed up or a piece of fancy lingerie that spends its time in the bottom of the dresser drawer.  You also won't get on her bad side because you bought the wrong size/color!  It would also make a fantastic family gift, making holiday, school and art projects much more impressive than mere construction paper and scissors ever will.  I know I'm going to have my adult daughter drooling over mine and asking to borrow it, forcing me to guard it jealously.If you are looking for additional items to accompany it, whether it is a planned purchase or a gift, I would suggest adding some DCWV Cardstock Stack, Match Makers Brights, 58 Sheets, 12 x 12 inches, a couple of different Pacon Foam Board, 20""X30"", Assorted Colors, 10 Boards, some Crayola 0.29-Ounce Glue Sticks, 12 per Box, and you have the makings of your learning curve projects.  Additional papers to offer more flexibility or geared towards individual tastes, would also come in handy, as would card stock to create your own greeting cards.  Of course, with kids, adding an assortment of Glitter Assortment 12 - 3/4 0z. Bottles is always going to win you some ""cool"" points (just don't forget the traditional glue, as well as inexpensive paper plates to help confine it.)  This cutting machine, combined with some basic supplies, would go a long ways towards keeping kids entertained and occupied with holiday projects as the weather turns cold and everyone is confined indoors more.  It can also help create new family traditions, as the homemade projects become treasured heirloom decorations for your tree or cards to enthrall relatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCAKOMB70FGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EE7UZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1DCAKOMB70FGD","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pillow case is crisp and cool, snow white, and has an end that folds over to neatly encase your pillow.  That was another feature I was unfamiliar with, as standard American linens typically just have the sack-like designed pillow cases.  I put it on my favorite feather-down king size pillow, and despite the overstuffed nature of the pillow, there is more than enough room to easily slide the case on and fold over the end to enclose it, much like an envelope would.With a 400 thread count, most cotton or cotton-poly pillow cases would feel somewhat coarse.  This is as smooth as microfiber or very high thread count linens, despite the much lower cost.  I was really impressed with that!  It just has a cool, crisp feel to it.Sleeping on it is a dream.  I hope it launders as well as it sleeps, but if it doesn't wear well, I'll update the review.I did purchase this pillowcase with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a very simple and plain magnetized bar to hold your knives.  It makes it easy to prevent accidental cuts as well as dulling of your expensive knives.  They are in plain sight for easy identification of which one you want (or which one is not where its supposed to be!)  That's the in-use parts.I wanted to switch from a knife box mounted on the wall to this type, which is typically what is used in professional kitchens.  It simply speeds up the process of getting the right knife, as well as immediately identifying which knives are present and accounted for.  I had used a knife box mounted high on the wall the entire time that I was raising my kids to keep the blades out of their reach, but larger knives always protruded out of the bottom of the box and each knife had to be identified by the handle.  This is MUCH more convenient.Now for all of those not so DIYers out there that like directions, you won't find THOSE in this package.  The most direction related material is where it's printed on the box ""mounting screws included.""  It comes with two rather puny screws and equally puny anchors.  If your walls are like ours, and formed from drywall, you might want to take a trip to the hardware store for something more substantial.  The last thing I wanted to have happen was for me to reach for a knife on the bar, and have the entire bar, along with ALL of the knives, come tumbling down.  For a buck or so, save yourself the nightmare and potential injury.  Make yourself a template by laying a strip or sheet of paper over the back of the bar, marking where the mounting holes are in the bar.  Use that template to put the screws in the wall, ensuring that you have the bar where you want it and straight.  I actually just taped the template on the wall to get my placement right, then tore the paper away after the screws were put into place.  Slide the bar over the screws, with the large end downward, and gravity will keep the screws in the narrow portion of the mounting holes.The bar actually has fairly good magnetic strength and seems to hold the knives securely.  Even so, I'd really suggest NOT putting it where a falling knife is going to land on someone's foot (or a short person's little head).  Even with a good grip, accidents can and do happen.  Mine is mounted on the wall above my counter, so a fall is just a foot or so to the counter.  So far, nothing looks like its going to happen anytime soon in regards to falling knives.Overall, it would be a five star item if it included decent screws/anchors and directions.  Maybe that's petty, but I really hate having to run down to that big box store for 2 screws and 2 anchors.  It's also something that even the most inept DIYer should be able to mount without help-if they had directions.  On the flipside of that direction issue, maybe its better to have no directions than to have badly auto-translated directions that make no sense and are more confusing than anything.A magnetic knife holder is one of the sleekest and nicest features for a wannabe gourmet kitchen.  It's simple design doesn't clash with anything and goes with just about any style of kitchen decor too.  My only concern is that some stainless steel isn't so stainless, and in our hot & humid South conditions, start to rust.  If that fate strikes, I'll update my review.  Outside of that, I'm expecting this to literally last a lifetime.  It certainly has enough heft that it SHOULD last that long!I did purchase this with a promotional discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.  Since all of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, this one is no different.  I really DO like this, and would have to recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOAU9R2O7EAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01776UX8I#wasThisHelpful","R1UOAU9R2O7EAH","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking a prescription thyroid medication for about five months now.  It seems that a number of members of our family have been diagnosed with sluggish thyroids in the past few years, resulting in most of us now being medicated.  Since things like always being fatigued, dry skin/hair, etc. are not exactly thrilling symptoms to endure, I wanted to  minimize the impact that it had on my life.  It is also taking the doctor some time to get the dosage of my medication adjusted just right for optimum health.If you have ever taken the medication, you know how quickly it starts to dissolve and how foul it tastes.  At the same time, I didn't want to mess around and make things worse, so I asked my doctor about this supplement.  While he was very dubious that it would eliminate the need for medication, he also did not see it as potentially harmful in any way, and suggested the ""maintenance"" dosage in combination with my regular medication.  Using it in this way, he felt that it would provide me with the nutritional benefits without causing any potential problems.It's not a miracle cure, whether or not your health care professional approves of OTC supplements or not.  At the same time, my dose of medication has been steadily climbing without ever reaching the levels he wants them at, so if this helps, I'm all for it.  On the short term, which is far from clinical trial evidence, I DO feel a bit more energetic, less irritable, and my scaly skin seems to be improving.  As for hair loss, I'm still losing more hair than I would like, and that is unlikely to stop until the doses of my medication are optimized.  Nutritionally, that takes some time as well.  Obviously, this could also be a result of the increased dose of medication and we have no way of really knowing.  All I can say is that if it helps a little bit, it's worthwhile in my book.  Just don't toss out your medication if you are being medicated for hypothyroidism, and do check with your doctor--this is not going to be a cure by any means.  It does provide the necessary nutrition to allow your thyroid to function properly though, along with a common sense diet.I did purchase this supplement with a promotional discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.

"This watch is drop dead gorgeous, in a manly way, of course.  It's got some serious heft to it--no lightweight, the heft alone just makes you think ""quality"" when you pick up the watch.It made my day, in a cheeky sort of way, to present this to my husband and watch his reaction.  He loves watches, and I had given him a sturdy wear-around-the-house watch for his birthday in fluorescent yellow.  While he likes the everyday watch, it's definitely not something to wear in dressier situations though.This one is.  It's functional, beautiful, very gift-worthy, and not overly glitzy either.  If you are looking for a watch that will fit a large (maybe even massive) wrist without looking foolish or having to replace the band, this watch is also your friend.  On my husband's wrist, which I would consider in the ""average"" range (he's average build, just over 6' tall) the watch face itself is very substantial.  That translates to nearly as wide as the top of his wrist.  The band itself will have to be adjusted down to fit him, it's honestly that large.  For guys with beefier arms, this would be a huge plus.  However, if you are the smaller framed or ""geekier"" build, this watch might simply be too large and have far too much heft to suit you.  It definitely is too much watch for a teen's wrist.We'd never bought an Invicta watch before.  It comes in a very nice gift worthy box, with a thick owner's manual, as well as an invitation to buy an expanded warranty for the watch.  There was even some sort of a membership card with space to write in the date of purchase.  Invicta is proud of the watch they produce, and hopefully that also equates to superior workmanship and customer service.As for price, these aren't cheap watches, and they certainly don't look cheap either. Amazon's price (currently under $100) is an attractive price for a ""nice"" watch without breaking the bank.  Most men would be very happy with this, whether they purchase it for themselves or receive it as a gift from their parents, spouse, or even kids.  Speaking as the wife/mother/grandmother/aunt of potential recipients, this is a watch that I would be very pleased to gift to someone.  (In its box, it would even be fairly simple to wrap, even if you are as paper-and-tape challenged as I am.)  For the high rollers who have $1K watches for dress, this would be one that was very suitable for wearing to the office too.  It won't clash with your suit, whether it is a rented tux, department store special, or a semi-custom tailored one.  It will go just as well with your golf shoes, polo shirt, & trousers for a round of golf with your dad or brother in law.  While I cannot imagine my husband wearing it while snorkeling or water skiing, it is water resistant to 330 feet, far deeper than I would personally plan on diving anyhow!The only reason I can potentially see anyone NOT liking this watch would be those with small wrists or those who cringe at the price.  For the price-cringers, consider that we bought about six watches at $10-30 each over a period of about a year.  Each had to be replaced when they failed, for one reason or another.  That easily adds up, and we spent from $60-180 over the past year for garbage watches.  That makes the price on this watch a whole lot more attractive and budget wise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMWNMR3KNNS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKP5O#wasThisHelpful","R3EMWNMR3KNNS0","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Aeropress Aerobie AeroPress Coffee Maker with Tote Bag coffee, and with recent kitchen renovations, our coffee pots have been packed up for the time being.  My husband thinks the Aeropress is ""too complicated"" to use, requiring wifely assistance for each cup of coffee.  In the name of restoring domestic bliss, enter the Joyful Java Collapsible Silicone Pour Over Coffee Maker.We have had pour over coffee makers before, and used them both at home and while camping.  This works on the same principle, but unlike previous models we have owned (like Melitta Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer black this one is collapsible, which translates to takes up a whole lot less space, whether we are talking about a cupboard or a backpack.  Combined with our cordless electric kettle, we now have a coffeemaker that my husband feels comfortable using.  You simply put the filter in, add your ground coffee, and pour the hot water in.  With our over-sized mugs, it does require multiple additions of hot water to achieve a full mug, but that's still relatively low-tech.  Presto, we have a hubby who can make his own cup of coffee!  (I tease him with the ditty ""I'm-A-Big-Kid-Now"" from Pull Ups.  Dirty trick, but funny!)Super simple, compact for storing or traveling with, the only ""negative"" is that single serve coffee makers typically use more ground coffee per cup than making a full carafe.  The plus is that nobody ever has to drink that last cup of burnt tasting sludge to empty a pot.  (Don't you HATE that?)This little cutie is really convenient, even coming with its own little carabiner to make it easy to find in a backpack (or to hang it from a thermal mug).  For a great gift for a traveling coffee drinker, pair this with a hand operated little coffee mill, a mug, and a portable kettle, add a bag of some gourmet beans and you will have the PERFECT gift for your coffee drinking buddy.For the ones out there that are as frugal as I am, the smaller cone filters that fit this coffee maker are more expensive, as well as harder to find.  You can buy the larger size more easily, and they typically cost a lot less per filter than the small ones, but the large works just as well.  If you need the neater look, they can be trimmed to fit, but I never bother.  The extra just makes it easier to toss the whole thing into the compost!  I have also been known to use a regular round filter and just fold it to fit, add my coffee, and brew away (see the photo--it does work just fine.)This is fantastic for those occasions when you have a power outage, go camping, decide to live off grid, or just want one cup of coffee without spending a fortune.  I've owned just about every model of single serve coffee maker out there (Including Keurig and Tassimo) and this does just as good while costing a mere fraction per cup compared to those fancy coffee makers.  Without parts to break, it will also outlast all of those expensive machines too.  It also stores compactly when not in use, whether it's hanging on a peg, in a drawer, in the cupboard, or hanging out with your mess kit in your camping gear.I did purchase this with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always honest and unbiased, and this one is no different.

"I really LIKE tenderized meat for making a number of dishes.  However, I don't like having it processed elsewhere--the more meat is handled, the more points there are for contamination.  Granted, I could do like my mother did, and beat it myself, but maybe I'm just lazy.  I hated the mess, noise, and time it consumed.This is three rows of angular blades, not the round pin style, and they are pushed through the meat cutlet by pressing down on the top bar, which slides the blades through the perforated base and into your meat.  They are razor sharp, and if you use a wood cutting board with your raw meats, it will seriously mark them up.  I use the more easily sterilized white poly cutting boards with raw meats, and when they become too seriously rough from knives, etc., they are replaced.  (Save your wood ones for safer bread & veggie cutting!)  This tenderizer is substantial enough in size to quickly work through enough meat for a recipe/meal.  The blades are substantial enough in size that they work great at pushing a dry rub, minced garlic, etc. right into the meat.  I've tried it on cuts as thick as 1"", and it works efficiently with the thicker cuts as well.  I really LOVE the lack of spatter mess compared to pounding meat.This is a great answer to  making a hated task easier as well as promoting some additional recipe tweaks.  Unlike pounding meat (no beating of meat jokes please!) this isn't going to make your cutlets thinner, but it is going to tenderize them.  This tenderizer also does not have the spattering effect of pounding meat with the hammer style tenderizers. Another feature I really like is that  I can smear the meat's surface with seasonings of choice (try coating your beef cutlets with minced fresh garlic and black pepper) and these gazillion blades will literally stab it through the entire cutlet.  Talk about perfecting a true chicken fried steak!  Everything comes out fork tender, whether it is beef, chicken, pork, or turkey.The tenderizer cleans up reasonably easy, just don't let anyone interrupt you long enough for meat residue to start to dry and cling to the blades or it can get tougher.  I immediately clean the blades by disassembling it and washing with hot soapy water, let them air dry thoroughly, and then it stores neatly in its guard.  It's safe to store in a drawer too, as the case protects my fingers from being cut when fumbling around for whichever gadget I'm searching for.  I'm not sure it is dishwasher safe--our kitchen is being renovated and we're doing dishes the old fashioned way until its completed.Overall, I couldn't be happier.  This inexpensive gadget saves a lot of money over buying substandard cuts of meat that have been pre-tenderized at the store, as well as giving me more flexibility about what kind of meat I use.  (Nobody sells tenderized turkey breast or chicken thigh cutlets!)  I did purchase this tenderizer with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased review, and I really DO love this gadget.  It would have been a five star gadget but the included guard arrived with hairline cracks in it, despite the box being undamaged.  Over time, I suspect that it will break long before the blades themselves wear out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25C3ES11U3MHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DBXETS#wasThisHelpful","R25C3ES11U3MHU","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eukanuba dog foods are one of my ""trusted"" brands.  They consistently have high quality foods.  However, on my fixed income, it usually doesn't run to this particular food.  However, I do have a beloved and very senior dog who has been failing fast over the past year.  Sometimes, she isn't as interested in eating as she used to be (she was always a chow hound in her youth).She still has a great coat, despite her age, and this time of year is an important one for her, as she is growing in her normally very plush winter coat.  We haven't been using this food long enough for its effects to show yet (it takes a while to affect the coat) but she seems to like this food better than the various offerings I'd tried with her lately.  It also doesn't seem to be difficult for her to chew, as many older dogs have dental issues, and she is no different.No diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, etc. occurred as we introduced her to this food either.  (She normally has a cast iron stomach, but some things have not agreed with her the past year or so.)  My past experiences with Eukanuba foods have never shown their foods to be inclined to cause stomach upsets anyhow.I'm pleased with the food, even though I know that it doesn't include any water from the Fountain of Youth.  (Heck if it did, people would be chowing down on the stuff.)  I feel better about her eating this food though, as we have a long history together (she's a big girl and about to turn 14).

"My husband has giant feet, size 14 shoes.  He also has one foot that is somewhat atrophied, and he limps.  That means his shoes take a beating, cost a fortune, and he frequently complains about foot discomfort, as well as having trouble with stumbling.  Insoles, one would think, would be the last of his worries, or potential solutions.That was totally wrong.He is in love with these insoles.  He tried them out in a cheap pair of athletic shoes, the one thing that never works that well for him.  It was an immediate and instant improvement in the shoes' fit and comfort, on both the good and bad feet.  He really likes these insoles, and for the price, even if they have to be replaced every 3-6 months, it may extend the life of his shoes/boots by as much as 12 months while remaining comfortable.  Considering that a ""cheap"" pair of shoes is going to be at least $50 for him, and decent ones are as much as $200, that is saving a lot of money.We haven't had these insoles long enough to know how well they are going to last yet, but typically other brands have lasted the 90-180 days, depending on the brand and how much he wore the shoes they were in.  These insoles also fit his shoes perfectly (one time that having a size 14 shoe was an advantage?) with no gaps or trimming.  I'm ecstatic, he's happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZQWB0413ZJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYE2O9S#wasThisHelpful","R1WZQWB0413ZJU","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a VERY sturdy crate for its size, yet remaining an easy-to-fold design.  Despite the description indicating it is a single door model, the one I received has two doors, giving you the option of using either the end or side as your favored door.  With the size and dimensions of this crate, it is taller than I had anticipated, and while that isn't necessary for the chihuahua this crate is intended for, it might be very advantageous if it is intended for something other than a canine inside.  (Such as large birds, etc., although the plastic crate won't work with parrots or macaws for long.)I was really impressed with how sturdy the crate was.  They would also stack well, and are strong enough to be stacked several high even with occupants inside.  Overall, they are a very versatile crate, capable of far more difficult applications than housing a small dog for road trips.  It's great for that, however, and folds for easy storage when not in use.  Our chihuahua is a rescue dog, and doesn't particularly enjoy road trips unless he is in a nice, safe, crate.  Since he loves the destination part of a road trip, such as the campground, a sturdy crate keeps him safe on the road, as well as when we're not directly supervising him in a campground.  This crate offers much better views and ventilation than an airline crate, and stores much more compactly when not in use.  It's also a LOT easier to securely attach a ""Lix-it"" bottle to (our dogs' preferred crate drink method) compared to a small airline style crate.While I did purchase this crate with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, this is a good value even at full price.  I fully expect the crate to outlive our far from young chihuahua and undoubtedly host another rescue small dog in the future.  I am impressed with this crate enough that I may consider replacing some of our other crates with this brand in the future, which is saying a lot.  (We have multiple rescue dogs in our household, and crates maintain peace, as well as promote housebreaking ASAP.)  All of my reviews are always my honest and unbiased opinion, and its rare for anything to be as impressive as this crate is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLY0NTOJ0PTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YU4PYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLY0NTOJ0PTL","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this just seemed a lot different than the usual undergarment for smoothing under your clothing.  The edges of the shoulders are as though they were woven that way rather than finished with a seam.  My first reaction was that it seemed cheap and unfinished, but it has changed.It really is a sleek ""smoother"" for an undergarment, nearly vanishing under your clothing for a much smoother appearance even under the finest fabrics.  However, as with any shapewear, it does flatten the breasts, which is going to upset most women, while those who are well endowed may find that a plus, allowing for a smoother fit of garments through the bust than they would normally have.  Personally, I prefer to not have buttons straining through the bust.This isn't a miracle garment, and it's not one of those things that all women will love.  However, it does have its place in many women's wardrobes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMIN1Y9GK6CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZBPN56#wasThisHelpful","R1GMIN1Y9GK6CG","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Snoring is a family trait in our family, and while it doesn't bother those of us that do it, it does bother our partners.  I thought I would try this solution.It was a dismal failure for me.  I tried it on, and it barely fit my head.  I don't have an unusually large head, and don't even wear a particularly large hat size, so I was surprised to have this barely velcro together enough to stay put, but only when uncomfortably tight.  It's so tight that there is no room for my ears to protrude through the side slits, as they are pulled very narrow.  I am certain that it will not fit my husband's head either, as his head is larger than mine.  (So are his ears, come to think of it.)I'm not sure who modeled the head this is shown on, but the head must be small.  As it is, it's so tight that it would be impossible to fall asleep with it on.  I have no idea if I would snore with it on, but suspect that no one could snore with it on, largely because the discomfort would ensure they did not sleep.I did purchase this with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.UPDATE: I gave the chin strap to my adult daughter, who is much more petite.  On her smaller head, it did fit properly, and it also helped reduce her snoring, and as a side effect, it also reduced the drying of her mouth and lips from sleeping with her mouth open.  I changed the review to a four star review as a result instead of a one star, because it should be sized to fit a wider range of heads.  So if it fits, it does really help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHQI6RFFRWY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F4MJS6#wasThisHelpful","RIHQI6RFFRWY3","A1BKJNAWJT2TG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BKJNAWJT2TG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This beard butter is like a heavy duty beard hair treatment.  I'd gotten my husband some beard oil, and while it did sooth his skin under the beard, it didn't make a huge amount of difference.  This stuff is tougher stuff, apparently.  It's harder to work into his beard and down to the skin, but it also is easier to avoid using too much, as I did not like the smell of the beard oil he was using at all.My husband has eczema on his face and scalp, and it's part of the reason that he has a beard, as daily shaving really irritates his skin and increases the severity of the break outs.  At the same time, periodically, he has to shave off his beard to really deal with the break outs.  Nobody likes having giant chunks of dried skin in their beard, especially wives of the ones with the beards.  (Can we say yuck?)  This isn't a miracle cure, but we didn't expect one (all the doctors over the years haven't done anything for it any better)  but it does help sooth and minimize the issues.  It also does leave his beard a bit softer and just as shiny as usual (he has very shiny hair and beard naturally).  This is better than the oil because of its firmer texture and ease of use.I did buy this beard butter with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"The system really is designed for an IPhone, but does work w Google on my tablet. In order to get FULL use, you'd need Apple products designed to measure blood pressure, activity trackers and a pulse oximeter. (None of which I have).Also - the scale and tablet or phone have to be in fairly close proximity to the wireless server (modem, in my case) in order to sync. The scale will tell me my weight and body fat % in the bathroom. But the bathroom is too far away from our modem to sync. I bring the scale into the office, stand on it there, and then am able to sync it. It doesn't work to stand on it in the office and then bring it into the office and try and sync. I have to stand on it in the office. Once I sync it, it gives a list of  body fat, lean mass, body water, muscle mass, DCI(daily caloric intake nec to maintain your current weight), bone mass and VFR(?).  Then you can chg screens to see the trend for each of those measurement. Ex - even tho the scale says I've gained weight, it also shows that my body fat is trending downwards, my water % is almost a straight line and my muscle mass has a very slight tilt upwards. Very cool. My problem is that the office floor is not level, it has a slight tilt downwards (it was a garage). I suppose if you are looking at trends, not actual numbers it's ok. During set-up it was a little tricky to set up.It took 4 trys putting in the modem's password before the scale recognized it. I wanted to do a little 'Hooray' jump when i finally got. For some one like me, who is not completely 'plugged in', the set-up was a little frustrating. the directions pretty much assume you know how to do this already. The same goes for the set-up on the tablet. There are 2 iHealth apps on Google, but only the newer one works. I think for someone who has and is familiar with Apple products, it'll be no problem.

"It has that crinkle sound that some bags marketed for cats have.  It is soft and scrunchable.  I have four cats, one of whom hunts :(. Despite my wishes.  And she thinks this thing is something she needs to kill.  She pounces on it, and its crunches up which makes it crinkle, which surprises her, so she pounces again.  I love anything that keeps my four cats busy and this is looking like a real winner.  It is soft on both sides, so on a wood, tile or other hard floor it slips all over the place, which means the cat has to ""chase"" it around.  I will have to get more, as my little huntress does not like to share toys with her sisters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R12ESNVAYUQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V408WVE#wasThisHelpful","R3R12ESNVAYUQ8","A10M2MLE2R0L6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10M2MLE2R0L6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Still searching for good flavor enhanced water.  This tastes primarily like club soda, with a hint of flavoring.  I'm good with the hint of flavoring, but I don't like the club soda taste.  This is a personal taste issue.  I didn't taste any fake sugars, but if they are in the bottle they might have been masked by the club soda taste.

"I'm a fan of Epson WorkForce printers: I've had a few around the home, office and such in the past decade, and they tend to work fabulously, are easy to set up and use, and tend to have great improvements from one mid to higher end model to the next mid to higher end model. That's why this EcoTank wireless was a bit of a surprise: for the price, it's just ok. Here's why:The PROS: it's super easy to set up. It takes 15-30 minutes to set up and get the ink and everything all ready. That's not the shortest time ever, but with the big new cool tanks, it's not surprising that it takes a little extra time. WiFi easy to set up, printer easy to un-box, plug in, remove all tape and bits, and then move forward to getting all the ink tanks and print test pages takes the longest. I think it's pretty AWESOME that it is an all-in-one printer with up to 2 years of ink included. That's pretty awesome in my book. But will it really last that long? Only time will tell. An all-in-one, that feature I love. The decent amount of paper it holds, the capabilities overall, the 2 sided printing, all great in a smaller (mid sized) home office all in one.The CONS: no idea how the eco tank will unfold since only time will tell (not really a negative, just an uncertainty). It's entirely lacking in SD or other card readers, and it lacks a color LCD screen: not a necessity, but it sure is a nice feature to be able to print straight from camera card for a printer that is in this cost bracket. I was a little thrown by the ink level indicators: usually my printers tell my computer how much ink is left (are they always accurate, that's another story) but didn't see that on this one. The price seems a tad high for the features included/excluded.The Epson WorkForce EcoTank wireless color printer, well, overall it's a solid, nice all-in-one printer for personal use/home office.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DY0EMKRY4JNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFSM#wasThisHelpful","R1DY0EMKRY4JNU","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is basically a really cute play mat for little babbies! Yes, it can double as a small blankie in a pinch, but it's meant for softening flooring when you're on the go and at home, etc. It's VERY cute and it's well made, with lots of differing bits for interest and touch: very CUTE! I personally love the soft portion, it's really soft and loveable, comes nicely presented like a square blankie with a white ribbon tied around, and would make a cute baby shower gift. Slightly practical and slightly impractical, the higher-ish price point makes this more of a splurge then a necessity, but overall it's SO well made and so adorable, I would definitely recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1778PMZW0SYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V408WVE#wasThisHelpful","R1778PMZW0SYP","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Dove conditioner for curly, course hair is ok. It comes out very thick (good) and a yellow gray brown color (um, yuck). It layers in your hair very thick and when washed out, left my hair nice and soft. My problem was the smell: it's a bit overpowering for me, it could be just that it's not my favorite scent, and others might find it great smelling, but it was a turn-off for me. So much so, that I can't see myself using this again. My hair, which is brown, long, wavy with a bit of natural loose curl, was well-conditioned by this on day one. Smooth, the scent of the conditioner was more balanced once I washed it out. But usually I only wash my hair every other day, and by day two, my hair was a little on the dry side. That's not the case with my normal Pantene conditioner. I love Dove products, especially soap and body wash, but I've never had much luck with their shampoo/conditioner lines.

"Excellent external hard drive to add more gaming storage to your Xbox One or Xbox 360! I got this for our Xbox One, and it works fantastic: it quickly and easily plugs into the back of the game console (in the USB plugs) and does USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 (depending on your console), it takes a moment to format on your first plug in, but then it pretty much hangs in the back and while you still default save to your game console hard drive, this becomes a great external storage device for more saves or more needed storage!

"I love these Hefty Drawstring trash bags! At 30 gallons, it's a great big size, with easy drawstring ties and a bit of stretch, to get all your junk in here. The Extra Strong is just tied to the marketing name of Hefty, as I could not find that the plastic was thicker or higher grade than what I generally use for outside/big trash bags like this. That said, these trash bags take abuse pretty well and stay together nicely, and tie easily for removable and keeping stuff inside. I love the large size Mega Pack because these are SO useful for moving (pillows, couch cushions, covering hanging clothes, etc.), for trash, for outside trash (weeds, trimmed branches, etc.) and for general house use, it is always a good IDEA to have a LOT of these around: would definitely recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6OX3DQROQN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBGVMW4#wasThisHelpful","RY6OX3DQROQN9","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These print nicely and being interchangeable between inkjet and laser is a very good benefit (color inkjet and black laser). The value is also there for so many labels, and you can use these for your own small business product labels like I have (recommend you protect with a finishing spray like Krylon.

"I received the TeiKis stainless steel BBQ set and 3-in-1 grilling set from the manufacturer for review. One Word: ""Value"". I was a bit curious at first, what the quality of this stainless steel BBQ set would be for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the overall value of the bbq tools and case. First, it comes in a nice presentation carrying case, with all the tools well-strapped in place (not shifting or moving as you carry this around or in shipping): that's impressive considering everything that is included in this kit. All the BBQ utility tools are solid metal (stainless steel) and properly placed within the kit, so when you open the lid, it not only looks fantastic but it's also easy to find things when you need them. Some of the knives are held in place with velcro straps (to help reduce frustration at putting the kit back together and making sure all fits well) and to hold things where they belong. The tools work great on the BBQ grill: like any others, you'll want to clean them after, and they're gonna show a little wear & tear over time, but these are solid, well made tools for the grille. This would make an excellent gift or Father's Day gift for a man who seriously loves to barbeque: there may be some other great BBQ kits out there, but overall, I was impressed at the quality and the presentation, an exceptional BBQ set for your average Joe or Jane, most exceptional for the price: definitely recommend. And the 3-in-1 Grilling set? Well, the gloves are great, other than they could be a tiny bit longer, and the other included tools you definitely need and use: But the claws, OH the claws, the 2 BEAR CLAW MEAT HANDLERS are amazing. So great for picking up and turning big hunks of meat. Everything else in this set is practically a bonus :).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21NI3P8LU74J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5LE3JK#wasThisHelpful","R21NI3P8LU74J0","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this neckband headset free from the manufacturer for review. These headphones have come in REALLY handy lately when doing HANDS-FREE things around the house: moving the lawn, exercising (running), cleaning the garage, etc. These have become my primary headphones for hands free use, BECAUSE they are so lightweight, and they weight distribution is balanced well: the light weight of the headphones rests on my neck/shoulders (rather than my ears), and there are no cords to get caught on the various things around while doing things like mowing the lawn, so overall these headphones are great for hands-free work. There are a few things I wish I could change, that I hope they address in further product development, which are: trying to plug the headphones into the micro-USB port is a bit difficult. I recommend the port be moved to a more accessible area, or change to a wireless charging station solution (to recharge the headphones) - this would take these from great to awesome. I also wish these came in different colors, other than black, so were a little more sporty. Overall value for the price, at about $25 sale price, I'm a huge fan. At full retail, it would be too high price for the value/quality - definitely plan to get these on sale. Overall though, these NECKBAND hands-free headphones deliver on quality sound, great weight distribution, and no cords to get in the way while you're trying to use your hands and arms. Would recommend.In Conclusion, I am happy with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FEADMG98L0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7I5158#wasThisHelpful","R18FEADMG98L0K","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received Mr Rugged beard oil conditioner free from the manufacturer for review. Mr Rugged beard oil I found to be a fantastic product. You know that awkward in-between phase when full beard growth is not yet there, but you're trying to get there, or there is some scruffy that you don't want to shave just yet? Well, this beard oil conditioner is FANTASTIC for that because it makes the hair soft and smooth, and seems to reduce the itching significantly. A little amount seems to go a LONG way. And it helps to have a much smoother face for the benefit of your partner, less scratchy, less 'beard' burn; the smell is really quite nice, you don't need very much of the conditioner to get the result that you want, and the value for the price is hands down GREAT value. Definitely would recommend Mr Rugger beard products after this experience. Seriously helps get through that awkward beard growth phase and to smooth and maintain a great beard once you're there.

"We got the Serta Regular 9"" Stabl-Base Foundation for our QUEEN bed a few weeks ago and have been sleeping on it ever since. Our mattress is mid high-end IKEA mattress (foam and springs combo) and it's getting on to about 7 years old, and we were starting to think we might need to replace it soon (we used the high end slats from IKEA rather than a box spring before this), and we could not believe the DIFFERENCE!! We have been sleeping much better since we removed the slats and used this Serta Stabl foundation with our older IKEA Queen mattress: it's firmer, more comfortable, less lumpy, and both of us have said that we can't feel each other moving around as much as before! Add to that the quality of the wood, springs, and nice blue fabric cover, and we are sold: this Serta foundation has made a big difference in our sleep in the weeks that we have been using it so far: and an immediate difference like this, means that you can buy a good Serta Stabl Foundation and invest your money in the box spring that you can use for years and years, and then be able to use your mattress longer, makes this a great VALUE and definitely recommended item!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZ1TXO8V3YN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0THBW#wasThisHelpful","RWZ1TXO8V3YN7","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this bag free from the manufacturer for review. This is my first experience with an Avber Women's bag, and I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed. The bag came nicely protected in a large box with good packing material, and the bag itself came protected in a soft cloth case, protecting the bag from scratches, etc. - the bottom purse metal ""feet"" were each covered with a little piece of tape, protecting them, and the purse was filled with two pieces of packaging stuffing material, in order for the purse to keep it's shape nicely. The  synthetic leather is high quality and smooth, the bag reflects quality workmanship and attention to detail, and is design for both style and use. I LOVE the inside zipper pouches. The bag also zips along the top, and includes great long SHOULDER straps for easy carrying! It's actually a perfect style of purse for me: fashionable, quality, beautiful design, holds a lot, great shoulder straps, and the price is fantastic! I have a range of what I find affordable for everyday purses and this falls precisely within that range of affordability and great use.

"This is simply a fantastic vacuum - I want to give it 5 stars, but it needs a bit more tweaks in development before it's worthy of a 5 star rating. Read on to learn why this is a 4 star vacuum in my opinion. PROS: it works AMAZING. It has STRONG suction, pulling up a ridiculous amount of dirt, debris, fine pet dander, hair, etc. I am frankly quite impressed by how this vacuum does with suction and more importantly, maintaining suction over time. A HUGE fan of this vacuum for that reason. Another pro: the canister is easy to remove and empty, the filter is easy to replace and clean, the number of included attachments is GREAT, there are a few choices, they come on a nice stand/canister. It is SUPER easy to use, goes easily around and under almost any surface, works fantastic on WOOD floors and carpet and tile and vinyl, and I used this as a sort of wet dry vac for deep cleaning hardwood floors with the included Floor GENIE attachment, and it worked SO WELL! I LOVE this vacuum.The CONS (why I can't give it 5 stars) - it turns TOO easily. Basically this is because the vacuum is top heavy so the weight swivels quickly and easily from left to right, and seems to favor swiveling left - this is great but also annoying because it causes you to turn when you want to go straight. That just means it takes a bit of extra hand/arm coordination to move it around, although it self propels so NICELY that it almost cancels this out. But it IS a bit too top heavy, so it loses a star there. Also figuring out how to remove the vacuum from the included canister stand wasn't intuitive: even with a release bar and a button on the vacuum that says 'Lift Away' was still, honestly, a bit difficult to figure out that you needed to do BOTH things at once to remove the vacuum. But once you figure it out, no big deal.Seriously, this vacuum has AMAZING suction, and the 'True Pet' version comes with additional attachments and better filters than the regular Rotator Lift Away version, I would recommend the 'True Pet' version, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Shark vacuum. It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn close!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1WX7C32WOZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7R1FZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2R1WX7C32WOZA","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3M Ultra Clear Energy Saving Window film does its job WELL. We used it on a window in our office getting full sun for a good bit of the day, and can definitely tell in the results: it's cooler, seems definitely more energy efficient (current A/C works better), and still lets good sunlight in, THROUGH the tinting. It's quite time consuming to apply, and you need to follow the instructions to fully clean your window AND take your time and use the included tools in application. I recommend you take the time to really, really get all dust, dirt, hair, paint flecks, etc before trying to begin, and even save the application for a day when static is less likely (a bit of moisture in the air can be your friend when you apply this). It looks a bit dark until applied, but this stuff is great because it does what it says and gives you what you want; no, it's not going to magically make your window better (i.e. it won't make your window an energy efficient window), but it will IMPROVE the energy efficiency in a room where the sun heats up the room and you use a lot of energy for cooling. I would definitely recommend this!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3QNMRQ7N2K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","R2U3QNMRQ7N2K1","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kelty Tuck 22° sleeping bag, is awesome. Basically it's down to 22° weather, don't forget to use with the ground pad in order to keep your sleeping bag dry and working to it's optimal heat efficiency. This kept me plenty warm, and the ability to stick your feet out on warm nights? well that is awesome. Compresses well, reasonably lightweight. What I love about this sleeping bag, is the value for the price; this is a great sleeping bag for basic mountain back packing trips, scouting trips, hiking trips. It's probably a tiny too heavy and a little to non-compressible for extreme sporting. Otherwise the sleeping bag is fantastic and I would definitely recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OD0WY2B988G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFIR0#wasThisHelpful","R37OD0WY2B988G","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lifeproof Nuud case for iPad Air 2, is light weight, about half the weight of an OtterBox defender, covers your entire iPad other than screen, but is still very light weight in comparison to OtterBox. It provides good grip excellent, superior protection for your iPad, it is even waterproof up to 6+ feet. Not saying you should take this in the ocean, but if you have it around the pool side or you accidentally drop it in the tub, you might just have protected your very expensive Apple device. This even includes a faux iPad sized piece, that you can use to test the water proofness of the case before putting your actual iPad in it. Beware that once you put your iPad and it will be difficult to get out again in fact the company includes a tool to assist in this way. You will have to put together the case it comes in two pieces. For the reason alone of paying a reasonable price for a fantastic case, for protecting your very expensive Apple device, I would highly recommend this case. Button access is good but not perfect, as they could make some improvements on the fingerprint reader access, but this case is SO well done and provides superior protection without adding a lot of weight to your device, that I absolutely love it! This is seriously great and lightweight protection for your iPad, I would definitely recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EXKHX7ZXR79R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG9Q0C6#wasThisHelpful","R3EXKHX7ZXR79R","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These DII Elegant Lace curtains are nice - they are long, a pretty lace design, AND 100% polyester (hardly a surprise with the price, that this curtain set is poly). They are pretty, decently look and affordable for the price - they are NOT luxurious looking but they are not bad. The Pros: pretty curtains, nice and long, good set, really like these, not too heavy, not too light, have a decent stiffness and 'weight' to them. The Cons: the edges could be a bit more finished along the top and bottom, they are 100% polyester (most curtains are these days) which is better for NON ironing when you wash these, so overall I like these elegant lace curtains ok for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZS6OIANW7P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYE4G4#wasThisHelpful","R1HZS6OIANW7P3","A2L6QS8SVHT9RG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6QS8SVHT9RG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed is great so far - the grass seems to be coming up well for us, although we'll see if it lasts (could be dependent also on heat/weather/sun/watering).

A couple weeks in, it seems to be coming up and I'll update this if anything changes, but I like it thus far!

"Like the sauce, it's a good base to make your own good Italian meals: add some herbs, add some great cheese, add some freshly cut up vegetables and herbs (dice up some red pepper, or add some cooked ground beef), and you have a delicious meal ready quickly! These two sauces have great flavor, quite delicious, although I agree with other reviewers that the sugar content is higher than I would normally want: for that reason alone, I would tend to buy other, more healthy, more organically minded sauces as my base starter for a delicious dinner. If I went just on flavor, I really like these sauces and enjoyed the meals made with them, and maybe because I add so many other ingredients to this as a base, I can't taste the sweetness, it's just good Italian sauce.

"In this case, you are definitely getting what you pay for! This is an inexpensive, inclusive set that includes a plastic shower curtain, plastic shower curtain hanging shower hooks, a plastic soap dish, plastic soap dispense and plastic cup. It's a pretty basic mosaic design, and is great as a starter set for kids going to college, a little boys bathroom, or a bathroom starter set on a budget. You can't buy all these items separately for less than $30-$40 bucks generally, and this starter set is $18.99. For the price, you are purchasing a budget version starter set, until you can afford to replace with something better: the shower curtain is 'wash by hand' only, so something to keep in mind, but in an empty bathroom that just needs something until I can find something nicer, or for a kids bathroom to get a design going?

"While I'm not in love with this particular set of curlers, I like the base idea of this product, it just needs a lot of improvements:The Pros: I like the unique design, the way it stands up on end, it turns for easy access to the curlers, and no clips or pins are involved...I really love that the plastic rollers hardly touch the heat, so they don't really burn your hands much like other curlers: the soft rubbery material used underneath that does get hot, is reasonably easy not to touch too much while you are rolling: would love to see more of this material used in curler sets! The silicone (soft rubbery material) protects hair from heat, so is great, except in this case, there are just NOT enough curlers, period.The Cons: the 'I'm ready' light is pretty much non-existent...it supposed comes on red when you plug it in and goes off when ready...yeah, I never saw any sort of light, and had to keep guessing if it was hot enough or not. it's also a bit weird to get used to where/how the curlers are located so you can turn and use them...and you have no idea which are the large and which are the medium: that should be labeled. But for me, the worst two cons are, I have thick, long hair, and there is no way that there are enough curlers in here to cover all my hair: I tried and failed. and if I put more hair into each curler, then basically the curlers won't 'snap' shut and they just start falling down. Which brings me to my other con: it's neat, but even using a small piece of hair, my hair fell down way too easily, which means that the hot curlers are down on my forehead and hot, which I really didn't like. Overall, a neat product idea that could use further development, but I wouldn't recommend it...even those who had thinner hair said that it doesn't work well for them either.

I am really not all that sure, I knocked a star off because my eye mask doesn't match the picture. The inner lining is the silky pink as pictured but the outer part of the eye mask is black. It looks like perhaps this is meant to be the inner foam and some how it got shipped with out the outer pink finishing material sewn on to it. It did not affect the performance of the eye mask (only the appearance) so I kept it at a deduction of one star. The eye mask does block out light and is stated to help with ""stimulating the melatonin hormone, treats puffy eyes, migraines, headaches, sleeping disorders, and sinusitis."" The ear plugs are pliable and easy to use and come in a nice reusable plastic case. The case can be tossed in an over night bag or purse so that you can use when you're away.

"I've owned several foot massaging devices and have never found anything that couldn't be bested by a good foot rub. I've had severe foot pain for many years now and I still search for products that can provide some relief. This massager consists of a smooth wooden ball (aprox. the size of a baseball, perhaps slightly smaller) that is attached to 2 cords that have wooden handles. It is of sturdy construction, good quality materials, and well made. It is attractively packaged with a nice foot massaging chart and very basic instructions that this can be used standing, sitting, or laying down. The cord is just the right length for me to use in any of these positions with ease.This device is simple but I am so pleased with the results. It leaves my feet feeling relaxed, stretched, and much more comfortable than many of the other foot massagers I have used in the past. I will continue to use this frequently as it does provide relief to my foot pain. This is nicely portable, doesn't take up much room and would make a great gift for any of your loved ones aching feet.

"These silicone heart molds are great! They're really easy to use and clean and are very compact for having 15 separate heart molds in each tray. They're good sized hearts that have a little crease in the middle and a dimple on one side. This gives them a little character and makes them feel a bit more cartoon like and cute. These molds are truly non-stick and very flexible making it super easy to pop whatever you're making right out. They don't crack or break up in the process, just a nice clean unmolding for a perfectly heart. I also liked that I had no issue with any harsh silicone or plastic like odor while using these. They gave off no smell of their own straight out of the package or after washing and being heated in the oven.Silicone molds rock, especially ones as flexible as these are because you can do so many things with them. They're freezer, oven, and dishwasher safe so they're very versatile. I love making gummies, jello, mini muffins, cookie and brownie bites, chocolates, and hard candies. For crafts making mini tea light candles, soaps, crayons, side walk chalks, or painted clay molds make great gifts and party favors.

"This eye mask is nicely sewn and comfortable to wear. Not many sleep masks I've tried have had an adjustable strap and they generally squeeze too tightly and I don't end up wearing them. This sleep mask is easily adjustable and doesn't squeeze against my head. There are tiny magnets in this mask that the listing states that in combination with the mask are to help with "" Relief from Headache, Migraine, and Sinus Pain, Eye Fatigue, Dry Eyes, Acerbity, Itching, and Discomfort"". I cannot attest to having had relief from these things as of yet but hopefully if I do deal with them the mask will help. The mask does however block out light well and doesn't feel uncomfortable or overly warm on my face. The set also comes with a set of earplugs in a nice storage case. I don't usually sleep with earplugs in my ears but I will save these for a guest to use in case they need them. They seem well made, pliable and easy to use.

"I really prefer fine tipped tweezers but it is so hard to find them in stores in my area. I was pleased to come across these. They're a great length, shape, and weight and feel really comfortable to hold and use. The tweezers surface is textured and helps to have a nice no slip grip without feeling gritty or like sandpaper. These have a nice spring to them without feeling like you have to press overly hard to tweeze. I use these for plucking my eyebrows and for splinter removal. They have a great precision tip that grips well. They also come with a little rubber tip guard and a draw string bag for storing.

"This backpack is bigger and sturdier than I thought it would be and I am really pleased with the quality of it. It has two pouches on the side that are big enough to tuck a water bottle into securely. There are also two front pouches that have flaps that snap closed. The main bag has a draw string to gather the top closed and a flap that comes over it and magnetic snaps shut. The draw string has a plastic cinch to hold the rope where you need it. The inside is lined and has a zipper pouch in the upper back part of the bag.. The nylon is a nice wipeable surface and is easy to keep clean. I love the decorative trim on the flaps of the backpack it is well done and the studs seem secure and well placed. The backpack straps are sturdy, wide, and durable.

"This hundred board is made of sturdy wood and is nicely constructed and appealing to the eye. The tiles remind me of rustic scrabble pieces. I say rustic because not all of the numbers are centered in their tile, also the tiles aren't all exactly the same size. (but they're close on both counts) The set includes a board with a blank blue grid, a board insert that has the 1-100 numbered grid, tiles numbered 1-100, and a box/tray to store the tiles in. I do wish the tile tray had a lid but I have found stretching a couple rubber bands around the tray long ways keeps the tiles in the tray for storage. I did note a strong smell that reminded me of the clear coat matte spray I use when painting ceramics. I am assuming that it's the clear varnish coating the wood. I did need to air it out before use but it didn't take long for the smell to dissipate.This is a great mathematical tool to teach kids matching, number sequences, counting, and many other number based lessons. I was disappointed there wasn't an insert laying out different ideas and games using the board but that was nothing a quick google search couldn't remedy. I found several sites with different  suggestions on how to use a hundred board and the different things it could teach. What I like best is it can be a very basic teaching tool that grows with the child and can be utilized to teach more difficult math lessons later on. We will get a lot of use out of this board and I am pleased with how sturdy the construction of it is.

"This dog shampoo has a pleasant smell unlike some we have used in the past. It lathers up well (unusual for an organic and all natural product) and we didn't have to use as much of this product as we do some other shampoos we've used.Pros:Great latherDog wasn't itchy after shampooing and skin didn't seem to dry out.Fur was very soft and manageable.Smell was pleasant.Cons: (why I knocked off a star)I am really not sure what is going on with the label vs pictures and descriptions on this listing and therefore have no idea if my label is accurate. It states certified USDA organic. (the picture on this product listing does not have this statement now)  Also the picture of the ingredients in this listing do not match the list of ingredients in the product description section.

"This ""bump and go"" train has a spinning set of wheels so that when it runs into a wall it will bump it and turn itself around and go another direction. This train runs on 3 AA batteries (not included) that you'll need a mini philips head screw driver to install and change. It plays music and sound effects that sound like a train running along tracks, and a train horn before going back to the music again and repeating. The sounds are a bit loud and I would love an option where sound could be turned off but the lights were still able to run but the kids love noisy toys regardless. There are also flashing colorful lights making the train bright and fun. This is ""approx 13 inches(length) x 3.5 inches(width) x 2.5 inches(height)"" so it's a decent sized toy that is easy for a kid to hold and carry around or play with.

"These super cute and versatile puppy paw silicone molds are great to have in my bakeware collection. These molds make 14 puppy paw shaped baked goods or crafts at a time. I was pleasantly surprised with the 2-1/5x2 inch.sized cavities and that they produce a nice sized, perfectly molded paw print. This mold had no awful silicone or plastic odor to it when I pulled it from it's packaging. I washed it in warm water and also had no issues with silicone smell out of the freezer or when baking with it. Speaking of this is freezer and oven (upto 450 degrees) and dishwasher safe. This silicone pan is super flexible so I recommend reinforcing the mold with a sheet pan to make it easier to handle when putting in and out of the oven or freezer. I actually like when molds are on the thinner more flexible side because they can be flexed very easily to pop out even the most stubborn and sticky of molded materials with no issue. These molds are non stick and I've had no issue simply twisting the mold and popping out each puppy paw in whole well molded condition. These molds would be great to bake your own home made healthier dog treats. If you have a dog lover in your household or family they would be sure to like cookies, muffins, brownies, or Jello in the shape of cute little paws. These would also be great for little soaps or crayons.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NYOFOV96ZSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017KE28Y4#wasThisHelpful","R6NYOFOV96ZSF","A27U0CX87Y2ADR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27U0CX87Y2ADR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a large 16 oz bottle of sweet almond oil. It comes with a flip cap for easy dispensing and a little goes a long way so this will last me a really long time. I'm happy that it has a great shelf life and the expiration date is clearly labeled on the side. I have very dry skin and I really don't absorb lotion well, it just seems to want to stay on the surface of my skin. I did like that just a very small amount of this oil really softens and moisturizes my skin with out it feeling over saturated or not wanting to absorb. It did feel slightly, well oily because it is oil but I like it much better than lotion, it has really made my skin feel soothed. I also like that it doesn't have a fragrance to it and that it washes off pretty well with out making me feel like water is being repelled by the skin that has oil on it. As a hair treatment I recommend being very light handed with it. A little goes a long way and it takes a bit to wash out. I like working some into my hair about an hour before I get in the shower. I then shampoo and condition my hair as normal. I have found that it really makes my hair extra soft and shiny and it feels much healthier.

"I really like these shoe laces. They're stretchy, reflective, sturdy, and easy to use. I do wish there were instruction stickers on each baggie of shoe laces included, or at least one print out. There is a photo reference in the Amazon posting if you need instructions on how to properly fit these to your shoes. It's a simple process that only took me about a minute more than lacing up standard laces and a pair of scissors. Once the laces are cut you really won't be able to reuse them on another pair of shoes because you do trim away the plastic tips that make the laces easy to feed through your shoes eyelets. I don't have an issue with this because 5 pair are included and it's nice to have a new pair of laces when you have a new pair of shoes. Instructions on how to use these laces1. Lace through your shoe like a standard pair of shoe laces2. Pick up the circle button like piece and push, feed the laces through and then let go of button.3. Feed laces through the small end of the bell shaped plastic piece and position it at the bottom beginning part of the laces.4. Tie a firm knot and slide the ""bell"" over the knot.5. Trim ends of laces so that the bell covers the ends.These laces are so much quicker and easier to use than standard laces. I also find that they have a bit more give in them and flex with my foot making my shoe more comfortable to wear as well.

"This is such a handy guide that makes Mexican food accessible to even the busiest of families. I always thought of cooking Mexican cuisine as daunting and time consuming. Thinking of times where my friends spoke of the all day process of batch cooking tamales or the slow roasted flavor of carnitas and barbacoa. I really love my slow cooker. The ""set it and forget it"" method of cooking can really offer up a great meal at the end of a busy day. A meal that other wise would be fast food or something from a box. I love that the author really took the time to lay out the basics of cooking in a slow cooker. There were a few rules that I really needed a reminder for and will help me get the best results. The book is broken down into simple quick to read sections that I found very informative, not at all repetitive or boring, and never over simplified. There is a fine line in writing a cook book were it can feel too dumbed down and the author never made that mistake. I found the section on Mexican pantry staples and explaining what each add to Mexican cuisine particularly interesting and really liked that a break down on chiles was included. I really have always been curious about what effect the different preparation's  of a chili pepper had on it's flavor profile. I love when a cook book not only gives me recipes but also teaches me about the cuisine and methods I am using to cook, and this book delivers that in a quick and interesting way.I live in a small town in the Midwest so I am always a bit concerned that when I start cooking foods from another cuisine that there are going to be more exotic ingredients that I'm just not going to be able to locate. If that is not the case I also find myself concerned that the recipes would be overly Americanized and I wouldn't get true authentic flavors. In looking over the recipes I am pleased that I haven't come across any ingredients that have been difficult to locate. The recipes also feel true to cuisine and well adapted to the slow cooker. Each recipe has a breakdown of how many it serves, how long it will take in the slow cooker on low or high settings, the amount of prep time involved and a chili pepper rating of just how much heat you can expect from the recipe. I also love that the recipe includes directions for what should be prepped the night before and what can be done in the morning so that it you're not in for any surprises that might set you behind at the beginning of the day.The book is informative, the recipes easy to follow and make, and I love having a home cooked meal ready and waiting even when I'm too busy to cook. I am pleased with this book and can't wait to make my way through each of the recipes and find my favorites.

"This skirt is incredibly comfortable, true to size, and has a nice stretchy spring to it. This time of year I have a huge issue with static so I was concerned this might be an issue with this skirt, I was really pleased that hasn't been the case. There was no shrinking after washing it's still as comfortable as it was before it was laundered. I am 5 10.5 and I really like my skirts to be very long, it is a continual struggle for me to find skirts that come down to my ankles and I was thrilled at the length of this maxi waist skirt. It's very stretchy and the waist is sewn extra long so that you can bunch it, fold it, let it lay in a kind of ruching effect and it works nicely to camouflage, and control top the waist area for some one who has a bit of a pooch in the belly area. There is one thing that on my body I didn't find particularly flattering. I really like when a skirt flows out from the hips and doesn't instead give the ""mermaid"" effect where the skirt cuts in below the waist to hug the leg line. So instead of being flattering this really highlights the lump that is my over weight belly This would be great for those who carry their weight more evenly but isn't the best for those who carry a lot of their weight in their middle. That being said it's nothing a long shirt wont fix and the skirt still looks nice with an untucked shirt. I love how flowy the bottom is and it hangs really comfortably. It's got a nice weight so it doesn't feel like the slightest breeze will blow it up over my head but it's still really light and airy material that breaths well. I did find that this is pretty sheer so I wear a slip with it. This is sewn well, feels quality made, the seams and hems are all secure with no loose or hanging threads. I like that it has three seams but that one doesn't land in front so that the front panel of the skirt is solid. This skirt can be casual or dressy and the black color that I got will go with anything. I am loving my super soft and comfy skirt and I will be wearing it a lot.

"On my weight loss journey I have come to realize just how important it is to keep records of my measurements. There are times I have found that the scale never moved or I gained a bit back in a week and I would feel discouraged. I measure in once a month and have found even when I'm not making progress on the scale I am still losing inches on the measuring tape. It's really important to realize that the scale is a guide line and only part of the picture. This is where these tools come in. I really love the body measuring tape, it's meant just for this purpose. It has  little round peg at the beginning of the measuring tape, you wrap the tap around what you want measured  (arm, calf, neck, waist, etc.) and hook it into the provided slot, you can then press the button and the tape will retract until it is flush with your skin and hold in this position. You can then unhook the little peg and record your measurement findings. This is made of plastic and feels like it needs to be used gingerly but so far I've not had any issues with it and it's more about perception than actual lack of sturdiness. This tool is really easy to use and would also be great for some one who does a lot of sewing for others and regularly takes measurements. I have owned a measuring tape like this in the past and it feels identical to it so I am pleased with that as I got a lot of use out of it before I misplaced it.This is the first fat test caliper I've used so I don't really have a comparison on this product. I really like that the included instructions were clear and guided me through the process of using this tool and that there is a chart to interpret those findings included. This tool isn't hard to use and I made sure to measure the same spot a few times to see that I got the same results and that this tool is consistent and it is. This feels a tad flimsy but is pretty flexible due the nature of the way it works and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart at any moment. This tool is also easy to use, made to fit comfortably in my hand and has easy to read numbers on it. Definitely a tool I will keep handy so that I can keep track of my progress.

"I have issues with my oven and can't seem to bake a batch of cookies evenly no matter what I do. I am really pleased with these mats, they bake very evenly and I find that the bottoms of my baked goods aren't getting burnt before the top and middles get done when I use them. I also love that even though a lot of products say they are non stick and really aren't these mats are perfectly non stick and I never have an issue with any item. Food just slides right off the mat. I have a large sized baking sheet so I had no issues with the size of this mat, it fit fine. There were no issues with any unpleasant plastic like fumes or smells that tend to happen with some silicone products.

The fan is tiny, but if you angle it correctly and put it close enough, it really does push enough air to give you that little relief you're looking for.

The controls are very intuitive and the clock is easy to set and adjust for daylight savings time. One thing I've found annoying is that the timer defaults to 2 hours.

It works good enough and it's amazing all the crap I can now see at the bottom of the pool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUYZP7WWI25DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HBHVXA#wasThisHelpful","RUYZP7WWI25DQ","A1MMFSW19AM019","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MMFSW19AM019?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was tired of shaking water out of my ear for hours after swimming and I'm thrilled to finally find some earplugs that will do the job. They are easy to pop into your ears and once in you still have no problem hearing other people talking to you. I hardly notice them when I'm swimming, but sometimes when I first pop up to take a break I get that ""water in the ear"" feeling before it quickly dissipates.The case is pretty flimsy and will just break if you don't open it slowly, but the ear plugs should last a while. Great little add-on item from Amazon if you're already ordering something else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RR7OJR45BW7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018ZWKMW#wasThisHelpful","R3RR7OJR45BW7X","A1MMFSW19AM019","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MMFSW19AM019?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I went to the home improvement stores and it was obvious that this trash container was sturdier and more durable than any of the other cheap flimsy plastic options out there. The lid was secured to the container (but doesn't lock down onto it even if you press hard so if you were to turn this thing upside down then the lid would open). There is a warranty offered from the manufacturer, but I think the bigger issue is having such a well made and expensive trash container stolen by neighbors.64 gallons holds more trash than my wife and I can generate in a week. It probably would take 5-6 very full kitchen garbage bags to come close to filling this up. It's very easy to wheel up and down the driveway and so far it's survived some rough treatment from the garbage men. It won't blow over from the wind or roll around in the street if the garbage men decide to leave it on it's side half in the road.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27P1MMSAQSY80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YKCDUW#wasThisHelpful","R27P1MMSAQSY80","A1MMFSW19AM019","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MMFSW19AM019?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the pictures this looks like an awesome product, but once you take the big neoprene strip out of the case you immediately realize how cumbersome this product will be to actually put in use. It's just one big, wide, flat strip of neoprene with velcro running down each side. If you have a ton of wires all coming from the same outlet perhaps this would be a useful tool, but I found it way too big/bulky for simple use behind a tv entertainment center. It's rather time consuming to attempt to thread the wires in and out just the way you want them and then at the end of the day it still looks like a spider web behind the tv stand. Ultimately I had to send this back and I'm just going to rely on individual velcro cable ties (also available on Amazon at a fraction of the cost of this monster)","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L7Y9TSU4E3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M8SSW8#wasThisHelpful","R28L7Y9TSU4E3D","A1MMFSW19AM019","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MMFSW19AM019?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love the size of these...love the internal heating system - they hold heat really well & for a long time.  Heats up fast too!  I need to practice more with different products to try & get my long, thick locks to hold curl, but that's not this product's fault.  Careful, the metal strips that the curlers rest on get super hot & if you're not paying attention, you may tap one when pulling the curlers out.  I might invest in some clips to hold these in too.  The pins are a tad difficult to use & they leave slight marks in your hair.

"I'm in love!  After trying a size 2 for our 20lb Schnauzer, we found it was too big (he could shake it off) & had to order a size 1.  Now, walks are 100% nicer!!!  He still tries to shake/paw it off his face, but he's unsuccessful.  And I'm sure after he gets a little more used to it, he'll stop trying.  It keeps him from being able to bark & lunge at other dogs (even if he means well).  No more pulling & tugging...exhausting my arms.

"or a good addition to your own collection for the winter holiday season...For the money I spend, I always trust a Lenox and this is one is no different.Just beautiful, heavy but not too heavy to hold, not too big, a wonderful center plate at the table. I could use this not just for eggs, but other smaller eatables such as mini-muffins or small pieces of desserts etc.But, unlike another reviewer mentioned, this is made in china, not in the US (may be designed in the USA).Nevertheless this is a great piece of Lenox tableware to have or to gift, and is worth every penny..

"I drink several cups of coffee and tea a day and so I thought this will be a great addition to my office desk. But, what a disappointment...First the materials used: 1. The inner cup that holds the liquid is plastic. I would have expected a metal (stainless steel), particularlyif it is going to hold hot coffee or tea for a couple of hours. I can only use it now for cold liquids.2. The silicone (flexible plastic) tube that runs from the top of the inner cup to the rim so you can drink out of it? another bad idea if you drink a really hot coffee/tea out of it - you get plastic smell (at least initially..). And I am sure it won't last either.Several other design issues:1. The silicone tube gets pinched by the sides when the cup is placed on the desk. The handle moves up, lifts the inner cup and along with that the silicone tube by about a .25 inch when you lift the mug and that opens up the tube so you can drink out of that. But the handle moves so easily, that if the cup falls to its side on the desk, guess what - your table is full of coffee.. so the whole idea of no-spill cup is lost...2. A little too big for what it is. I would have expected a thinner one from the picture, and would have appreciated a thinner one.3. When you pour the liquid in, if you are not careful, liquid will go in the gap between the inner and outer cups! Then you have to clean it up...One nice touch is that the bottom comes out for cleaning; you really really need that facility for this one, anyways.In all, not really usable for me...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29X6UO1IO8V0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBLGRIY#wasThisHelpful","R29X6UO1IO8V0","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Comparing to that, this one:- is milder; just apply a little and it seems to vanish in a couple of hours.

"I love it.. but only 4.5/5!There is only flaw I see with this product:Most of the outlets I have are two outlets in one wall plate. This one takes up most of the space, uses only one outlet, but hides the other outlet, so I can't use that outlet for anything. In effect, I convert 2 outlets in to 3 outlets + 2 USB - not bad at all.... but still. Could have done better with either a slim profile one that doesn't block the other outlet, or just use both outlets - using one for the 3 outlets, and the other one for the USB charging.Other than that, this is perfect.1.

"Well made, has a nice finish and touches to make it a fashionable bag.Lots of packets inside and out. The inside packet is good enough for tablets/ipad of size up to 10-12 inches and not really for any serious laptop. So don't think of this as a laptop carrying bag. (Who would expect that in a fashion piece?) There are other additional packets for money and purse etc..Outside packet can be used for small change, papers, mp3/phone and a bottle etc.Not much security as it relies on a draw string to close the bag and there are not many zipped enclosures (that are difficult to open in a hurry), but that's OK for a fashion back pack or a day bag (for car travel etc.)The material used is very nice.Functional enough for day trips nearby, but not for long travels as the main handbag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9YZTGWVO31S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUGIKL0#wasThisHelpful","R2V9YZTGWVO31S","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You just open up and keep it in the sun for charging. It has taken about 3 hours for me to charge the battery using sunlight, while charging from AC outlet has been much faster.Every accessory is useful and works well; included flash light (either the separate add on or built-in LED flash on the side) both work very well and for a long time. The fan actually works and gives a cool airflow (drawback is that you have to hold it close enough).After a full charge of the battery, it is able to provide about 70% charge to my Galaxy S6 smartphone: more than enough for emergencies!Definitely a must have for emergencies..and a good gift","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1598489YSKM9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLINB12#wasThisHelpful","R1598489YSKM9P","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall 4.5/5non-scratching surface, a little big for normal 5"" phones (like Samsung Galaxy S6 or Nokia phones), but good to have a big one like this on the table.Very well made, as with most Belkin products are.Comes with a really small USB charger/power adapter that looks cool and USB to MicroUSB cable. Charges my Galaxy S6 in about 2 hours from 0 to 100% and shows the status with LED. As it approaches full charge, it flashes colors (red and green!). While it is charging it is usually green.With the name of Belkin, I am hoping that this will last for a long time.One issue, (reported by others) is that it is a single coil, and the area of charging is only half or less than that in the pad. So, we still have to take care in placing the phone on this pad, so that it charges; can't just put the phone anywhere in the pad; have to watch the green LED.Definitely recommend this one, if you are looking for a Qi charger, and if this is priced right in comparison to competition (just a bit premium for Belkin brand name and the finish of the product, including the cute, small USB charger).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8Z2S360P171/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VA5SU56#wasThisHelpful","R1I8Z2S360P171","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't believe all the writing in the Amazon page when I ordered this, but then once I got it, now I am a believer!One caveat though: before using first time, read the manual. Unless the handle is pushed back in on opening it, it is not going to cut the nails. So read the manual that shows in pictures how to use this nail cutter.Once you learn how to use this, even your biggest toe nail is no match for this cutter.Very well made, totally sleek and is so small it is packet-able ( or can carry in a valet) but I wouldn't buy it for that reason! I would buy it just for the functionality of this little marvel.Unlike the cheap cutters, this doesn't throw the nails far and wide. You can collect it from the back of the blades.One of the sides has a nail file face so that is included as well.Only one issue I noted: the curvature of the blade looks a little wider than normal cutters.

The openings are well done, so there is no issue in using any of them - IR,speaker, headset in, and power in.4. As if one color is not enough, you get 3 color bumpers!Cons:1. The buttons, while totally concealed (with just a tactile marking for hands to feel it), work just ok most of the time. It would have been ok to have the buttons stand out and work well.2. Heart rate sensor, with the cover, seems to be deep set, so some times, unless you are careful, doesn't work correctly; takes longer to get the rhythm and start measuring.These are minor quibbles compared to the pros - slim, well made, great protection, and so I can only reduce 0.5 out of 5 for these cons.Definitely worth a buy..","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRMAJ8MTR1MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ5ALA4#wasThisHelpful","R3GRMAJ8MTR1MG","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even people who never used a smart phone can easily get used to a windows phone (or iphone for that matter, if you can spend more) - definitely not an android phone - the way current android phones arrive at customers with a ton of bloatware and confusing interface  for a non-techie.Details: In most specs, this almost looks like a twin of Nokia Lumia 635 (unfortunately, 635 is available in US for as little as $69), with just one exception - 2 SIM support. It is also a little more bulkier than the current sleek crop of phones, but then at this price range, it is quite good as is.Only a few cons:1. lack of applications (applies to Windows) - but if you are only looking for simple things such as email, FB, Twitter, Flipboard and some web browsing, this is more than enough2. 5 MP camera - not so good - pictures are just ok - not great.Several pros:1. display is fine for this price range (definitely not going to watch netflix in a 4.5 screen of this sort).2. Battery life is good3. Comes with a screen guard and a nice cover - that otherwise will cost you another $15 or so.4. Front camera too - for skype/video chatting/selfie (but looks like low quality VGA or less).5. No bloatware at all :) Most windows phones are phones first and smartphones second..unlike 'some' smartphones!6. Configuration, joining WIFI/Bluetooth etc are all so easy, and the experience is the same across all Windows phones.Misc. Notes:Micro Sims. And have to open the back cover to install the 2 Microsims, unlike Nokia models, but removing the back cover is quite an easy task. With 2 Sims you get 2 phone numbers on the same phone, giving you a choice to use which sim for calling out. Useful in other countries, but not of any use in US.(PS: My current primary phone is a Galaxy S6, upgraded from Nokia 1020, which was an upgrade from iPhone 4S. I have a good use for dual sim phones when I travel abroad, and this one fits the bill nicely for me).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OGKO2AY6VTQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7S1N90#wasThisHelpful","R1OGKO2AY6VTQN","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can you do in a phone cover to differentiate from million covers out there?? UAG has done it - done it well.Sleek, fits perfectly, looks quite solid (I only dropped a couple of times - definitely not for testing this case :) , and it was fine). Excellent corner protection, Even stays put when placed on a slanted desk. It doesn't hinder access to the heart rate monitor (LED) for measuring using s-health app.Best of all, quite lite; doesn't add bulkiness to the phone (only some , not a lot as you would expect from a 'military grade' cover).There is lip protection as well.If it is made affordable, this will be the best cover money can buy for a Galaxy phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMV9RGYPCG46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRG8K0A#wasThisHelpful","RSMV9RGYPCG46","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several things to like and a couple of (big) dislikes..positives list:1. Shiny, sateen like shell (polyester) on one side and such a sofft fleece on the other side. Feels so good on the body to use such blanket/throw.2. In spite of being made in polyester/fleece, it is quite warm and yet doesn't get too warm; does breathe through. So it is always pleasant to use either in winter or summer.3. It is quite light, not heavy at all. You would think it has to be heavy, looking at the fleece side.4. It can be a decoration as well, leaving it on a chair..Now the negatives:1. Not sure about this flag thing on it..may be some other graphic might be better.

"Overall: 4.5/5.0I attempted to assemble this myself, alone.  It was quite hard and I had to use all the ingenuity and muscle power to get it done over 3 to 4 hours, spread over 2 days. In the end it was worth it. ( to be truthful, I needed some one to finally lift it up after I finished assembly and again to hold it down, while I poured sand in the base).Parts and shipping: Great. Parts are sturdy and well made. Wall packed and arrived properly.The post is in 3 parts that interlock (and with a screw/nut). Only a few gripes here:-while all the parts were shown in the assembly manual, the parts could have been given a name, letter or a number that also shows up in the packaging of parts. For e.g. there were several screws, nuts and washers and the dimensions were quite close to each other, that you have to guess at times, as to what you should use for what.- I wish the post could have been made in strong/sturdy PVC or some other lighter material, bringing the overall weight of this.One small caveat for those who assemble: The height of 10 ft. etc is true only if the 3 parts of the posts are pushed together to the minimum length! The posts join together with an elongated long hole for the screw that keeps them together.After assembly: Better use sand to weigh down the base as that won't get spoiled or leak. I needed 2 bags of 50lbs sand from the neighborhood HomeDepot.Once it is done, it is quite sturdy, as real as you can get system for hours/years of fun. It can adjust from 8 ft to 10ft, and can be moved around the house as you see fit.The only gripes I have are: (and reasons for a deduction of 0.5 in the rating)1. Parts naming to identify the parts easily.2. Could have been a bit lighter3. It is still hard to adjust the height for one person (unless you are strong).I love it and recommend it for all families with kids (and those who are kids at heart or basketball players)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XH56Y6WVNDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L61OHZ6#wasThisHelpful","R23XH56Y6WVNDK","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"French press system on the go. For those who want to brew for themselves a personal cup instead of the usual office coffee, this is a good alternative.Several plus points and one con..Pros:1. Very well made, inside stainless steel (except for some plastic at the bottom of inside unit (shown clearly in the picture).2. Does hold coffee hot for an hour or so but not too much (less time than claimed because of the top flexible plastic cover)3. Does fit in my car cup holders (looks a bit wide at first sight though, compared to the usual starbucks ones).Cons:1. The flexible plastic cover; for the money and the features, it is a letdown. I hope they fix it in the final version (as this is a vine copy).Other caveats: as the instruction says, we can only use medium or coarse ground coffee in this.

"Update: 5/1/2015:Yeah, but bad software - lots of bugs abound...Shame on Samsung and Google for such a software that is inferior to IOS and even Windows mobile. Even things that work well on my Nokia Windows, I have several issues with this phone software.A few ( I couldn't keep up with the number of bugs...):1. Screen rotation off doesn't work properly, even with samsung supplied software in cases. Even if I disable, it continues to rotate for most apps.2. Biggest gripe: the display brightness control. I have no clue how I can set it up correctly so it adjusts automatically whether I am indoors or outdoors. The Settings screen has a checkbox for auto and I have that checked out, but once I lock and unlock the phone, it shows as unchecked from the pulldown status screen. I have tried several things with this and I am still not getting it right. It is always hard to see in bright sunlight, until I pull down the status screen and check the box again. Shouldn't this be a sticky setting in the first place???3. Can't use carmode from my bluetooth when the phone is locked (and the phone gets locked after a minute of timeout. I can change the timeout to 30 minutes but then why have a locking feature with that timeout?). So, how am I supposed to use voice dialing?S-voice is even worse for this purpose.4. Settings is not organized correctly.  How do you get to wifi-dialing?? I would guess Settings/WIFI or Settings/mobile networks. No, it is under ""more connections settings"". This is not one issue, there are several such issues with settings organization - not intuitive enough.5. I am not fully happy with the camera also..the photos seem to be a bit grainy in 100% setting. (could be my phone issue...). The camera app is not good enough, and I have to probably use third party apps etc..(Note that I am more than an amateur photographer, and do take event photos for organizations, own a high end DSLR, used a Nokia 1020 before mainly for camera, and so I know how good this camera/software is).6. So I installed Google Now thinking that could be better. Now tells me that it will take 12 minutes to my office on Saturday nights and even on Sundays... Sadly, Google Now lacks basic AI smarts to tie the current time to what I may do at that time. I do not remember seeing such reminders even on Cortana. Cortana used to remind such things only in the mornings.7. Bluetooth software is quite bad. It has issues with disconnecting particularly when you pair it with multiple things (Car, headset), and can't even hear some times.In general usability is poor compared to competition, while the hardware is great.Original review:I actually bought one of these from T-mobile.  Here is a brief take:Pros:1. So beautiful to hold, nice size, finish, glass on both side; especially, the white glass on back looks more like an off-white marble.2. Best display on a smartphone you can buy. Youtube/video streaming is beautiful. But need to really try this with Gear VR accessory once I get it.3. Trimmed down software as promised! no bloatware.4. I love s-health software. It tracks all my walking and running in a day, without having to do any thing special, and measures the pulse when I want it. Quite useful5. While battery capacity is a bit low compared to even S5, this still lasts about a full day (roughly 20+ hours) with lot of email accounts. But then I don't do video streaming that much; I do use facebook and browse a couple of websites, use linked in and a few other apps on a regular basis.6. Blazingly fast. Absolutely no lag for anything.7. Wireless charging.8. Charges fast (in about an hour and a half for full charge, and about 20 minutes for 25% charging). Much, much better than my Galaxy S tab from last year (which takes about 5 to 6 hours for a full charge).9. Ultra power saving mode seems to work well - lasting about 4 or 5 hours with about 10% charge left.10. Finger print on the start button works well.11. The gorilla glass is supposedly scratch-proof but I don't want to test it within a month of buying :). It does seem to be quite solid so far.12. While the camera is good, I am not sure it matches my old Nokia 1020. My quick test does show up a bit grainy when the picture is zoomed, compared to Nokia's photos. This is not by any means a professional comparison though.Cons:1. I miss Cortana/SIRI; I can't get either google or s-voice to work properly. S-voice seems to work only some times, when I have the phone locked. When the phone is unlocked, no issues. But then when you are driving, phone is always locked and can't do voice dialing. This is a big bummer. I hope Samsung fixes s-voice2. Battery cannot be replaced by users.I don't consider the lack of sd  card slot as a big issue - with 32g on board and cloud to back it up...Overall 4.5/5. The best smartphone in the market today, and will be an all-time great if only a few software issues (like good voice dialing) and a bit more picture editing features are avilable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XRM5GCGTK70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8KSMN4#wasThisHelpful","R30XRM5GCGTK70","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been in the software industry for 25+ years, have used mostly waterfall over the years for many, many system projects, and have found little use for a full scale Agile so far. I see where it can be useful for applications development and for maintenance releases of software. In any case, though I don't need it, I decided to do an official PMP course and this book arrived at the right time! And over the years, I did incorporate some aspects of Agile in to my usual waterfall projects as well, where it makes sense. Reading this book assured me further to use more and more such strategy even if full on Agile won't work for my system projects. (Note that some system projects are so small, but takes a year or two, and a proper Agile becomes an overhead)The things I liked about this book are: not expecting the reader to know Agile (and giving an excellent overview), taking experienced waterfall project managers like me (as well as fresh project managers) from other PM methods to Agile, excellent set of case studies, focus on enterprise level and big projects.Things to improve: better/clear illustrations (bigger print, more colorful).In all, I would recommend this as a first book on Agile to experienced project managers as well as wanna-be-project managers as well. 4.5/5.0","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAUP1AKXCC3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118991044#wasThisHelpful","R1LAUP1AKXCC3P","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an older ear thermometer from another brand that I don't use much (because I can't believe the readings!). I was a bit skeptical while ordering this (a free vine sample, so why not try this once more...).Pleasant surprise.Have to power on, put in the ear, press the start button, and just 2 seconds later you hear a beep, and you have the reading. It is repeatable and as accurate as can be. Both ears need not be exactly at the same temperature and also there can be very slight variations - but never more than 0.1 plus or minus.  In my trial, it did come out to the same number in most cases and definitely the same number on the same ear of the same person over some time lapse...Pros:1. Well made, nice small size, easy to read, good controls; eject button tosses the plastic lens filters cleanly..2. Place to keep the filter pack in the plastic cover, so you don't have to search for replacements in the last minute when you want to use the thermometer!3. Quite accurate, and repeatable measurements.4. Very fast readings - less than 2 seconds.Cons:1. Replacement filters! If multiple people use it, it is good to change the filter and also good to change filter once after every few uses (Braun recommends changing after every use!). Cost of filters and the task of keeping in stock is an issue/con.2.

I am quite happy with the light - it is cool white as promised (I have had some other brands that claim more than they could!), enough power as promised.Just one issue: the metal ring around the light is not fixed to the light tightly. I used it to screw the bulb in the socket in a narrow opening, and the metal ring starts rotating on its own independently of the light!  Don't know if this is a manufacturing issue or a design issue, but hope they fix this.Other than that, the clearance from the socket - the long threaded base is quite helpful, for fixing this bulb in narrow housings.Overall, I like these, as they serve the purpose at a very reasonable price, and would recommend this brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LF3XDIVAQT4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHGX50Y#wasThisHelpful","R1LF3XDIVAQT4S","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are quite a lot of things to like about in this headphones and there are obvious issues with it.Pros:1. Excellent materials, fit and finish; wires never get tangled, and stay loose. The magnetic on the side of the earbuds is a nice touch. Once you take the buds off, they nicely stick to gather and stay put cleanly without tangling in the wires. But, I wonder, what is the effect of this magnet on the sound quality? can't say...2. Decent audio quality. I couldn't find much to fault with this. (except the Bass/treble/voice all seem to be set to the normal range and increasing/decreasing a range doesn't have much of an effect, so I believe it does lack in bass/treble  extremes - as you would normally expect a simple, in ear, earphones to. So I am not complaining...)3. Call taking, volume, sound etc are all quite good.So then what is my complaints?Cons:1. Earbud is fully plastic and is made for only some special ears/heads - definitely not for me. The earbuds don't stay in ear! I tried looping it around my ear and even that didn't help. If you can't keep it in your ear for long, what use is that earphone?2. Would be nice to have a small zip bag to go with this, especially when it is advertised as premium earphone!And of course an airline adapter would help too.Amazon has done some nice touches - such as the magnetic earbuds, and even the slim, low profile 3.5 pin that aligns so well with a slim phone is very thoughtful.The wire is great too - it totally stays untangled even if you crumple and stuff it in a small place.  This quality is comparable to the wires of more expensive Bose noice cancelling in-ear earbuds!

"While the first section of the book is really intended for 'dummies' - things like what to look for when buying a piano/digital keyboard, the later sections cover all the required material all the way from beginner to an intermediate level.  There are several things I like about this book and should have given 5 stars for it, but:1. End of the day, you can't learn everything from a book - need direct practice and some instruction time from a professional teacher (unless you are a born genius, of course!). This book can take you only so far. After that you still need to practice a lot and also get some face time with some pros/teachers.2. More importantly, I feel there are less exercises and simpler examples at the beginning. The toughest part of learning something new is in the basic stages. That part should be really taken slow, with lots and lots examples/exercises. You can never overdo that.  While this book does try to cover a lot of ground, still not enough for the early stage, IMHO.3. Nitpicking: the print for the music could have been a little bit bigger.In spite of that, this is one of the 'must have' books you should have handy, as it provides lot of valuable information, pointers to references for further learning, and website access to all the songs for you to listen and practice while reading this book.For those of you who want to learn without a teacher, there are some software in the market, that can connect your notebook to a digital piano/keyboard through USB/MIDI cables, and such software can guide you real time with playing songs, track if you pressed the right key or not, within the tempo or not, etc.  I believe such a software along with this book will get me more complete instruction than otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCZT0YAYFRMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118837428#wasThisHelpful","ROCZT0YAYFRMJ","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You go in thinking of buying one item and end up buying 10 of those as you can't pass the deal. (and some times get choice words when your spouse sees it :) ). I got the same feeling when I saw this item. I needed only one and saw this deal, couldn't resist.For a change, though, this is really good. Now I get to use different color when I feel like.The covers are good quality, do seem to have good protection (though if you drop from 4th floor it may not stand). Since the covers are made of semi-transparent material, the colors show up lighter than what is shown in the picture here. Some are neon colors (orange, green).The cover does fully cover the important part of the phone - the big lens at the back. And has a small lip/edge at the front so the phone rests on the cover when it is put face down.And price is right, fast shipping.

"That said, everything comes with some compromises and this one is no exception.I owned (and lost) a QC15 headset; I liked it, but I could use it only for the sake of noise cancelling (while travelling or in a noisy lab at work). If I put it on more than an hour or two, then my ears start aching because of the way the ear cups sit on my head.This one came in as a gift from heaven. I didn't buy this for a long time, just because of the price. Even if it is good, it is still not worth the price at 300 and would have been a good buy at 200 or less. In my opinion that is a fair price for the value you get, especially compared to Beats and Sennheiser and other competitor products.Pros:1. Excellent noise cancelling of most constant noises (such as engine noise, computer fan noise, A/C noise etc) and also reduces overall volume of all other sounds - including people speaking in the vicinity.2. Excellent quality/finish, the cable is of right length and material (doesn't snag/catch on or get tangled).3. Fits nicely on my ear and stays. I have only tried for a couple of hours so far at a time and so far so good.Cons:1. Sound quality is reasonable/OK, but I don't see anything special with this headset compared to the cheap Belkin (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPAVJZ6/) in ear headsets that I use otherwise. If anything, it is a little better, but not worth the price difference.2. Way too expensive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA3CBSKCQFVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D42A16E#wasThisHelpful","RUA3CBSKCQFVJ","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I upgraded from a old HP Officejet J6480 all-in-one to this. I was looking for the following:1. Good scanning capability (HP J6480 was one of the best ones when I bought it - excellent scan resolution).2. Wide format printing, so I can print some posters (not all the time though) - old HP was only standard format (up to legal)3. Reasonable printing speed (10+ pages pm) and running cost4. Support for mobile device printing (air print etc..) - my old HP didn't have this(This was bought from Amazon using a different account with a gift card, so it is not shown as 'verified purchase' but I do own this printer and did buy from Amazon).So far after a couple of months of using, I should say, I am more than happy on all counts - with some exceptions (reason for my 4 star rating!).The best I like is the scanning/copying: huge scanning surface 11x19 kind of size (haven't measured the exact size, but it is more than legal size). The feature I like here is the ability to auto fit the image to A4 size for example.One nice/neat trick is to set up your own email address, so you can send print jobs to your printer anywhere from the world through email!The thing I don't like:1. Remote/network software access. HP, for e.g., sports a web page for scanning, so you open up your browser and scan images to your browser and save it locally. Epson, still uses a separate desktop program, called Epson Scan, that lets you connect through network, scan it and save to your computer as a file. This doesn't help much (for e.g. I can't scan something to my android tablet now, which I could do with the ancient HP).Other than this, this is a great printer - excellent build - should last for years.Another thing I noticed is this: My old HP, while printing, will shake the cheapo table it is sitting on. The Epson, while bigger and heavier, doesn't shake the table :) Go figure...Epson is solidly built.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EUQE1SB9SA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Y834NC#wasThisHelpful","R24EUQE1SB9SA2","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great finish and quality for this price! Good storage, and the lid is OK (another bench at the same price point I have has issues with the lid opening and closing after some use). Looks really beautiful -with the piano black finish. Seat is comfortable.Assembly was quick - didn't take more than 10-15 minutes, but would have appreciated a proper tool for tightening the nuts. (that's the only negative point about this, the included one is not good). I have my own set of tools and so this didn't matter.  I believe I may have to tighten after some months of use (based on the assembly type of this bench), but then we have to do that for all such assembled furniture anyways.I would highly recommend this bench - for the finish, comfort, and price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNBEC92JUWC5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006X7U1Y4#wasThisHelpful","RNBEC92JUWC5K","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced a Norelco sensotouch 2D (1150x - http://www.amazon.com/Philips-1150X-46-SensoTouch-Frustration/dp/B006W2SYF8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404281741&sr=8-1&keywords=norelco+sensotouch+2d), with this new shaver from Remington - a first Remington in 20 years.Pros: 1. decent shave for the price - good performance for the below-100 price range. A little bit better than sensotouch 2d shavers.2. Less noise while operating than comparable shavers in this price range.3. Well made and should last (except for blade replacements)Cons: not much; but Remington could have made a better shaver than this to make it the BEST value for the money, but it falls short of that; The charger stand is a little weird - can't make it a stand so it is just an extra attachment around the body of the shaver.One thing to note: the Amazon web page doesn't say this: It is a wet shaver as well.The differences between XR1370 shaver and this one are:1. XR1370 has LED % display of charge remaining while this only has red light to indicate low charge level.2. XR1370 holds 60 minute worth of charge compared to 40 minutes of charge for this.Otherwise the 2 models are identical in shaving head etc..Definitely a good shaver for the price range and worth buying if you are budget-conscious. If money is no object, Sensotouch 3D is still the king of rotary shavers, IMHO.Update: 7/25/2014: Reducing the rating to 3/5. Spoke too soon. The heating problem I used to see with the old metal foil shavers 10 years ago is happening with this razor too. After a couple of minutes of use, the razor surface starts feeling warm to the skin. This heating doesn't happen with Norelco rotary shavers and seems to be specific to this model (or to Remington brands).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ALNWIS11HW3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0LGBH4#wasThisHelpful","R2ALNWIS11HW3I","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:50 MinsUpdate 7/23/2014: reducing to 4/5. Battery life (and charging) is not as good as iPad or for that matter, for a device that costs 500 bucks. A few issues with Android as well (but then I have my own gripes with IOS as well). The microSD slot was hard to use. I use a Transcend 32GB MicroSDHC Class10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter 45 MB/s (TS32GUSDU1E), but it is quite difficult to insert and keep it locked; had to use a tool (I used the microsd adapter!) to push the card in. This card does get recognized and I can use it well.Old Review:My iPad 2 broke and I was looking to buy an (a second one in the household) ipad air; got this at the right time, and am in tablet heaven...I did try a Dell Venue 8"" - my first android tab - a while ago and it was a disaster (turns out there are display and hardware issues with that model). So when I got this, I was a bit skeptical - only for the first 10 minutes, though!Let us get to details then...Summary of differences with ipad:1. MicroSD slot! (up to 128Gb capacity)2. Better and bigger display3. 3GB memory for running applications (compared to 1GB)4. Camera 8MP compared to 5MP5. Fingerprint sensor!Size and handling: At 10.5, it is bigger than ipad air. Even thinner than iPad at 0.26 inches; smooth surfaces, and as with iPad Air, it is a bad idea to handle this beauty without a case; it is quite easy to drop these, and they are not made to hold in hand for long hours without a cover, either. So, please buy a good cover to go with this.Display: At 2560x1600 it is about 25+% more than iPad air in terms of resolution (287ppi compared to 264ppi) - and it shows! Beautiful Super AMOLED display beats out the LED displays. It is reported that AMOLED displays are usually not bright enough, but on this model, it is more than enough - even in bright outdoors. The settings entry for brightness has an 'auto' mode, but that doesn't seem to work fully well (an android issue or Samsung issue), and it is still bright in the night. I had to turn off auto and reduce the brightness manuallly for night time viewing! The display is gorgeous, to say the least, and the best part of this tablet.Battery and charging: Battery life is quite adequate at about 8+ hours ( I did run through several episodes of burn notice with netflix streaming on one charge). Charging with the included charger does take longer than I expected - several hours for full charge. In addition, there is ultra power saving mode you can turn on from 'settings -> General' menu - this mode takes you to a black and white screen mode and allows basic web surfing, email and a few application that you can choose to add.  In this mode, it can last quite a few hours with just 10% charge remaining.Bloatware: Contrary to some review, there is some bloatware that is pre-installed but not much. There are two boxes that show up in the second screen - Galaxy essentials and galaxy gifts. If you go in to this, you get to choose what bloatware you want :) But there are some good ones such as wall street journal or Economist 3 month subscriptions for free, GQ and other free issues, as well as some free games.There are 2 apps - Samsung Level (for the soon-to-be-released Samsung headphones - to compete with Beats..) and Samsung Gear - pre-installed.Camera: 8MP for the back camera with a flash compared to just 5 MP in iPad - seems good. But this is the only feature that was ordinary in Samsung tablet. The pictures in auto mode doesn't look as good as a normal (cheapo) 8MP digital camera photos in auto mode - even to an untrained eye. (I put a Canon EOS 7D to good use and I can spot a good camera when I see one; sadly this is not one of those..), but it is adequate; so is the front camera at 2 MP.WIFI - comparable; both support a/b/g/n dual band MIMO, but Samsung also supports 'ac'. Quite easy to setup/connect to home networks. So far there is not one hiccup with the wireless access. Excellent performance.CPU - While iPad only has A7 ARM cores, Samsung has 4 A7 cores and 4 A15 cores; it claims it switches the cores depending on the need/usage/power requirements. For all practical purposes, it is fast; there is some lag but not serious lag in using multiple apps and notifications and background tasks going on.Fingerprint sensor: It is all how you train (give samples) the sensor! It takes 8 samples to setup, and so use your finger in slightly different angles - tilting your finger a little from left to right before each sample. Settings screen and fingerprint setup also allows you to setup an alternate password in case you can't get through with your fingerprint. In addition you can always unlock with your google account. I am able to use the finger sensor almost without any failure so far and found this this to be way better than the one I have on my Dell Lattitude notebooks.Audio: has 2 speakers one on each side (unlike ipad air), and the audio is decent for this price, though I prefer to use earbuds for better sound.Watch On app and the IR capability: while new for Samsung, the app is still not ready; has several issues. It let me add my Denon receiver, dish receiver, sony bluray and panasonic tv etc., but I can't turn off or control all devices individually (no selection for device). Only volume, channel change etc work! Power button asks what device you want to power off - again didn't list bluray or receiver - only my TV and Dish. I hope this will get fixed as the app improves. But basic IR facility is great - worked from a distance of 20+ ft across the room.I absolutely love this. In terms of hardware, it scores a 10/10; fit and finish is great and I would expect this to last at least another 6 to 8 years (unless the technology obsoletes this hardware - which it will...); Apple has been trounced from the tablet throne with this entry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDC2XQE9MT3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHA5G6G#wasThisHelpful","R2CDC2XQE9MT3A","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the watch settings interface is just OK, it can be improved. For e.g. a single setup button with sub-menus for various things instead of different buttons for different functionality is a little confusing. I had to read the manual to set this watch and use it.

In addition to these sensors, Casio goes one up and allows music control on the iphone.Pros: 1. Fitness and music control through bluetooth, along with traditional digital watch functions in one package - useful if you want to avoid having too many accessories around2. Price is rightCons: 1.

"By the time I got this product, I lost my second phone an iphone 5. The product page says ""iphone or android"" and I have a Nokia 1020. No harm in trying, so I tried with that and it works beautifully!Turns out that the technology is based on induction (no wifi/BT or other technologies that require software on the phone to connect to this speaker), and so in theory, it should work with most any phone.While the product page also says you can use for talking (skype, chat/conference etc), the microphone is the phone's. This product is only a speaker and doesn't have any additional microphones.Pros:1. Compact, well made (marked ""designed in Detroit, made in china""), nice angle and solid non-slip feet to keep on desk.2. No need for power cable or for batteries. Built-in charging is supposed to last for 7 hours (haven't tested that yet, only for an hour or so..)3. As the claim goes, no need to pair, or connect. Just place the phone on the speaker, and play! If you take the phone out, speaker stops immediately. Can't get simpler than this.4. Excellent volume, sound quality. Great for phone, and ok for Radio/music5. Reasonable price for what it offers.Cons:Why 4 stars?? I did hear some static when I was not playing anything on the phone! But the static was very low volume compared to the music playing.

If at all, it can be a little more affordable.I did buy a previous version of NewLife/GelPro a while back from Amazon, and when I saw this I couldn't pass up the opportunity to add one more.

"I replaced a CFL PAR30 recessed lighting over the kitchen with this - and what a change!Pros:1. Looks beautiful in a recessed lighting (while, like all LEDs this has strange fins on the side, they don't show in a recessed setting).2. Excellent lighting - does give 40 degree wide coverage instead of the usual spot light we get with LEDs; pretty useful/workable for my counter work.3. Bright, more natural light; does look like 75-90W4. Excellent packaging; looks well made, though have to wait and see how long this lasts (20 years as claimed?? I will post an update in 2033 if you are willing to wait)5. Price is comparable and on the lower side by the time I write this review. (I do see more expensive ones in Lowe's)Cons:1. Packaging! While it is packaged very well, it was a bit difficult to take it out of packaging; just a minor annoyance.In all, I am very happy with this product and will buy more when it comes time to replace other bulbs in the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KF7J7VRG7XAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3T6OHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KF7J7VRG7XAA","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For carrying a DSLR (Canon EOS 7D) and a couple of lenses, filters, caps, for local trips, this is a fantastic bag. If you want to travel with this bag (airlines, long distance, public transportation etc) and worry about safety, then this bag can only contain a little bit in the zippered area - one body+ 2 smaller lenses or 1 big+1 small lens and a purse, passport etc. So usefulness of this bag depends on your needs.Pros:1. Several slots/openings/storage areas around the bag, that can contain lenses, caps, filters, batteries etc, when you are changing equipment in a hurry while shooting.2. Inside padded storage to protect body and lenses when you travel outside.3. Extendable; you can open the zipper on the long strap side (right side of the picture shown here) for more storage inside the bag.4. Very convenient for using either as a shoulder bag or cross belt style.5. Excellent quality, finish.6. Reasonable priceCons: except for this one, can't think of anything else:1. Couldn't put in 7D body with a long zoom lens (70-200mm L f4) in the padded storage area and zip it easily. Having the camera ready with a lens is a must for anyone who wants to take candid and quick shots at a moment's notice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0O1EN3ZCUZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GYIKHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C0O1EN3ZCUZ9","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:1. Nice, good looking set of cups2. Excellent price/value3. Right size - not too big and not too small - holds about 10 oz. without spilling.Cons:1. The stand is too flimsy and seems to be shaking a bit. Not sure if it will fall off anytime. It also keeps the cups too close so you have to be careful in handling this.2. Cups get hot quite easily - just pouring hot water in to it (not heating with it) makes the cup hot outside! So it may not be good for heating/microwaving for longer duration (say more than a minute or 2).For the money, it is definitely worth it. Not sure if it will last thought (only time will tell).

"I was hoping this could replace my WaterPik, particularly for traveling; and it didn't live up to that expectation.While this product looks good, well made, has enough water pressure etc there are a few issues:1. It works well if you have an orderly set of teeth with uniform, nice (even if very small) gap between teeth. Otherwise, it ends up hitting the spray on teeth and the back pressure of that forces the tip away. Our own involuntary action will push the tip back resulting in hitting the gum/teeth with the plastic tip. It may take quite some practice to get used to this issue. Since WaterPik uses a constant jet, it is not such an issue with it.2. This only helps to clean between teeth while WaterPik helps in cleaning the area near the gum or things stuck in molars.3.The water pressure is not adjustable. It may be too much or too little for some.Overall WaterPik cleans better.Biggest benefit is that it is made for travelling - with its size and need for very little water storage.  And the fact that it can use the same charger as other Sonicare line of tooth brushes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZUHTRV8Q3NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG270S#wasThisHelpful","R19ZUHTRV8Q3NZ","A3LKN9GND01EWJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LKN9GND01EWJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The packaging is nice looking and inside you’ll find the candle placed in a large piece of styrofoam with another piece on top and then the candles themselves are wrapped in a think layer of plastic for further protection. Once you get everything unpacked you’ll find the three candles, user guide and remote control. The candles are three different heights at 5, 6 and 7 inches tall and they’re all about 3 inches across.They’re made of wax, at least part of them is, the outer shell or layer is real wax giving them the look and feel of a real candle. The candles have a plastic flame in the centers that moves or flickers like a real flame does and gets illuminated by the LED inside to simulate a real candle look. The battery compartments are on the bottoms of the candles along with the main power switch. Each candle needs three AAA batteries for power which are not included.There’s just one remote control that controls all of the candles at the same time. The remote is small and it uses a button or watch style battery which is included for you. The remote has ten buttons for power, timer, mode and dimming. You can set the timer for 2, 4, 6 or 8 hours and it works on a 24 hour cycle meaning if you turn it on for 2 hours at 1pm it will stay on for 2 hours and then go off until 1pm the next day and come back on again for 2 hours and repeat the cycle until you change it.  The modes are candle and light, candle mode is where the flame moves and the LED is on, light mode is the LED flickering but the flame doesn’t move. The dimmer buttons are self-explanatory really.When you power the candles on they do look very real in the low light and especially in the dark. The moving flame makes it look even more real and they’re fairly bright, they would make for nice ambiance or just a nightlight for the hallway. The Comenzar LED candles are a great product for sure, I like them a lot, and this three pack is less expensive than buying all three individually.The remote can control all three candles at the same time which is nice for convenience sake but if you want to control them individually you can’t, to me it doesn’t mater much as I like all three on at the same time. The candles look and feel real thanks to the wax outer layer, in the dark you can’t tell unless you get up close.I have to say I’ve reviewed a lot of these candles lately and I do like them, they’re neat and they do look real. The others I’ve reviewed I’ve given away as gifts and those people were very happy with them but this set of three I’ll be keeping for myself!Pros:+One remote to control all three+Looks like real candle when lit or on+Less expensive than buying individually+Timer and remote control with numerous functions+Real wax, feels like real candleCons:-No scent like a real candleDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The mandoline comes packaged well with bubble wrap for protection. This is a mandoline and a storage box, all the accessories are shipped in the box. Once you get everything unpacked you’ll find a bag with three blades in it, safety food guide, clear box, peeler and the mandoline itself.They do include a free bonus peeler but it’s really cheaply made, the whole handle crushes when you squeeze it. The safety guide or food holder as they call it isn’t the best as the metal prongs stick out farther than they need to and once you get so far down on the food as you’re cutting the prongs scrape the plastic mandoline and scratch it and scrap pieces off into your food. Not good at all.There are four blades included, three on the side and one already installed for you. You’ll get a two grating blades, big and small, a flat blade and a julienne blade. The blades are very hard to get off and on to switch them, I’ll be honest, I was afraid I was going to cut myself while trying to switch the blades out. It’s just too difficult to switch them out and not safe at all.The main part, of the actual mandoline isn’t the best quality at all. There are extra pieces of plastic hanging off of it in various places, it just looks really unfinished and it feels flimsy overall.You’re supposed to be able to adjust the thickness of your cut with a dial or wheel on the top near the handle but it’s virtually impossible to move at all. It just won’t move at all with one finger or two or however I try to turn it. When it first arrived it moved slightly, very hard to turn, but after using it only twice it won’t turn anymore at all. I only used it to get some potatoes and then some carrots, and there’s nothing it, it’s clean but yet the dial will no turn. If you can’t turn the dial then you can’t adjust the thickness which means you basically can’t use the mandoline anymore unless you get it stuck on a thickness you always want to use… So it worked twice for me and now I can’t use it anymore. The deck or surface has adjustment lines on it so you can gauge the thickness of the cuts when adjusting it but they really don’t line up with anything at all so they’re useless.This is one of those products that I wanted to like and was kind of excited about but it was just a letdown really.The quality is bad, there’s extra pieces of plastic hanging off it, and it just feels cheaply made and flimsy.The blades are very hard to change to the point where it’s safety issue.The adjustment dial was very hard to turn when it first arrived, and now it’s impossible to turn at all, it’s stuck, frozen where it is. It’s clean, there’s nothing in it to stop it from moving, it just won’t move anymore, so the mandoline is rather useless at this point.I’m sorry, overall the Brieftons Mandoline is just a bad product really. Bad design and bad quality controls make it something I would never want in my kitchen or anyone else’s either.As of now it’s going in the garbage, none of it is worth salvaging. My advice, spend a little extra money and get a decent metal mandoline if you’re serious about getting one.I don't understand how this product got 5 star reviews, in all my years of reviewing thousands of products, this has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen. I don't think the 5 star reviewers actuality tested it and used it honestly, unless they got really lucky and got a perfect product.Pros:+Sharp blades+Container to collect cut food+Interchangeable bladesCons:-Very hard to turn thickness dial, now dial won’t move at all-Feels flimsy-Very hard and dangerous to switch blades-Thickness guide is pointless, doesn’t match anything-Peeler is very flimsy and cheaply made-Unfinished, extra pieces of plastic hanging off-Metal prongs stick out too far, scrape mandolinDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"I love Scif-fi, it's probably my most favorite genre of movies with horror and sci-fi/horror coming up next.I like sci-fi because of what it can be, it takes you somewhere where you want to go or where you can possibly go.Mars is where it's at now and Red Planet is a great movie, sure it's not going to win any Oscars but I like sci-fi that shows what can be. Yes it might stretch the imagination a bit and yes it didn't get the greatest reviews of ratings, but I liked it. The movie has a bit of everything, technology, military and they even throw God and religion in the mix and it makes for a movie that's not sure where it's going I think, it's a hodgepodge or things tossed in together but I like it, it's about 2 hours of time I can just sit back and forget about real life.2010 is the sequel to 2001 and it was made way after the original and you can tell. The movie is very much different that the original. 2001 was a great movie but it was slow and rather artsy, but 2010 is more modern and I like it better than the original for the effects and just all of it really. It's a movie that moves at a much faster pace then the original but yet it helps to answer some questions from the original that were left unanswered.Contact was based on a Carl Sagan novel and it's not bad. The pacing is a bit slow at times and there are some things I wish they would have delved into more, but overall it wasn't bad.For three decent sci-fi movies, this collection is well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLXBGKD9QXM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00632KUY0#wasThisHelpful","R1HLXBGKD9QXM0","A3E049PVKG7NDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E049PVKG7NDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The styli come packaged in a heavy duty zip style bag and each is individually wrapped. The pens are mostly black with a colored accent on the tops under the clip. There is red, green, blue, light blue and yellow in the pack. The stylus is on the front and there’s a hole in the center of it where the pen tip comes out when you push the back down. The ink in the pens is black and it seems to write just fine.I used the stylus primarily with my Samsung Galaxy S6 and it worked fine, just like any other I’ve got. I also tried it with a Win10 tablet and an Android tablet, again, fine, no issues.As a stylus these aren’t bad at all I think, they worked fine with my phone and tablets. As a pen it writes well but it’s too lightweight for me personally, I like something that is a little bit heavier. I’ve tested all of them actually and they all write, no issues there.I’m also not sure about the pen/stylus combination where the pen tip comes out of the stylus. Sure it’s convenient but if you happen to forget you’ll be using the pen tip on your phone or tablet. They’re not bad, but they’re not perfect.

"The brush comes packaged in a thick vinyl bag with a note card that has some specs and information about the brush on it. The brush has blue/purple semi-clear plastic handle with a hook on the end and then a wire reinforced top with yellow bristles. The brush is about 9.5 inches long from the hook to the tips of the bristles, about half is handle and half is brush.I’ve been using the brush to clean dishes and pots and pans as you’re supposed to and it works great. The bristles are thick and semi-ridged, they’re ridged enough to scrub and get dirt or food particles off but yet soft enough that they won’t scratch anything. The brush does a great job at cleaning in my opinion. The handle fits in your hand comfortably and offers a good grip on the brush.This is the perfect brush for cleaning my coffee pot. The pot I have is a thermos insulated style as I don’t like the ones that have the heater on the bottom that essentially cooks your coffee all the time so it’s larger that a normal pot. This brush allows me to get right in there and really scrub the pot and all around the edges and inside of the threads for the lid. The brush is also excellent for the filter basket as it has raised sections in it all around in lines radiating from the center point. I can use a regular sponge/scrubby but it takes more work, this brush gets right in there and cleans it efficiently.The only real issue I can see with this brush is the hook on the back, it’s just plastic so I’m not sure how long it will last. It hasn’t broken yet, but only time will tell if it lasts. Yes I do have it hanging up, I found the perfect spot in my kitchen near the sink for it.So far the Amazer brush is a decent product, and it works, again, only time will tell as to its longevity, but as of now I like it.Pros:+Seems well made so far+Works great+Comfortable to useCons:-Not sure about hook, just plastic, might not lastDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The tongs ship in just a basic brown box with the Ohuhu logo on it and inside you’ll just find the tongs and that’s it. You don’t need anything else, if you don’t know what tongs are for or how to use them then I don’t think you need to be buying them…These tongs are about 12 inches long and they’re made of stainless steel and they do feel well made. They do have some weight to them but not as much as you’d expect from something made of stainless.On the back end you’ll find a rubber coated ring which is part of the locking mechanism. You pull it out to lock and push in to unlock and the hole in the ring handy as you can hang them up out of the way. The bottom of the tongs is slightly rounded and curved upward and inward to make it easier to pick things up and to grip them. The upper half of the tongs has a rubber grip to make sure you keep a hold of them. They have a good grip like the name suggests.I use tongs all the time in the kitchen, these are useful for many things and I think they’re like the second or third most used item in my kitchen besides knives and spoons or spatulas. I have several pairs of tongs actually of varying sizes. Some of the tongs I have are with ends that are coated in silicone but sometimes I don’t want that, and these from Ohuhu are not coated so they do have a place in my kitchen.These tongs are very well made and they’re nice and long. They’re not coated so I wouldn’t use them in a non-stick pan but they’d be great for grabbing things out of the oven or BBQ or numerous other uses.Coated and non-coated tongs are useful and I like to have both type in my kitchen.Pros:+Well made+Nice and long+Easy lock and unlock+Rubber gripsCons:-None reallyDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The drop cloth comes packaged in just a plastic bag, but that's fine as it's not fragile, in fact it's very heavy.The material is an off white color, more of a beige look to it maybe. The material is thick, you can't see through it at all and the stitching is thick. You can walk on it and you'll be fine as it shouldn't rip or tear at all.The drop cloth is actually divided into three sections vertically along the cloth with stitching there as well to hold it together.The cloth is large at 12 feet by 15 feet so it should cover most rooms in the average house and it won't have any problem covering furniture and other objects.The cloth is thick and should absorb paint drops or small spills and not soak through.Drop cloths are used to protect and this one should do a good job, but you don't have to use it just for painting, you can use it as a dust cover or even to protect your couch from your pets. This cloth does look very nice and it's presentable, it's not a very rough material, it's semi-soft really.The material used is called 8oz cotton duck or linen canvas and a quick bit of research shows that 8oz cotton duck is considered a medium weight material but it feels heavyweight like the description says it is.The big issue I have with it is that I don't think it's going to fit in my washing machine as it's so large, but that just has nothing to do with the product itself, but it's something you might need to know if you were interested in a large drop cloth.I like it, I'm glad I got it as it will get a lot of use as I do have some remodeling to get done around the house and I usually use old blankets which aren't the best, a real drop cloth is what you need, it's what really does the job to protect your floors or furniture from paint, dust, dirt etc.Disclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The case comes in a clear plastic box and it’s available in many different colors, I got what they call Gray/Camel which the outer covering is a gray canvas color. It’s a diary style case with a magnetic latch on the front. It’s made of canvas and synthetic leather on the outside and it feels well made really.When you open the case the left side has three credit card or id slots and under those is a larger pocket where you can put money or receipts etc. The right side is where you’ll put the phone and it’s made of a TPU or silicone rubber. The top two slots are nice and wide but the third one is very tight, I really couldn’t fit my card in it, it would only go in about half way.The phone fits well the case, you basically just push it in. The case allows access to all ports and buttons and the cut out on the back is nice and large as not to interfere with the camera. The case does offer decent protection for the phone inside and it holds it well.The diary can act like a stand, the case inside is only partly attached and  the back cover folds to make the phone stand up in landscape mode. One small issue here is that I really haven’t even used the case, about a week or so everyday and on the back is very noticeable and rather ugly crease where the case folds to make the stand. I can only assume that as time goes by the crease will get even more noticeable and more ugly as that’s what’s happening already.The Goospery Diary case is a decent case to help protect your phone and allow you to travel light.The case does offer good protection for your phone and access to all ports and buttons.The case isn’t perfect though, there is a not so great looking crease on the back that seems to be getting worse as time goes on. I don’t think the crease does anything to stop the case from protecting your phone, but it just doesn’t look good at all. The crease isn’t that noticeable but it’s become more noticeable as time passes and I’m afraid it’s only going to get worse.Pros:+Well made case+Decent protection+Can just carry phone, id and cards in one caseCons:-Unsightly crease on back of case-Money needs to be folded to fitDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The box is nice looking with a big picture of the battery pack on the front and some basic specs listed on the back. Inside you’ll find the battery wrapped in a soft plastic for protection and then there’s a user guide and thank you care included.The power bank is black and silver in color with a single button on the top for power and a small LED next to it. The led lights up red for charging and green for power. The charger is about 5.25 inches long and about 1.25 inches at its widest point towards the back near the power button. The battery inside is 2800Mah in capacity and it’s big in size, I have smaller portable packs that are larger in capacity that this is. Part of the size is the car adapter and whatever circuitry is is inside of course, but it just seems big for such a small capacity. On the back end you’ll find two USB ports that are colored red, you can charge two things at the same time if you wanted to.I charged the battery pack in my car and charged my phone at the same time and it seemed to work just like any other car charger I have. You need to charge the battery of course in your car before you can use it and that’s fine as you just plug it in while you’re driving and it will charge as you’re on the go. I tested the battery pack and it worked fine with my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. I measured it and it was only producing about 3 watts at about .6 amps. Yes it’s not a fast charger at all, but it will work in an emergency to power your devices for sure. The battery is only 2800mAh in capacity and the Galaxy S6 has a 2550mAh battery so I could charge it fully at least once with the battery pack.The battery charger combination is a neat product in my opinion, I’ve never seen anything like it before and I think it can be very useful.It does have some small issues though, like it’s slow to charge and it’s rather large for the small capacity of the battery.Yes it can be useful though, it can be great in an emergency, use it to charger your phone while on the go and leave it in your car so you then have a emergency battery supply. The charger does seem well made overall and for what it is it’s not a bad product overall.Pros:+Useful combination product+Dual USB ports+Dual use car charger and battery in oneCons:-Slow charge-Large size for capacityDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"So I purchased another inexpensive one of these and very much regretted it as soon as I opened the package, so I had to buy another one and I settled on this one and I'm very happy with this purchase.I use these for actual shower curtains and not just a liner as I like the clear to let extra light in, so this is my shower curtain, I've been been doing this for most of my life actually, using clear liners as curtains.This one has magnets/weights at the bottom to keep it in place and it also has metal grommets or metal reinforced holes at the top so it won't rip easily.My favorite thing about this product is that it's not wispy like less expensive ones are. What I mean is that it doesn't float up and stick to you while you're taking a shower, it stays in place. The last one I had did have weights in it but they didn't matter as it still floated and clung to me so I had to fight with it and keep smacking it away from me while taking a shower, very annoying. This one is great, it does not do that, it stays down while you're taking a shower.All in all I think this shower curtain is nicely made, it feels made of heavy material that should last a long time.I'm very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAHZPO80KW4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LS9UD2M#wasThisHelpful","RVAHZPO80KW4W","A3E049PVKG7NDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E049PVKG7NDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The packaging is a small brown box and inside you’ll find a plastic try holding the earphones in place during shipping and for protection. Once you get everything unpacked you’ll find the earphones, user manual, extra sized bud covers and a carrying bag with spring style top closure.They’re wooden so they’re very lightweight and they seem well made overall. I don’t see any marking on them for right and left sides though.In-line you’ll find the remote control with a single multifunction button on the top and then the microphone on the bottom. The button is one press for play/pause, twice quickly to skip or twice and hold to fast forward, three times quickly to go back or three times and hold to rewind. For calls the controls are one press to answer/end and hold for 2 seconds to decline call. At the end of the earphones you’ll find a gold plated 3.5mm connector that’s reinforced with metal above it.I tested these with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Android phone and the controls on the remote worked as they should. I’m not sure I like the one button for everything, but it does work and I guess that’s what matters most here.Sound quality is not the best, bass heavy music produces a lot of distortion at even medium high volume levels. There does seem to be a good balance of bass and treble overall, but they just seem to be able to handle heavy bass.As far as comfort, they’re not comfortable at all really, and they don’t stay in my ears. I tried different sized earbud covers and they just didn’t seem to want to stay in my ears.The FSL Xylem earphones aren’t bad for the price but they aren’t great either.Sound quality leaves a bit to be desired and they’re not really comfortable either, at least for me they weren’t.Pros:+Inexpensive+Seem well made+Remote works with AndroidCons:-Not quite comfortable-Distortion at med high volume levels-Not sure about single button for everythingDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"If you have bed bugs this is the stuff you want to use. Do not bother with sprays or anything else as they only work when they are wet, as soon as they dry they are no longer effective.No more bed bugs for me, where they came from I don't know, but I was not happy when I woke up with bites on me one day all of the sudden. I have insomnia and bed bugs did not help that at all, they made it much worse. I could barely sleep just thinking about them crawling on me and drinking my blood like little vampires. I hate them, I wish there was a way to eradicate them from the entire world.Anyway, off on a tangent there, this stuff is great, I've tried gallons of pump sprays and aerosols and they did not work, just waste of money. And then I read about this stuff and figured I tried everything else so why not try this too and it worked! I'm so happy to get a good nights sleep.You will need gloves and a mask/respirator and something to apply it with. I picked up a large glass cheeses shaker from my local dollar store and it worked perfectly for application. (see picture).If you have bed bugs this is the stuff you want. Yes it might require 2-3 cycles of application and vacuum but it's worth it to be rid of these nasty pests and this stuff is safe for pets.A highly recommended product for sure, it really works, and I'm vary happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151OJQ7FUJHS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q0DM82#wasThisHelpful","R151OJQ7FUJHS7","A3E049PVKG7NDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E049PVKG7NDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I don't know where they came from but I ended up with bed bugs. I hate these things, I don't mind other bugs, they're just a natural part of life but in my opinion bed bugs have no place in the grand scheme of things or the circle of life as it were. I hate them, I hate waking up with little marks on my arms and neck and then having to try and hide them from view as they are embarrassing. I sleep on the couch often as wife and I keep different schedules and I'm kind of an insomniac, only sleep 4-5 hours per night usually so that interrupts her sleeping routines and it's just easier for me to sleep on the couch when I'm not tired at bed time. Bed bugs did not help my insomnia at all, they made it worse as I didn't want to go to sleep as all I could think about was those things crawling on me and sucking my blood while I was sleeping. Anyway, we ended up with bed bugs in our couch somehow and I bought two gallons of pump style spray killer and I even bought the aerosol kind and none of it seemed to work. Two gallons on the couch and floor and walls should have done the trick and it didn't, was fine for a few days but then woke up again with bites on me. Yes I saw them too so I know they were there as I ripped everything apart to clean everything yet again.I was at my wits end with these things but then I found out about diatomaceous earth and I'm so happy I did, no more bed bugs. I've gone weeks now with no bites.The only thing is that you need to a way to apply it and you need a good dust mask or respirator for the application process and rubber gloves as well. This stuff will dry out your hands, but some lotion and you'll be fine. I also have pets and the other spray stuff wasn't the best with them, but this stuff is safe for them as well so that's a plus there.I ended up grabbing a large sized glass cheese shaker from the local dollar store and it works great for application of this stuff. (see picture)It did take a couple applications, I just wanted to be sure. Applied it, let it sit for a few days, vacuumed everything and reapplied, did this every week for three weeks and no more bed bugs. Yes it might seem like a hassle, but it was well worth the time and effort to me to be able to sleep peacefully. You need to make sure that you apply to floors and walls as you never know where they'll hide, and any crack you see and on and under baseboards too.I'm happy, no more bed bugs, well worth the price for sure. I wish I would have learned about this stuff before spending lots more time and money on other pesticides that didn't work.This is a highly recommended product to get rid of bed bugs inexpensively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QKJ2BMGA976T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TJ5UOE#wasThisHelpful","R3QKJ2BMGA976T","A3E049PVKG7NDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E049PVKG7NDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The bracelet just ships in a plastic bag and that’s fine as it’s not exactly breakable, it’s just nylon essentially. The bracelet is black in color and has plastic clasps or buckles on each end. One end has a magnesium bar and whistle in it and the other has a scraper/knife built-into it.The magnesium bar does have black paint on it so you’ll need to scrape it off before trying to use it to expose the magnesium and it will produce sparks with the included scraper with a bit of work. The scraper is very small and it’s not sharp at all, I would sharpen it but being so small it can take a lot of work and patience.As far as fit, for me it was a perfect fit, not too big and not too small. I’ve purchased inexpensive paracord bracelets before and they were too small for me, but this on is fine. The clasp locks well and holds firm.So I have a lot of paracord floating around, expensive and inexpensive versions as I like to use it and make things from it. I had to cut this bracelet open to check the insides of it to make sure it was real and it is what it says it is, it isn’t. The listing says it’s 7 strand paracord but it’s not, it’s only 6 strand. Real 7 strand paracord should have 7 individual strands inside of the outer sheath but I only found six when I cut it open. They may consider the outer sheath as part of that number, but that’s not correct at all.The cord seems decent overall though, it’s thick and slightly stiff like paracord should be. It’s real paracord, so that’s a plus there as some inexpensive bracelets like these aren’t.I did fully unravel the bracelet  and measure the cord length and it’s slightly over 120 inches or a bit more than 10 feet in length which can be useful for lots of things surely.I have bought inexpensive paracord bracelets before and I can say this one is better quality overall than those are so for the price it’s worth it even though it’s not 7 strand paracord.Yes it’s not 7 strand paracord, but it’s advertised as 7 strand so I’m not sure what to do with that little fact as it’s not a bad product in spite of being only 6 strand.Pros:+Fits well, good size+Good quality overall+Can be useful surelyCons:-Not 7 strand paracord-Blade/scraper is not sharp at allDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The packaging for the O2 Hurricane is a nice sturdy box and inside you’ll find the Hurricane, power supply/charger, accessory bag and two straight plastic tubes. One thing you’ll notice is missing is the instructions, not sure why they didn’t include instructions. I should also note that I’m not sure the accessory pack was supposed to be included or not, so you may get one, or you may not.The O2 Hurricane I bought was the Industrial version in the color yellow that is supposed to be able to produce over 220 MPH wind speeds. I do have an anemometer but it only goes up to 99.9mph and the Hurricane does at least that according to my anemometer. The Hurricane is about the size of a regular can of compressed air, it’s 8 inches tall and about 3.5 inches at the widest part measuring from the back to the front of the nozzle and it’s about 2 inches thick. It is much heavier than canned air at about 18 ounces, but that’s to be expected as it does have a battery and blower inside of it. I’m not sure of the battery capacity, the specs only list that it’s a 12v NiMH battery.On the bottom of the back is the charging connection and then the front has a nice large trigger to activate the blower.It does need to charge for at least 10 hours before the first use which I found out by going to the O2 website. The charger has an LED on it that will turn green when charging is complete. Charging can take between 4-6 hours, but it all depends of course as to how much battery is left as to how long it will really take.As far as noise levels, it’s much louder than canned air is. I measured it and got about 77db at one foot distance which isn’t really that loud, like an alarm clock or loud music, but it can be annoying using for long periods and I wouldn’t want to use it at night when people in the house are sleeping.The accessory pack includes a small angled nozzle to compress the airflow to allow for greater force which works well. The brush attachment is very useful, I’ve found myself using it frequently. There’s also a flexible extension so you can get into hard to reach areas which can be useful. They’re all mad of plastic but they feel well mad and sturdy for what they are.As far as the attachments, I only really use the brush and the nozzle, every one in a while I use the flexible extension but I don’t think I’ve ever used the two tube ones at all besides just trying them out the first time, they just don’t do much at all.The O2 Hurricane is a useful product for sure, but it’s not going to totally replace canned air sadly. I was hoping it would, but maybe someday something will.In my time with the O2 Hurricane I’ve come to like it and use it as a supplement to canned chemical compressed air. It won’t replace canned air, but it can help you use less of it. I still buy and use canned air, but I use both as I’ve found the O2 Hurricane does have its uses. I use it for bigger things and I especially like the brush attachment to help get dirt and dust out and off of things. The O2 Hurricane can’t really clean things like a CPU heat sink or a video card heat sink, it just doesn’t move enough air and it won’t fit between the fins so I have to use the canned air for those types of jobs.The point is that you can save money with the O2 Hurricane, I buy less canned air now as I use it less since I got the O2 Hurricane.So there’s really one question to ask here and that’s will it replace canned air? The answer is no it won’t, but it can save you money overall though if use in conjunction with it.Pros:+Well made product+Includes useful attachments+Can save you money+Moves quite a bit of air overallCons:-Rather loud-No instructions included-Won’t replace canned chemical air-ExpensiveDisclosure: I purchased this product for my personal use and thought a review would benefit other consumers in making an informed purchasing decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11E6F4PCRKILW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEAFW00#wasThisHelpful","R11E6F4PCRKILW","A3E049PVKG7NDK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E049PVKG7NDK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The packaging is just a plastic bag which is fine as it’s just a piece of cloth and it’s not exactly fragile. The bag has numerous examples on it of how to wear or use the wrap.It is large at about 19 inches by 9 1/2 inches in dimensions and it’s tube shaped to go around your head and neck. There is no seam which I like a lot, it’s solid and one piece. The material is thin yes but I found that it’s actually warm. The skull design is located about half of the way down the warp, the bottom of it is at about the halfway point in the cloth overall. The wear it as a skull over your own face you’ll need to fold down the top half inside and this works to double to layer to keep you warmer but you can still breathe through it.The skull design reminds me of a vampire with the fanged teeth. It also remind me of the mask from the video game Call of Duty, so it can be a few things really.So I wore it as you’re supposed to. When you fold it down to the top of the skull design it should then line up with your nose it looks like you’ve got a skull face. Not much else to it really.I like this product a lot, it’s got a great design and it’s large enough to keep your face and neck warm.The material does seem thin but it’s actually quite warm especially since it’s basically double layered on your face. It’s already started to get cold here off and on and one day was 32F with wind chill in the upper 20’s and I made sure to try it that day and it did keep my face nice and warm and it kept the cold wind out.I see nothing wrong with this product myself, it works as advertised and looks good.Only time will tell if it’s made to last though.Pros:+Skull design+Thin but yet warm material+Big enough to keep neck and face warmCons:-None that I could findDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The toy comes wrapped in plastic for shipping and when you open it you’ll find a cardboard tag attached to it.The Foxy Dog toy is pretty big at about 23 inches long and about 5 inches across the body. The body is just one big air bladder or the squeaker and the tail crinkles like cellophane so it has two noise makers in it really. The tail is very soft and furry while the body has what feels like corduroy material over it.I think the Foxy Dog is cute, it really does look like a Fox and it seems well made. There is no funny smell to it like some toys have I’ve noticed.I have two Pit Bulls and they love toys but you never know what they’re going to do with it.Samantha is a smaller one, she’s dark brown, and she loves toys, she’s like a little kid really and she was very happy to play with it and with me with it.Casey is Sam’s sister and she is bit more laid back and relaxed and I never know what she’ll do with a toy. She has some stuffed animals in her sleeping cage that she has had for about two years now as she protects them and sleeps with them but she has this thing about squeakers she has to get them out and at first it didn’t seem like she was going to do that with the Fox but about ten minutes later the fox was dead, she ripped the squeaker out and chewed it apart.So we now have the fox minus the squeaker and I can still play with it with Sam as she likes the crinkly tail and likes to chase it with me pulling it. She’s weird as she kind of acts like cat almost chasing things around but the fox might be down but he’s not out, he’s just a lot thinner now.So did my dogs like it? Yes they loved it.Will it hold up to a Pitt Bull? Nope, not at all, but I didn’t expect it to as there’s not much that can hold up to one.I was hoping this might be one of those toys that my dog Casey would like and want to snuggle and protect but she couldn’t resist the squeaker, she just has to get them out for whatever reason.The Pheenx Pets Foxy dog toy is a cool toy, I like it and so do my dogs but depending on your dog it might not last long.To be fair it’s not sold as something rugged and indestructible and it was an experiment on my part to see how my dogs would react to it. They liked it yes, but sadly Casey liked it a bit too much. I spend a lot of money on dog toys for my dogs and sometimes it lasts for ten minutes like the Foxy Dog and some they have for years, you just never know how they'll react.I think the Foxy Dog is a five star toy myself, and yes my dogs love it, they loved it a bit too much obviously though. Even though the squeaker is gone they still do play with it and like it. Casey doesn't care much about it now that the squeaker is gone, but Sam is more than happy to still play with it as she does like the crinkly tail.Pros:+Very cute+Well made+Inexpensive+LargeCons:-Doesn’t stand up to a Pitt BullDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The package for these clips is just a heavy duty zip style bag which works fine.The clips themselves are white in color and remind me little seashells really. They are open on both ends and have a wavy line going across the top center. On the back you’ll find squares of 3M adhesive tape so you can mount the organizers permanently if need be.The clips open up in the center and they snap shut with an audible snapping sound. They close tightly but not very tight, more then tight enough to hold a cable in place though. To use the clips you just open them up, put a cable in and then snap them closed. Very simple to use.I don’t have enough room on my desk so I actually have a table next to my desk for overflow. I’ve been using a binder clip for my cables and it sits between the desk and table and rests in that space. It’s worked for years for me, but it’s not the nicest system.I decided to do something similar to my binder clip by sticking two Mudder clips together with their adhesive tape back to back. The clips are nice and fat so they will not fall between my desk and table and it looks a  lot nicer than the binder clip for sure. That’s off to my right side where the computer is. I’m going to do it again with two more cables as soon as I get around to running the cables back  behind my computer and under the table.I recently got a very nice 10 foot micro USB cable for review and I decided to use that on the left side of my desk as I keep my tablet over there normally. The cable was just sitting there loosely on my desk but I decided to use one of the clips and attach it to the bottom of the shelf I have there. Now the cable hangs from the shelf and it’s out of the way. When I need it I just pull it down and then I can tuck it back up there when I’m done and it’s out of the way. The adhesive is fine for mounting the clip upside down, it seems to be staying there just fine and it’s been there for a couple weeks now.  The clip closes tightly enough to hold the cable in it just fine and the opening is wide enough that the cable easily slides in and out of it as I need it.I love using things other than what they’re for. These clips are most likely made to be stuck to a flat surface on your desk and they just stay there permanently but I decided to do something different with them and it works fine for me.These clips can be used for lots of things. You could stick them to your desk and they’ll hold your cables. You could stick them to a wall to hold a networking cable for example, or you could do what I did and do something different.The clips seems well made, the spring is good enough to hold the cables in place and the holes are large enough to allow the cables to easily slip through them.I love these, and I think I need to get some more.As of right now these are ten dollars for five of them and that’s about two dollars each. It might seem expensive, but it all depends on how useful you’ll find them. I think they’re worth it, I like them, they do what I need them to do and they look nice.Pros:+Easy to use+Well made+Good adhesiveCons:-None that I could findDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

One side is a standard female USB connection like you would find on your computer for example. The other side is a male micro USB connector.I tested the adapter with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Android phone, an Android tablet and a Windows 10 tablet and all three recognized it and could read and write to and from USB drives so I would have to say it works just fine.It’s a very simple product that is very handy for me.It works with the devices I tested it with, I could read and write to and from USB flash drives and that’s what I wanted it for.I also used it as an adapter with my Windows tablet to use a wireless mouse with it and it worked as well.

"The cases comes packaged in bubble wrap and then each one is individually wrapped in a plastic bag and they have cardboard inside of them to help them keep their shape.The colors in this pack are pink, blue, yellow, gray and clear. Each case has cut-outs for the ports and camera along with protrusions where the buttons are to make it easier to feel them.All of the cases are slightly textured on the inside to make sure your phone stays put and it’s not scratched. The tops or backs of the cases are very smooth and glossy while the inside is more of a semi-gloss finish.These cases are for the Samsung Galaxy S6 specifically but Pvendor does have cases for other phones as well.The cases fit very well on the Galaxy S6 and they allow easy access to all the ports, buttons and camera. The cases slightly come up over the edge of the phone to protect the edges and the camera area is cut open wide to make sure it’s not obstructing the camera at all.  The cases are very thin and don’t really add much bulk or any weight really to the phone. Even though they’re thin they should do a decent job of protecting the phone from daily life and keep it looking nice and new.The Pvendor Silicone cases for the Samsung Galaxy S6 are very inexpensive. If you’re looking for a cheap case you could pay as much for a single one as you would for this five pack so it’s a great deal really and you could have one for every day of the work week so you don’t wear them out and for something different.I could complain about some tiny extra bits of silicone here and there on the cases but for this price I don’t expect perfection and it just comes right off very easily.These aren’t bad cases overall, they do offer a basic level of protection, just don’t expect them to protect your phone if you drop it.Pros:+Very inexpensive+Really doesn’t add bulk to the phone at all+Decent basic protection+Multiple colors in one pack+Access to all ports and buttons is unobstructedCons:-None reallyDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

These are 6.6ft or about 2 meters in length.For testing I charged things and I’m happy to report that the small connector worked great with the Otterbox case I have on my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone.

"The packaging for the microUSB cables is just a heavy duty zipper style bag that is white on one side and clear on the other.

"The Lux Essentials French press kit ships in an attractive box and indie you’ll find the press well protected by lots of bubble wrap and on the side you’ll see the extra screen and basic instructions for usage. The measuring spoon ships inside of the press and it’s just black plastic but it’s fine for what it is and what it needs to do.The press itself is two pieces essentially, the top and plunger combination and the carafe section. The carafe section is made of borosilicate glass to withstand the heat and it’s see through which is something I just love so you can se the coffee inside being brewed. On the outside of the carafe is a stylized black handle that goes all the way around it, it makes for a great looking French press really. The handle is attached to the carafe and I’m not yet if I like that or not as cleaning might be an issue.The top is solid except for the strainer or pouring section which is actually fairly tightly spaced so it will also help to filter out any coffee grounds that might get through the screen.The bottom of the plunger is the screen and spring section. The screen isn’t just flat, it curves up along the sides of the spring and the spring keeps tension on the screen against the glass sides of the carafe to keep the grounds where they should be, not in your coffee.According to the instructions you need to use two tablespoons of coffee per eight ounce cup of water, more or less depending on taste preferences. I like my coffee strong so I used a little more. The water should be hot but not boiling, you can boil the water on the stove and then let it sit for 20 to 30 seconds and then add it to the coffee in the carafe.Once the hot water is in you just put the lid on making sure the strainer opening is towards the back to keep the heat in and then you just let it sit for about four minutes. Here again you can let it brew for a longer or shorter amount of time depending on your taste preferences.Once the time is up you slowly push the plunger down to separate the coffee grounds from the now brewed coffee and then it’s ready to drink.It’s a great cup of coffee. The first thing you’ll notice is the taste, there’s just a huge difference in taste between using a French press and using an automatic drip coffee maker. The first time I used a French press I was honestly amazed, I didn’t believe that what people said about them, I didn’t think there could be that much of a difference but there really is. It’s a totally different cup of coffee, taste and even the texture it seems like is different.Clean up is easy overall, it’s glass so the grounds just come out easily enough, but it’s still a bit messy, at least messier than a drip coffee maker is.Sometimes grounds can get stuck between the metal plate and the screen on the bottom of the plunger and you just hold the base and unscrew the plunger handle slightly to loosen it to make a gap for water to flow through to remove the grounds. This is also how you change the screen as well, just unscrew the plunger all the way and the whole thing comes apart.The Lux Essentials French press makes a a great cup of coffee and that’s all you need to know! Seriously though this French press is excellent is pretty much every way I can think of.I’m not sure about the fact that the glass carafe is attached to the handle as far as cleaning it, but only time will tell I guess, for now it works fine, but I just thought it was worth mentioning.I love the glass carafe, I really like being able to see what’s going on inside, it just makes the whole process more interesting really.I don’t think I’ve ever seen any other French presses that come with an extra screen, but then again I really didn’t look either, but it’s nice they included one and the spoon is a nice bonus as well.If you want a good cup of coffee then you need to try a French press and this one from Lux Essentials is a great place to start.Pros:+Makes a great cup of coffee+Well made+Comes with extra screen and spoonCons:-None reallyDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The packaging is bright and colorful and there’s instructions on the back for you if you’ve never used a whetstone. Once you unpack the box you won’t find anything except the stone and a rubber non-slip base for it. The stone is 7 1/16” long by 2 5/16” wide and about 1 3/16” tall. It’s a stone so it’s rather heavy at about 1.4 pounds but that’s to be expected.The stone is divided in half horizontally in beige/yellow and gray. The top layer is 1000grit or fine for just honing your knives and the bottom layer is a rough 240grit for repairing and/or putting an edge on very dull knives.For testing I sharpened my knives, chef and pocket knives and it worked great.Yes the nice white or beige side of the stone will get dirty looking, but that’s just how it is and for the most part it’s fairly to clean off with just a little water and a soft cloth.To use a whetstone, the main thing is patience and then practice and yes if you’ve never used on there is a chance you may mess up the blade on your knives but it can be fixed so no need to panic.A whetstone is spelled with an ‘h’ in there but you actually do get it wet, the best thing to do is soak it in water for about five to ten minutes or so before using it. The main reason you do it is lubrication, you can use oil on a whetstone but if you do you never can use water again. Water is more readily available and it’s just cleaner to work with I think, less mess, less oily residue on things, so that’s always what I use.It may seem like a daunting process and I know a lot of people don’t like them because they’re basically afraid of them because they require more work but in the end it’s very much worth it.I have two steels for honing and sharpening my knives and I do have another stone but just single grit. A dual grit stone is nicer to have, especially one like this as it has fine and rough right there for you ready to go.If you’re a chef or if you’re serious in the kitchen and have decent knives then you owe it to yourself and your knives to get a good whetstone to keep them at their best.The Priority Chef whetstone is an excellent choice for keeping your knives maintained and sharp as it offers both rough and fine grit in on stone. Yes it won’t last as long as a single grit stone will since it’s basically just half, but you’ll still get a few years out of it surely.Some of my knives are over twenty years old and they’re still great knives and that’s because I take care of them by maintaining them and this whetstone from Priority Chef will help me keep them for hopefully another 20 yearsPros:+Dual grit+Non-slip base+Well madeCons:-None that I could findDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"The packaging has a rugged look to it with a window on the front and inside you’ll find the speaker in a plastic tray for protection. Once you get everything unpacked you’ll find user guide, cloth drawstring carry bag, microUSB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable.The speaker is green and black in color and it looks virtually the same on both sides except the front has the AYL logo on it. The green goes all the way around the outside and it’s actually rubber to help protect it from falls. The front and back have metal grills protecting the five watt speaker inside.Attached to the speaker is a thick heavy duty rubber wrist strap that actually held on by a screw so you could take it off it you wanted to.On the top edge of the speaker is the control panel where you’ll see buttons for power, volume down, play/pause/answer call and volume up labeled buttons.  The volume up and down buttons actually work to skip forward and back tracks too, you need to hold them in for it to activate.On the left side of the speaker thick rubber door that covers over the microUBS charging port and the 3.5mm audio input jack.The bottom actually has a threaded hole for mounting on a bike or wherever if you wanted to.In the top corner of the front of the speaker is a small LED that lights up blue for Bluetooth and red for charging.I used the speaker with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Android phone and it worked perfectly fine, I had no problems connecting it over Bluetooth.The controls worked for all the functions, I could skip tracks and adjust the volume easily.The sounds is actually very good for most all music I tried. The speaker can get very loud, I mean very loud and it actually vibrates when the volume is up. For most music the sound was very clear even at max volume, it was only when I played music that was very bass heavy that the sound started to get slightly distorted, but it wasn’t very badly distorted. I just lowed the volume ever so slightly and it was fine. Overall the sound is very good.This AYL speaker is IPX5 certified meaning you could  shower with it if you wanted to, IPX5 means protected from water jets essentially according to the official code. This also means you can take it camping, hiking, bike riding in the rain and still have music while on the go. No it’s not submersion proof but if you did drop in water you just need to let it dry fully before using it again.The speaker is Bluetooth 4.0 enabled and that means more features and more range basically. The range you get varies on what types of material are in the way so theoretically you can get up to 33 feet of range with nothing blocking the signal.The battery inside is 1500mAh and according to specs it should provide up to 12 hours of play time at 80% volume.The AYL speaker is a great product for outdoor use surely, I can see myself taking it with me camping or hiking with no worries about something happening to it. So no matter where you day takes you this speaker should survive most any situation.Pros:+Very well made+Great sounding+Very loudCons:-Slight distortion at high volume with heavy bassDisclosure: This product was given to me for review by the company for review purposes only for free or at a discounted price, and is not considered by me as payment for the review.

"I started this book with some hesitation.  This book is a bundle of 3 novellas in a series.  There were some negative reviews on the first novella that made me pause: attack and takeover of a human spaceship purely for enslaving the human women, the men are killed and the older women put out to pasture as house servants, younger women unwilling to mate are to be forced into prostitution.  In other words, with that kind action I was wondering how I could find anything redeeming in the ""hero.""But, I am a sucker for the Mars Needs Women storyline and generally enjoy Mina Carter's works, so I took the plunge and bought this book.  By the way, I do recommend waiting until the whole storyline on a character has come out rather than reading piecemeal; I think he frustration factor over cliffhangers and feeling unsatisfied over too little story will be resolved.  Any way, the hero's race of Lathar warriors do redeem themselves - they quickly realize that humans are equally intelligent and fierce as themselves and in the end are seen as equals.  Also, I didn't read detail that the Lathar ruthlessly killed the men but rather just sent them away.  BUT  despite this, there are a few troubling aspects to the Lathar race which prevents me from giving this a full 5 stars:- the Lathar kidnap females from a less intelligent race for procreate and sexual relief.  The less intelligent race is cow like looking.  There's some major wrongs and ick factor there:  preying upon and enslaving another race, having sexual relations with another being that it feels kind of like bestiality - ugh- so if there aren't enough human females to go around I can only guess that they'll continue to enslave the above race or seek other races to do the same - this is deplorableHopefully the author can quickly turn around the two points above, cuz it ain't pretty.  Cloning does make more sense and it's brought up in the storyline so why wasn't it more pursued?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MANCCBIQGCFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RCH66M#wasThisHelpful","R1MANCCBIQGCFH","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very rarely do I give such a low review, but this was so disappointing.  I was looking forward to reading about a romance that started with a translator and a Russian hockey player.  I was looking forward to funny conversations/incidences as a result of translations as well as hearing some Russian words for that added mysterious romantic feeling.  Uh no, turns out the guy is fluent in English so while there were a few incidences of learning Russian culture, it felt like a regular American NA romance.As another reviewer noted, the author didn't follow-up enough with characters and situations which she would introduce and she introduced too many on top of that.  This could have been a much more interesting story if the author hadn't tried to introduce so many angles to the h's life....spoilers starting so stop reading if this bothers you----------Here are all the elements that are introduced into the heroine's life- ex soccer superstar- mother murdered but murderer never found, plus heroine was present during murder?- heroine always feels abandoned although her grandparents seemed to be loving, caring albeit unwilling to discuss her deceased mother- discovers she has a biological brother- becomes a lead singer for a band- currently studying to be a social worker and has started one community outreach center and trying to start a 2nd- does Russian translation as a side job for her grandfather which is how she meets the hero- full time college student- part-time waitressIn other words, the heroine has way too many activities.  It's like the author wanted to stuff the storyline with every fantasy or scene she thought would be interesting, but wasn't vested enough to write about these activities/interests/situations comprehensively.  I think if she did, it would have made for an extremely long book.  Really, if she had just played up the translation aspect with the heroine being a full time student that would have been plenty and the story would have been more realistic and interesting.  Okay throw in the band part as you need a reason for jealousy.  I became particularly annoyed with the half-axxed approach to fleshing out a scene when you read about the heroine getting roofed by someone she can identify - not cool to blow something like this off so casually, the perpetrator should have been identified to the police or in the very least, there should have been more reaction by the heroine not just a ""ooh ick"" response.The reason for the hero breaking up with the heroine was lame.  He professed to being so head over heels in love with her and he drops her because of a poem she wrote where she disses him but the poem was written way before they even started dating/expressing an interest in each other.  And he stays away from her for 2 months!  Come on, that's a combined wuss/jerk move.I had such hopes for this book and really wish I had given more credence to the 3 star and below reviews, but I was relying so much on an endorsement from an author whose NA books I had really enjoyed.  Guess she must have been a pal or maybe they share the same publisher and she was compelled to write a good review on her blog.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308Z8QI1AMD14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R308Z8QI1AMD14","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heroine and hero in this story were very interesting and 3 dimensional.  The heroine is good natured, constantly hungry, brave, and quick thinking.  The hero is caring, brave, smart and believable.  Unlike the first book in this series, this story was a mystery where the h/H spent time trying to find out who committed the murders which the hero is being suspected of.  You do have to suspend your belief a bit about how the heroine from the first book is able to hack so easily into security cameras, but hey, it's fiction so I'm okay with this NA modern version of Nancy Drew.I loved the depiction of the heroine's hippie mother and that the author brought back the heroine from the first book as a side character.  I think you should read the first book of this series though to totally appreciate this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA76WA72SV7H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6P9DXY#wasThisHelpful","RA76WA72SV7H6","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first book by this author and definitely not my last.  She did a fantastic job of keeping true to the nerd (read female Sheldon Cooper of Big Bang Theory) girl who can't help but voice her logical thoughts over being tactful.  I also liked the introduction of the friends she makes.  A lastly, I really enjoyed reading about her prank playing family - very cute and endearing.Reason for just 3 1/2 stars:  ehh, the hero.  I never felt his personality.  He felt very much of a side character who just reacted rather than initiated action.  He felt very bland to me and thus not interesting.  I found it very unbelievable that he had been a virgin at 21 and supposedly being so hot that all the girls on campus were drooling for him.Despite the hero feeling lackluster and unbelievable, there's enough good about this book that makes we want to read more from this author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2US7JWB9DOZRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTJQRNW#wasThisHelpful","R2US7JWB9DOZRD","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Penny Reid was a co-author so I had high hopes, but no such luck.  The intelligent, original humor of Reid wasn't present.  The biggest problem with this book was the heroine - she doesn't have an endearing personality quirk like Janie, but more of a personality disorder that cries out for her to have therapy.  While a child, the heroine has been abandoned twice in her life and as such has never formed personal ties with anyone for fear of future rejection.  The hero is amazingly patient and unfathomably interested in her.  I say unfathomably, because she doesn't strike me as that special.  In fact, I found her judgemental and desperately in need of growing up.  She is depicted of having this incredibly successful blog, a la gossip column style, where she takes snaps of celebs or celeb lookalikes and pokes fun at them - all doing so anonymously.  Taking potshots at people without supplying your real identity? Uh, that's a combination of cowardice and bullying in my POV.  There's supposed to be this saving grace to her blog in that she helps raise money for charity - don't care, it doesn't make it right.The story started off as 4 star, then went to 3 star as I couldn't believe the hero would be interested in her.  Aside from being good at her job (uh, how does a recluse become so smart about PR?  that's another loss of a star for me), you don't see any evidence of her being charming, engaging, or interesting.  I kept waiting for her not to come across as a pathetic shut-in and the way she is such a hypocrite in her dealings with the hero towards the end  - I wanted here not to be a HEA as she is so unworthy.I do disagree with the criticisms of some reviewers about the amount of sex and BDSM.  Eh, for romances these days, the amount of sex written I didn't find excessive.  I really dislike BDSM and was happily surprise to find out that the hero just likes to secure her arms and thankfully there is no hitting or weird toys involved between the two of them.Anyway, please don't judge the author, Penny Reid, by this book (oh and avoid her Friends with Benefits book too) all the other books I've written by her are ""intelligent romantic comedies.""

The heroine is fantastic and not cookie cutter - she's heroic and funny but not boringly goody two-shoes.

"I've read the other books in this series and actually read this one out-of-order as I always found Elizabeth the least interesting of the knitting group.  Should have clued into that as well as the low starred reviews from fellow Reid fans.  Yikes, where is the Reid humor and endearing heroine?  Elizabeth is a major B.  I wanted Nico to kick her to the curb.  The guy tells her how he honestly feels early on and she just keeps stomping on his feelings.  Maybe if his bullying behavior had been more recent, but not only was it 10 years ago but during their last summer together, he was incredibly loving to her and so to me  they moved beyond his mean boy high school behavior.She doesn't even strike me as a particularly good doctor.  She doesn't first try to communicate with her patient, Nico's niece, but instead talks to the people around her - terrible bedside manner.The only good thing in this book was when Sandra appeared, but not enough to overcome the unlikable heroine.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWHSY08S7D6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJJN0WC#wasThisHelpful","RBWHSY08S7D6D","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read almost all of Penny Reid's knitting series and thought I'd give this NA romance a try.  I think parts 1 & 2 represent Reid at her apex for writing a smart, honest, quirky, original female character coupled with a growling, over-the-top rich, handsome alpha.  Kathleen, the heroine, says the most endearing and funny things.  I loved her best friend, Sam who was supportive but never meddling.  Reid really excels in writing comedy and heroines whom you want to cheer for in addition to their supportive female BFFs.  There are the some unbelievable parts to her characterization such as the hero not being more screwed up as a result of his appalling parents and  Kaitlyn not being more savvy/experienced about life and wealthy people since she is the daughter of illustrious parents.Stop reading if you don't want to read anything spoilerish:If parts 1 & 2 hadn't started with a certain characterization of Kaitlyn being so smart and funny, then I wouldn't have been so disappointed by part 3. Kaitlyn isn't cute/quirky/smart but rather too self-absored and quite frankly epically stupid to all of Martin's signal flares indicating he wants to get back together. I know some reviewers expressed discontent. that Kaitlyn and Martin were apart for so long in part 3, but thought that made their HEA much more believable.  They did need time to develop some crucial personal life interests while apart from each other and I don't think it would have happened if they were still together.  But aside from that, I agree with the other reviewers that Kaitlyn is aggravating in her blindness.  Also, I felt she should have been much more sympathetic to Martin's desire for revenge - if you had the devil for the father, maybe the only way to exorcise him is to take away his power.  An epilogue where you see the couple say 5 years in the future would have been nice a nice way to bring closure to this romance.  It's such a pity that this story, which started off with such a witty, interesting heroine, becomes a more angsty ""finding herself"" and at times self-righteous heroine for most of part 3.I hope the next elements book is on Sam, she sounds really interesting with her tennis background as well as her quick wit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPWZEZEPBSGKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO12QKY#wasThisHelpful","RPWZEZEPBSGKH","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm rounding up my rating to 4 stars because overall, the quality of this author's writing (style, vocabulary, imagination, scenery) is of such a high order, that I can't bring myself to just rate this book at 3 stars.  It's a solid 3.5 for me.What I liked:- the heroine.  I liked how she developed herself as a person which you learn over flashbacks- the scenes with the brothers, particularly their, ahem ""bathroom schedules""- the setting- the love you see between the heroine and her mother- the gal pals of the heroine, they really added color to the storyWhat I didn't like:- the hero.  He was just too artist like moody for me.  I realize he had his reasons, but he just felt like such a downer.  Also, the way he's physically described, he sounded like a cast member for Duck Dynasty which I don't find attractive in a hero (commenting on looks only)- the romance.  It just felt so fits and starts and took a long time to progress.  It was an uncomfortable reading for me when those two were together as there was so much conversational fumbling- I found the 180 degree turnaround with some of the brothers, such as Jethro unbelievable.  You're supposed to believe that a guy who actually tried to pimp out his younger sister to his friends turned over a new leaf in 3 years.  His story, as well as how the other brothers' lives were so quickly changed by the hero, seemed too good to be true.- I wish there had been more background on the brothers and the heroine when they were kids and supported each other as it would have made their closeness after an 8 year separation more believable.- the way the brothers and the heroine just accepted the hero paying the bills so easily - uh, they all had jobs, so why were they okay with that?- it would have been nice if there had been a paragraph or two about how winning a beauty pageant changed her life (I assume that's how she afforded college) or her brothers (one of them talks about her winning made it hard for them but why?)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KSHRSQ0PMQFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRQJ5M4#wasThisHelpful","R2KSHRSQ0PMQFK","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every now and then I think I'll try my hand at writing a romance and then I read something this well written and say, ""nope, the bar has been set, and I can't even touch the bars.""  I loved the concept of the heroine who is bombshell hindered by Tourette's like spouting of Wikipedia.  She is incredibly intelligent and endearing, but due to a lousy family, she has always held herself slightly away from romantic relationships, never going fully into them with her heart.  At first I had a hard time with her character as it seemed like too many bad things were happening to her at once and the author was just making her life too sad, but it quickly passes and she is given a chance to shine.  I loved her cluelessness and her spouting of facts.  And more importantly, I loved how the hero was fascinated by her knowledge and valued her mind as well as her looks.Usually I find the gal pals of the heroine overly interfering, nosy, and quite frankly enabling of bad habits.  But I really liked these gals, particularly when they take on the bad guys.The reason for not giving this a full 5 stars is that I thought what happened with the heroine's sister could have been brought more to a conclusive end (or maybe it's in the next book?) and I have to say that the wealth of the hero was too over-the-top to be believed.  But aside from that, really the writing style is very sophisticated and this romantic comedy stands above the usual trope.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USYVZ3VGB1H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUWA58E#wasThisHelpful","R2USYVZ3VGB1H8","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the previous book (or serial) of the Ice Planet world.  Appreciated that the author didn't do the usual ""everything is rosy"" when you're kidnapped by aliens.  I really felt the author stood out for depicting how traumatizing, humiliating, and physically hard it would be if someone were kidnapped.  Even when the human women find another race of alien men, it's not easy peasy.  So intrigued by a new take on the familiar men are from Mars theme, I decided to continue with reading about this world.Unfortunately, this one is a real step back for me.  The female lead was just too foul mouthed and not in a clever, snarky way, but more in a pouty low class, style.  I appreciate that she wants to stand on her own two feet and that she's feeling physically and mentally lousy after all she's suffered, but sheesh, when you voice your opinions, do so in a more thoughtful way.  It's like she had Tourette's syndrome and you just wanted her to shut up.I almost gave this story 2 stars, but there is a scene where she puts on her big girl panties and learns to take care of herself and her mate without incessantly making crude comments.  Unfortunately, that was only a brief reprieve before she went back to imitating an elementary school kid who learned their vocabulary from a XXX movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7L71YB9S0CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CTNIH0#wasThisHelpful","R3O7L71YB9S0CW","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great sci-fi read from this author.  I wasn't sure how she would pull off a heroine who is so naive but she did it!  Lara, daughter of a diplomat, is the type to foolishly hurl herself into an adventure.  Likely she's done this multiple times because she always had her sister, Nori, to bail her out, but now that she's on her own, you feel like she quickly learns more to think on her own.  I really liked how her character's gift with languages combined with empathic abilities enabled her to reach out to others.This is very much a romance of opposites, but it works.  I look forward to future books by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTS8NVPY3BCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106W2YBO#wasThisHelpful","RUTS8NVPY3BCX","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The background of the watch face is a very light grey so the contrast against the numbers isn't as high as I'd like.  I think this watch is trying to evoke the style from the 40s/50s.  The watch band is more brown than orange (in the photo it looks orange) which I consider a step in the right direction.I agree with other reviewers that the watch band is too long for most women.UPDATE:  After owning this for less than three months, the watch stopped!  I can only hope that a battery replacement will fix it.  Certainly the watch should work without problems for at least a year!","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFY6VLEGAQKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083W56QK#wasThisHelpful","R2YFY6VLEGAQKK","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You definitely need to read book 1 of this series to have a full appreciation and understanding of ""Fighting Shadows"" but that book is the one that got me hooked on this author, so it's all good.  With regards to writing ability, I feel like the author advanced even further with this romance.  This is not a formulaic NA.  At first you may find yourself not liking the heroine as she's been raised to be a grifter and she shows signs of immaturity.  On the other hand, those faults are what make her character realistic and unique.  She does mature over time and you do like the person she becomes.I think Flint's bitterness over his paralyzed condition makes sense.  And I think pairing him with the oddball Ash makes total sense as she's the only one, with her ""out-of-leftfield"" sensibility that can shake him out of his doldrums.  Coupled with Ash's caring nature, the romance worked for me.The only reason why I don't give this a full five stars is that I would have liked a bit more variety, action, change of scenery throughout the story.  I felt like there was maybe too much time spent on the two characters trying to overcome their insecurities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJU78Y6GIEOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGSIJ5O#wasThisHelpful","R1FJU78Y6GIEOJ","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, not understanding the high starred reviews.  I read another of the author's freebies ""Ready to Were"" and thought it was okay but wanted to give this author another chance.  Very glad I did not pay for this.This book features dubious humor around old people's toilet moments, scenes of cannibalism, foul mouthed guardian angels whom I don't find witty (instead of calling the heroine by her name (Astrid) it's always Axx + another noun).  This is not clever humor, this is the poorest excuse of comedic writing I've ever come across.  Even the world building got to be too much.  It was this weird jumble of throwing in famous people's names for other paranormal creatures.  This is seriously a mess.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XYGKX3FH1ENK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYMXM2I#wasThisHelpful","R2XYGKX3FH1ENK","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A funny tale of a female werewolf who is in the equivalent of the Werewolf FBI, returning to her hometown after a year's absence.  She left her hometown in order to get away from her fiancé whom she believed to be unfaithful.  The fiance is the alpha of the pack as well as the town sheriff.  He has never stopped loving her and wants her back.  She is joined on her hometown return by her gay BFF a vampire.  Together, along with her grandmother they make a funny trio.The humor made me grin, but not laugh out loud funny like a Tara Sivec book.  Maybe because it was slightly on the forced side?  I did like the heroine and how much she had grown as a person.  This book is part of a series but I didn't feel like there was such a cliffhanger that I had to go out and buy book 2.  I'm kind of on the fence with this author so will check out another of her freebies to see if I like her writing style.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB1539EPSEWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PD8LQ6G#wasThisHelpful","R1OB1539EPSEWC","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great start to a series.  It's not often that you get to read a PNR where both the h and the H are both demons. I really love the fact that the h, while she can be quite the kick-axx  doesn't feel the need to flaunt it, only does so when needed such as when she stands up for her cousin or she needs to get herself out of a bad situation.  In other words, this is a smart heroine who, while not taking guff from anyone, doesn't needlessly antagonize anyone but is never a doormat.  She had lousy parents, but she doesn't feel sorry for herself and sees some of the good that came in her life from a nomadic upbringing.  Best of all she's very independent but not to the point of TSTL.  For this, I give a huge thank you to the author.  So many times I groan in romances where the heroine is a wannabe or delusional warrior and she does causes more trouble for everyone.  Not this heroine - she knows when to stay by the sidelines or when to fight with all she's got.I really loved how despite this being PNR, it was not instal-love for these two.  They did get to know each other and realize how much they meant to one another.  The romance was believable because they were both so honest with each - no communication problems.  Again, another big thank you to the author for writing a ""big misunderstanding"" event between the two of them.  As a romance book addict, I'm so tired of seeing people simply not talking to each other, particularly if their love is so strong for each other - it makes me really wonder about their long term viability.Lastly, the world building was interesting.  I really appreciate how the author gives the details of the demon world - through events, actions, conversations, internal thoughts.  This really shows the level of sophistication of this author how artfully she weaves the details of the world into the story - a lesser author would have huge info dumps or drawn-out internal monologues.This is a standalone book, but if you enjoyed it then definitely recommend her Vampire series which is of similar calibre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCDIYE5E8D73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P3660O#wasThisHelpful","R1LCDIYE5E8D73","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enjoyed this short story which was a space thriller.  Daughter of the president? of a planet escapes her home planet during a time of civil strife.  She is placed on a military ship where she is pursued by a lecherous captain.  She also runs into an old high school flame.  Liked both the hero and the heroine - brave and smart.  No TSTL moments in the story.  I liked how the author didn't have too much sex in the story which too many romance authors use as a substitute for story.Just small complaints that keep me from giving this a full five stars:- I never really got a good idea of what the hero or heroine looked like.  Would really have liked to known what the heroine did for a living.  I didn't get the feeling that she was a princess so, uh what was her life besides fleeing from civil unrest?- felt like she and the crew were able to get away from the pirates too easily- felt like there should have been more exchange between the hero and heroine before becoming so serious.  yes, they had a history but it was a high school romance and there was a big gap in betweenOkay this didn't make me lower the rating, but the author really needs to use more appropriate covers.  If I hadn't discovered the author previously through an anthology, I don't think I would have thought to pick-up her books.  With the exception of the Iron Admiral books, her covers always make me think that they're non-fiction books about space or for Star Trek geeks - I would never have guessed by the artwork that this was SFR.Anyway, this author writes well and definitely I will continue to be on the lookout for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNRS61WHBIIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EFZAEQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CNRS61WHBIIL","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th sci-fi action/thriller I've read by this author and they've all been great.  This one also has romance in it which I enjoyed as well.  The author does such a great job of world building.  The hero and heroine are both brave, resourceful and yay, no TSTL moments for them.  I appreciate how the 2ndary characters are more complex - they have their pros and cons.I'm surprised this author isn't read more widely.

"Oh wow, who doesn't want a Nick as the man in their life.  I really liked his combined personality of pragmatism, protectiveness, and devotion/worship for Daisy.I would say the synopsis is a little misleading.  It implied more of a thriller aspect and really this novella was a snapshot of Daisy and Nick's life as they try to adapt to leading normal lives.  Agree with the other reviewers that you need to read  ""Last Hit"" in order to understand this novella.I really appreciate how the authors avoided the formulaic alpha hero-Russian hitman and the inexperienced gal.  They are both fish-out-of-water types when it comes to relating to every day society and that is what makes the story interesting plus their utter understanding and devotion to each other.  I really, really liked how between the two of them there was this incredible, understanding connection on how to deal with each other's idiosyncrasies.The reason why I don't give this 5 stars is that I think the authors went a little overboard about Daisy's desperation for a friend.  I realize in having Daisy befriend Christine it was also to show Daisy's understanding nature and big heart BUT sorry, Christine isn't worthy.  Spoilers to follow, so stop reading if you don't want to read them..........................  I can understand Christine being under the thrall of clearly a junky, abusing boyfriend who takes her money and beats her up.  Christine is literally starving as the money she earns from the two jobs is going towards her boyfriends lifestyle.  Abusive relationships like that I would not judge but hope someone would offer help as Daisy does.  What I am not understanding about is how much Christine uses Daisy - constantly copying her answers - what is the point of her choosing to be in college if she's not willing to study?  I guess someone could say she doesn't have time because she's working two jobs, but again, college is a choice, so why bother paying for it and taking the time to attend classes if you're only constantly going to cheat?  The worst though about Christine was when Daisy tells her that her boyfriend tried to rape her, Christine's only thought was ""my boyfriend isn't here?""  No thought, apology, or care did she send Daisy's way about the attempted rape.  I just thought Daisy should have thrown her hands up on Christine even at the beginning when the cheating began and said ""you're toxic and I don't need a friend this badly to have to buy them with my homework.""  I also thought the authors went a little overboard with making Daisy so socially awkward that she couldn't make friends easily - I didn't like her looking so pathetic although it did provide scenes where it showed Nick trying to make friends for her as he just wants her happiness.Anyway, to end on a positive note, Nick and Daisy are one of the best couples I have ever read.  Despite the use of the ever popular Russian hitman theme, this story contains original, uniques characters and a powerful romance.  I can't wait for more in this series!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AIMCTPBI77VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9A4AFS#wasThisHelpful","R1AIMCTPBI77VN","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved how I was transported back to the world of dragons and mages.  Here the story focuses on Asha a fire mage/dragon seer hybrid.  During the story she comes more into her powers and and develops her relationship with her mate, Braedon, a very powerful fire mage.  Brandon fights alongside her for both her right to choose her own path in life as well as aid the dragons in their fight against a corrupt dragon (her stepfather).  There is wonderful world building of dragon society and the author certainly drops bread crumbs for future relationships which I can't wait to read.I think what I really appreciate about this author's writing is that she really knows how to spin a tale, make the reader feel like they are in a totally different realm.  People talk differently, dress differently, behave differently - there is no jarring 20th century, whiny teenage like voice I often encounter with other fantasy romances.  The heroine is brave and smart and the hero too, but not an alpha a-hole.  Most of all, the author does not overdo the sex scenes which too many romance writers rely upon as a basis for a book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D1KK3ARPRL2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5JO1JU#wasThisHelpful","R2D1KK3ARPRL2U","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once I pay for a book, I feel an obligation to finish, but this one broke the rule.  I'm so disappointed as I had high hopes based on the author's story in a Sci-Fi anthology.The story started out 5 stars for me, but then after the H/h's insta-lust (which I was okay with since it's one of those instant mate recognition themes) the next scene skips 3 months ahead!  You know that they are getting along and the relationship is growing but just a few instances are told rather than shown, of how the H endears himself to the h.  By skipping over the early days of the relationship, the author missed out on building a key part of the romance for the readers.Spoilers ahead-------------The h's character I found to be increasingly TSTL and high school immature.  She takes it upon herself to seek aid from the US military and thus exposes her mate's race and operations to the government.  She is surprised and disappointed that a former military friend places tracking devices on her and has brought others to take her in.  And to top it off, despite this personal betrayal, she still wants to treat the guy as though he'll instantly be an ally by telling him classified information and letting him walk into her mate's camp without restraints (uh, this is just minutes after the ""friend"" was chasing you down with his military squad).  For someone who supposedly was experienced in clandestine operations you'd think she would have been smarter.  You then read how since her arrival at her mate's encampment she's indulged in being rebellious simply for the fun of it and is addicted to playing video games.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3207YGWAVYK1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008G3BOLC#wasThisHelpful","R3207YGWAVYK1O","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm surprised other reviewers haven't noticed that with the exception of the 1st story, each author manages to insert the words ""Max Midnight"" somewhere in the story AND they very cleverly allude to the next story.  I was reading the stories out of order (zeroing first on my favs) and once I figured out how the authors were doing this, I really got into paying attention to the details and went back to rereading the stories!  Even the last story of the anthology, ""Getting Wilde"" drops a hint about the 1st story.  Some of the foreshadowing clues are very subtle - loved it.  It was like a game of Myst, trying to find out how the authors would hint about the the story.  Hats off to Darynda Jones, both for the excellent story and how clever she was in alluding to the next one.I imagine coordinating this type of linkage was an incredible headache amongst the authors.  Not sure why the 1st author didn't try to use the phrase ""Max Midnight"" and give a clue to the next story... oh well.As you expect with any anthology some of the stories are stronger than others.  The standouts for me:Darynda Jones - A Lovely DropWoman with the ability to go back in time uses her skills to try to help an FBI agent.  Not as much romantic but definitely thrilling.Shea Berkley - Dark Secrets:  Stone Cold DeadA paranormal (don't want to spoil it by revealing what type) warrior type woman comes to the aid of a couple of children (I love reading about kids in PNR) and hooks up with a vampire slayer.  I understand this is part of a series and I'm looking forward to the next one.Trish McCallan - Spirit WoodsThis one felt very Twilight Zone like to me.  A female veterinarian reconnects with an old lover in her hometown.  He's a cop who helps her figure out how a dog she cares for is the living embodiment of her childhood dog as well as who vandalized her old childhood home.  Definitely got the feeling there will be a follow-on to this story as there were unanswered questions.  Look forward to the sequel.  I'm a real Trish McCallan fan and she is the reason why I originally bought this anthology.Jenn Stark - Getting WildeA Robin Hood type heroine who uses her magical gifts to steal ancient artifacts and then uses the money to help magically gifted children.  She is hired by a past lover who is magically powerful, to steal something.  I sooo want to read more about this heroine and have added Stark to my TBR list.Based on the quality of writing on the above stories plus the very interesting linkages, I definitely felt this anthology was worth the $4.99.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2TSUSKF9D4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGNMO0U#wasThisHelpful","RV2TSUSKF9D4W","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The four star rating is rounding up from 3.5 stars.- I did like the story but the book needed editing so badly that every other page I found myself stopping to reread a passage to figure out what the author really meant.- In the beginning, the book feels choppy but it definitely improves as the story progresses.  More background information on the children and the brothers earlier on would have been helpful.  It's been a while since the previous book and so I was confused as to who was who in the beginning scenes with the 6? adopted children.- Story could have been much fuller if there was more background information on the villain and his motivations.- It wasn't clear to me how the heroine was being instructed by the bad guys to spy on the hero's family.  You know she is being controlled by drugs but there is never any explanation as to what information they expected her to uncover.  Also, what was the hero's reaction/thoughts to her father prior to the drug addiction discovery?Good stuff:- The author is fantastic on creating an imaginative world.- Love how the heroine isn't a deadweight in the relationship but demonstrates brains and quick thinking.- No TSTL moments.- I really liked the idea of how their relationship began and evolved (society couple that grew to love each other).- I liked how the author introduces a same sex relationship but doesn't stand on a soap box about it.I really think this book had the potential to be a solid 5 stars with better editing and more filled out scenes.

"Lynda Chance is a great erotica writer and usually is one of the best with writing a swoon worthy alpha, but I have to say, I really didn't like the alpha nor the female lead in this story:- I didn't like it when Garrett kept pushing Maria sexually when she said ""no"" and ""stop"" to him.  She doesn't say it in the most forceful way, but it doesn't matter, he should have backed off, particularly when she utters it more than once.  I would have been okay if he just tried to seduce her with words but stop touching her once she tells him to back off.- Garrett is supposed to be this incredibly smart businessman.  I know the point of the story is that his attraction to Maria drives all common sense out of his head, but seriously, a smart businessman of his calibre would not have gotten so aggressively physical with an employee.  I like that Maria points out the liability at the beginning, but am disappointed that she didn't have the spine to walk out on the job (and join one of the fancier/swankier hotels she is so confident she can find a place at)  and the sex fog didn't immediately clear from Garrett's head once she mentioned suing him.- Maria has two major TSTL moments at the beginning of the story that just did not make sense with the overall characterization of her as a top notch hotel employee ready to take on a general manager's position.  TSTL #1:  background info tells you that she is a major pain to Courtney, an executive sent in to revamp the hotel, merely because she is professionally and personally jealous of Courtney.  She is such a major pain that Courtney is forced to recommend firing her.  I really thought it was one of the lamest parts of this story when Maria reflects back on her behavior:  ""hey she's just human.""  Uh no, it's more like ""get over yourself"" and stop committing career suicide.  Being a major B to someone who is just doing her job is evil, not to mention if you want to work in the hotel industry in the same area, word gets around of your bad behavior and you'll find yourself job hunting in another state.  This leads me to TSTL #2:  when she meets the owner of the hotel in person, she is again a major B.  Even though she thinks she's getting fired anyway, uh again , hello someone this high up could get you blackballed from not only any of the hotels in the area but in other parts of the country as well.  Her entire work history is with this one hotel and now she is risking not having any positive references from the folks who can really make a difference.I think this is the first time where I was disappointed in both the h and the H of a Lynda Chance book.

"Interesting world building, great heroine.  It's an apocalyptic future with zombies causing the mayhem. The heroine is brave, resourceful, independent.  The cyborg heroes didn't strike me as particularly different from regular guys other than being tall.  Their characterization I thought could have been more unique/other worldly.I'm fine with M/M but wish it was either solely M/M or just concentrating on her.  I was fine if the heroes were lovers in the past, but once they met Emma, I just wanted them to be into her - I know that's a greedy female perspective.I am a huge fan of this author's Grabbed series.  Can't tell you how many  times I've reread them because they're so good.  Highly recommend her Skyport Virgin book as well and hope the inner muse nudges her to write another sci-fi as I think she's at her best in that genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJD1CX1Z242D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q084YT4#wasThisHelpful","RYJD1CX1Z242D","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karyn Lawrence's writing is really a cut above the pack.  If you're a Lisa Marie Rice fan, you'll really love Lawrence's writing style  and storyline.  Her heroines are interesting, compelling, independent and matched against alpha type men.  However, I personally find Lawrence's stories more enjoyable because they don't feel as formulaic and over-the-top in characterization as Rice's.There is a depth to Lawrence's leads which I don't often encounter in the romance genre.  Her leads aren't perfect, for instance the male lead has already been twice divorced and I have to say I was reluctant to buy this book based on that.  The way the hero's alphaness is displayed is more clever than other alpha's I've read about - he mentally manipulates rather than just yells/screams.  The heroine is no wilting lily and really shows her smarts, particularly when facing off against the bad guy.  Even the characterization of the bad guy/psychopath was well done.  The author drew a 3 dimensional character with the bad guy making you wonder what his next move will be and why.I think the only reason why I take off 1/2 a star is that I wish there had been more conversation/interaction between the hero/heroine before they fell into bed with each other.  Prior to the sex, it's just flirting and a feeling like the hero just likes the chase and this makes him seem too shallow for my taste.  Of course, he's not, but would have liked a better foundation for their attraction.Anyway, this is a great read that you will find a hard time putting down.  I read her previous book, ""Stay"",  which I absolutely loved and recommend reading before this one so that you can get a more complete idea of the entire storyline.I look forward to the next book this very talented writer comes out with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCBJ59LZP4RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1BU3P6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCBJ59LZP4RM","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd say this is 2/3 thriller and 1/3 romance.  I was fine with this combination.  The author spins a wonderful page turning tale.  I particularly enjoyed how she gave voice to minor characters - it really made the story that much richer.  I agree that it would have been nice to have learned  the H's POV or more interaction (other than mercenary action) between the H and h so that you understood more what she saw in him.You can definitely read this book without having read the previous book.

"Great story telling. This is a wonderful sci-fi intrigue/romance.I loved how the romance developed between the two junior ambassadors as they trek across the planet.  Lirzhan, the Zhore ambassador knows instantly that Alexa is the one, but proceeds cautiously as he knows she doesn't share the same feelings in the beginning.  At first I thought Alex was a little on the immature side, but as I read more about her, I liked her and how she was a survivor.  Unfortunately she does have a major TSTL moment which while quickly resolved, it did really tick me off with the characterization.  She previously came across as mature, capable, courageous and granted she was under pressure and sleep deprived, I thought her traitorous turn on Lirzhan really made her unworthy of him.  If not for this, I would have given this story 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZJNT52R0AZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK1GSE8#wasThisHelpful","R2RZJNT52R0AZS","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to read Cajun romances and there are some nice elements to the world building here, but as much I've tried to stick with this series I'm giving up.  This storyline bugged me not only for the incompleteness of the final relationship but also the whole love triangle - the heroine was too much able to call the shots and for once, I felt like the male leads were really being led by the nose - this isn't alpha behavior.Something else that bugged me, the math being off:  whether it was how old she should have been (uh no way are you 22 when you're a year out of law school) or the number of nights she was with Luc (the storyline said she spent 7 but the narration indicates 4).  It's like the story needed an alpha reader who wasn't a friend of the author's and thus more likely to have a critical eye.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDV25FQPSKLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH2PVIY#wasThisHelpful","R2UDV25FQPSKLE","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took a while, but the author definitely delivered on book 2 of this series.  It's been so long since I read book 1, that I can't remember if I had any pet peeves about it, but certainly with this story, I didn't find any.  Zoey is probably the most kick-butt heroine I've ever read.  She ruthlessly goes against Cambions who kill innocents.  She has no time for the politics of her supernatural community and is all about the action.  This is a very thrilling read and what I really like is that there aren't any PC ""oh I'm not going to kill the serial killer cuz whatever.""  Bad guys get handed their axx and I love that.There does seem a slight TSTL action on the hero's part where he could have closed the gap with Zoey earlier by texting her  about what happened in book1.  He did try calling her every day and felt if she didn't pick-up then she wasn't ready to listen.  But seriously, couldn't he have tried texting to get his side of the story across and extend the olive branch more effectively?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVU5CPHJ4DS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJDSYQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1JVU5CPHJ4DS9","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 2nd Rock Chick book I have read.  I read the first one as I was hoping to fall in love with a whole new series from Kristen Ashley, but the 1st Rock Chick book didn't grab me like some of her other books.  I picked Regret to read as I noticed it was the highest rated book of the series on Good Reads.Unfortunately, I can't echo the high ratings.  I found the story to be filled with repetitive description of how hot looking the hero is and how all the women and men encountered in the story are gorgeous in one form or the other.  The story felt so removed from reality - with the exception of the cafe owner, do any of these women have jobs?  They seemed to live these almost high school level lives where they hang out at the cafe, shop, and do each other's make-up.What I found the most off-putting was the lack of sensitivity and respect towards keeping the heroine's rape confidential.  The Rock Chick gang and their men just share this intensely private information to any and all - it doesn't matter if they think the listener is someone sympathetic to the heroine; it's not their story to tell.  Also, a doctor would be confronted by an ethics panel for blurting this out in front of a dozen people whom he knows aren't the victim's family - it doesn't matter how much he feels intimidated, he'd be in serious trouble.The whole different personality types of the heroine:  ice princess, new Sadie, sarcastic Sadie, etc., just felt silly.  I understand the reasoning behind the heroine putting up a facade and just the ice princess one would have been fine, but all the others made her seem mentally unstable although I think the author was trying to go for charmingly kooky.Maybe if the story had been cut down more, I too would have succumbed to the magic of the Rock Chick gang.  Perhaps just enough detail to chuckle rather than rolling my eyes over the rinse/repeat of girl bonding, danger to the heroine, and personality changes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XWRVJ8G73LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006KD2TP0#wasThisHelpful","R28XWRVJ8G73LF","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so glad that Jan Karon returned Father Tim's character to Mitford.  I certainly enjoyed his adventures outside, but it's nice to get the latest on the town characters.  I don't know if there are really places like Mitford, but I'd certainly like to find such a community for myself.I am amazed at the quality of writing in this series.  It would be understandable if it started to feel formulaic after so many books, but the author keeps it fresh and interesting.  I actually think the author has reached a higher plane in her writing when I look back at the first book (which I enjoyed) and compare it to this latest.  Father Tim's character, the life of a retired priest, the lives of the working poor, etc. are depicted much more realistically - their flaws are more apparent and yet living in a small town, they know to forgive them and mush on and find happiness in the little things and be generous wherever possible.I do want to caution people who pick-up this book, that you do need to read the whole series in order to understand and enjoy the story fully.I read in an interview that Karon plans to continue the series and I really hope the next one comes soon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV03KIDO75G00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDD9TX0#wasThisHelpful","RV03KIDO75G00","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I really like Lynda Chance's books featuring hot alpha males.  She's definitely on my ""favorite authors"" list.  Unfortunately, this one wasn't as good as the first book in this series, ""Rule's Obsession"" which I do highly recommend.I did really like how the male/female quickly come to their ""I love yous"" and are very up front and honest about their feelings.  I wasn't super crazy about her still carrying the v-card at the age of 24 - that just seemed unrealistic, particularly since she wasn't a socially awkward wallflower.I was really into the story and was wondering how the big misunderstanding would evolve (all of these romances have something where the h/H temporarily come apart) and was very disappointed that it came about due to the heroine's concern over kids potentially becoming orphans.  Also, the hero could have made his argument about how their potential kids would never be alone, much sooner in the story.  It was just so unbelievable how after coming together, they were then able to be distant towards each other while living in the same space over a couple of weeks.  If the heroine was dead set on separating from him, why the heck didn't she immediately move out?  She seemed incredibly insensitive to keep herself around.  If she was really in earnest about making a break, she should have considered hightailing it out of her job to avoid even more contact with him.I did like that this heroine, similar to the author's ""American Millionaire"" was financially secure in her own right.  Most of Chance's heroines are at such a financial disadvantage to the hero and I dislike that being such a constant element.  I also liked how the hero was very patient in waiting for the heroine to grow up, before he made his move on her.  And I really, want to praise the author for the honest sexual health discussion the hero/heroine have with each other; it makes the h/H come across as smart and the sex scenes more realistic.On the strength of the first book in this series, I'll still check out Garrett's story, the 3rd in this series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJV9V9T95X0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N98FD3O#wasThisHelpful","R3AJV9V9T95X0T","A2GF23URLB9BLL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GF23URLB9BLL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.

"This is feels very YA, but it deals with some complex ideas.  I always enjoy books by Mr Dahner, as he takes a small number of technological breakthroughs and shows both how they would disrupt the world and how they could save it.  There is, however, a certain naveté and simplicity to some of the personal interactions.  For instance, a family that has been kidnapped previously and is now quite wealthy waits until another kidnapping attempt to upgrade security.  Then they hire cheap.  That doesn't scan well for me.I pre-order everything I can get from Mr Dahner.

By that I mean 2/3rds of the book is reasonable people doing reasonable things to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  There are a few minor points of conflict that may become interesting in the next book, but nothing really bad happens.

"A very good addition to the Ring of Fire series.  The story moves well from the outset and builds throughout.  Paris is the focal point of the plot with most of the mainline characters offstage or in subordinate roles.  Rebecca and Agustav have brief scenes, but mostly it is about France.  A few events I did not expect have now been added to the histories.Two complaints: wading through almost an entire Latin Mass plus English translation got a little pedantic.  I will say that the frequent use of Latin quotes brought a good deal of power to the prose, but at times it got a little clunky.  Secundus, it almost felt like the events found in 1634: The Bavarian Crisis did not happen.  Or I was unclear on how things turned out.Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable read.  Some of the previous novels had me questioning my loyalty to the series, but this renewed my faith.  For fans of the series, this is quite a good addition.  For newcomers...I advise you to start at the beginning, but this actually works pretty well as a stand alone.  I did not feel the need to go back an re-read the series to figure anything out...but I did feel the desire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7EIQYI94E3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNLQE7U#wasThisHelpful","RZ7EIQYI94E3E","A2KDIAVN06UP7A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KDIAVN06UP7A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like Ms Shearin's writing and the dialogue is clever, but there were a few instances where the need for a snappy riposte drove the book out of character.  When the witty banter or turn of phrase is what drives the plot instead of vice versa the flow of the narrative breaks.

"A Deal With God has one of the most unique story-lines I have ever read. It is loosely based in fact, as the people really existed and really died at very young ages. Of course everything else is a work of fiction.The way the women's lives intertwine is very strange. One dies, leaving behind three sons and a husband. The other is brought back from a coma by making a *deal with God*. The how and the why their lives come together are what really make this book worth reading though, and I don't want to spoil that for you.It is portrayed as a Christian romance novel. If you are looking for a clean cut, probably doesn't actually happen in real life type novel you should probably skip this one. As a Christian from birth I can tell you that this is a more accurate representation of how it really is this day and age. The good news is that this book highlights how forgiving God is.I think anyone would enjoy this, religious or not.

"Aegis Rising was recommended to me by a fellow mom for my 15 year old daughter. We are both constantly on the lookout for good YA books as both of our kids love to read.This is by far one of the best YA books I have read in a long time. There are five main characters: Aari, Mariah, Kody, Tegan and Jag. They are mysteriously brought to a hidden valley after their plane crashes somewhere in Northern Canada. They soon find out that this valley is inhabited by a secretive people with amazing capabilities. These people believe that the five teenagers are a part of their ancient prophecy.One of the main things I liked about this book is that each character is depicted so well and the setting of the forest and the hidden valley is described so beautifully that I felt like I was right there! The dialogue was never awkward, which is a pet peeve of mine. The action scenes were truly gripping. Overall this is a very well written novel. It is a fast paced sci-fi adventure novel that will take you on an amazing journey.

"Constricted is the first dystopian romance I have read. It was a dark read, that touched on many subjects that tend to make any human being with a conscience uncomfortable. Unfortunately they are real issues, even if this novel is a work of fiction. The book took several pages to get going. It doesn't have a ""hook"" that grabs your attention right from the start. Definitely stick with it though because once it does get going, it doesn't stop!The main characters, Korrigan and Petre were well developed and easy to relate to. The pace at which their relationship develops is very believable. Relationships that start out completely far-fetched is a huge pet peeve of mine that I usually have to endure with most romances. I have no doubt that this will be one of my favorite series and I can't wait for the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKYOTGC3V4U27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKS5HQ0#wasThisHelpful","RKYOTGC3V4U27","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book reminds me of a movie I watched several years ago. It also had a serial killer with an alternate personality. Both were in the horror genre and gross and disturbing at times but also also absolutely hilarious. I know those two things shouldn't go together, but when they do it's awesome.One thing I really loved about Simon Says is that the main character, David, is relatively normal until his wife cheats on him. Then he completely snaps and does whatever atrocious acts ""Simon"" tells him to do. It really makes you wonder about the people in your own life. You never know what could make a person play a dangerous game of Simon Says.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9VNK8ILY0EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKHTB4E#wasThisHelpful","R1W9VNK8ILY0EO","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a sucker for true stories, so when I saw Duplicity I knew I needed to read it. A true life deceit/crime story. Almost like a ""Snapped"" episode, minus the murder. It was better than I expected. The book starts out with the main characters, also the person writing the book, finding a Russian wife. They have a child together named Johnny but then she leaves him high and dry.As a single dad he tries to find someone new to spend his life with. However, since he wants love so bad he is blind to certain flashing red lights. Aubrey pretends to be taking care of her elderly grandma, which is supposedly the reason she can only be home a few days a week. What she is really doing is lying, stealing and leading a prostitution ring that ends up being an International ring.Instead of getting mad (well, he probably did get mad at first) Goldman got even. He brought down his second wife and made the world a better place.

"Even as an adult, I still love well written YA books/series. However, now I have an even better reason to keep an eye out for them. My daughter loves reading and I love finding great books we can read together.Ascension was everything I look for and more. Usually I steer clear of novels that have so many characters, it just gets confusing and I never really feel connected to any of them. Not true with this one! All of the characters were amazingly well fleshed out. They all had their flaws and their strengths and blended together seamlessly. The romance wasn't just thrown in as an after thought, it went with the story perfectly.The writing was descriptive enough that you felt like you were right there with Charles, Clark, Donnie, Chloe and the rest of them. The action scenes were particularly good and kept you on the edge of your seat while you read them. About the only flaw I can think of is that there wasn't enough focus on the main characters parents. I felt like they should have been a bigger part of the story.

"I love Historical Romance. Every time I read a novel in this genre I wonder why I don't read them all the time. Dream Time was the first one I have ever read set in Australia and I loved it! I hope there are more of them. If you add to that the well fleshed out characters and a plot that won't stop twisting you have a real winner.All (well most) of the characters were great and I loved them, but my favorite has to be Nan. The interactions between all of the characters was great and the dialogue was never awkward. A pet peeve of mine, and it seems to rear its ugly head in romance novels more than anywhere else.Overall a solid five stars ,and I can't wait for the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBPFQGK83ERC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8O8FKU#wasThisHelpful","R1BBPFQGK83ERC","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cash Chronicles is the type of book you never knew you would absolutely love. The story-line is unique, but it isn't trying so hard to be unique that it loses itself in the process. We follow Samson in a post Civil War era. There is a bit of timeframe jumping to his past but luckily it is never confusing. There are Mutants in this wild west and it is all the more interesting for it.The characters are well fleshed out, the writing is witty and flows well, and the entire novel will leave you drooling for the next installment.

"For a long time I have suspected that a close friend has an eating disorder. I wanted to be able to understand it better before approaching her about it, so I bought Freedom From Eating Disorders so I could be better equipped to deal with her situation. I am so glad that I picked this book. It was so helpful, explaining each common eating disorder in detail, how the personal suffering from it feels and thinks, and what it can look like on the outside.

We have been together for 10 years, and I still can't figure out the *why*.

"John Mack is the type of person that everyone wishes they knew personally. Well, at least those of us who realize that some form of a breakdown of civilization is almost guaranteed. If we did know such a person, we would be able to sleep better at night!Last Stand, and other prepper books, are basically the horror genre. More and more people are waking up to the many threats that are lurking just around the corner. This book shows a town right after an electromagnetic current is let loose and it thrusts everyone back a few centuries in time. No computers, no satellites, no cell phones. Will John be able to save his friends and neighbors? Will he even be able to save himself?One thing I really liked about this novel is how much legitimate prepper techniques were incorporated into the story-line.

"Two good friends of mine and I have a pact. When one of us finds a particularly amazing erotica story, we immediately tell the others about it. So when my friend called me up and told me I absolutely had to read The Visitor Arrives I got it immediately. She didn't let me down!This bundle comes with four different stories, but they all have Lea and her amazingly hot (firefighter!) roommates Sean and Andy. The sex scenes are very well written and flow very naturally. I also love that even though they are super steamy, they don't have that *ick* factor that some of the more hard core erotica does.Loved it!

"I absolutely love Georgia O'Keeffe and since I have already read so many biographies on her I was super excited to find this book. Instead of being a biography it is an in-depth look on how her work became what it was.I am ashamed to admit that I never knew the tie between her and Zen Buddhism and never dreamed that it had influence on her work. In fact, I honestly didn't even know what Zen Buddhism WAS until reading this book. I found the entire book to be very well researched, both when it came to the religious and cultural references as well as everything about Georgia O'Keeffe.The list of the biographies at the end was very thorough and there were some that even I had not read, which was surprising to me.

"I love horror stories. However my torture of choice is short horror stories, because if they are too long and involved I feel like the horror element gets lost...and I can't sleep at night. One of the main reasons I enjoy anthologies is because there is a little bit of everything. Even if I don't have the same favorite as my friend, we usually both still have a favorite and enjoyed all of them.I felt like Rite of Passage was the most horrific. There was nothing about it but darkness and it just oozed creepy. Loved it! Don't worry, if you are more into horror stories with better endings, this has quite a few of those. The Mushroom Man was my favorite in that category.Overall this is a solid five stars.

"The author's bio is what initially intrigued me enough to purchase this book. I just knew it would be entertaining and break all the rules, in a good way, and I love reading books like that. Not the kind where spelling and paragraphs are thrown to the wayside, but where you just feel like you are a close friend of the main character and they let you into that locked away part of their brain that very few people get to see... Does that make sense? Probably not, but that is how I feel!Forced Entry didn't let me down. It was a small glimpse into the deep and dirty south. Coming from a state that has recently legalized ""ganja"" I can definitely understand the *criminal* side of things and how it really shouldn't be a crime in the first place!A quick and entertaining fast paced read.

I love how he is so sexy, honorable and loyal yet so dark at the same time.This book pretty much starts right where Stand By Me ends. Chase's younger brother, Will and his girlfriend Cassie are a good addition to the story. They were well fleshed out characters and you could really feel how much Chase loves his little brother and how he would do anything for him. Unfortunately *anything* includes some unsavory things since Will and Cassie have a past that is not letting them get away. Through all this Kay is right by Chase's side, but will Chase go so far down the wrong path that not even she can bring him back?I love Kay and Chase so much that I honestly can't decide which book I like better, but it really doesn't matter because everyone needs to read both!

"A great story with a strong romance at the center of it. I loved the book's setting in the New York City classical music scene and how the characters all came to be members of the orchestra at the same time. The description of Li Hua's childhood really spoke to me since I also grew up around classical music. The scenes with Tony were definitely my favorite since they got me laughing and (later) got me feeling emotional. I really sensed their love for one another as time went on.I realize that the dramatic scenes were instrumental to telling the story, but reading about her bad decisions was sometimes hard. The fact that these  scenes were unconventional and gave the plot some twists and turns was a nice surprise. I also liked how the story changed as the plot unfolded. Tony was probably my favorite character and I found myself laughing out loud at his antics and the things he said. If anything, I would have enjoyed reading more background about orchestral players and why they do what they do. This is a hot romantic suspense kindle book and very well told. Good story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IMJES0ZOTU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4K73II#wasThisHelpful","R16IMJES0ZOTU3","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those rare books that is almost impossible to explain in a way that does it justice. Anything I seem to come up with just doesn't seem like it explains it in a way that comes close to how I felt reading it. I have never personally read a book like this before. I'm not sure if there are many out there, but I can't imagine them being half as good.NOW is written in first person, and that was probably the best decision. Ever. It really helped me feel a connection to the main character. Reading this book puts you on your own personal thought provoking and emotional journey right along side the protagonist.Overall the book is written very well. The plot is well thought out and executed. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2EC9GMWXOH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CYF5MI#wasThisHelpful","R3E2EC9GMWXOH2","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whew - what a ride! My friend highly recommended The Rainy Day Man to me, and I am so glad she did. Danny was the most unique character I have come across. That is saying something because I read a LOT. The way the book starts just hooks you right in and doesn't let you go until the end. Even then you will find yourself thinking about this book long after you turn the last page.I don't want to say too much and give away something, but you do NOT want to pass up this book.

"There are thousands (probably, I've never actually counted) of financial self help books. So why did I decide to get this one? Because the description jumped out at me. I am a huge believer in positive thinking and laughing at yourself. This book concentrates on both of those traits.On top of it being an easy read because of the way it is written, it is chock full of practical advice. If you are interested in learning how you can LITERALLY find money every day (including how you can increase your paycheck without getting a raise) then do not pass up on this amazing book.I loved the affirmations at the end. Some of them are practical, some of them are awesome, and some are funny.

"This work is labeled as a Science Fiction novel. It certainly does fit some of the criteria for that, but it is definitely not *hard core* sci-fi. In fact, it is kind of ominous in the sheer fact that anything and everything in this book could actually happen!In the not to distant future, science and technology determine who is the ultimate world power. The United States is in a constant struggle with the Middle East to stay ahead.We follow Kantak Johnshon, a native Alaskan as he studies at MIT and eventually goes back to his long distance girlfriend back home. Things really go to a head when the two world powers disagree on oil prices. That causes a huge electromagnetic burst of energy to be used as a weapon….we all know what kind of devastation that would bring about in a world so heavily dependent on technology and electricity.Will the men in power stop destroying the world before it’s too late?Great, fast paced read! The only thing that brought it down to four stars is the fact that the characters all had the same *personality*. I really, really, REALLY have a hard time keeping characters straight when they all have the same voice and reactions. Overall not too much of a detraction from an otherwise great novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3VMUK2CQV0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNXELWA#wasThisHelpful","R2R3VMUK2CQV0P","A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S1ZBCF0DUUVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really like it when books incorporate folklore and legends into the story so when I saw Flying Elephants and Other Stories I knew it was going to be the perfect fit.It has six stories. Handsome Prince, Broken Pot, Barber and Ghost, Flying Elephants, Six Blind Men, Tailorbird and Monkey. They all come with wonderful illustrations that fit the stories perfectly.I also really liked how at the end of every story, the *moral* was pointed out in a bold way.

"I had to take a last minute flight (family emergency) and I was in a bit of a panic. I detest flying and I usually find at least two amazing books to read on the flight to help distract me.I didn't have very much time to look, but I knew I wanted a thriller to suck me in. When I saw Assault on St. Valentines it just jumped out at me and I decided to give it a try.I definitely picked the right one! I was about half way through the book when the plane landed and I didn't want to get off so I could finish reading. That is something that has never happened before.This is a very fast paced (also very gruesome, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to such things) thriller. If you like a book that immediately hooks you and doesn't let go until the last page then this is the novel for you.Hicks is an ex-mercenary living in London. Suddenly his world is turned upside down when a sect takes it upon themselves to murder as many innocent civilians as possible.He finds an adorable, newly orphaned, girl named Bethany.

Who would have ever thought that the Vietnam War and Dragons would go together? Not me.

However, being of english heritage I couldn't pass it up.Felicity's Beaus ended up surpassing every expectation I had. This is much more than a petty revenge novel.

"I have the Wolo Bad Boy in my MX-5 and my wife's Jeep Cherokee horn was just not cutting it anymore in NYC.  She was rather jealous of my uber loud horn and wanted one of her own so I bough this for her.It is really loud.  The quality of the materials made me take off a star, nothing special and if anything feels a little bit cheap and flimsy.  But, that is all made up for in the noise it makes and the low price.It is not a deep tone, more of a bugle noise than a tuba, but it will get their attention.  In fact it is so loud it may violate noise level laws, so be careful laying on your horn if the police are around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZC2AYK4OHVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9R5DTO#wasThisHelpful","RUZC2AYK4OHVZ","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read the reviews thoroughly before you decide to purchase this.  It is not a miracle diagnostic and depending on your dog you can get extremely varied results.  I bought it for my parents who had just adopted a new dog.  It was obvious that he had boxer in him (brindle and the typical boxer rear leg stance) but the rest of him nobody could figure out for sure.  I knew from looking at him that he had one or more of the Pit Bull breeds mixed in there, but no idea which or how much.He is an amazingly sweet dog, so swabbing his cheek and gum was easy.  Definitely easier if you wait until they are relaxing/sleeping and then sort of give them some lovings and do the swab.  Try not to do it soon after they have eaten and be careful to keep the sample as clean as possible.Basically you'll get back a report that shows the dog's ancestry if they have enough DNA in the appropriate breeds.  In our case he came back with 6 distinct identifiable breeds out of a possible 8.  The report you get will show the breed(s) of the parents, grandparents and great grandparents, but from what I have read this is purely a representation and not actually the true breeds of their individual relatives.  It is more of a visual reference for us, the humans who want to know their breed and how they got to be the mix that they are.In our case they were able to identify American Staffordshire Terrier, Boxer, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Mini Bull Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  As mentioned above, the Boxer and the 3 pit bull breeds were obvious to me (Am Staff, Mini Bull and Staff Bull).  He has the typical pit bull ears (un-cropped) and face but not quite the wide jaw, he is also quite muscular and strong and can be picked up off the ground by a rope he is holding it with his teeth (he loves playing tug of war).  He also has the sweet, loyal, intelligent, stoicism that so many pits have.  He shows almost no physical characteristics of a Chow or German shepherd, he has very short hair, no black spots on tongue, etc.The attached photo to me represents the most important part of the report.  There is a lot of info in the report, but this one section to me contained the info that was most helpful.  Wisdom panel has some great videos on you tube that explains a lot about recessive genes and why your dog may have something like Chow Chow in their DNA but not display any of the physical traits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHU0QW3GEVY1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAVM9SI#wasThisHelpful","RHU0QW3GEVY1Q","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second purchase from PS.  The first was a batch of the low cut green socks.  I loved the green ones, they were amazing.  Thick, comfortable, breathable, etc.  So with the colder boot weather fast approaching I bought a set of the full length Heather/Navy socks.  I still really like them but they just don't seem as thick as comfy as the low cut greens.  I'm not sure if it is a color thing, possibly the dye used affects them, or if it is a size issue, or materials issue but they don't feel the same on the feet.Regardless, these are excellent socks, especially for the price and I wish I could give 4.5 stars.  But if I were to order again I'd most likely try full length green to see if they were thicker and if not stick with the low cuts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NF7J8BFSJYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y9QBYW#wasThisHelpful","R19NF7J8BFSJYX","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great item if you need super high arches.  The arch and heel area are reinforced with hard plastic made to look like carbon fiber.  I need them because I have plantar fasciitis and a high arch is needed.  Beyond that I can't say there is anything special about them.  Actually I am a bit disappointed in the lack of overall thickness and comfort.  I've bought Sof Sole before and was always pleased.  These are really thin and somewhat generic in regard to support and comfort beyond the high arch.  Sort of a 1 trick pony if you will.  So if you need them for high arch support they are great, beyond that nothing really good to say.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSITBXNOB514/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TP73YU#wasThisHelpful","R2LSITBXNOB514","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a life saver.  My wife and I own two rabbits.  We usually let them roam around our 2 BR apartment in the mornings and evenings.  Although they are litter box trained, when they free range they tend to drop pellets randomly.  It happens.  Not a big deal as bunny poo is easy to clean up.  But it does get annoying constantly stepping on it, especially when guests come over and you have to vacuum the entire apartment.I got so tired of it that I put down the money and got a Roomba.  What a miracle.  Significantly less bunny droppings.  I run it couple times per week and it works miracles.  The first few times it pulls up a lot of dirt you may not have known you had.  It only gets stuck in one area of  the apt, under an Ikea chair, but I put a pillow under it and that fixes the problem.PET OWNERS WARNING - The first few times I ran this the rabbits were out.  It is a robot and does not care about your pet.  Unfortunately, your pet is not a robot and may care about the Roomba making them move.  In my case my male rabbit's response was to plop down a rather nasty bit of excrement that wasn't the normal hard pellet.  The Roomba also does not care what it picks up.  In this case the pile of wet excrement left by my rabbit got smeared under the Roomba (thankfully missing the brush) and then smeared more on the carpet.  Not a nightmare to clean up but definitely not fun and left a rather unpleasant aroma in the apartment.  If this were a dog or cat I cannot even imagine how much worse it could have been.  Also, google pets attacking Roomba and you'll see quite a few $$$ Roombas chewed to pieces by dogs.  So, before leaving your pet alone with one of these, give it some test runs or you may not like the results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYPZM3QIHVDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LX6OC6#wasThisHelpful","R1CYPZM3QIHVDI","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Six month ago I had a dental cleaning that led to a bi-lateral penicillin resistant middle ear infection.  A full course of Augmentin had almost no affect which is how it was determined to be AB resistant.  The pain, discomfort, lack of hearing, dizziness, and a list of other horrible symptoms which I won't bother to list was awful. Suffice it to say I was in misery 24/7.  Multiple ENT visits and two different 10 day courses of Bioxin AB along with two round of Prednisone finally got rid of about 90% of the issue.  I barely avoided having a hold cut in my ear drum and a tube inserted to drain.  But, my ear continued to bother me.  There was a constant discharge, blockage, mild pain, and a feeling of discomfort in the ear.  It just didn't feel right.  I was constantly having to equalize pressure, constantly clearing my sinuses, and there was a persistent discharge of mucus draining from my Eustachian tube down the back of my throat, very annoying.ENT's determined that it was just residual affects from having such a bad infection.  But the problems didn't go away.  Original infection and treatment with AB's lasted about 2 months.  But 4 months after that I still had symptoms all day and night and was very unhappy.A friend of mine suggested colloidal silver.  At this point in the process I was willing to try anything.  Research online was mixed to say the least.  Traditional medicine said it is a hoax and dangerous.  Personal experiences spoke otherwise.  So I tried it.For two weeks I took it orally, in a nasal spray, and via ear drops.  At first I noticed no change at all.  None.  Then after about 2 weeks things seemed better.  I wasn't sure as it was still bad, but it didn't seem quite as bad.  After 3 weeks almost all of my residual symptoms are gone.  No more constant discharge, very little need to equalize ear pressure, no more pain or discomfort or loss of hearing.For the first time in over 6 months my ear feels 100% normal again.Full disclosure this info is technically anecdotal.  I don't have any data to back this up beyond my personal experience.  No idea if it was helped by taking it orally, ear drops, or via nasal spray.  No real proof it fixed anything beyond the fact that I took it and now my ear is better.  I know correlation does not equal causation, but I also don't believe in coincidence.Bottom line, if you have any sort of a lingering infection or after affects from one I cannot suggest strongly enough to try this.  I would never take this in place of an anti-biotic if there is a real internal infection.  But I will also always take if i'm ever on an anti-biotic again.I believe in a blend of traditional and holistic health care.  When you have a middle ear infection and AB comes in real handy, but apparently this does too.  I'm a convert.  Will definitely be using colloidal silver from now on for any anti-microbial needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJIBG9KLTU29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013664GE#wasThisHelpful","R1JJIBG9KLTU29","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get really bad DOMS in my legs whenever I do squats.  Like really bad.  It usually kicks in full about 36 hours after my workout and last for at least 3 days.  I get very mild DOMS everywhere else, only my hips/thighs are affected adversely.  Sitting down or standing up (chair, couch, etc) requires the use of both arms and a lot of grunting.  After my last leg day I was so sore for 4 days that I was seriously considering cutting way back on squats or eliminating them all together.  I did some research online and saw that BCAAs can help and figured it was worth a try.  I've tried almost every supplement under the sun and believe the vast majority of them are snake oil so I was very skeptical about trying BCAAs.I did my regular leg day (including squats) on a Wed afternoon, including doing higher weight and more sets than I did the previous leg day that left me sore for 3 days.  This product arrived on Thurs afternoon just as I was beginning to feel the effects of DOMS in my legs.  I was worried that my weekend was going to be spent shuffling around like an old man.  So I opened this package and took a dose in the evening.  I woke up this AM and after taking my regular hot shower realized not only did my legs not hurt worse than when I went to sleep, they actually felt better.  Not 100% normal, but better than when I went to sleep.  I took another half dose this morning (Fri) and am now typing this at noon and can say my legs feel 100% normal.  No pain, no soreness, no tightness, no DOMS.I am well aware of the placebo effect and how it works.  But I do not believe for a second that it could have this much of an impact on me physiologically.  My legs feel completely normal 48 hours after a leg workout.  That has never happened in my entire life.  I've done more leg days than I could possibly even attempt to count and I've always been significantly impacted 48 hours after a normal (not light) leg day.I'm a convert and will continue to use this until I see a different results.Oh and the watermelon flavor tastes just like a Jolly Rancher of the same flavor.  It does contain an artificial sweetener, which I wish it did not, but you cannot have everything.  The flavor was excellent, just a slight artificial sweetener after taste, and it dissolved easily in a cup of water.  It does foam up a little before it settles down too.If anything changes (good or bad) I will update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBEOCW4O6W11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055BYD66#wasThisHelpful","R1GBEOCW4O6W11","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is basically a combo of the ingredients in Tucks and the main ingredient in Prep H.  It is 50% Witch hazel and .25% Phenylephrine HCL in a gel base.First the good news.  It works very well.  Easy to apply and stays on as it is a little sticky.  Very useful as you don't need Tucks and Prep H, you get both in 1 shot.  The effects last a long time, relief was quickly and sustained.Now the bad news.  For the first 20 seconds it felt a bit like I had put kerosene on instead of Prep H.  Literally.  It burns a lot.  Full disclosure I was a bit raw when I put it on, was not have a ""good day"" so to speak.Despite the initial reaction, it did significantly cool things down and each subsequent application was less intense.  In the end (no pun intended) I bought a 2nd tube and now use it a preventative maintenance.Overall a very good product but depending on the severity of your symptoms and the location of your rhoid(s) you may want something a little less potent.

"Wow doesn't even come close.  My wife loves grapefruit and is always looking for grapefruit seltzer or grapefruit soda, most of which is hard to find or full of sugar. So I figured I would give these a try.They are amazing.  We add them to water and they taste like fresh squeezed citrus juice.  I went from drinking 1-2 liters of water a day to drinking 3-4 liters a day.All 4 flavors taste great and taste like fresh fruit.  One packet in a liter of water will provide a mild flavor.  I normally use 1-2 per liter depending on which flavor.  Lemon and lime are stronger than orange and grapefruit.I also use the lime in a gin and tonic and the flavor is great.  Honestly I think you could substitute these for real citrus and you'd have a hard time telling.I will be a life time customer of these, they are that good.  Just glad I found them and bought them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34G9D9YLQN6PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GE90AS#wasThisHelpful","R34G9D9YLQN6PX","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My bunny is getting old and was having serious issues with his hind legs.  Vet said it was lower back arthritis and suggested putting him on Metacam  a RX NSAID.  We did that but he still had issues, barely could use his hind legs and was becoming very incontinent.  Vet said that glu/con for rabbits was difficult but I figured it was worth a shot.He will not eat these directly but he is a picky eater.  So I soak a few of these in water overnight, then mash them, then add fruit juice and puree them.  He still won't eat them but since I have to give him Metacam from a syringe every night a second syringe of this is no big deal.  A large syringe is very handy as these don't really liquify fully.When I first started giving him these he was losing weight and would not even struggle when I feed him with the syringe.  Slowly over a few weeks he got a little stronger each day.  First he struggled a little bit, then he started kicking, and now it take two of us to give him his medicine and with one person he will jump out of your hold.Suffice it to say he is back to his normal self, is gaining the weight back, and seems to have full strength back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KIPB55EOCBNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PZEC52#wasThisHelpful","R2KIPB55EOCBNI","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overwhelming taste of ginger.  I am giving 3 stars as this product is not bad, but labeling it as a Tonic Syrup is really not an accurate description.  Bitters sure.  But the flavor is really a mix of citrus and a whole lot of ginger.  If you are looking for a quinine tonic taste this is DEFINITELY not it.  I was looking for a better tonic to make G&T without using high fructose corn syrup or having to pay a ton for real tonic like Fever Tree or ToniQ.  Sadly this was not the answer.You may like the taste of this product, personally I do not.

"Don't know why but this stuff works much better than the regular stuff.  I've used NM with my dogs and now was using it with my rabbits.  Believe me when I tell you rabbit urine is far worse than dog urine.  It is not quite as bad as cat, but it does have a rather pungent eye watering scent and rabbits use it to mark territory.  So I figured I would try this version of NM and I am extremely satisfied.Not only does it do a better job at removing the aroma, but it also does a better job of removing any stains.  The only downside of this product is that it is very strong and if you use it in large amounts the smell will linger for a little while as it breaks down the urine, but it definitely works.Having used NM more times than I would like to remember, I can definitively say this works better on urine than the regular NM.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQRSHWOQAH5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I5VTRW#wasThisHelpful","RTQRSHWOQAH5M","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love these, but with a big big caveat.  These are not a cracker you will eat plain or if you do you may have a penchant for consuming cardboard.  That being stated, they are amazing as a dietary supplement for fiber.  Eating one plain is like chewing on wood chips, literally.  But, with something very simple, like a light cheese spread they become easy to eat and really quite enjoyable.  Personally I use a wedge of laughing cow cheese (low fat and low calorie and readily available) on each cracker and they become quite tasty.I've been using these as part of a high fiber diet and try to get 3-5 at dinner.  Usually I substitute whatever carb side dish we're having and use these instead.  Or as stated prior, I'll spread some laughing cow cheese on them and use them as the side dish if the main course isn't something they match with well.They are very filling and I find I do not have nearly as many late night cravings.  They work especially well if you drink lots of water with them.  You won't feel bloated but you will feel very very full.On the plus side I have not noticed any negative side effects of ingesting so much fiber in one meal.  In fact I've had nothing but great results.These are great if you're looking to supplement your fiber intake.  Just be aware that they don't do well when eaten plain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LMY1F93H7M9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O8R4N0#wasThisHelpful","R1LMY1F93H7M9P","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK product but not going to buy it again.  The price was a bit high, was expecting a bigger container.  Also the seeds are a major pain to deal with, with the drying process they become even more pronounced and brittle and really get caught in your teeth.  I'd strongly suggest anyone avoid eating these if you don't have dental floss around.Probably a good item for long term storage or camping, etc, but not something I'd suggest for regular daily use.  They tasted fine, but between the cost and the seeds getting stuck in my teeth I doubt I will buy this item again.

"Love it.  Perfect gym bag, has everything I could ask for.Very sturdy and well made, lots of zippers for easy access.  Has a side shoe compartment that fits my size 11.5 Nike Air 180 running shoes with a little bit of room to spare.  Not sure how well this compartment would do above a size 12-12.5.  Other end pocket is great for holding small items like deodorant or q-tips .  Main compartment is roomy enough that even with shoes in the side pocket you have enough room for shorts, socks, shirt, water bottle and a few other items.This is hardly a hockey bag or one for sports where you have lots of equipment, but for the daily gym rat who isn't hauling around extra equipment it works out perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231UDKGE9FF4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CG4LZQ#wasThisHelpful","R231UDKGE9FF4V","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really nicely designed bottle.  I go through about 2-3 liters of water a day and needed an on the go bottle.  My biggest problem, most of them leak.  I commute on the subway in NYC so I have a messenger bag I use to carry my water bottle.  This is my 3rd one as the first two would leak regularly.  They were the old school ""bicycle"" water bottles.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  The flip top and twist top opening looked great and work great.  Makes carrying the bottle easy and cleaning a breeze.Just one thing.  It leaks.  Not once, not twice, but on a regular basis.  I'm 6'3"" and 215lbs and I have to tighten this bottle with all my strength to keep it from leaking, literally as hard as can squeeze it shut, otherwise it leaks if it is left on its side.The safety latch is great to keep it from accidentally opening in your bag or whatever, but be prepared to really crank down on the top if you don't want it leaking into your bag or car seat or wherever you have it where it isn't standing upright.  The leak isn't from the sip top but from the main top.Beyond that I'm very happy with it.  Easy to use at the gym or on the go.  Very well made and designed.  Just that leak is annoying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNSJGZCS4OUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043T9DKC#wasThisHelpful","R1TNSJGZCS4OUO","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use these in a wood fired stove that my wife and I use to heat a soaking tub.  They are great and provide a nice even boost of heat.  Overall the stove aims for high heat but I throw one or two of these in now and again to maintain a prolonged heat.  Best part is the almost complete lack of ash.  All that remains is a light powder.They burn well, sort of a medium heat and long burn.  Personally my wife and I love the smell.  Be warned, however, your neighbors may not appreciate it.  One neighbor asked us if we were burning rubber or plastic.  No idea where she got that idea, but if you've never smelled peat burning it is possible that you could mistake it for a rubber product burning.For the price and weight and quality they are great.

"If you want to really clean out your fuel system this is the way to go.  It contains the most PEA of any cleaner on the market and PEA is what you want.  As quoted in Road & Track:""PEA is the cleaning agent found in any truly effective complete fuel system cleaner. It is the strongest cleaning agent available in fuel additives. It cleans better and cleans more parts than PIB and PIBA. PEA is in a league of its own and in some cases it is the only detergent that can get the job done.""This product contains 30-50% PEA as per the current MSDS.  Google it and you'll see.Techron used to contain PEA but now uses Stoddard Solvent instead, which is basically paint thinner.Lots of debates out there in the auto world on what additives are worth while and which are snake oil.  When in doubt, do some research and then look at the MSDS and find out exactly what is in the additive you buy.As an example, Royal Purple's equivalent which costs about the same ounce for ounce contains 5-15% PEA.  Lucas Oil's Deep Clean 10-30% PEA.Bottom line is know what you are paying for when it comes to any automotive additive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24X0R630IK94J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CPI5Z0#wasThisHelpful","R24X0R630IK94J","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally, finally, finally...I no longer have to go freeze my hind parts off to check the temp on the hot tub.  My wife and I have a wood wired soaking tub which can take from 30-90 minutes to reach 104F...needless to say it is really annoying to a) constantly have to run out to check the temp, b) go out in a bathing suit and find it is too cold, c) go out in a bathing suit and find it is too hot.Now that is no longer a problem.  Not only does this tell you the current temp, but it also shows you whether it is staying stable, rising, falling and how fast it is rising or falling (it has a small icon in the upper right with an arrow that points up, horizontal, or down) and if it is rising/falling fast the arrow points at a higher angle.Since our tub is wood fired it has no electronic flow, it uses thermal siphoning which usually leaves a very hot top layer of water and cold layer beneath.  Solution was to buy a low end sump pump and leave it running when were firing it up.  Obviously we pull it out before going near the water.  This keeps the water stirred and even and helps give an accurate temp.This is also really helpful as you can track how fast the water is heating.  For us that is critical so we can add wood accordingly.  We don't want it too hot or have too much wood left and end up in 108F water.It also is great as you can see how much the water is cooling off and how quickly.Literally I could not have designed a more ideal product.  This does everything I want it to do and eliminates a trip into the cold every 15-20 minutes to ""check on things"".One of the best products I have purchased in a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81W4OEJ03XP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTMSYZU#wasThisHelpful","R81W4OEJ03XP0","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was seriously surprised at how much water this thing moves.  My wife and I have an outdoor wood fired soaking tub that can take between 30-120 minutes to get to full temp.  All the while we have to stir it every 15-20 minutes with a paddle.Well that got old fast, especially as it is getting colder.  So I invested in the smaller pump I could find thinking I'd get a nice low flow to do the work for me.  Well when they say 25 Gallons per minute I don't doubt it.I attached a small 8' hose to this pump as I was trying to get the water to flow faster to the wood stove.  I placed the open end of the hose into the water inlet that leads to the stove. When I plugged in the pump the hose literally flew out the opening and started spraying water everywhere, I was shocked at how much water it was moving.So we ended up just using it to mix the water in the tub and it literally reduced the heating time by about 25-30%.On top of that I was shocked at how quiet it is.  I makes a low audible humming sound that is deep but not loud.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKT849DFH9B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X07GMW#wasThisHelpful","R1YKT849DFH9B7","ASU90XOGDC02M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASU90XOGDC02M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And with the amount of new research being conducted on Vitamin D, it seems it is involved in so many more cellular processes than previously thought (it helps regulate the synthesis of serotonin, for example), and thus should really be taken year-round.VIva Labs makes taking Vitamin D simple, with one small 5000 IU cap.

When a watch approaches a $100 price tag, I would expect at least 3 years of coverage* The clasp feels a little cheap, and makes me wonder about long-term durability* I have smaller wrists, so the watch face seems a little large on me, so keep that in mind when making your decisionBOTTOM LINELovely watch and Invicta has a great reputation, so despite the limited warranty I suspect it will last for years.

"I'm really a t-shirt and jeans guy, and as such, I have a roster of favorite tees in my drawer.

Time will tell if the color will fade to a dull brown, as is the case with most black tees, but for now it's very sharpSTYLEThe v-neck is very nice, and looks both casual and stylish.FITI prefer an athletic cut, where the shoulders are a bit broader and the lines stay tight down the body to the waist. This tee is very short and wide, almost boxy. The arms are about the only area that fit well.VALUE$10 for a tee is fine, if it fits well and is guaranteed to last.

"I have an assortment of foam rollers/massage balls/massage sticks, and have used other SPRI products.

"We have one very hard to please cat, and one cat that will eat tuna-flavored lint if given a chance. The cats are given canned and dry food, rotated throughout the day, and they really enjoy Authority Grain Free Adult Cat Food for their dry food (this was after trying close to a dozen different brands/varieties).I like that the Rachel Ray Nutrish is a no grain, no filler recipe, using very well-sourced ingredients. The size of each grain is pretty small (smaller than a green pea), making the food easy to consume. And the price, though on the higher end, is justified by the quality.That being said, neither of our cats liked it. We even tried mixing the Authority brand with this, but they somehow (leave it up to cats) managed to pick out the pieces they liked, leaving the Rachel Ray Nutrish pieces in the bowl.Bottom line: cats, being cats, are finicky by nature. Based on the ingredient profile, I would recommend this food to other cat owners, but be aware that your cat may still not like it.

"Getting a new bed was LONG overdue. I had been using an old Select Comfort (Sleep Number) bed for years, which I absolutely despised. Quite possibly the most overrated, uncomfortable, glorified, overpriced air mattress. I kept putting off getting a new bed because a) cost, and b) with so many different types of beds available, it seemed daunting to even begin shopping. I had been considering Tempurpedic, but could not justify spending the equivalent of a used car (I know, I know, 1/3 of your life ...). And although I do prefer a harder mattress, when I had the chance to get the Serta Hemmons Gel mattress, it was too good to pass up.The first night on the mattress was pretty magical. It's very soft and you sink right into the top. I move around a lot, from back to side to stomach, but I think I stayed in one position the entirety of the first night. I have since experimented and found that the mattress is ideal for side or back sleepers, but not so much for stomach sleeping.Despite its memory foam structure, you do still feel some movement from your partner, but to a much less degree than with other beds. My wife used to wake me every time she moved on our old mattress, but I haven't really been disturbed since switching to the Serta.The mattress is also nice and thick, so make sure you get deep-fitted sheets.The biggest demerit is the lack of ""coolness"" that is promised. I get warm very easily in bed, which leads to terrible sleep. This mattress is designed to help keep you cool, but I have not noticed this at all. In fact, I think it's actually warmer than my previous bed.It's hard to say if the price is justified, as I've only had the mattress for a few weeks, so my experience is limited. But the Warranty is 10 years, which is reassuring.Overall, I'm really happy with the bed and would certainly recommend checking it out. If anything changes over time, I will update this posting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDDGSBK5H730/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0TC26#wasThisHelpful","R3PDDGSBK5H730","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a gift for my 2-year-old niece (yes, she is under the suggested age, but she is well-supervised), and just in time, as summer comes and goes quickly here in Minneapolis.Assembly isn't terribly difficult, but it is time consuming. My brother and I took turns with the myriad plastic screws. Overall we finished in about an hour, and left the decal work to the kids, who were more than happy to slap stickers on anything BUT the Jeep.The Jeep is of a surprising build quality. The frame, wheels and extra parts feel solid and durable, most likely able to withstand a few years of youngster abuse.Battery charge time is pretty lengthy (14-18 hrs), which for the time invested, offers very little usable time in return (maybe 45 minutes overall).The radio is super basic but functions relatively well. The mp3 jack is a nice touch, though no real place to set the player. The rollbar with lights is cool, but fairly impractical; I don't know many parents who'd want their kids riding this well past sunset.Price is pretty steep, and without really knowing long-term durability, it's hard to gauge if the price is justified. The replacement batteries are also fairly costly, at about $50.The bottom line, of course, is my niece really enjoys the Jeep. So despite any negatives, the positives definitely win out. This is a really fun toy with which kids will not likely grow bored. If price isn't a concern, don't hesitate to pick this up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78CFWQN3DA4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZ2HAKI#wasThisHelpful","R78CFWQN3DA4Y","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never owned, nor to my recollection, even used a sewing machine before, so I can offer no real comparison for the SINGER 1304. But being just an ordinary dude with basic needs, this machine very much fulfills its purpose. I had long been putting off making curtains for my bedroom's french doors, as the thought of laboring with a needle and thread, along with yards and yards of fabric, seemed far too tedious. My wife even recoiled at the thought. Suddenly a light appeared, Amazon opened its arms, and bestowed upon us the SINGER 1304.The first thing I noticed was the feel of the machine, which is very solid. Stands up to any real power tool in terms of durability and seems capable of long-term use with minimal maintenance.The Quick Start guide (yes, I read instructions) was very handy with the initial setup. The controls, even if you don't have a need for the variety of stitch types, are essentially dummy-proof. Just turn the dial and you're in. The thread loads relatively easy from the top. And the pedal kind of makes it feel like you're using a big machine press. Kind of.The unit operates fairly quietly, too, perfect for when you need to sew your crotch at 2 am without disturbing your neighbors.I haven't had a chance to play around with all of the functions, such as the buttonhole makers, but it seems fairly intuitive.The curtains for the french doors turned out really well, so now my wife and I are looking for other projects to do. Based on the price point, I'd say this is a real value buy. Does everything you need, easy to use, and it (according to me) counts as a power tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R295IBCA1M5FFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV4ZWBQ#wasThisHelpful","R295IBCA1M5FFG","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a fairly oily nose, and regularly use pore strips as part of my regimen. As with any nose strips, application of the Biore Charcoal Pore Strips is very simple and easy to use. Just clean, wet, apply, let set for 15 minutes and remove. But in terms of effectiveness, I don't see how the added charcoal offers additional benefits. The amount of oils/skin deposits was the same or even a bit less than what I normally achieve with standard nose strips. My pores didn't appear nor feel any clearer than if charcoal had not been present.Additionally, every time I peeled off the strip, black residue was left on my skin, requiring further cleansing.

"I waited a little over two weeks to review this 5-HTP supplement, as one or two days is far too short a duration to glean any real benefits. About me: troubled sleeper -- lifelong troubled sleeper. Generally very positive outlook, not prone to depression, very even tempered. As such, I was looking for something to help induce a sense of relaxation, so as to improve my sleep quality, but not necessarily to help with mood enhancement. I have tried every concoction one can think of: melatonin, Valerian root, l-tryptophan, GABA, glycine, hot tea with honey, and on and on. I have even tried 5-HTP in the past, but only found it mildly beneficial.Doctor's Best is a little different in that vitamins C and B6 are added to aid in the conversion and uptake of 5-HTP into serotonin. I was dubious, yet hopeful, that this 5-HTP supplement would produce any noticeable results, but I have been sleeping so much better.I am now falling asleep relatively quickly, hit REM sleep (very vivid dreams) and wake up more refreshed. I do still wake up periodically throughout the night, so this is not a cure-all by any means. I'm stacking this product with Choline & Inositol, which seems to be a great combination for me.The pills are small and easy to swallow, and have no odor or foul taste if you burp.Cost-wise, these are a great value.

The Sabre Compact Pepper Spray is perfect for her, for a few reasons:* Key ring attachment is very convenient, as one can attach the bottle to a bag or jacket to keep it easily accessible* The canister is housed in a tough, plastic casing, which withstands outdoor weather and accidental drops on the ground* This pepper spray has a range of 8-10 feet, which is excellent, so one can remain a safe distance from a would-be attacker* Practice canister is a really smart idea, as most people will never have used pepper spray until they NEED to, which could lead to mishandling the device* Safety switch/lock prevents unintentional release of the sprayOne can't put a price on safety, but this pepper spray seems very well priced, offering convenience and peace of mind for those who need it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JFT0K9GQD9JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058ENC7G#wasThisHelpful","R2JFT0K9GQD9JK","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:* Convenient! Very easy to stuff in a gym bag* Flavor is pretty good (French Vanilla). Not too sweet, but I do taste a lot of salt* Well-packaged* Solid 20g of protein per serving, with added vitamins and minerals to help with recovery* Only 170 calories, so it should fit most dietsCONS:* Use of corn maltodextrin as the carb source. I'm all for replacement shakes, where there is a balance of carbs/protein, so long as the carb source is nutrient-dense and not a cheap, highly-processed GMO* Milk protein concentrate isn't the most bio-available form of protein, and it's a slower digesting protein, which means it isn't the most ideal for a post-workout recovery shake* A little sodium-rich for my liking, which comes through in the flavor* Some of the vitamins and minerals are inferior forms, which means the body won't utilize them efficiently (vitaman E is synthetic, B-12 should be methylcobalamin, for example)* At about $2/serving, these are a little more expensive than I'd like. A high-quality protein powder will generally run about $1/servingVERDICT:Convenient, yes. But given the availability of higher quality shakes, at a similar or better price point, it's unlikely I will be recommending this or using it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHYEWOEBO33G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCD7ZC6#wasThisHelpful","R3GHYEWOEBO33G","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't do a lot of gaming (which this router seems to market towards), but when at home I do stream a signal to my blu-ray player (for Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc) and laptop, and even my cellphone. This is an upgrade to my Linksys E2000, which I thought was a great router, but started to get a little glitchy in recent months (signal drop, long-buffering times, etc). The E8350 seemed like a perfect next step, and I couldn't be happier.If you have experience setting up routers, the E8350 should be a breeze to install. The Linksys interface is one of the better ones on the market, which makes setting up the system pretty easy, and actually offers a lot of customization options (parental controls, guest connections, etc) -- which I don't really need, but nice to have.Once set up, I connected my devices and tested the signal speed and strength. File loading and streaming content were lightning fast -- far faster than with my older router. The only limitation I can see thus far is with range. At about 20-25 feet from the unit itself, the signal starts to wane a bit. The 4 antenna units are adjustable, which does help, but for a router with so much under the hood, I would expect a bit more.An odd design note is the lack of indicator lights on the unit. Not a big deal by any stretch, but checking connection status is a little tricky if just looking at the router itself.If you want to plug in for wired connections, the four Gigabit ports are a very nice (and blazing fast) feature.The price point is higher than a lot of models currently available, but I think the features justify the cost -- especially if you have a need for high-end performance. The only real question is long-term reliability, but for now I'm happy with this upgrade and definitely recommend it to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMVROGW5FPVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19M72#wasThisHelpful","R1IMVROGW5FPVL","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:50 MinsI have been using an old Espon Stylus CX7400 for the past 7 years, and it was getting time to take it out to pasture. I like having an all-in-one unit, so I wanted to find something comparable (print, scan, copy) but with wireless capabilities. I didn't have to look long when I came across the Epson Workforce 2660. I snatched it up and so far, it has yet to disappoint.SETUPOut of the box, setup was pretty simple: take off strips of blue tape (used during shipping to hold components closed), connect AC adapter, power up unit and follow the instructions on the color screen. After the initial set up screens, you're then asked to install the software, which brings you through another series of firmware installations/setups, resulting in a Print Test page. The printer was fluid and responsive right out of the gate, and I was surprised by the speed with which the test page printed.CONNECTIVITYUsed the USB connection to get everything up and running which is the simplest option. After initial setup, I then connected to our Wi-Fi, which was pretty easy. The printer looks for available signals, select your network, enter passowrd, and connection is established.The Start Guide also has a QR code to install the Epson iPrint app, for iOS or Android. I REALLY dig this. I tested the app by printing a photo from my phone, and within seconds the image printed. The app not only allows you to print, but also perform maintenance tasks, such as head cleaning and firmware updates, and even shows current ink levels, negating the need to open the Device Panel folder on the PC. Nice.SCAN/COPY/FAXThe scan and copy features are smooth and accurate, and with scanning you have the option of storing the image on the Cloud. Boss. I have no need for the Fax feature, and therefore did not test this out, so I cannot comment on how well this works.PRINT SPEEDI have uploaded a video showcasing just how fast this unit prints. Black & white pages are mere seconds, with color being just a few moments longer. The printer also runs pretty quietly, so you won't have to soundproof the office.INKInk cartridges are small and easy to install, and seem competitively priced (as of this review, between $9-12). The colors are true and bright, and the black is solid (no browning or graying, like with my last printer). Since I haven't been using the printer for long, I cannot comment on how long each cartridge lasts, but will update once I am able.ON-BOARD COLOR TOUCHSCREENThe color touchscreen is pretty slick and responsive. From the screen, you can Copy, Scan, Fax, as well as establish a wireless connection. Very nice feature.CONSThe only real knock I can find at this point is some components feel a little cheap/flimsy, which makes me question long-term durability.FINAL THOUGHTSOverall, I definitely recommend this unit for anyone in need of a printer with a host of capabilities. As I continue to use and explore its features, I will post updates, but for now I'm loving it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38W5CPPGTUTHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QC2K#wasThisHelpful","R38W5CPPGTUTHZ","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I gave up sugar, this has been my go-to sweetener. It's incredibly clean with no additives/fillers, and the taste is awesome. As with most pure stevia, it does have a slightly bitter aftertaste, but not to the degree of others I've tried.I use the stevia in coffee, almond milk, veggie shakes, even baking, and have always been satisfied with the results. A little certainly goes a long way, so start with a small amount and add from there.BulkSupplements is also an excellent re-seller, so feel confident you'll get a great product at a great price.

"I've been clinging to the same beat up Dirt Devil Vibe Upright (with Power Brush attachment!) since I bought it on clearance ten years ago. The suction is terrible, it's as loud as a cement mixer, and it weighs about as much as that cement mixer. Needless to say, I have been in need of a new vacuum for quite some time, but never did I think that vacuum would be a Roomba.Truth be told: I always thought robot vacuums/sweepers were a bit of a gimmick, something for tech-junkies or, well, the lazy. So when it arrived in the mail, I opened it with both skepticism and cynicism, thinking, if nothing else, the Roomba would serve as a fun new  torture device for our cat, Sherlock. As much as it pains me to admit, I am now eating crow. The Roomba 870, despite a few limitations, is an incredible appliance and I will (probably) not speak ill-ly of them again.My home set up: one-bedroom apartment, about 700 sq ft, tile in the bathroom and kitchen, carpet and throw rug in living room, bedroom and closet. One short-hair domestic cat who loves to shed, and one imported wife with long black hair, who also loves to shed. After spending some time with it, here is a list of Pros and Cons for owning the iRobot Roomba 870:PROS:* Solid construction. The Roomba is built like a tank, but has soft edges, so if it does collide with an object (which rarely happens anyway), no damage will be incurred* Surprisingly quiet. I can still hear the TV/stereo/conversation while the Roomba is running* No more spinning brushes that get clogged with debris! I didn't realize what a pleasure this would be (specifically, it doesn't choke on the tassels at the ends of the throw rug! Genius)* Fairly intuitive, easy setup. I'm certainly not ignorant of technology, but for time's sake, I'll always prefer simple programming. Can set up multiple, scheduled cleanings with relative ease* Long battery life and self-charging. The battery has yet to die mid-cleaning, as I don't have a ton of square footage, but this is still a a great feature. The Roomba will find the nearest dock and park itself until fully re-charged* Collects a great deal of cat hair and dust, so it lives up to the pet/allergen claims* Strong suction. We have an issue of our cat trailing litter everywhere, which we're constantly sweeping. The Roomba is easily able to suck up the litter granules* Transitions pretty smoothly from the tile to carpet. It only got hung up once, but only because it hit a warped part of the rubber carpet stripping.CONS:* Warranty. Comes with one-year limited standard, but with an appliance with this much technology, and at this price point, I would expect at least 5, if not 10, years of coverage.* Can't use it on furniture, like our couch, which still necessitates owning another vacuum or handheld device* See above, for carpeted stairs (I mean, you COULD use the Roomba on stairs, but you'd have to manually lift it onto each step, thus defeating the purpose)* Dust bins are a little small, meaning they need to be changed after every cleaning, but I am willing to concede the overall size of the unit will limit thisIf you're on the fence about buying a Roomba, take it from me that it's worth the plunge. I'm now thinking of getting one for my mom and step-dad, who also own a cat, and just don't have much time or energy to vacuum their place. And if you're curious, besides functioning as a high-tech cleaning device, it definitely delivers as an entertaining torture machine for pets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KDVBAQPE6W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKQBHVO#wasThisHelpful","R27KDVBAQPE6W3","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this pitcher at just the right time, as I needed a new pitcher in which to brew some fresh iced tea. Normally, I drop ice cubes and/or lemon wedges into the tea, but the Contigo takes a painfully easier and cleaner approach, offering an infuser stick and ice core. But is the pitcher's high price justified?PROS:* Durable, thick plastic that will resist drops* Seals really well. Lemon wedges lasted well over 5 days* Lifetime Warranty coverage* Quality, BPA-free materialCONS* Somewhat difficult to maneuver with one hand, as the pour-release button is tough* Lid can be tricky to pull off* High priceVERDICTThe Contigo is definitely a premium pitcher, with plenty to satisfy most users, but in the end it really is just a pitcher. Is the sealing quality really that important when sitting in the fridge? And how often will one utilize the infuser stick?

"This one took me by surprise. There will be obvious comparisons to OxyElite Pro, which isn't quite fair, as OEP was a different kind of beast, but I'll admit I was definitely comparing/contrasting my experience between the two. The ingredient profile for EpiBURN Pro isn't all that unique, with maybe the exception of Nelumbo Nucifera, which may have appetite suppression and lipolytic properties. Other than that, Ashwagandha root, Olive leaf extract, forskolin, yohimbe and caffeine have all been used in various weight-loss products. But so far, I've had good luck with it.Tried one capsule at first, which didn't seem to have much effect (the only reason for a one-star demerit). But at a two-cap dose, the sweating really began. Energy is smooth and long-lasting, with no crash. And even a surprising amount of mental focus. I have yet to need a third cap, as two generally gets me through the day. Taken pre-workout, plenty of energy with some left over, and moderate appetite suppression.One final point is that each capsule only has 100 mg of caffeine, which is great for those with low tolerance, or if you want to stack with other stimulant-based products.So, is it OEP? No, but it is a great product by its own merits, and I'll definitely keep it in my arsenal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9Q71Q68OU25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLV4TQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2S9Q71Q68OU25","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is subject to future editing, as I have yet to travel with the suitcase, so all observations are based on initial impressions of the luggage itself. For now, my stupid cat crawls inside every time I open it up to show it off. Get out of there, Sherlock!PROS* Ridiculously light. My lazy cat weighs 5 pounds more than this baby!* Solid construction. Stitching seems durable, and the material feels like it will withstand some abuse. Unlike my cat ... wuss.* 360 degree spinning wheels. Like when I toss my cat off the counter and he spins across the room.* Vibrant, attractive color (blue, in this case). My cat looks attractive ... in the right light, after a bath, from a distance, if you squint your eyes really tightly.* Retractable handle that actually extends and locks to a usable height. My cat extends too, when he stretches before a 12-hour nap.* Multiple front pockets seem handy for housing passports, e-tickets, photos of my cat, etc.* Limited 10-year warranty. If only I could return my damaged cat. How long do they live?CONS* The zippers aren't the smoothest, which concerns me with repeated use. Might the teeth get gnarled and lock up, or do that weird middle-split thing?* Retractable handle feels a teensy bit flimsyFINAL THOUGHTSIn all honesty, I think this is a very worthy entry in the carry-on market.

"I usually have 4-5 different protein powders on-hand, as I work for a supplement retailer and have access to numerous products. At this point I have probably tried 50-60 different kinds of protein powders, some good some garbage. Lean Body by Labrada was a brand with which I had no prior experience, so I had no expectations. Here are my thoughts:PROS:* Fairly clean profile, taking a more natural approach to the ingredients and sweeteners* Mixes up pretty well with a shaker cup, and not too gritty* Taste is excellent. This is really the high-point of the product. Not overly sweet, not too bland, with a bold chocolate flavor* Easily digestible, with no subsequent cramping or boatingCONS:* Price per serving is far higher than it should be -- as of this review, over $1.50 per scoop* Given the overall caloric value and lack of satiation, not an effective meal replacement* Some questionable ingredients, like non-dairy creamer (provides a smooth mouth-feel, but invaluable as a nutrient) and polydextrose (a very cheap, fiber-like ingredient)* No full-disclosure as to what their ""Natural Flavors"" areBOTTOM LINE:If you're looking for a well-balanced protein powder (the macros are 50/30/20 proteins, carbs, fats) without a lot of additives, Lean Body Hi Protein is definitely a viable option.

"I have fairly weak wrists, especially since having surgery on my left wrist, so certain exercises (barbell bench press, military press, etc) cause undue stress, limiting my ability to lift heavy weight. After using the new HumanX Wrist Stabilizers for several workouts, I can say they are quite effective at aiding in wrist support/strength, but do come with some negative points as well.PROS:* Very thick, cushy padding feels good against the skin and compresses the wrists well* Adjustable to fit a broad range of wrist sizes* Very strong and really stabilizes the wrists, allowing one to increase the weight load of a given exercise* Stays in place/no shifting, so no need to readjust during the workoutCONS:* Padding is not extended all the way around the straps, leaving a gap of no protection* Takes a little adjusting to sit comfortably on the wrists* The metal buckle can rub against the wrist bones if not positioned correctly* No breath-ability, so wrists get sweaty* Price point a little high, especially given the Chinese manufacturing tagOverall, HumanX Wrist Stabilizers are a good, not great, product.

"As an avid gym goer looking to maximize joint health and recovery, I have tried numerous combinations, concoctions, elixirs, witch's brews, etc for my joints, each of which certainly has its own merits, but nothing that I can definitively say has been effective. Chondroitin, glucosamine, MSM, fish oil, white willow bark, boswellia, and turmeric have all graced my supplement cupboard, but always willing to experiment, I have implemented a newcomer: NeoCell Hyaluronic Acid.First off, it's hard to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of this type of product, as it generally takes time to build in the body, and even then results can be quite subtle. And one's anecdotal evidence is obviously not the best tool by which to measure whether or not a product will work for you, especially given that we all respond differently to ingredients/products. SO, to determine whether or not the hyaluronic acid was effective, I took it exclusively without the aid of other joint supplements for the first two weeks, then added in other supplements for the remainder of the supply.From what I can gather, the hyaluronic acid seems to be more salubrious when used in conjunction with other products; in my case, I added turmeric (Curcumin) and MSM. On its own, my joints certainly had a reduction in inflammation and my post-workout recovery was pretty solid, but the results were far more dramatic when used in a regimen of products. My knees, normally my most bothersome joints, felt particularly strong.As for the pills themselves, they are small and easy to swallow, gentle on the stomach, with no disagreeable odor. The price point seems to be about right, though, considering the pills are more effective when used with other supplements, the monthly cost could quickly add up.Overall, a good, not great, product for joint health, but certainly worth looking into if you have exhausted other options, or are looking to get that little extra boost from your current joint program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYX63HT4IJBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QS10LY#wasThisHelpful","R2PYX63HT4IJBF","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PZ Myers is a breath of fresh, godless air. As much as I enjoy reading the works of the ""new"" atheists (Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, etc), the tone of their efforts is generally of a much more serious, often times combative nature, an urgent call to action against primitive beliefs that hold back the progress of humanity. While Myers does address many serious topics, his humor pervades within The Happy Atheist, offering an alternative, light-hearted perspective on why the belief in god(s) is silly and antiquated.The Happy Atheist is broken up into short, easily digestible chapters, each focusing on different issues that arise in the ""to believe or not to believe"" debate. Myers uses his sharp scientific mind to great effect, poking copious holes in the arguments and defenses laid out by believers, many of whom respond to Myers with nothing less than death threats. Some of the various topics covered in this short book are abortion, evolution, morality, and perhaps my favorite chapter, the desecration of a communion wafer.My only real grievance with the book (pamphlet?) is the overall lack of cohesiveness. There does not seem to be an overarching point or message, other than the belief in god(s) is no longer relevant in our modern, scientifically-learned world.An enjoyable read offering wisdom and compelling arguments on every page, The Happy Atheist is sure to polarize its readers, but will ultimately satisfy those on the godless side of the argument. I'll end with my favorite passage from the book:(P. 28) [Referring to the desecration of ""sacred"" items] ""Nothing must be held sacred. Question everything. God is not great, Jesus is not your lord, you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet. You are all human beings who must make your way through your lives by thinking and learning, and you have the job of advancing humanity's knowledge by winnowing out the errors of past generation and finding a deeper understanding of reality.

"I sweat a lot. Even sitting here, typing this out, I can feel beads trickling. As such, I need a good deodorant to mask the activity of my underarms. Some time ago, I switched over to aluminum-free deodorants and antiperspirants, because I realized aluminum was blocking my pores and irritating my underarms. My mainstay deodorant has been Herbal Clear Sport Deodorant Stick 1.80 Ounces, which I really like, but I wanted to try something new with a different scent.Baxter of California -- though not an antiperspirant -- is an excellent alternative for me. I like that it rolls on clear and smoothly, and is a cylindrical shape, rather than the traditional oblong shape of most deodorants (why did that shape become the standard, anyway??). The scent is great, being very light and not overpowering, but still masculine (though my wife has actually borrowed it!).The odor protection seems to last a quite a while, even under heavy, sweaty conditions, such as after a good workout, so no need to reapply throughout the day. The only major downside is the cost, which is a little hard to justify, considering there are much less expensive alternatives.But if you're looking for a more natural deodorant that's free of aluminum and the other typical chemicals found in many brands, I certainly recommend giving Baxter of California a try!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10T3TZ10QJNET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XTWFZE#wasThisHelpful","R10T3TZ10QJNET","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a runner and occasional cyclist, tracking my workouts has been aided immensely by the use of heart rate monitors -- of which I have owned several. Prior to GPS technology, I owned the Timex Ironman Men's Road Trainer Heart Rate Monitor Watch, Black/Orange, Full Size -- which was spotty, but got the job done; then upgraded to a GPS-enhanced Garmin Forerunner 405CX GPS Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor (Blue), which was an awesome GPS HRM. And now I'm back to Timex, with their new Run Trainer 2.0, loaded with plenty 'o bells and whistles.PROS:* Despite all appearances, the watch is not too obtrusive or bulky and sits comfortably on the wrist* Big display screen that presents a ton of training data: heart rate (when wearing the chest strap), distance, pace, intervals/splits, etc* Comfortable HRM chest strap that fits well and doesn't slide around when running; and maintains good communication with the watch* Fairly easy-to-use functionality and set-up (took maybe 5 minutes to get familiar with the features and user info fields)* Better-than-average GPS synch with accurate data* Solid battery life (Timex states 8 hours, which seems to be about right) and quick recharge time* BUTTONS -- ACTUAL BUTTONS! (Garmin Forerunner users will understand my frustration)* The ability to upload data to several websites is awesomeCONS:* Can take a little time to lock onto a solid GPS signal, and has (only a couple of times) lost the signal during a run* The unit will occasionally lose my heart rate signal, but the seems to occur mainly when the temps are a little lower* For some reason, when the battery is completely drained, the watch will reset the field data to January 1, and the time gets screwed up. It does fix itself once recharged and a GPS signal is reestablished, so more of a minor nuisance than anythingHave not used this in water to test its ability there, nor do I own a foot pod, but both features are definitely nice to have. The hydration reminder seems a little unnecessary, as I think most athletes know when to fuel during a workout, but again, nice for those who need it. Price seems fair for what you get, and is more-or-less in the range of most GPS HRMs of the same caliber.Overall, a great contender in the GPS HRM category, and a vast improvement over many other models. I'd definitely recommend the Run Trainer 2.0 for those in need of a reliable HRM with an abundance of features!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPBNW592TZV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT8XXAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NPBNW592TZV0","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, protein bars have become better and better, with companies utilizing excellent ingredients in order to maximize taste and nutritional value. My go-to bars are by Quest Nutrition, which have to be the best on the market, but thinkThin bars are certainly a worthy option when I want to munch on something different.The texture is a unique chewy/crispy blend that some might consider on the dry side, but I personally enjoy it. The flavor, in my case dark chocolate, is definitely a big selling point: not too sweet, definitely indulgent, with the right amount of bitterness.The nutritional profile is better than most bars, being gluten-free, low(er)-carb, but the high amount of sugar alcohols might cause digestive issues for some. There are 20g of good quality protein, coming mainly from whey and soy isolates, with casein filling in the rest. And the inclusion of a vitamin and mineral blend is a nice touch.

"Sure, I reside in a state where the sun only rears its warm, life-giving light 10% of the year (yay, Minnesota!), but when those golden beams do shine down, I attempt to absorb every last photon into my pasty, translucent skin. To transform my milky white epidermis into a breathtaking golden hue, I generally rely on the standard Banana Boat brand of various tanning gels and creams. But, wanting to expand the collection of half-used, expiring bottles of varying SPF in my bathroom cabinet, I thought I'd branch out and try the new Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel. Here are my initial thoughts:PROS:* absorbs really well, leaving no sticky or greasy residue behind* light, pleasant odor that won't attract bugs, nor repel the opposite sex (more perfumey than tropical)* offers good protection, while still allowing for a nice tan to developCONS:* the solution does not distribute well with the current spray cap, and tends to drip* for a ""gel,"" it is very thin -- more like a cologne/perfume consistency* might have to reapply the solution frequently, as it does not seem to last very long -- especially when sweating or swimming* slightly irritating to the eyes, though not as much as my Sport Sunscreen* COSTOverall, if you're looking for a new, unique tanning gel in a fairly attractive bottle, you can't go wrong with Hampton Sun.

"I love me some wheat grass shots, and will jump at the chance to slam a fresh squeezed shot any opportunity I get. However, ArgoLabs Wheatgrass Boost shot will not replace the real thing anytime soon.The flavor is not terrible, as there are certainly hints of wheat grass and juice, but the aftertaste is not desirable. The shot leaves a tacky residue in your mouth that lingers long after you've swallowed. Blech.Boost? Did not notice any, which is its main selling point. The B-vitamins and ""boost blend"" are not dosed well enough to offer any real energy support, especially given that the B-12 (normally an excellent vitamin for energy enhancement) is the inferior form of Cyanocobalamin, which the body cannot readily utilize (look for Methylcobalamin, which is the active form of B-12, and much better absorbed and retained in the tissue). The only real boost may come from the 4g of sugar!Nutrition wise, this Wheatgrass Boost shot once again takes a back seat to an actual wheatgrass shot.

"The ab wheel/roller is one of the best exercises one can do to strengthen their abs/core, and it's an exercise I have always utilized in my workout routine. Since it's fairly tough to overwork the core, it's one of the few muscle groups you can workout multiple days per week, so having an ab wheel at home is ideal.Overall, the Ab Carver is a great piece of equipment and simple to use. The ergonomic handles feel great in the hands, and the wide wheel base offers easy targeting of the obliques -- as well as increased stability. As a more advanced user, I'm not entirely sold on the ""kinetic engine"" assisting in the movement, but novice users may find it beneficial.Compared to other ab wheels, the Ab Carver is definitely on the pricier side, which is the main reason for losing one star in the rating. Most ab wheels are priced between $15-20, and I cannot say having the kinetic spring is worth spending the extra money.But if you're looking to tighten that midsection and lower back, are new to using an ab wheel and want a little assistance, the Ab Carver Pro is a worthy option!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NETAMXKH2FX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1N0R6C#wasThisHelpful","R2NETAMXKH2FX6","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past few years, I have tried numerous brands of in-ear headphones, but have never found that right combination of fit and sound. When I saw the new Monster iSport Strive, I thought my problems would soon be over. Wrong.First, the fit. The shape is kind of odd to begin with, perhaps in an effort to be ergonomic and follow the natural curvature of the ear canal. However, these never quite stayed comfortably in my ear. The upper fin was a nuisance at first, but I eventually did grow accustomed to it. But, the bottom portion of the ear piece was far too hard, meaning after just 15-20 minutes of use, my ears would be in pain. There are three different sized ear tips included here, but unlike Goldilocks, I could never find a size that was ""just right."" They were either unbearably tight, or incredibly loose.I'm willing to overlook the size/fit of the earphones overall, as it's hard to make a product designed to fit everyone, just as long as they sound good. And this is where I was really disheartened. I've owned several Monster products in the past, all of which have been outstanding, but the sound on these was dismal at best. The iSport is plenty loud, but terribly balanced. There is no real definitive bass on the low end, and the treble is rather tinny. Adjusting my mp3 player's EQ levels did help a little, but not enough to override the poor quality.The one positive aspect is the flat cables, which do help eliminate tangling. The cables are also fairly light, which makes it ideal for running or other cardio activities.Sadly, I cannot recommend the Monster iSport in-ear headphones -- especially at this price point. I wish I had a better recommendation, but I have yet to really find a pair that work for me!

"As a former fat guy (nearly ten years strong of having lost 70+ pounds), I know firsthand the stranglehold food companies have on consumers. I was addicted to every form of fat, sugar and salt available -- preferably all in the same food/meal! Now that I am health-conscious, preparing to become a fitness trainer and dietitian, with a wife who just graduated from nursing school, I'm hoping to use books like Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, as a means of relaying the insidiousness of food giants, and the dangers they impose upon the public.SSF is a well-written, heavily researched book, exposing the dark, predatory nature of food manufacturers, and how they use those three key ingredients to hook us into consuming unhealthy, packaged food in vast quantities. There is obviously an agenda/bias from the onset, so if you're looking for a fair and balanced expose, temper those expectations. But I think most of us know too well the greediness of food corporations, and thus have very little sympathy or interest in seeing their bottom lines are met.The book starts with a secret meeting held among the food giants, such as Kraft, General Mills, Pillsbury, etc., where a well-intention-ed VP of Kraft made a compelling presentation on the dangers their own food companies impose on the health of the public, and how they have an opportunity to step up and present healthier options. Michael Mudd, the VP on stage, was quickly leveled by General Mills head Stephen Sanger, who essentially rebutted with, ""Look, we're not going to screw around with the company jewels and change the formulations because a bunch of guys in white coats are concerned about obesity."" And that, folks, just about sums up the vested interest food companies have in our health. (Note: it isn't just the food companies who are to blame, as Big Tobacco is also in cahoots, as well as greedy politicians)From there, author Michael Moss takes us through what is essentially a history course on each ingredient, Sugar, Fat and Salt, why we have physiological cravings for them, how the food industry uses this knowledge to manipulate and stimulate certain brain receptors (interestingly enough, sugar has the same effects on the brain as drugs) in order to get us to consume more, and heart-wrenching stories of those whose lives have been directly affected by the food industry. Perhaps the most disgusting portrait of this abuse is the studies conducted using children, where a ""bliss point"" (that magical level of ultimate satisfaction) is being discovered through various taste tests of sugary foods.For fans of Michael Pollan, and films like Hungry for Change, you will certainly enjoy Salt Sugar Fat. For those with any interest in their own health, or the health of their families, this is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJ93H1D4V9Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069807#wasThisHelpful","R3LJ93H1D4V9Z3","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really on the fence with this book. Dreams and Shadows was my first foray into the ""sci-fi"" genre of novels, so within that genre, I cannot make comparisons, but I know what I like and dislike when it comes to fiction in general. I'll try to construct this review as generically as I can, to avoid any plot spoilers.First, the characters were all inventive and plentiful, from wish-granting djinns to more sinister fairie-type creatures. But the author never gave me a sense of why I should care for any of the characters -- even the protagonist(s) Colby and Ewan. This may be the biggest weakness of the book, the lack of character development and empathy we should feel for them. Even the relationships between the characters was somewhat murky/unclear, in terms of how/if they cared for one another.The arc/plot is probably the novel's biggest strength, in that the story moves along at a fairly quick pace, with fascinating turns along the way. The world created by Cargill was bright and imaginative, and there is a satisfying amount of blood and gore for those seeking a little violence, but mixed with enough romance and humor to offset the novel's darkness. I definitely appreciated the fact that I could not tell where the story was heading (predictability is an immediate turn-off), and it did ultimately resolve in a satisfying conclusion.Stylistically, the author's writing style is somewhat weak, as is evidenced, for example, by his reliance upon on overused literary devices to serve as a means of exposition. There were constant passages of ""An excerpt by Dr. Thaddeus Ray, Ph.D., from his book A Chronicle of the Dreamfolk,"" which is followed by a clinical, biographical description of certain characters and their kin/lineage. This particular device is on par with the done-to-death ""Merriam Webster's defines ... ."" The saving grace was the dialogue, which I did find to be natural and flowed well. Writing in the voice of children, for example, is often hard to achieve successfully, as most author's dumb down their vocabulary. But Cargill handles it with deftness, giving us a sense that the characters are mature and strong.Overall, a mediocre entry into the vast collection of fiction, though, perhaps, sci-fi enthusiasts will enjoy the colorful characters and world found within Dreams and Shadows. I will likely not recommend this book to others, but there is a good chance I will read Cargill's next effort, as his writing does show strong promise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMPG7D9QOML4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190423#wasThisHelpful","R3TMPG7D9QOML4","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With just a handful of ingredients, Kay's is able to make a tasty, healthy, and satisfying snack, neither too sweet nor too dull, with an enjoyable crunchy texture. These are definitely more cinnamon-heavy than almond, but I don't consider this a knock at all.With 12g of protein, 4g of fiber, just 3.5g of fat and no artificial sweeteners, Kay's Cookie Bites are a far better option than most snacks available, and I have even tossed these in a bowl with some almond milk for a great breakfast cereal option!Here is the nutritional profile:Serving Size: 34gCalories: 125Total Fat: 3.5g (6%)Saturated Fat: 0gCholesterol: 0mgSodium: 336mg (13%)Total Carbohydrate: 15g (5%)Dietary Fiber: 4g (15%)Sugars: 3gProtein: 12g (17%)INGREDIENTS:Soy protein isolate, Rice flour, Yellow degermed corn flour, Almond butter, Corn starch, Evaporated cane juice, Natural honey, Pea fiber, Inulin, Tapioca starch, Cinnamon powder, Non-aluminum baking powder, Xantham gum, Natural flavoring, Stevia.The only real knock, and hence the 4-star rating, is the sodium content is on the higher side, which is a problem for those on a restricted or reduced sodium diet.

"For better or worse, I ingest copious amounts of caffeine throughout the day, and even if I taper off my intake in the early afternoon, I still feel the effects when it comes time to sleep. The obvious solution is to simply not take caffeine so late -- or at all -- but it's difficult to say no to that sweet, sweet rush of energy!Has Rutaesomn come to the rescue? I honestly have to give a reluctant yes, as I definitely had my doubts. To put Rutaesomn to the test, I took about 200mg of caffeine around 5pm, which normally would be a death sentence for sleep. A few hours later, I popped one capsule of Rutaesomn, and by the time I was ready to turn it, I actually felt sleepy and had zero issues shutting down for the night. I have even taken a capsule just as a relaxant, without caffeine in my system, and it works really well on that front, too! For me, it works even better than Valerian Root and Passion Flower, each of which is very effective in promoting relaxation and good sleep.If you're someone who has difficulty shutting off your mind after a heavy day of coffee or soda drinking, I definitely suggest giving Rutaesomn a try. The only reason for my four-star rating is the limited information regarding long-term effects. Given the lack of regulation in the supplement industry, it can, often times, be a toss of the dice with a product's safety and efficacy, so please do exercise caution and moderate your use of the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FDFYCM3HAK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DKXR64#wasThisHelpful","R21FDFYCM3HAK8","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chapstick, Carmex, Buddha Balm, Burt's Bees ... these are just a few of the countless brands of lips balms that have floated around my house in years past. Not necessarily on the hunt for a ""volumizing"" balm, the new Envyderm Lip Volumizing and Conditioning Plumper did sound intriguing, and having recently lost the last tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy, the opportunity to try this came at just the right time.The gloss applies really smoothly and evenly, with no clumping or overly tacky feeling. The scent is muted but fresh, so you're not overwhelmed with either a perfumed or waxy odor. And once applied, I didn't feel the need to reapply every few hours, as I tend to do with other lip balms.Does the product live up to its name by volumizing and plumping up your kisser? Yes and no. I definitely felt a tingle, which kind of took me by surprise, indicating there are active ingredients in the formula. It sort of feels like a menthol rub, akin to Vick's Vapor Rub, but much more subtle. My lips certainly felt much more hydrated and healthy, but I didn't necessarily perceive an increase in fullness -- at least not dramatically so.The applicator could use some tweaking, as it feels a little flimsy and cheap, not really delivering a smooth application. And the price point seems a tad high for what you get.Overall, I still recommend the product, despite its few setbacks, as my lips feel much healthier and more moist, but it's unlikely -- at least at this price -- that it will be a regular addition to my lip balm/gloss rotation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXE94N1CDOXCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098I0D4S#wasThisHelpful","RXE94N1CDOXCG","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a fitness-y type dude who works out 4-5 days per week, protein powders have become a dietary staple -- for better or worse. I tend to stick with protein isolates or isolate/concentrate blends, which have little to no carbohydrates, and are fairly low calorie, reserving the rights to add carbs/calories as I see fit. As such, MetRX Protein and Oats wouldn't seem like a fit for me, but I thought I'd give it a go, as it would free me up from having to prepare carbohydrates post-workout or between meals. Well, I think I have stumbled upon a protein powder which will quickly go into my rotation!Taste is surprisingly bold, without being overly sweet. Lots of vanilla and cinnamon, both of which blend very well with the added oats. No grittiness or poor aftertaste, either.Mixibility is fairly good, but with oats being a big presence here, you can't expect a perfectly smooth, clump-less texture. Still blends better than a lot of other protein powders on the market.The texture took some getting used to, as the oats were begging to be chewed, so my gulps weren't perfectly smooth. Not a deal breaker by any stretch, but definitely a new experience.Nutritional profile is pretty solid, at 200 calories and 17g of complex carbs. There is very little in sodium, low sugars, with a healthy dose of dietary fiber, making it an excellent heart-healthy option. There is also a good 25g dose of blended proteins (soy, whey concentrates and isolates, casein and egg). This means you're getting a great combination of slow and fast digesting proteins. And the addition of digestive enzymes will greatly aid in the absorption and breakdown of those proteins and carbs.Here's a breakdown of the nutrients and ingredients:Serving Size: 56gServings per container: about 16Calories: 200Total Fat: 4g (6%)Sat.

You could certainly eat only 1/2 serving size in order to maximize the value, but you'd also be cutting down on total protein intake, which you'd have to supplement elsewhere.Overall, definitely worth adding in to your dietary regimen, especially if you like to take in carbohydrates with your protein, after a tough workout. And try this as a batter base for protein pancakes!

Either taking pity on me, or having grown tired of my constant grievances, my wife suggested I use this new Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer. But, I'm a tough, bearded guy! I can't be seen dabbing moisturizer upon my scaly, blotchy skin! Enough was enough, however, and I caved. And I dabbed. And I liked.The moisturizer is very smooth, not greasy at all, absorbs remarkably quickly and, best of all, is only ever-so-lightly scented, leaving me some dignity as a Brawny Man. Best of all, it actually did ease the skin irritations from which I had been plagued. The fact that the moisturizer has an SPF of 15 is a nice touch, as well, though, here in Minneapolis where we see sunshine 13 days of the year, is not as much a necessity as in other climates.Overall, I highly recommend this product, whether you have a gnarly scruff in need of taming, or soft, smooth baby-butt skin that you're trying to preserve. The only downside is having to admit to my wife that she was right, the end of which I will never hear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2MGODL7JXIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RNUH7M#wasThisHelpful","R1N2MGODL7JXIQ","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My brother just remodeled his basement bathroom, so as a gift I gave him this American Standard Satin Nickel faucet. In typical brotherly fashion, I was enlisted to help install said faucet, which, I must say, was far easier than I anticipated.Installation was a breeze, as the instructions were clear and concise -- which is much appreciated, for the non-handyman like me. We did not need to acquire any additional specialty tools, so with the basic wrenches, screw drivers, etc, we installed the faucet in very little time.The function of the faucet is incredibly smooth, with precise movements on the handles, and excellent water flow from the tap. What more can you ask for?The style/form is both modern and elegant, and satin nickel finish is killer. It will definitely be the standout piece in the bathroom.All in all, a great faucet at an excellent price.

"Me gym guy. Me lift heavy weights, like rocks. Sometimes knees and shoulders hurt. Me no like. Pain sometimes make salty fluid discharge from eyes. Arrgggh!Okay, you get the point. Between running and lifting weights, I do pound my body pretty hard, all of which makes my joints ache. I always use a high-quality fish oil supplement, as well as a blend of MSM, glucosamine and chondroitin, to help combat the pain, but even that concoction still leaves me a tad stiff and sore. I had heard plenty of good things about turmeric (curcumin), namely its ability to help decrease inflammation, so I thought I'd give it a try. Wow. Where has this little capsule been all my life!?Jarrow Formulas Curcumin 95 offers 500mg of curcumin per dose, and is now a regular part of my supplement regimen. I take one capsule after my workouts, along with my other supplements, and not only has it helped decrease my joint pain, but it speeds up my recovery as well. For example, last week I strained my lower back, so I doubled up on the Curcumin -- which was the only change I made to my regimen -- and within just a few days my back was nearly good as new. I've strained my lumbar region several times (should probably stop lifting so many heavy rocks), and have never recovered this quickly before.All things considered, we all respond differently to supplements, so many may not experience the same benefits as I have, but if you're looking to improve joint health and muscle aches, I can't recommend Jarrow Formulas Curcumin 95 enough. And at its current price, it is a fairly inexpensive supplement as well, so give it a try!Me now go back to cave and take nap.P.S. Try breaking open a capsule and adding a dash to some stir fry!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6SZ97FNJIIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HKZ85A#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6SZ97FNJIIW","A3IMO49QD6OYKN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IMO49QD6OYKN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure why these would be necessary, but I decided to give DII Kitchen Millennium Washable, Non Adhesive Refrigerator Bins and Shelf Liners a try for one reason. Soup season has arrived. There is one single thing that I put into the fridge in a pot, and that is soup. Recently, due to the fact that my Paula Deen cookware soup pot has a lid that has never fit properly, I have spilled soup a time or two. I usually put a fresh pot of soup into the fridge overnight, before eating it for two reasons. One, it always tastes better the second day. Two, if the soup contains any meat or poultry there will be fat. I skim it off the top before heating it. Due to the ill fitting lid I have spilled some soup a time or two. These will hopefully soak it up before it manages to spill over the sides of a shelf.I did not spill soup in order to review this. Even if they work well, it just isn't something I want to do. I did cut them to fit a couple of shelves, and they look nice. I took a piece and tossed it into the laundry and washed it twice. It must be laid flat to dry. It does dry up pretty well so far.  Time will tell if this is a good idea, but for now the refrigerator liners look nice, and seem to wash up pretty well. Hopefully it will perform as hoped and help to cut down on cleanup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23S8PM28NEG2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHB11M#wasThisHelpful","R23S8PM28NEG2H","A13H5US9Z7L9M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H5US9Z7L9M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband was quite pleased with this deodorant. He is not someone who works in an office but he does like to wear a dab of fragrance when he goes out, ( he actually found one that doesn't set off my sensitivities,) and always tends to buy deodorant with a scent. I thought this would be nice for him to try.  What he does do for a living is repair machines in a food factory. Even though he is about at retirement age, he has a physically demanding job.This does not have an overwhelming scent, which I am grateful for, because I am sensitive to fragrance carriers. It is light and pleasant and so far has not given me a blasting headache, so I think I'm safe. Also, the fragrance fades fairly quickly which makes me happy. He enjoys this fragrance and has had no issues with it not being strong enough a deodorant. It works quite well for him, even at work.I would say that this is a win, win in this house. He was happy as could be at getting a fancy new deodorant, and it doesn't seem to contain the carriers that bother me. Will we purchase this agin? Possibly, as a gift.

"The Veil (Fianna Trilogy III) by Megan Chance is easily the best book of the three. Well paced, well written and very enjoyable. The story of the Fianna, the velada and the Fomori and the battle they have been called to fight. The calling of these two warring factors was inadvertent, but it now had to be dealt with. The decision belonged the grace, the Fomori.There was yet another choice. If Grace survived the decision on the night of Samhain, which of the men would she choose? Patrick, her protector, or Diarmid, who may have won her love through enchantment? And still, things were different now, than they were 2000 years ago, there was something different about the velada. What was it?There were triangles everywhere, perhaps the magic of three? And we can't forget the Druids and the Sidhe, for they factored into all that was happening as well. How would it end? What would the decision be? And what did the change in the prophecy etched on the ogham stick mean?The first to books in this series drag a fair bit. I blame the editing, not the author. Perhaps the publisher wanted a trilogy where a good solid book would have sufficed. THIS is what they could have had, if they had let that happen. This is a good solid, and memorable read. But you really do need to read the first two books first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2L064EBWYHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503945723#wasThisHelpful","R1U2L064EBWYHS","A13H5US9Z7L9M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H5US9Z7L9M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been reading the Leigh Koslow series since book #1. I did not go looking for that book, but thankfully it found me. I was looking around a Half Price Books store and happened on a few of Edie Claire's books. In fact, two of the three I picked up that day were stand alone books and not part of this series at all. I loved them both. The I started in on the first Leigh Koslow, and never looked back. There were a few lean years, when I wasn't able to find any new books by this wonderful, upbeat author. It was disappointing, but things happen. Then, like magic, Leigh reappeared with all sorts of new adventures, a fabulous family and every story better than the last, which really doesn't happen very often in a series.I believe that the Koslow series is kept fresh and entertaining because the author writes play and other books in between. She has some wonderful YA books out there, for instance. Take a look at her book Wraith. I am far from fitting into the YA category, but I enjoyed that book all the same. I think you will enjoy it, too!Every single book is filled with twists and turns and mysteries and surprises. Every single book lacks grim gory bits, and has never needed them. This is refreshing and necessary, today. The market is filled with plenty of grisly, gory, stabby books. Far more than we need. Rest assured that entertainment is what you get with Edie Claire.

"So here it is, summertime. I enjoy hot cocoa, but it is rare that I brew some up during the summer. I was offered the opportunity to reviews these from Amazon Vine, and couldn't pass it up.

I took :Midnight Dark ChocolateCharlestown ChewSugar BabiesJunior Mint ( Which I chose and enjoyed)Mexican Spice which I tasted and it is really good.Tootsie Roll andCharlestown Chew Vanilla.We brewed them up, and had a sort of taste test, pass around and see who likes what session.My nieces husband put his Mexican Spice over ice....interesting! And for the littles, we made sure it was cooled down before we gave it to them.They chose Tootsie Roll, which I knew they would, so I took 2.General consensus was that it was weird to drink hot chocolate in the summer. This may be true for the most part, but there are those damp nights or the I crave chocolate moments where I see these coming in very handy. Besides, we drink hot coffee and tea in summer, so why not chocolate?

"The Whisper (The Riverman Trilogy) by Aaron Starmer, is book two of The Riverman Trilogy. This is a series meant for juvenile readers, which I am assuredly not, but I was led to this series by a mighty villain who lures other into reading books she enjoys. Most of the time I'm helpless to resist. In this case, I have no complaints.The Whisper picks off where The Riverman left off. The same main characters populate the book, and there are some interesting and imaginative additions. The story is fast paced as Alistair journeys from here to there and back again, and magical creatures and non creatures abound. It's pretty tricky reviewing a series, so as not to indicate something that others will interpret as a spoiler.So, I will simply say that there will be quite a few surprises, a few things here and there that you have already suspected will turn out to be the case. And dreams really do come true... or not. There is a bit of time travel involved again, as the journeyers of Aquavania can return to the solid world at the very moment that they left. Will this make a difference? Can it change lives?  Well, I'm certainly not going to tell you.This will, in my opinion hold the interest of young readers, boys and girls will enjoy it equally in  my opinion. I also think it is a light and enjoyable read for adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXPZTBOXGBUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374363110#wasThisHelpful","R3TXPZTBOXGBUU","A13H5US9Z7L9M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H5US9Z7L9M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ortho 0475010 MAX Poison Ivy & Tough Brush Killer Ready-To-Use, 24-Ounce worked well for me. We have had a lot of rain lately, and so I had to wait to pray a stubborn patch of poison ivy that I have been at war with for years. No matter how careful I've been, I have been stricken with those fiery patches on my arms, and sometimes my neck after doing any work in the back forty of our property. Two days ago I sprayed the area early in the day. I considered waiting for a few dry days in a row, but since the poison ivy plants were just getting bigger by the day, I went for it. I did rain later in the day, so I wasn't sure it would be effective. Two mornings later, the area sprayed was visible even from my back porch. A trip back to the area showed me that my biggest concern, my honeysuckle, was still thriving. I don't like using these products, but after years of losing the fight, I wanted the offending plant gone. I have a small area left to do. This is all confined to two very large, concrete,  raised beds behind my garage. Those things have been useless to me since I moved into theis house over 25 years ago. Hopefully another application of the Ortho will finish it off for good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCI5CLI16JHGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSMWEO#wasThisHelpful","RCI5CLI16JHGZ","A13H5US9Z7L9M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13H5US9Z7L9M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My son pulled it off the charger as soon as it was ready and uploaded his favorite songs off the computer. What is cool is that this is not just for music. You can add voice, video, and photos as well. My son uploaded some of his favorite pictures of his siblings and pets on it. It also has a game installed that is pretty basic, but fun for kids. The MP4 player also came with earbuds and a charger. This is very easy to use and child friendly.

I pull it out when I start overheating and place it on the back of my neck for 15 to 20 minutes then replace it back to the cooler. The difference is amazing. No more headaches which means I can workout longer! Im 50 lbs down 90 more to go and with the help of this towel and some diet and exercise, I will get there.

"""Another hurdle is the fact that most American kids, or adults for that matter, aren't familiar with the Garibaldi biscuit. Originally published in the UK, this title may suffer from a cultural divide of cuisine.""--T. JonkerGaribaldi's biscuits are wafers cooked with currants, sometimes containing raisins in them. This funny children's book recounts the story of how Garibaldi's biscuits were cooked, and the whereabouts of their invention. Using insane surreal fiction and existential chaotic drawings, the author and artist will leave the reader both perplexed and entertained, which is pretty wild for a kid's book.After years fighting battles in South America with an army of Italian exiled soldiers, General Garibaldi returned to Italy. There Giuseppe and his men fought back the invading French Bourbons army, for a while. The Bourbons have kidnapped Garibaldi's grandparents to cook them biscuits. Undiminished in courage or valor, Italy's hero and his fighters wage water balloon war on the Bourbons.Garibaldi's soldiers use pizzas for belt buckles, holding up their pantaloons and eat them when they're hungry. Pet woodpeckers wearing overalls, and waging war with water balloons, will all mingle to create a tale that is hilarious for imaginative kids, and amusingly odd for their parents. Garibaldi is victorious, but his kind grandmother volunteered to bake the defeated army something to eat, thence the famous biscuits are born.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3J09K9E3Z4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761455787#wasThisHelpful","R3A3J09K9E3Z4E","AMRZ5G7HF7I03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRZ5G7HF7I03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since twins Molly and Penelope were born, the Quirks were forced to move over two dozen times, to avoid being exposed. Within nearly a decade, their attempts to settle down in quiet normal neighborhoods are jeopardized. The family inclination to abuse their own 'special powers' may have contributed to their problems, rather than being the villains they seem. At school, Molly, Penelope, and Finn are now learning circus skills in gym class.Finn, a five-years-old naughty boy, takes advantage of his latent invisibility to play annoying tricks, stealing from Mrs. DeVille, while low concentration mother Bree, keeps her job as a waitress by influencing customers' minds, to her benefit. It takes detective work to keep their nosy neighbor from snooping around Luckily, and uncovering the Quirk family secrets.

The third grader is a young avid book reader, who has a passion for funny stories with real twists. Though Soderberg plays the Quirks' dilemma as a comic situation, young readers are less likely to smile than be embarrassed at the Quirks' behavior.

The Bodlean library may provoke the curious young readers to pose a question to their teacher. The novel keeps an  entertaining pace, and poses hints on literary celebrities, to invite cultural dialogue.

"****1/2I found this science enhancing book, for kids at early age, a good match for my six years old curious grandson. The book has an introduction to explains how fossils are formed, and how valuable they are for learning about prehistoric life on our planet earth. A fossil is an article  either from a plant or an animal, that has been preserved by nature for a long time. It may be a petrified shell fish, or a woolly mammoth, frozen for thousands of years in the icy ground. Sometimes it's the skeleton of a dinosaur that has turned hard like stone.The book uses full-color pictures to tell the story of a boy, who while taking a walk along the shore of a lake, with his cocker spaniel, finds three different fossils. Going for a hike, the boy trips on a fossil, that comes to life, revealing its origin as an ancient complex leave plant. The boy splits open two other fossils which also come to life, a dragonfly, and a pterosaurs.  When the boy releases a huge, scaly pterodactyl, it carries his dog away, that he must find out how to send the beast back to its petrified state.Artistically told without a word, this visual story will surely inspire first grader Oliver and instruct him creativity.  Thomson’s dramatic, extraordinary illustrations, are vivid art on every page, enlivened further by exploratory geometry, and active shots of the boy’s shocked face. The mix of Fossil with the flight of fancy is thrilling as a kid breaks open fossils and sees live versions of the fossils appear.  But this book will tell Oliver, a young artist in his own right,  how can you make a fossil, too;  the imprint of an ancient leaf in a rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291O2CLYMIXSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477847006#wasThisHelpful","R291O2CLYMIXSN","AMRZ5G7HF7I03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRZ5G7HF7I03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Siena is able to form friendships and as she continues her investigations.. Her new ability for interacting, has eventually provided her with the insight to help her brother unlock his will to speak.Although Siena's strong inclination for imagination strides has inflluenced her illusive mood, the plot is more leisurely in the first half of the novel, that active readers may detatch. Supernatural themes blend naturally with a drift for reality, thus appealing to critical young readers who enjoy paranormal events to be justified. The milieu of Siena’s world is perceptible, with the developing mysterious and engaging narrative. I hope Noah, my 9 years old grandson, will be engaged enough while the novel acquires its inertia  in order to enjoy the happy conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7EINO8MWF0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385742991#wasThisHelpful","R1L7EINO8MWF0I","AMRZ5G7HF7I03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRZ5G7HF7I03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"****1/2""The most significant book of our time, in the field of Christology."" --Rudolph Bultmann*Many people today don't realize that Jesus claimed to be Devine. They're content to think of Him as little more than a great moral teacher. But even His enemies understood His claims to deity. That's why they tried to stone Him to death (John 5:18; 10:33) and eventually had Him crucified (John 19:7). C. S. Lewis reflected, ""You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to"" -- Mere ChristianityDonald (John) Baillie completed the new edition of his book, ""God was in Christ,"" with editing and appendices, just before he passed away in 1954. He anticipated and pioneered the task of liberating biblical terminology and reforming theological expression, that culminated in post WW-II best seller, ""Honest to God, 1963"" by the Bishop of Woolwich. Baillie was praised half a century ago, to have written his brilliant essay on Incarnation and Atonement; 'as an adequate and up-to-date form of orthodox Christianity, since the ecumenical movement started enhancing the clarification of some theological topics in biblical exegesis.'For a novice student of theology, John Baillie has offered a sharpening tool, in his essay, to examine the question which Jesus posed to his lay disciples, of fishermen, that echoes at every Christian encounter with Christ, ""What do you think I am?"" Prof. Horton discussed the book in a lengthy exposition in his book, ""Christ the savior,"" expressing an important issues of using intelligible friendly language. Same was emphasized by Nottingham's G. H. Bebawi, professor of systematic theology, and eminent patrologist that, ""The great patristic thought of the church fathers, needs to be expressed in today modern vermicular language.""In 'Christ in Gospel and creed', biblical theologian James Barr has made a parallel observation, that orthodox Christianity possessed an insight which has been lost from sight in much modern biblical studies; the insight that the interpretation of Christ must state that He was not only what He did, that must not only be soteriological but also antological."" Baillie attempted thus to affirm a biblical doctrine of the Person of Christ that adheres to the Pauline teaching; ""that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."" --I Cor 5:19","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZBLLTRESA9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684164701#wasThisHelpful","R3PZBLLTRESA9G","AMRZ5G7HF7I03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRZ5G7HF7I03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The talented illustrator has done a superb job to engage the kids visually.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9F9RSHWBN49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761457291#wasThisHelpful","R2V9F9RSHWBN49","AMRZ5G7HF7I03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRZ5G7HF7I03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Olwen Mellory, who writes children's books, is invited to an intensive retreat at Dunesfort House in the Outer Hebrides (Scotland). It turns out to be far more challenging than she imagined, and she has grave doubts about staying. Powerful techniques are invoked such as prolonged hyperventilation and walking on hot coals, and intense exploration of dreams and fantasies. Difficult enough but then a catastrophic event changes everything and it seems doubtful the program can even continue. Will Olwen be able to stay till the end, or, would she be wise to run away as fast as she can? What will she learn about her inner self? And what is the secret story of the inscrutable and menacing Director, a man known only as Rose? You will have to read the book to find out.The book is hard to classify. Novel or memoir? Or fictionalized memoir loosely based on real life experiences? Beautifully written, in lyrical, colorful prose, the book is not easy reading. There is so much intense instrospection, so much free-floating emotion, so much inner pain to be worked through, that this reader found it necessary to take frequent breaks from the text. Not to mention the author's describing every bite of food Olwen ate and every garment she  wore during the week. I kept imagining what kind of enormous steamer trunk she would have needed to carry all those clothes.  The book is sprinkled with expressions in Scots Gaelic whose pronunciation and meaning are not well explained.If you like to read about  inner Work, the exploration of the Unconscious, soul healing, and profound psychic transformation you will love this book.

"Buck Hawthorne is a private investigator in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Business is pretty slow till the latest group of clients arrives one rainy day--and a strange group of characters it is. A centaur out of Greek mythology heads up the group--an attractive young woman with the body of a horse and four agile hooves. And others equally strange.  It seems these clients are visitors from another world, a magical world coterminous with our own, but operating by different rules. What they have to say is even more shocking than their fairytale world appearance. The case they want help with involves family secrets, a terrible crime, and a breakdown of social order in the magical other world. Will Buck get involved? Should he? Should he follow these oddly assorted visitors into their world? And if he does, can he ever return home? Will he succeed in the heroic mission that is offered to him, or will he be eaten by the dragon? Well, ha ha, I won't tell you, you'll just have to read the book for yourself.

"Bjorn had high hopes for his new job at The Authority (a  bureaucratic enterprise of uncertain function), but the early signs were not auspicious. Bjorn found his co-workers irritating at best, undisciplined, poorly dressed. He in turn came across as pompous and controlling. Things took a downward turn when the fellow workers noticed him standing, trancelike, in the corridor leading to the toilets. He maintained he was visiting a room there, a room that no one else could see, a room where he felt re-energized, creative, better able to think.Was Bjorn mentally ill or prophetic? Was he seeing things that didn't exist, or things that others could not yet see? In any case, an administrator's nightmare. Karl, the boss, tried various strategies to keep Bjorn functioning and the office staff from outright rebellion, but nothing seemed to work for long. Would he have to fire Bjorn? Or would he find that this odd-ball employee was on to something important? What would you have done?Author Jonas Karlsson writes simple, unadorned prose that is easy to read and very engaging.

"The Nasmertov family of Odessa, Ukraine, now live in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, except for Uncle Pasha, the eccentric poet, who still lives in Odessa, but flirts with the idea of relocating to America. The family lives in a state of low-grade chaos in both countries, eternally ruminating about this and that but unable to make decisions. That is the plot, as far as I can tell. Reading this book was like taking a prolonged vacation with this family, as though one had mysteriously found oneself living with them, trying to figure out who they were and how they were related. It wasn't easy.The story, such as it is, takes place in different time frames and different countries. Some of the characters became differentiated from the perpetual confusion--like Frida, the surly daughter and reluctant medical student. Or Pasha who enjoys a certain level of literary fame, but is almost unable to function in practical matters. Some of the characters become a bit more likeable, at least familiar, as the story progresses, but the reader will have little desire to know them any better.Author Yelena Akhtiorskaya writes in a rambling, disjointed style, with long, confusing sentences, odd turns of phrase, and unusual metaphors. At times she shows flashes of wit, vivid depictions of family interactions, striking descriptions of nondescript, oddly dressed characters, poignant moments of failed communication. If you like that sort of writing you might enjoy Panic In A Suitcase. For this reviewer, the book was almost unreadable. I did manage to finish it with some effort. I'd give it a weak recommendation.

"In 1987 Gary Hart, good-looking, brilliant, and a visionary political thinker, seemed likely to capture the Democratic nomination for the presidency, and quite possibly the presidency. Then in little over a week his candidacy imploded and his career was reduced to a one-liner. People still remember Hart, not for his political skills or his visionary ideas, but for an ill-fated excursion with a gorgeous young woman on a boat called Monkey Business. What really happened on that boat? What was Hart thinking? And why was his fall so catastrophic and permanent?Author Matt Bai takes us through the episode, the times, the characters, and the changing political landscape to try to understand what happened. He doesn't actually reveal anything new about the incident. The players, those who are still alive, are sticking to their stories. More importantly he discusses what has changed in the political process as it merges with entertainment: inaccessible candidates who try to say as little as possible, while the press hounds them for missteps, gaffes, or personal failings (everyone has some), under he rubric of ""character."" Does this lead to better candidates and better office-holders? Probably not. The book is a fascinating account of this societal transition to what he calls tabloid politics.Matt Bai writes a gripping account of the Hart meltdown and the changes that have followed. He has access to many of the key players and documents, and what he writes is both believable and profoundly disturbing. He writes in a clear, direct style which is easy to read.

"Jason Padgett was, by his own account, a shallow, pleasure-seeking goof-ball, until the night he was viciously beaten after stumbling out of a karaoke bar. He suffered severe traumatic brain injury from which he has never fully recovered. His symptoms have been mainly psychiatric, including PTSD, OCD, and spells of depression. He also developed a remarkable new interest in mathematics, geometry, the significance of pi, and fractals. He began to see mathematical concepts in visual forms, and expressed his discoveries in detailed drawings. There was nothing in his previous background or training to explain these interests and abilities.This book is a detailed memoir of Jason's journey through hell and back and into his new life as a mathematical savant who also experiences synesthesia (the blending of sensory modalities). These abilities are uncommon, and to acquire them in adult life is extremely rare indeed. Jason's experience raises difficult questions about the brain and its workings, and about consciousness itself, and Jason meets many fascinating people as he seeks answers to these riddles. He takes the reader on an amazing journey of discovery--still unfinished as of the writing of the book.Author Jason Padgett and co-author Maureen Seaberg have written an interesting and moving memoir about experiences that most of us can barely understand.

For Michael it is the start of a painful maturation process. That's all I can say about the plot without spoiling it. You'll have to read this one yourself.Author Lisa O'Donnell writes a poignant, lucid account of a family trauma as experienced by a terribly innocent young kid. When I first began the book I thought it was going to be an Adrian Mole type of book, the foibles of the adult world through the cute perceptions of a child; it soon became apparent that this is a much darker and more serious work, even if it has to be told piecemeal, through the glimpses of a child, in a family that is desperately trying to hide the truth. The writing is delightfully simple, clear, even with a bit of local dialect and a few unfamiliar slang expressions. The story carries you along. You really want this family to find some healing, and you want Michael to regain his footing.The novel is not perfect, repetitious at times, and a bit too cute at times. Still, it's powerful, poignant, and engaging. I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

"This novel starts off with a bang. Carolina Slade is thrust into an assignment which goes way beyond her usual bureaucratic duties at the Department of Agriculture, an assignment which involves illegal drugs, the governor's family, the VA hospital, and some really nasty people. This assignment is off-the record, and when Slade runs into unexpected, life-threatening complications, she finds that no one has her back. Meanwhile she is trying to raise two challenging teenagers, settle into her new home, and work things out with her love-interest, Wayne Largo. Enough about the plot--it's complicated with many levels. You'll just have to read the book.Author C. Hope Clark writes an offbeat thriller with fascinating characters. The pages crackle with energy, the heroine ever struggling to balance her job, her family, and her emotions. She doesn't like being told what to do, and repeatedly gets herself in hot water by challenging authority. She makes mistakes, any one of which could be fatal. Will Slade get out of this alive? Will she find the real bad guys before it's too late? Will Wayne make a commitment to her, or go back to his ex? Wait and see!This is the third book in the Carolina Slade series and in my opinion the best. Author Clark is maturing as an author, her writing becoming more complex, deeper and richer. Her characters are more lifelike, her plots more intriguing. You would never figure out where this one was going without knowing in advance, but in the end it all makes sense. Looking for an unusual thriller with a South Carolina setting and a marvelous cast of characters, this is one novel you need to get hold of. I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

"John Lago is an assassin for hire, working for a man named Bob. His job is to infiltrate large organizations as a lowly unpaid intern, develop trust in this almost invisible role, and kill some high-level executive. As he gets started on his last case, before mandatory ""retirement"" at age 25, he leaves a memoir and pointers for the ""interns"" who will come after him. He's very, very good at what he does, but in this case he makes some major mistakes. For one thing he develops some human emotions, a bad thing in this line of work.Of course, John is a classic psychopath without a trace of normal feeling or  empathy, but all this is about to change as his path crosses that of Alice, the very hot and very savvy lawyer who works with him. And then there is Marcus, the biological father he manages to track down and actually form a relationship with. He starts to make mistakes, and things begin careening out of control. Will John be able to pull off one last assassination? Will he be able to retire? Will he even survive? I won't tell you, of course, so you'll have to read this novel for yourself.

"Jon Grady is a brilliant scientist who has come up with a way to manipulate gravity. Unfortunately you won't get to see his discoveries applied, or his accomplishment recognized. He's been suppressed, worse than that, imprisoned and tortured by a shadowy government agency. The Bureau of Technology Control was supposed to maintain social stability by controlling the influx of new technologies so they wouldn't be too disruptive. Over the years it has grown ever more secretive and powerful, so that the legitimate U.S. government has completely lost control of it. Now it is holding some of the world's most brilliant minds in a prison with no possible escape and is systematically deconstructing their brains for its own evil purposes.Well, that's the basic story, and it raises many fascinating questions. Will Grady survive? Will he escape? Will anyone ever escape from the ultra-high tech prison called Hibernity? Will Jon Grady ever again live a normal life? Will he find love?

The writing is not polished, repetitive, filled with cliches. The first half of the book is mostly narrative, setting out the premises of the story and its fictional world. Huge amounts of scientific-sounding jargon are thrown at the reader, but the actual underlying science is never clearly explained. There's a lot of playing with gravity--falling up, falling down, falling sideways--and with brain science, but again, the author doesn't give the impression of understanding this science well enough to explain it. A lot of stock science-fiction characters fill the pages with stilted, improbable dialog. On the other hand, it moves fast once you get past the half-way point, and you will keep reading just to see how the author will pull it off.If you love sci-fi thrillers with brilliant scientists and evil government bureaucrats, you should probably read this one, but I don't recommend it highly.

"In this thinly veiled autobiography (or is it fictionalized memoir?) Sara Barron recounts a life of awkwardness, embarrassment, humiliation, social mistakes, and family baggage. Stuff you wouldn't even tell your therapist. Stuff about body parts, bodily fluids, and bodily gases. About some of the creepiest room-mates you ever heard of, and that doesn't count her imaginary dog. I kept waiting for the author to say, ""I'm not making this stuff up."" I'm pretty sure she made some of it up, at least I hope so. Eventually, in spite of everything, she grew up and became an author.And what an author! Sara Barron is a genius with words, uses  language to brilliant effect, creates scenes, events and characters that are impossibly believable. She is great with dialog, even when the characters are giving each other the silent treatment. She is able to talk about some of the most embarrassing and humiliating events (thoughts, inner monologs, fantasies) without quite crossing over the line into filth. She is incredibly funny.Should you read this book? That depends. If you're squeamish about body parts and graphic language, probably not. Seriously.

But that meant uprooting himself to the suburbs, trying to fit in to a new family, and most of all, learning to get along with his nemesis, a fluffy white rooster named Buddy.Author Brian McGrory has written a charming, if slightly fluffy, memoir about this period of his life, and how he transitioned from a self-absorbed, Seinfeldian thirty-something, to a real family man, thanks in large part to the relentless badgering of the rooster.

"Agnes Gilbert is a fiftyish woman living marginally as a hypnotist's office assistant and taking care of her elderly, perennially kvetching mother, when she has the first of her visitations from an entity called Elias, the archangel. She is not the type of person to seek or expect such an experience. She is of no religious persuasion, with vague spiritual leanings, carrying on a torrid but loveless affair with her apartment manager, the maniacal street-evangelist, Lucas Beeler. Elias the archangel tells Agnes to simplify, divest, detach herself from worldly things, and promises to visit her again on the last Sunday of each month. As people learn about Agnes' visitations, crowds begin to gather for these monthly seances, a motley crowd of seekers in search of wisdom, enlightenment, healings, miracles, whatever.But Elias is a testy archangel, easily offended, who makes it clear that he does not provide ""services,"" and is not to be asked for angelic healings or other such favors. The townspeople are not happy at the crowds gathering in their quiet neighborhood. The invalid mother is not pleased at sharing Agnes' attention with the angelic visitor. Things begin going downhill in many different ways.

"On the night of March 8, 1971, the regional FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, was burglarized by an unlikely group of citizen-activists, and all its files were stolen. Later, as copies of the files were sent in successive mailings to the news media, an amazing new picture of the FBI began to emerge--an agency spending most of its energies on investigating and suppressing dissent. The revelations shocked the American public and caused massive upheaval in the FBI. Amazingly, the eight burglars were never caught.The book is an in-depth account of the burglary, the times, the social unrest and dissension around the Viet Nam war, the antiwar movement, the conceptualization of the burglary as a way to re-invigorate that movement, the recruiting of the burglars, the stories of the burglars themselves, the planning and execution of the burglary, and the revelations that developed of an FBI out of control and obsessed with spying on American citizens. In the book's final section the author studies the aftermath of the burglary, the changes that were made (and sometimes not made) to the FBI, and the continuing American tension between freedom and security.Author Betty Medsger writes a gripping stranger-than-fiction account of this bizarre episode and its meaning for America. This is a page-turner, written in novelistic style, but packed with facts and profound analysis. At 536 pages, plus bibliography and notes, this is not light reading. For old codgers like this reviewer the Viet Nam era is still vivid in memory. I remember those times and the profound divisions that developed in our country, but I was not aware of the Media burglary. Therefore the book was profoundly enlightening. It was also disturbing, because it reflects something more amiss than the personal obsessions of J. Edgar Hoover. It describes a recurring mind-set in America, celebrating freedom of speech in the abstract while trying to suppress and/or punish those who express unpopular views. The author doesn't preach, but she forces the reader to think deeply about the issues raised. The story is not over.The Burglary is great reading, but it's also an important book, a book that needs to be read. I cannot recommend it too highly.

"Anyone doing counseling or therapy in a Christian context would do well to peruse this remarkable work. In an evolving field rife with controversy, the author presents a calm, reasoned, and inclusive overview of Christian therapeutics. While the basic orientation is to cognitive therapy, psychodynamic principles are not slighted. Subjects such as praying with (or for) the client, the use of Scripture, confession, forgiveness and redemption are all explored. Needless to say, it's not light reading, but it is accessible and understandable. The author presents different theories and points of view, treats all of them with respect, and offers a way for clinicians to think through and reason about clinical dilemmas.Author Mark McMinn uses a delightful method of presenting brief clinical vignettes, with different possible approaches, different therapists, and different assumptions, and invites the reader to reason through each situation. There are, of course, no simple answers, but there are pitfalls to be avoided and lessons to be learned. The writing style is clear and lucid, with a gentle touch of humor. Ethical issues are discussed in depth. Beyond the techniques and  vignettes, Author McMinn explores the foundations of Christian counseling, the underlying theology that must support any therapeutic efforts. The approach is not a bag of tricks. The vital ingredient must be the spiritual growth of the counselor/therapist.This reviewer, now retired, would love to have had McMinn's book in hand when he was treating patients.

"America's first president has become an almost mythic figure, but to the author of this powerful biography, he was first and foremost a military man. In this densely written, scholarly book, Stephen Brumwell presents an intriguing portrait of the man who would come to be called, the father of his country. Not a complete biography, the work concentrates on Washington's military career, from the French and Indian wars to the American revolution, and a little beyond. Washington began his career as a hot-headed, overly aggressive young officer who had much to learn about leadership, but who gradually evolved into the wise and charismatic leader of revolutionary times. It was quite fascinating to this reader to follow the gradual transformation. No, Washington was not perfect, made some strategic blunders and suffered losses, but he learned from them. With an army of volunteers, happy coincidences, and his French allies,  he managed to humble the British empire of his day. He soldiered in a difficult political environment, with troops constantly on the verge of defection. Victory hung by a thread.This is an ambitious book, mostly readable, but, with long sentences and numerous names to remember, sometimes it's slow going. It fleshes out the sketchy picture of Washington acquired in grade school with a fascinating adult portrait of the man. It is not meant to be the complete story of his life, and should be supplemented by further reading. Author Brumwell develops a fascinating picture of the times, the culture, and the attitudes of Washington's America.

"When a computer can beat Kasparov at chess, is the human mind doomed to obsolescence? Maybe not, but, what if a computer could win game after game of Jeopardy? Where will it all end? Are we getting smarter in the new technological age? Or dumber? Will we end up exchanging cute pictures of cats as our last remaining intellectual activity? Author Clive Thompson tackles these questions and many more in this delightful, stimulating and thought-provoking book. The new technological devices are tools and they can extend the reach of our brains. Like every technological advance, from the invention of writing, to the printing press, the telephone, television, computers, and the internet, they can be used for good or ill. And like all these earlier advances, we tend to fear them, at least initially.The author doesn't endorse a doomsday scenario for the human mind, but sees a bright future for using the new tools. Computers can do things humans cannot, and vice versa. Exciting possibilities are beginning to emerge, applying the new technologies to such fields as medicine, politics, governance, and education. Yes, we may waste time on Facebook, but we may also develop a remarkable background awareness of the people in our lives. And no, teachers will not be replaced, but they will have more time to work with the students who need help, while other students are blasting ahead at their own pace. Governments are beginning to listen to the governed, at least on occasion, even in the most tightly repressive countries, as knowledge itself becomes more democratic than ever before.Author Thompson writes a scholarly but completely accessible book, sparkling with good humor and optimism.

"This remarkable history links the great Benjamin Franklin to his little-known younger sister, Jane Franklin Mecom, and in doing so explores the meaning and scope of history itself. The brother and sister, one of whom is justly celebrated for statecraft, diplomacy, and science; the other who toiled in obscurity raising (and mostly losing) children, grand-children and great-grand-children, maintained a remarkable camaraderie  throughout their lives. Drawing on the few surviving letters of Jane (and the many of Benjamin), the author attempts to reconstruct the life of this spirited and intelligent woman who has been so overshadowed by her brother.The book is not exactly a biography of Jane Mecom; in fact it's hard to classify. It is also a history of the colonial era in America, the American revolution, the culture and way of life in those times, the hardships experienced by most people, the few opportunities for women to express themselves, their limited education, the poor state of medicine in those days, the outrageous infant mortality, and the sad fate of the mentally ill. And, the author says, that's what history is really about--people who were more celebrated in fiction than in what was thought of as history. All that, rather than the names, dates, battles, and accomplishments of a few giants.Author Jill Lepore has written a work of vast scholarship, drawing on a range of sources, that is also interesting, entertaining, and endearing. The characters come vividly to life, with all their struggles and suffering; and the emerging nation, the United States, as well. In fact author Lepore has created an amazing work from the scant historical traces of her subject, Jane. If you are at all interested in the founding generation of Americans, their lives and their times,  you will love this book.

"The book begins with Mom, Glen Finland, trying to teach her son to navigate the Washington, DC subway system. Endless hours of practice, following different routes, buying the tickets, trying not to get lost or distracted. This is important because her son, David, is autistic (with a variety of other impairments as well). He doesn't follow social cues well, he doesn't do abstract thinking well, he is outgrowing childhood, and he has no prospects for employment. Even when David gets it right, Mom has trouble letting him go. David is straining at independence and Mom suffers every step of the way.This is a powerful memoir about a young man with autism, about parenting, about the lack of social support for children who are different, about the limited help available from the army of doctors, counselors, and all of what David calls ""professional strangers."" If the book reveals a lot about David and his struggles (as inferred, because he doesn't talk about them and doesn't like to be asked questions), it probably says even more about Mom, author Glen Finland, and her struggles with parenting. She writes extremely well, drawing her readers into the pain, the frustration, and the occasional moments of triumph, how she survived, and how her marriage helped her survive. This is not a feel-good book with a happy ending, because David will never be ""cured.""

In the course of the book he shares from his vast wealth of clinical experience, reading and study, information about animals and their behaviors we might never have known.Unfortunately the book is not easy reading. Author Virga writes in long, complicated sentences, and digresses too often into well-worn paths of Buddhist philosophy. Many of the parables he quotes are too well-known and told at too great length. This reviewer would have liked to hear more about the animals themselves, and less of Dr. Virga's speculations about their possible feelings and motivations. Still, there's a lot of value in this book and I'm glad I read it. I recommend it, but if you're looking for short colorful anecdotes about cute animals, you may be disappointed. Reviewed by Louis N.

"The aspiring writer of today confronts a rapidly changing landscape, where authors have to do most of their own promotion. Within the last few years the would-be author has started hearing about this mystical thing called ""platform."" It means something like one's built-in audience, or fan base, or followers. Those who will buy the book without much encouragement from the publisher. This short book goes a long way toward explaining exactly what platform is and how one goes about building one. Good thing because having one is almost mandatory now if you want to get published.This compact 244 page book falls into three sections: principles of platform, mechanics of platform, and interviews with authors who have used the principles effectively. It's hard work and takes an investment of time and commitment, a willingness to give without immediate reward, and openness to constant change. Platform building starts early, long before the book is published or even finished. When the book comes out, the platform, the followers, the potential buyers, must already be in place.Author Chuck Sambuchino knows his stuff and speaks from a rich vein of experience. The writing is a bit dry, the material is almost overwhelming. My favorite part of the book was the author interviews, with each of twelve successful authors speaking of their own journey and how they utilized the principles of platform effectively. Their accounts were believable, and they made it clear that no single method works for every author. I enjoyed this book and it sparked a lot of ideas for my own writing career. I wish the author had offered more of the nuts and bolts of social media and how to use them, but this is more of a big-picture kind of work. If you are a beginning or aspiring author Create Your Writer Platform is a book you need to read, and I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

"Kevin is struggling to hold on to his dead-end job at the meat packing plant, trying to support his widowed mother and get through school, but then things get worse. Seems that Kevin's life has pursued a downhill course since he was ten years old, when gangsters murdered his father and little sister. He is about to lose this job, too, but the kindly intervention of Mr. Balducci, an old family friend, keeps him employed, although constantly humiliated and degraded. He's a plucky and resourceful kid, though, and a surprisingly good boxer, and begins clawing his way back up the social ladder. Then he learns that Mr. Balducci, the old family friend, is actually running a powerful crime syndicate and the meat-packing  company as well. Things get ever darker and more complex, and Kevin learns that Mr. Balducci was the brains behind his father's murder. After that it's war--Kevin sets himself the unlikely goal of taking down Balducci and his organization.Well, how does a loser who can barely hold on to a job fight a powerful crime boss? Can he do it? And can he win back the only girl he ever loved, the mythical goddess, C.W.? Does he succeed? Does he survive? Does he get the girl? Will he make it through school? Will he go to prison? And who is really the genius behind this world of crime? Naturally I won't tell you, so you'll have to read this book yourself.Author Ben Lieberman writes in a hectic, breathless style, which will keep you frantically turning pages. If the book starts out with a somewhat believable premise, it soon takes a turn into sheer escapist fantasy. It couldn't happen this way, but somehow author Lieberman keeps his readers engaged, and half-believing. The characters do the impossible, the illegal, the unforgivable, and the felonious, but still keep fighting, joking around, talking trash, getting wounded or killed, and drinking themselves silly. So, that's the kind of book it is, and, if you like that kind of reading you will love ""Odd Jobs."" It ain't great literature, but it's great fun to read. I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

"The Adonit Jot line is probably the best line of Styli for touchscreen devices that aren't Wacom-powered or comparable.The difference is that devices like the Wacom line or, say, the Surface line are specifically designed to replicate a pen-and-paper experience, whereas an iPad or Android device is designed with human fingers in mind, and is thus not responsive enough to register input from something as small as a pen tip. Such responsiveness would require those devices to be bigger and more expensive.The Jot concept is the most effective workaround to at least get the experience CLOSER to pen-and-paper. The concept works for two reasons:- because the disc is attached to the stylus via a joint, it is less sensitive to small movements- because the disc is transparent, the user has the subtle experience of writing on the device with a pen tip, which influences user perception, such that he/she intuitively 'feels' like he/she is writing with a penIt works viscerally and is quite effective, and the size of the Jot Mini is ideal; it's less unwieldy than most styli,  but it still feels like a pen in use.These cost a bit more than other styli, but their increased effectiveness justifies this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDIZYTYDQAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","R2UDIZYTYDQAR","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not one to get particularly excited by something like a new vacuum cleaner, but as a tech junkie, I AM inclined to be excited by new tech of any kind, so the Air Cordless Lift has held my fervor far longer than a vacuum cleaner probably should. Its design is fantastic, its ease-of-use is off the charts, its features are top-shelf, and most importantly, it does its job well.Unboxing and setup are a snap and usage/maintenance instructions are covered entirely in about three short manual pages; it's designed so intuitively and simply that all you need to do is charge up the battery and start vacuuming.It has a slim, minimal profile and only weighs about 12 pounds, and along with functional accents like the swiveling head, the design makes vacuuming nearly effortless. Even better, the canister assembly detaches for hand-held spot-work and increased portability and accessibility (it comes with a few attachments for corners and upholstery with other specialized attachments available separately), and the slim/light profile maximizes this functionality. Other design accents, like a floodlight on the base of the canister that illuminates the area being cleaned (and that serves as a sort of spotlight in handheld mode), are well-implemented and reinforce the sense that effective simplicity was the watchword at every juncture of design.Maintenance is equally simple and intuitive: emptying the canister takes a few seconds, and the only other upkeep required is the occasional cleaning of a small filter, which is done in a few seconds under a tap.Most importantly, it cleans quickly and effectively on carpets, upholstery, and hard floors, and the profile makes it easy to address all three applications with their assorted trappings (corners, crevices, etc.). Features like the extension arm and the spin-brush toggle (for work on finished/delicate hard floors) make this a true all-in-one vacuuming solution.The whole package comes together really well, and it illustrates how much a well-designed implement can elevate a chore like vacuuming from a big hassle to a minor task. Having the right tools makes all the difference.Supremely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O72JA62K3Q8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","R1O72JA62K3Q8F","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned several nosehair trimmers, all of which conform to the 'standard' cylindrical trimmer design. One was cheap and broke, one worked okay until the blade dulled (it wasn't replaceable), and one works pretty well, but it takes a few minutes to operate and clean and I don't like the associated hair 'pulling.'The NT3355/60 is a welcome change. The design is brilliant- effective but faster, and without the 'pulling'. It's also easier to maintain and clean. The eyebrow brushes make it effective for precision brow-trimming, too, which isn't/wasn't possible with my other trimmers.My only concern is that I'll have to replace the entire blade assembly whenever it loses sharpness/effectiveness, but this will be a small price to pay for the ease, speed, and comfort I enjoy every time I use it.

"This is a great option for a box-less platform frame because it's very reasonably priced considering its sturdiness. It's also lightweight and mobile without compromising that sturdiness.Assembly was pretty straightforward. My only issue was with the four outer plastic corners, which buttress the outer frame during assembly; they need to be placed just right in order for everything to align properly, and getting them to do this was a bit tricky. Also, I found the included tools (a non-adjustable wrench and an allen wrench) less effective than my own.Once assembled, though, the bedframe is great- sturdy yet easy to move, as I said.

"The Aether Cone is a difficult product for me to review. As a music junkie and a pseudo-audiophile, I'm very particular about how I listen to my music, in terms of playback, organization, and accessibility, and the cone is very different from what I'm used to.I feel it's best to evaluate it through two criteria:- how well it does what Aether claims it does- how well it stacks up to more standard music access/playback optionsAether calls Cone a 'thinking music player' that plays whatever you tell it to and gradually learns to 'know' what kinds of music to play based on your listening patterns. Because it's intended to function as an 'A.I. DJ companion' (my phrasing), it's not necessary to do anything other than tell it what to play and use three simple controls (a 'listen' button, which stops whatever's playing and prompts Cone to listen for your next request, a 'short turn' of the front of the device, which skips to the next song, and a 'long turn', which tells Cone to randomly choose something altogether different from what was just playing).It's an interesting design, and it's pretty nice when it works, but it doesn't always work well. In the first place, although Cone has pretty robust voice-recognition ability, it's far from perfect, and many's the time I had to request something numerous times before it understood. Additionally, though Cone (powered by the Rdio streaming music service) has an impressive array of music at its employ, it doesn't have everything. Additionally, you'll find some issues with, say, different renditions of a work (this pertains to concert music and some jazz), as well as the occasional mix-up with a live or alternate recording of something. None of this is to say that it's a bad experience: indeed, I'd estimate that 85% of the time, it worked just fine, and it's neat to be able to cue up a song just by saying what I want to hear.In terms of it 'learning' what I like, this was hit-or-miss. I was occasionally mystified/amused by what it thought I wanted to hear, but I was also impressed occasionally by how well it was able to predict music it thought I'd enjoy; there were a couple of instances where it guessed right on some fairly obscure music.In consideration of my first criteria, then, I'll say that Cone performs as-advertised pretty well- an A-minus.Will it replace my standard music-listening tools, then? Not by a long shot. Cloud-streaming media technology certainly has its place, but it can't touch either physical media or local storage for quick-access that doesn't rely on network connections. Not only that, but I don't have access to any sort of transport controls (fast-forward, rewind, repeat, etc.) or any sort of playlist tools.Perhaps the biggest drawback for me is that if I want to hear what Cone's playing, I have to hear it on Cone. I can't kick the signal to my home-theater speakers or my studio monitors, or even to a set of headphones. While the Cone speaker sounds very nice and has a very nice maximum volume without a lot of distortion, it just isn't in the same league as any of the permanent playback setups in my house. In Aether's defense, Cone wasn't intended to replace these things, so I can't deduct anything from my final evaluation, but I think it's worth noting for prospective buyers.Who is Cone ideal for? It's ideal for someone who:- doesn't own a large music collection but wants access to one- needs a music playback solution that's easy to move or transport- doesn't have a lot of space for speakers, monitors, amps or receivers- values ease-of-use over control and customizationIf you fit one or more of these descriptors, it's worth considering. I DO feel the price is perhaps prohibitive for some, and it bears repeating that you WILL need wireless internet access to use it, as well as a computer to set it up for the first time. Rdio has a free option that includes some advertising and limited song-skipping, and an unlimited subscription is $10 monthly, which is quite reasonable.In summary, Cone is an intriguing concept that's carried out pretty well, but it's also something of a niche solution, and given the price, prospective buyers will want to consider its benefits against other options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Y2A5LH2P6CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCVPIJI#wasThisHelpful","R15Y2A5LH2P6CV","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last 15 years or so, there's been a natural and anticipated shift in the agressive-athiesm/antitheism (hereafter 'AAA'... ha ha) movement away from demonstrating religion's many shortcomings, toward instead trying to justify the validity and value of concepts like moral absolutes and the good/evil dichotomy in ethical terms without having to resort to the values-systems that function as part of religious worldviews.""The Moral Arc"" is the latest work by a 'big name' AAA writer to assert not only that the shifts toward rationalism and empiricism have actually aided human morality, but that they are sufficient to sustain and improve it, even as the traditional moral guides of religion and philosophy continue to erode.As someone firmly in the theist/deist camp, I'm convinced neither by the premise nor by Shermer's articulation of it (though I acknowledge that my viewpoint colors my skepticism, just as Shermer's atheistic viewpoint colors his evaluation of the validity of religion's truth-claims). However, I appreciate that he isn't nearly so militant or antagonistic toward the institution as some of his peers are in their work, and there are two aspects of his presentation that demand serious consideration and reflection, even/especially by theists:- he demonstrates that humanity's most influential moral codes all contain the same strains of fairness and justice- the implication being that notions of, and desires for, justice and fairness are intrinsically human, rather than being simply extrinsic standards learned from custom or culture (though to my way of thinking, this begs the question about where those intrinsic notions come from in the first place)- he reminds that religion, like any other human convention, is bound to its origins and milieus- pointing out how often atrocities and injustices (in retrospect, clearly functions of what those cultures and milieus demanded or preferred) have been justified in the name of their corresponding religious/cultural componentIf I had to single out one aspect of Shermer's position that I find most untenable, it's the insistence that the ways in which the world is getting better owe their emergence to the evolution of humanistic trends in thought. While it's beyond the scope of a summary book review to really unpack this position, it should suffice for me to say that some of the parallels he draws for these two developments are tenuous, in my opinion.Shermer frequently oversimplifies and presents his perspectives on nuanced issues as though they were factual or complete, but this isn't a major grievance; he doesn't misrepresent himself as someone coming at the subject objectively. Nevertheless, how compelling you feel his presentation is will likely be a function of your position on the subject going in. I think it will do what most works in this vein do: it'll bolster the like-minded, but it won't convert many from the other side.Having said all that, it's well-written and pretty easy to read, though it drags a bit in a few places and could have been shorter without losing its impact. He's a good writer, though, and the subject matter is engaging for people on both sides of the issue, so I'll give it four stars as a reading/ thinking experience, and three stars for the central premise, of which I am no more convinced than I was when I began (I'm sure Mr. Shermer will be distraught when he finds out).","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127GNVRUXW2XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096914#wasThisHelpful","R127GNVRUXW2XG","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To be candid, I haven't owned or regularly used a toaster in about twenty years, so I have little knowledge about what modern toaster technology has to offer. Having said that, I'm greatly enjoying using this one.It's a sturdy design with a nice-looking, soft-industrial aesthetic. Control is digital, which is very cool to a guy coming from toasters with the old 'dark/light' sliders. Once I know what settings work for the things I toast, I never have to guess again.I actually bought this primarily for bagels, so the 'bagel' specialty function, predictably, is quite welcome, as is the 'defrost' function (I buy my bagels by the dozen from local delis and freeze them). Auto-shutoff prevents burning in case of jams (which does occasionally happen with non-uniform-size items like real deli bagels).In summary, it's a great modern toaster that's easy to use and well-performing, with bagel-lover-centric features that add value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZP127IZYEYV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8XFGI2#wasThisHelpful","R1ZP127IZYEYV6","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm comparing this product to Omega-3 Fish Oil - NutriGold Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold, 180 Softgels - 1000 mg EPA + DHA with 85% Omega-3s in 1,250 mg Liquid Capsules, Molecularly Distilled Fatty Acids, Pharmaceutical Grade Pills That Are NOT Enteric Coated for Best Absorption But ... and Controlled Labs Orange Oximega Fish Oil, Citrus Flavor, 120 SoftGels, which have been my go-to brands.The big sell here is the size of the pill, and it does indeed come in a bit smaller, but it's also a little fatter than more other omega-3 pills I've seen. Still, it goes down easily and doesn't have any detectable odor. I get a little of the fish aftertaste, but I've never used a fish oil supplement with which I DIDN'T experience that, even among products that are designed not to taste or that others report being aftertaste-free, so I think I'm just unusually sensitive to it.The important thing here is the nutrition profile, and Nature's Bounty nails it. Per-pill, this product contains slightly more fish oil than either of the two aforementioned competitors, and the price per-mg is slightly lower.There are some who will talk about varying qualities of fish oil and promote a certain brand or product thusly, but I don't know enough about that issue to comment. My only concern is the amount of fish oil/omega-3s in the products I use, and the Nature's Bounty product is a great value in this regard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13M71YVTBEWBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N0RGQI#wasThisHelpful","R13M71YVTBEWBS","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To my way of thinking, the measure of a great stroller is its ease of breakdown/setup, and the InVenture Pro is aces in this regard. I'll admit to not having a great deal of stroller familiarity, but in my limited experience, I've not used a stroller that has a better combination of light weight, easy breakdown, and value-adding features.Assembly is pretty easy- relatively quick, with no special tools needed. The build seems good and sturdy and, as noted, is lightweight.The seat is reversible, so the kiddo can face either way. The stroller is designed for one of the manufacturer's carseats to fit into the frame, but it's sold separately (I didn't feel the Amazon page communicated this clearly enough, so potential buyers need to understand that the included seat won't function as a carseat).The baby isn't here yet, so I can't give you his opinion, but all the design cues for an easy-to-use, functional stroller are present.My only critique is the price, which is a slight bit higher than other, ostensibly comparable, strollers. However, if one is inclined to purchase the sold-separately carseat, that totally justifies the price of each item, in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH7H2AWPUAO4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOMVDCQ#wasThisHelpful","RH7H2AWPUAO4O","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed this for my nephew to play with. When I was his age (about three years), the two things I loved most were deep, bright, bold colors and building things out of blocks, Legos, Lincoln Logs, etc... so this building set caught my eye right away, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy playing with it also, probably more than an adult should.The tiles are very attractive and eye-catching, with a little more pop in the colors than the pictures capture. The magnets work great and are balanced nicely between fairly strong adhesion and easy separation.Especially for smaller kids, the emphasis will be on two-dimensional building, but the three-dimensional building potential is pretty robust here, for when their creativity begins to expand a bit. For that reason, the applicability is scalable and they'll offer several years of interest as the kids grow.The only reason I'm deducting a star is due to the price- although it's a high-quality building set, it IS a little steep. It's a fantastic toy for stirring creativity, though, and is highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGNHKU0C89AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMVQLJC#wasThisHelpful","RYGNHKU0C89AB","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice calcium supplement. The dosage is twice the daily recommendation, which is ideal for people whose nutritional needs surpass those daily guidelines (almost everyone, in my opinion) and for people who have other needs related to calcium deficiency. The stack includes other ingredients to help with absorption, and it didn't give me any stomach issues, which other calcium supplements have.Some have complained that the pills are large, but I suppose this depends on the person; in my opinion, they're fine. They're gelcaps, which makes them easy to swallow.Given the price, this is an excellent value, as it's an all-in-one calcium stack.

"I've not noticed a lot of difference among the different carpet-cleaning products I've used, so this one gets standard marks because it works as well as any of them. It's the first time I've used the BISSELL brand in my carpet cleaner, and the price is a bit higher than the bran I normally buy (Hoover) for what appears to be the same level of cleaning performance. However, the smell is really terrific- it's called 'spring and renewal', and though I don't know what either of those things actually smells like (haha), I CAN tell you that this stuff smells great... floral, 'perfume-y', but very understated.I can't comment yet on the prolonged stain-fighting performance of the Scotchgard Protector, but if it works at all, that'll bump this to a five-star product, in my opinion.

"Whitening toothpastes have never done much for me; I don't have super-white teeth, just average, but I've never noticed a huge change in using them. Rembrandt is about the most effective one I've tried.Unfortunately, this toothpaste continues that trend, so if you're looking at it because you need the whitening effects, read as many reviews as you can, since everyone's experience differs. For me, there wasn't a noticeable effect. Nevertheless, I don't expect too much from toothpaste at this price point, and the flavor was very nice- enough that I'll probably buy this again because of it.

"'Evolution Revolution' is basically a positive primer to the concept of complexity theory as it applies to biological evolution, with built-in responses to some of the points where it disagrees with or challenges alternate theories.Complexity theory is that theory that life has an intrinsic tendency to become more complex over time. Author Alan Bennett maintains that this is a better explanation than natural selection for how certain complex mechanisms in nature have come to be.His arguments and case studies are compelling at points, and he does an effective job of vetting them with input from notables in various fields. The book reads well and is laid-out in such a way as to keep the reader interested in seeing what comes next.In terms of the book's thrust, there is a mildly evangelical tone to it, in the sense that Bennett seems very much awestruck by complexity theory and wants you to be, also. Fair enough- one wants an enthusiastic presentation when one is being presented with a potentially profound new idea. Just understand that the presentation ends up being a little one-sided. In other words, don't go into 'Evolution Revolution' expecting it to settle all the relevant issues. For what it is, though- an intro and selective application of complexity theory-, it's well done.FULL DISCLOSURE: I was provided with a copy of the book to write an uncompensated review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AY3H5BLUG5C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989189104#wasThisHelpful","R2AY3H5BLUG5C4","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This food chopper is simple to operate and clean, seems to be sturdily-built, and most importantly, works well for cutting things like peppers, onions, squash, and carrots- basically, any fruit or vegetable that has a little firmness to it.I was initially concerned about having to reduce the size of what I chopped before chopping it, but as long as it fits on the square chopping space (a little under 3"" square), this will chop it.As a bonus: though the manufacturer seems to intend this for fruits and vegetables along the lines of the ones I mentioned, it's GREAT for quickly chopping potatoes for french fries. I halved russets and chopped each half, and it worked flawlessly. Using the broadest of the three surfaces yielded fries that were the PERFECT thickness for my taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIPVLU2ZSTT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWLJOSG#wasThisHelpful","R2SIPVLU2ZSTT1","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pendant on this necklace is very sparkly- a function of the stone layout and how the many tiny stones grab the light. Resultantly, there's a lot of light 'motion' on the surface of the stones when the necklace is in bright light. It's attractive and makes the piece stand out in a pleasing way. The diamonds are matched well and have good clarity. They watch the setting and metal very nicely.The necklace seems to be well-made and is pretty lightweight, given the size.

"These earrings are attractive without being excessively eye-catching; subtle. The diamonds seem to be of good quality- white, even clarity, and they and the metal complement each other. The blue tanzanite stones also complement their setting nicely and have an even, subdued complexion. The color scheme creates a nice gentle gradient going from the center of the stones to the edges.My only criticism of these earrings is that the leverback mechanism seems to be a little longer than it needs to be, which creates maybe a longer 'hang'- a little more distance between the ear and the stone setting than necessary, but this will be a function of preference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOWT45SDCE5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPSV45U#wasThisHelpful","R3TOWT45SDCE5H","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite being a ubiquitous element of much of modern music, sound synthesis remains a quantity unknown to most people. The littleBits kit is a perfect entree into that world for ANYONE who's interested.Audio synthesis is the art and science of taking raw electronic signals and manipulating them to create different kinds of sounds. The littleBits kit breaks the essential components of a synthesizer out into discrete 'bits', allowing dabblers to understand how each component factors into the finished aural product.Though this seems to be designed with a younger audience in mind (it'll make a great school project or something along those lines), the kit and the literature it comes with will be useful for ANYONE who wants to learn the basic concepts. As a bonus, it's actually a fairly versatile synth for the price, so adventurous musicians and producers may find they can create some useful sounds with it.There's really no precedent for this, so my five-star rating is predicated on two factors: the educational value and the practical value for musicians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10IVB8WJMLBN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G99BZ4Q#wasThisHelpful","R10IVB8WJMLBN4","AFYPYQAFA31JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFYPYQAFA31JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just got this kit today and I love it!  I've had separate tools before, and lost them, so really needed a new set.  The scraper closest to the mirror wasn't useful as I don't have anything to scrape...but it would be good for people/pets who have a build-up across the teeth.  The tool to the left of the scraper...I LOVE it!  It's a bit coarse, on the sides of the tip, and it helps to scrape fine gunk from under the gum-line.  I did it all by feel and after a few hours, while on the computer, it feels like I've just left the dentist. The far-left tool is thin and sharp tipped, good for getting in-between crowded teeth and picking off what is hidden in nooks and crannies.  I have braces and hate to floss so this is a life-saver.

Feet don't breath in these and start to sweat the minute I put them on, even under the top strap. My foot angles kind of strange in this foot-bed; toes leaning towards the sides of the shoes instead of being held towards the front...hard to explain. It's like the foot-bed near the toes are angled inward so my toes angle sidewards. Not very comfortable for Birkis since my feet are accustomed to wearing anew pair right out of the box with comfort...not so with this pair. I'll try walking in them to hopefully have them adjust to my foot shape.  The good thing about these is you can wear them at the beach, in water, mud, what-ever and rinse them off. Good throw on shoes for when you don't care about wrecking them.ETA: Sent this pair back and ordered one size larger (which I never had to do in all the Birks I've bought).  This larger size still has a some-what funky fit, a tad too long, but at least I can wear them around the house or going out in rain or mud.

Good taste without the high price.For pasta sauce, quickly fry a bit of zucchini, onions, garlic in olive oil.  Add a can of these tomatoes and chop/smash coarsely with a wooden spoon.  Cook for about 5 minutes or until your pasta is done (al dente) and add the drained pasta into this sauce, mix a couple of minutes and serve with freshly grated romano cheese.

"I didn't realize this bento was so tiny.  It would be great for a pre-schooler or young child.  I don't have a measuring cup with markers to tell you how much this holds.  My guess is the bottom will hold 2 scrambled eggs and the top is probably twice the size.  I can see using this for breakfast or snacks and using another bento for your main meal.Fits together nicely, has its own bento band to hold it together. This has 3 lids total - 1 for each tier and a final top to close everything.  You can fit a small, flat utensil or napkin under the top lid.  This is the smallest bento I own, by far.ETA: I just found the size written: Bottom tier is a tiny bit over 1/2 cup and the top tier is a tiny bit under 1 cup.  So a total of 1-1/2 cups for both tiers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNW6VUL2T50OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8KP2CS#wasThisHelpful","RNW6VUL2T50OB","A37CENQP0ZNKVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CENQP0ZNKVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The rectangular design makes a pretty presentation, all foods easy to see and only one tray to clean (vs a double tier).  I like the larger, single tiered bentos best - easy cleaning and packing.When packing for a day out this is the one I use for a man and I use smaller ones for me.

Want to try cucumber with the lemon/lime combo also.  Never made fruit waters so this is new to me.  Cut the cherries in half so more fruit hits the water. On my list is cantaloupe, watermelon, cucumber, peaches, will be keeping my eyes open for new fruits.I would purchase these again.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  My docs are getting on me to drink more water (kidney stones at a young age/female) so until they find out what is causing them, I'm to drink tons of water every day but I'm not a fluid kind of person.

"This seemed like exactly what I was looking for and I purchased it in spite of some the negative reviews.  Your experiences may vary, but I was extremely pleased.After reading about the leaking problem, I opened the top and filled scalding hot water completely full.  I left it overnight in my garage stored horizontally on top of some paper to detect any leaks and not a drop of water leaked by the next afternoon.  Undeterred, I emptied it, refilled with hot water, and left stored in the vertical position.  This time I noticed some weepage around the large opening.  I applied, as one review suggested, some Vaseline and no more leaks the next day.  Still I'm going to store in the horizontal (flat) position to be safe.PROs:-No more mess.  After you drain the oil, just put the cover back on and store.  I hated cleaning my old drain pans [the bowl style and the pan-on-top style]-Carry handles are great when this thing is filled-Capacity.  I did a 5qt and 7qt oil change and did not have to take time to empty the drain pan in between-Materials.  Plastic is beefy and well-constructedCONs:-No gasket included.  For piece of mind, a large rubber O-ring or gasket around the large opening would have made many of these 1-star reviews much higher-Size.  I would prefer a larger opening.  The opening is 8"", but when you're used to a larger pan, this is small.  With my F-150, I may have to move it as much as a foot when the oil drains just to keep the flow in the center of the opening.-Wheels.  They aren't needed and don't work well.  I honestly wouldn't have listed these as a con, since they are totally unnecessary, but they don't roll well (molded plastic)I would definitely purchase this again.

"Great tool for removing stubborn hoses.  I used this to remove a lower radiator hose on a Ford 289.

"I heard a few tracks from this album on XM radio's Real Jazz channel and was blown away.  I purchased the mp3 version from amazon, but this is certainly an album worth owning. This is my first Monty Alexander album, so I am by no means an expert.  A few thoughts on ""Uplift 2:""Battle Hymn of the Republic.If you're feet aren't stomping by  the end of this classic, seek medical attention immediately.  This group epitomizes swing.  Monty Alexander's exuberance and joy on this tune remind me of Clark Terry throughout.  The bass and drums do more than keep time, they set a joyful rousing good-time sentiment that will keep you humming all day.  This is my favorite track from the album.You are my SunshineMonty Alexander and the gang offer a great take on a favorite childhood tune.  The interplay between the musicians is top-notch and will have you out of your seat if you're not careful.St ThomasI was surprised by this tune.  Monty Alexander's piano really reminded me of Max Roach's solo on Sonny Rollin's version of St Thomas on the Saxophone Colossus album.  This was great musicianship on display and I keep coming back to this tune.I like the blend of island music with straight ahead swing.  It really works.  There are several gospel style songs.  This really allows Monty Alexander to show off his chord-prowess and command of the keyboard.I would recommend this to any jazz enthusiast.  This would even make a great gift for the non-jazz fan.

They weren't as pleased, though, with NeverBeast as they were with the Fairy's previous installments.The movie seemed slower paced than the previous movies.  A few new characters were introduced, but they didn't really add to the story.  There was no depth and background like in previous movies.  The story does focus more on Fawn, the animal fairy, but similarly ignores most of the other fairies.  Even Tinker Bell plays a minor role--much to the disappointment of my youngest daughter.Still, with five kids ages 1-10, this was a good renter.

"Sort of a twisted, black comedy version of “About a Boy” (with elements of “Bad Santa“ thrown into the mix), “Bad Words” tells of an unlikely relationship between a cynical, child-hating adult and a gregarious  ten-year-old who insists on being his friend.Guy Trilby is a single, hyper-obnoxious 40 year-old elementary school dropout who, much to the consternation of children, parents and contest organizers around the country, has decided to force his way into spelling bees where he competes against - and invariably bests - groups of brainiac youngsters.  Chaitanya Chopra is the relentlessly cheery and upbeat child-whiz who tries to befriend - and defeat - Trilby at the Golden Quill Spelling Bee right there on national television for all the word to see.It’s awfully hard to like Trilby at times, as he smugly sabotages the other players’ chances at taking home the trophy. Yet, Jason Bateman (who also directed the film) manages to make a potentially repellent character both amusing and oddly endearing. Perhaps that’s because Trilby always says what he thinks, cutting through all the BS, skewering social norms and puncturing balloons of political correctness as he goes. What he doesn’t count on is meeting his match in the form of Chaitanya, who ultimately wears the middle-aged man down with his open-hearted honesty and frankness. And young  Rohan Chand matches his older costar moment-for-moment and scene-for-scene.Allison Janney, Kathryn Hahn and Phillip Baker Hall round out the cast.Unsurprisingly, the script by Andrew Dodge does go a bit “soft” at the end, but there was probably no way of avoiding it given the arc this type of story naturally follows. Plus, it provides the context that makes all that comes before it suddenly make sense.You may be put off by the movie at times, but that’s just what makes it so much fun to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LT1IT5DW0CQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH4SZWK#wasThisHelpful","R3LT1IT5DW0CQB","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even those with little or no interest in ballet will be moved by ""Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq,"" a documentary about one of the finest dancers ever to grace the stage, one who, like Lou Gehrig, was struck down by a disease of unspeakable awfulness in the prime of her life (though, unlike Gehrig, she managed to live to almost 80 despite her illness).A favorite pupil of famed choreographers George Ballanchine and Jerome Robbins, Tanaquil, or ""Tanny"" to her friends. stood out from her ballerina contemporaries due to her unusual tallness and angular frame. The film chronicles her rigorous, sheltered youth, her tumultuous marriage to Ballanchine, her phenomenal success on the stage. And, then, just as she was on the top of the world professionally, tragedy - of a particularly cruel nature for a person used to making a living and perfecting her art with her body - befell her in the form of a severe case of polio, a case so severe, in fact, that she was forced to endure time in an iron lung and ultimately to spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.Through an abundance of stills and kinescope recordings, we get to see a great deal of Tanaquil's work. These are supplemented by interviews with those who knew Tanny both on a professional level and as personal friends. Most poignant are the recitations of the letters Tanny wrote at the height of her illness, many of them from a rehabilitation center where she was receiving treatment. Her resolve and inner strength, along with and her almost nave hope for the future, pour forth in great abundance from the writings.One thing that strikes us most in Tanny's post-polio life is her determination to remain independent in the face of her disability. And, indeed, the movie ends on a high note, as we learn that Tanny spent the better part of her life imparting her priceless wisdom and insight to young dancers from her wheelchair.The movie provides an inspiring portrait of an inspiring person.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEB0N2RKXILB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAGF9Y2#wasThisHelpful","R3CEB0N2RKXILB","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wes Anderson’s latest cinematic confection, “The Grand Budapest Hotel,“ is a quirky, surrealistic comedy set at a mountain resort run by a concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes)  and a “lobby boy” named Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori), whom M. Gustave has taken under his wings to train in the art of service.Set in a fictional country, the movie begins in 1968, when the Grand Budapest Hotel is just a shadow of its former self, having been allowed to fall into disrepair and currently inhabited by a small contingent of eccentric tenants.  One of them is a writer (Tom Wilkinson) who discovers that Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) is now the owner of the once-proud establishment. The elder Mustafa regales him with stories of an earlier time in the hotel’s history - the 1930s, in fact - when the palatial inn played host to only the richest and most aristocratic of occupants and guests.Through dual-narrated flashbacks, then, Anderson weaves a smart and cheeky tale of an enduring friendship that triumphs over class division, a tale that combines wit with imagination and social commentary with visual elegance, set against the writer/director’s trademarked air of heightened unreality. When he isn‘t fulfilling his duties as hotel concierge, the foppish M. Gustave, fastidious in manner and with a poetic quote for every occasion, offers his “personal” services exclusively to blond, fabulously wealthy and emotionally insecure dowagers, one of whom bequeaths to him a priceless painting upon her sudden death. This surprising turn-of-events puts him at odds with a veritable army of the deceased woman’s outraged relatives. This leads to a stolen art treasure, a false conviction for murder, a daring prison break and a mad race to stay one step ahead of the pursuing authorities, as M. Gustave endeavors to prove his innocence.To enhance the dreamlike nature of the material, the look of the film is marked by whimsical art direction and ultra-stylized framing. Even the dimensions of the screen change with the time period of the story - traditional square for the scenes set in 1932 and widescreen for those that take place in 1968.In addition to the splendid deadpan performances of Fiennes, Abraham and newcomer Revolori in the key roles, the movie provides a veritable sea of familiar faces in supporting and bit parts, many of them members of Anderson’s repertory company: Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson, among others.“The Grand Budapest Hotel” finds Mr. Anderson in peak form.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36392362I7XK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAQJMJ0#wasThisHelpful","R36392362I7XK6","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""300: Rise of an Empire"" is less of a sequel to the 2007 original and more of a companion-piece, since much of what it chronicles overlaps, rather than follows, the events of that earlier film. The jumbled chronology leads to a great deal of confusion on the part of the viewer, helped not one whit by the fact that all the actors look pretty much the same in their Greek warrior attire, so that one is never quite sure who is fighting where or against whom. And, in all honesty, I'm not really sure it's worth the effort trying to figure it all out.As far as I can tell, the set-up goes something like this: the effete and cowardly Athenians, who are always going on and on about things like philosophy and democracy, turn to the bellicose Spartans for help in defeating the Persians led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), son of the late King Darius (Yigal Naor). Yet, although Xerxes has been transformed into a gold-plated demi-god, he's really just the puppet of the far more ruthless and conniving Artemisia (Eva Green), who French kisses decapitated heads and has dreams of bringing arrogant Greece to its knees once and for all for killing her family and turning her into a sex-slave, though she herself is of Greek extraction. The Athenian leader is (the almost unpronounceable) Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), who killed King Darius with a very well-aimed arrow through the heart and was rewarded with command of the army in grateful recognition of that feat. Beyond this synopsis, you're on your own.In an attempt to visually replicate the as-yet unpublished Frank Miller graphic novel that is its source, the movie employs a mix of live action and computer-generated imagery that puts the film in a kind of never-never-land of legendary pseudo-history.This garish spectacle of stiff acting, gleaming pecs, passionate hate-sex, pop psychology, two-bit philosophizing and slow-motion bloodletting is indeed something to behold, but, frankly, you've seen it all before - only better - in the original film.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31NLI7T0ADMK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJL6Q8#wasThisHelpful","R31NLI7T0ADMK2","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually when movies use Paris as a romantic backdrop, it’s a young couple who gets to occupy the foreground. Not so with “Le Week-End,” a tale of two aging tourists - he a professor of philosophy, she a teacher - who’ve chosen to “celebrate” their 30th anniversary in (where else? ) the City of Lights.Like many couples who have been together for a long time, Nick and Meg Burroughs often seem to have more things that are driving them apart than bringing them together. Not only have they grown tired of each other’s all-too-predictable habits and quirks, but Meg, in particular, feels that now, with the kids grown and gone, it may be time for the two of them to move on and to spend what little time they have left getting to know themselves as individuals rather than as a couple.Because the screenplay by Hanif Kureishi is clearly focused on an older couple, the film captures the paradox that exists at the core of lasting romantic love: that the very same predictable patterns and dull routines that, over time, work to deaden love are also what enhance intimacy and bind us inexorably to one another over the long haul.Though Meg and Nick are still clearly sexual beings, even that fact has caused some tension and division between them, namely in an affair Nick had awhile back and for which he is perpetually atoning. Yet, the script is smart enough to know that what is said in the heat of the moment is not always indicative of what is in the heart.Much of the second half of the film takes place at a posh and pretentious dinner party thrown by an old college buddy of Nick’s, an American author and intellectual played by Jeff Goldblum.Director Roger Michell keeps the tone serious and intimate without becoming heavy-handed or preachy. He allows the characters to reveal their depth through conversation and the way they interact with the world and each other. He is aided immeasurably by the skilled and incisive performances of Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan, who make us truly believe that they are a couple who have grown both comfortable and complacent with one another over time. Above all, “Le Week-End” acknowledges that relationships are tricky and complex things and come with no pat or easy instructions to make them easier to navigate our way through.After “Le Week-End,” it may not be necessary for Richard Linklater to make another “Before…” movie, after all. I think Kureishi and Michell might have done it already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1L0K9WXQTNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEEZSGY#wasThisHelpful","RQ1L0K9WXQTNB","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the war-is-hell department comes “Stalingrad,” an old-fashioned World War II movie chronicling the famous siege that devastated that city in 1942 and 1943. This dubbed-into-English Russian film tells of five heroic Soviet fighters who commandeer a shell-shocked woman’s apartment out of which they wage their own battle against the Nazis.With its clear-cut delineation between good guys and bad guys, heroes and villains (except for one momentarily ambiguous Nazi), it’s clear that subtlety is not exactly the movie’s strong suit. In addition, its complete lack of character development turns the viewers into dispassionate observers of all the brutality and carnage taking place on screen.Running an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, this static and talky and occasionally corny movie seems designed to provide modern-day Russians with a morale boost by giving them a chance to focus on their heroic past. And while the Russians have just as much of a right to engage in this sort of self-congratulatory exercise as anyone else (goodness knows, American moviemakers do it often enough), it still doesn’t make for very compelling filmmaking or drama.If you want to see this sort of thing done right, check out the beautiful 1957 Russian classic, “The Cranes are Flying,“ a true work of art for any season or nationality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJTVT9HAOSHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWY9F5G#wasThisHelpful","R1CJTVT9HAOSHN","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**1/2A high-octane action flick on the order of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, ""Need for Speed"" features the less-than-impressive first big-screen headliner role for Aaron Paul, the brilliant young star of TV's ""Breaking Bad."" In it, he portrays Tobey Marshall, an unassuming mechanic by day and by night a street racer whose recently deceased dad was not only the owner of the body shop that Tobey is now trying to rescue from the old man's years of mismanagement but a legend among the die-hard racing crowd. Daddy issues much? Before he knows it, Tobey is wrongly convicted of the death of his best friend in a fiery car crash and, when he's finally paroled, dedicates his life to exacting revenge on the actual culprit, a snooty rival from Tobey's past. And what better or more fitting way than by besting said villain in an illegal cross-country race sponsored by an underground radio announcer played by Michael Keaton?The plot, such as it is, doesn't require much more in the way of elaboration, other than to say that it's basically just an excuse for a bunch of testosterone-fueled, speed-busting outlaws to careen through the city streets and around the countryside in their fantastically expensive race cars with zero regard for the lives and safety of themselves or anyone else around them. This cavalier attitude is supposed to make the characters somehow cool and charming when what they really are is obnoxious and appalling. And while we're asked to weep when one of their own number gets inevitably killed in an ""accident,"" that same courtesy isn't extended to any of the innocent motorists or law enforcement officials who might get taken out during their high-stakes ""playtime."" They're all just ""collateral damage,"" I suppose.One understands Paul's need for a little R&R in the acting department after the intense rigors required by five seasons of ""Breaking Bad."" Still, one hopes that he'll soon get back to doing what he does best now that he's gotten this little career detour into commercial movie-making out of his system.Director Scott Waugh pumps up the action scenes efficiently, but he's had far less success with the quieter expository moments. No surprise, given that the movie is based on a video game of the same name.The supporting cast includes Dominic Cooper, Imogen Poots, Ramon Rodriguez (""Gang-Related""), Rami Malek and the aforementioned Keaton, but, like Paul, they too play second fiddle to the cars, chase scenes and stunt work. And that, I guess, is as it should be when it comes to a movie with a title like ""Need for Speed.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EDI9JD4J2VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFDMM3I#wasThisHelpful","R6EDI9JD4J2VM","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A familiar face in Britain but a virtual unknown in the States, comedian Steve Coogan has made his name in his home country portraying a fictional radio talk show host by the name of Alan Partridge. Since 1991, Coogan has performed his act on both radio and TV, and now he's branched out to his first feature-length movie entitled ""Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa"" (just ""Alan Partridge"" in the United States).In the film, the station where Partridge works is facing serious cutbacks due to a corporate takeover, changing audience tastes, a drop in listenership and bailing advertisers. Though Partridge himself survives the ax, the same cannot be said for his fellow broadcaster, Pat Farrell (""Hell on Wheels' Colm Meaney), who, upon learning of his dismissal, completely flips out, holding his co-workers hostage at gunpoint while the goofy and inept Partridge is sent in by the authorities to help negotiate a peaceful resolution to the crisis.Maybe with our history of gun violence, we're a trifle more sensitive to this sort of thing here in America than they are in Britain, which may explain why some of the laughs tend to catch in our throats at times, particularly when Farrell is threatening to take out a bunch of his own innocent and understandably distraught colleagues as retaliation for the wrong that's been done to him. That being said, the stylish mix of satire, slapstick, black humor and social commentary that Coogan and his various co-writers have come up keeps us chortling through most of the movie.Coogan makes Partridge a likable everyman character, bemused and skeptical without being hard-edged and cynical.

But at the 35 minute mark, the movie suddenly jumps the tracks, turning into a bizarre, yet strangely conventional, hostage drama, with the psychologically disturbed client kidnapping and torturing the psychologist in an effort to prove which of the two is actually most in need of help.The movie seems to be making the case that people like the Mackie character are just glib, overpaid shysters, taking advantage of people‘s suffering by offering them little but shibboleths and bromides to help them cope with their problems - but any message the movie might be trying to convey is subsumed by the unpleasant melodramatics that come to dominate the second half. Yeomen that they are, Mackie and Whitaker work valiantly to overcome the various roadblocks that the script throws in their path, but even these two fine performers eventually have to concede that they’re fighting a losing battle here. Even the “surprise” ending and moralistic message can’t ultimately redeem this cinematic turkey.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8R1S4USI4555/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKM5L6I#wasThisHelpful","R8R1S4USI4555","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***1/2Those with a fear of flying might want to skip “Non-Stop,” an airliner-in-jeopardy thriller that could have you taking trains and buses for quite some time to come.In another of his increasingly frequent action-hero roles, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U.S. air marshal who discovers that someone aboard a flight from New York to London is threatening to kill a new passenger every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into an account that has been set up for the occasion. The twist is that the mystery culprit is making it look as if Marks is the actual extortionist and may even be making Marks carry out some of the killings for him.“Non-Stop” works well enough within the limited confines of both the setting and the hostages-held-for-ransom genre of which it is a part. The whodunit plotting unravels at an appropriate pace, with a whole host of possible suspects for us to choose from, including fellow passengers Juliette Moore, Anson Mount (“Hell on Wheels”) and Corey Stoll (“House of Cards” ), as well as Michelle Dockery (“Downton Abbey”) and Lupita Nyong’o (“12 Years a Slave”) as flight attendants who demonstrate grace and ingenuity under pressure.The holes in the plot are probably large enough to fly a 747 through, but you really won’t notice or care while you’re strapped in for the ride.

"At 58, Gloria is in the midst of a midlife crisis. Divorced and with a seemingly strained relationship with her adult children, Gloria is also coping with a mundane job, a potentially psychotic upstairs neighbor, and days on end of perpetual loneliness (and, oh yes, a creepy hairless cat that keeps coming over for a visit). Until, that is, she meets Rodolpho, a divorced ex-naval officer, who has the opposite problem from Gloria: he’s TOO intimately involved with the lives of his grown daughters, so much so that he is unable to devote the time needed to nurture his relationship with Gloria.On the surface, “Gloria” feels like most of the other midlife crisis films we’ve seen, but the strength of this Chilean/Spanish co-production lies in its naturalism and in its focus on revelatory detail. Writer Gonzalo Maza and writer/director Sebastian Lelio provide enough specifics to make this a very particular story about a very particular woman. That manages to keep Gloria a sympathetic figure even when her understandable unhappiness begins to slide over into self-pity. The movie also refuses to tie its story up in a nice, neat little bow at the end to cater to audience expectations.Paulina Garcia won a number of awards, all richly deserved, for her nuanced, fully-developed portrayal of a woman whose life is all but put under a microscope for all the world to see. Yet, Garcia meets the challenge with a bravery rare for actresses her age. Sergio Hernandez matches her as the man who comes into Gloria’s life but who may be bringing plenty of his own baggage right along with him.Yet, for all its insight into late-in-life romance, the movie ultimately reveals that middle-aged lovers are often every bit as petulant, jealous and overly sensitive - not to mention, clueless - as the greenest teen when it comes to affairs of the heart. Some things just never change, I guess.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13785DP9M9H2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0CBTIU#wasThisHelpful","R13785DP9M9H2K","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like any trio of college buds who are now making their way in New York City (any trio of young men in the MOVIES, that is), Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) are having trouble with women. When Mikey is served with divorce papers, Jason and Daniel agree to remain single and uncommitted till such time as their cuckolded buddy feels like returning to the field.With screenplay and direction by Tom Gormican, “That Awkward Moment” treads upon some mighty shopworn territory at this point, but the general likeability of the stars helps to mitigate some of the familiarity. Ditto for Imogen Poots, Mackenzie Davis and Jessica Lucas who play the various women in their lives who come along to tempt the boys to break their pact.

"“The Suspect” has all the polish and professionalism of some grad-school student’s final project for a PhD in Cinema.The premise of the movie is so improbable and loopy that it requires a complete suspension of disbelief even to get through it. However, I won’t reveal what that premise is, for to do so would be to engage in the biggest plot spoiler since “The Crying Game.” All I can tell you is that it involves two African-American men who may have robbed a bank in a rural Midwest community. “May” is indeed the operative word here, for it turns out there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.If all that sounds somehow intriguing, then I’m doing more justice to the movie than it actually deserves. I don’t question the good intentions of those who made the film, but it so ineptly directed and so badly acted, so filled with screeds and bromides about racism and justice, and so bogged down by over-earnest plotting and a confusing time-shifting narrative, that even the best of intentions can’t make a silk purse out of this particular sow’s ear.I’ve deliberately avoided identifying the individuals responsible for “The Suspect,” both those in front of the camera and those behind it, and I wish them nothing but the best in their future careers in moviemaking. But I doubt anyone will be rushing to claim credit for this underwhelming, if well-intentioned, cinematic misfire.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOUNMD341MJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2PB7OW#wasThisHelpful","R1EOUNMD341MJF","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Paul W. S. Anderson's ""Pompeii"" is a throwback to all those sword-and- sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period-piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting, action and romance. This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D., burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job, ""Game of Throne's"" Kit Harrington plays Milo, a Celtic boy who, after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire, is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator. When he's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena, he catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning), a thoroughly anachronistic, sassy, forward-looking, freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood-soaked pastimes as fight-to-the-death battles in the coliseum. A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre, ""Pompeii"" is just chockablock with stock characters, cheesy dialogue and corny plotting, though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and, dare I say it, even quite brave finale.But, of course, anyone who checks out ""Pompeii"" will be doing so strictly to witness, albeit vicariously, all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top. Apparently, overproduced, CGI-infested disaster movies are our milder, modern-day equivalent to gladiatorial contests. And in that respect, at least, the movie delivers the goods.There's one thing that ""Pompeii,"" fortunately, doesn't have in common with those toga-wrapped spectacles of the past - and that is their extraordinary length. So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes, ""Pompeii"" has at least one thing going for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HF8KZMRMQNPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J11U54K#wasThisHelpful","R2HF8KZMRMQNPR","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**1/2So what do we have here? Nothing but another unnecessary remake of an ‘80s film. This time it’s “About Last Night,” the romantic drama starring Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, which was itself based on the highly acclaimed play by David Mamet, provocatively entitled “Sexual Perversity in Chicago.” In this version, it’s Joy Brand and Michael Ealy who play the young urban couple who meet, fall in love, move in together, then begin to have doubts about the efficacy and durability of their relationship.Brand and Ealy are appealing and attractive performers, and both have done fine work on TV, Brand in “Parenthood” and Ealy in “Almost Human.” But here they have been let down by screenwriter Leslye Headland, who proves herself incapable of getting past all the timeworn tropes and cliches that have become so much a part of the romantic comedy genre. The movie becomes just another men-are-from-Mars/women-are-from-Venus-type scenario, filled with girl-talk and guy-talk and all the predictable sturm und drang soul-baring and commitment issues (mainly on the part of the man, of course) that such narratives are prone to. Too often the things pulling the couple apart feel scripted and manufactured rather than organic and real. Under the slick but lackluster direction of Steve Pink, everyone just seems to be going through the motions, without any real passion or conviction.The movie also comes replete with the requisite smart-aleck, comic-relief couple (well-played by Kevin Hart and Regina Hall) to serve as a foil for the one on center-stage. Yet, even the humor tends to aim low when it should be aiming high.I like the way the story hits the re-set button in the final scene, but by then it’s a case of too little too late and we’ve already moved onto the next movie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXPBS8LN10B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J11U57C#wasThisHelpful","RTXPBS8LN10B7","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on an event that garnered worldwide attention in 2009, “Captain Phillips” tells the tale of two total strangers, both hailing from opposites corners of the earth, who are brought together by circumstance and fate.One of those individuals is Richard Phillips, the captain of an unarmed cargo ship sailing through international waters off the coast of Africa en route to Mombasa, and the other is Abduwali Muse, the leader of a band of Somali pirates who are determined to board the ship and hold its captain and crew hostage for ransom.Billy Ray has based his screenplay on the book “A Captain’s Duty” by Steven Talty and Phillips himself. The movie, directed with his usual taut precision by Paul Greengrass, relates the story in step-by-step detail, exploring the relationship between these two wildly disparate but equally desperate captains, as a thrilling real-life drama plays itself out on the high seas. While Phillips’ self-sacrificing heroism - and that of the Navy Seals who successfully took out three of the four pirates - takes center stage in the drama, Ray is still able to give Abduwali his due, making it clear that the young man has been driven to this action as much out of desperation as out of greed or criminal intent, since illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste on the part of foreigners in that area have pretty much depleted the Somali fishing grounds, leaving men like Abduwali without any viable means of supporting themselves and their families. Sadly, piracy becomes the next obvious step in the struggle for survival. It would have been easy to have turned Abduwali and his cohorts into one-dimensional villains, but, to their credit, Ray and Greengrass have chosen not to do so.This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Together, they create a human dynamic that carries the film far beyond the heart-stopping, race-against-the-clock surface aspects of the drama. Not that the visceral is in any way slighted, for in true Greengrass fashion, the film moves along at a breakneck pace, rarely slowing down to give the audience a chance to catch its breath along the way.By far, the most effective scene in the movie comes right near the end, after Phillips has been rescued and is taken to the ship’s trauma center to ascertain his physical and mental condition. Unlike the vast majority of movies and TV shows in which characters who are subjected to horrifying circumstances seem to bounce back from them almost immediately, “Captain Phillips” shows us the true human response to a life-shattering, traumatic event (thanks in no small measure to Hanks‘ magnificent acting).It is just this type of insightful verisimilitude that informs each and every moment of “Captain Phillips.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVQQASXVE3UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUNKU#wasThisHelpful","R2WVQQASXVE3UP","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**1/2There’s something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about “The Monuments Men,” one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. It’s one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the world’s greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war.Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Men’s motives for rounding up the treasures.The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide.Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and there’s some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but it’s hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBANX0KWIUCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL48BM6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBANX0KWIUCN","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**1/2“Ride Along” isn’t technically a “cop buddy” comedy - seeing as one of the characters isn’t actually a cop - though the movie follows the basic formula almost to a tee.Ice Cube plays James Payton, an Atlanta police officer who doesn’t much care for the man his sister (Ika Sumpter) is currently dating, one Ben Barger (Kevin Hart), a ne’er-do-well goofball who works as a security guard at a high school when he isn’t sitting at home on the couch playing video games. Ben does, however, suffer from delusions of grandeur when it comes to what he plans to do with his life, which is to use his skills as a gamer to become one hell of a real life crime fighter. James agrees to take Ben on a “ride along” in his squad car to see if he has what it takes to be a cop. Hilarity ensues.Or at least it would if the one-joke premise didn’t run out of steam about a half hour into the movie’s running time. Actually, “Ride Along” starts off on a promising note, with breezy, fast-paced dialogue and a genuine rapport established between Hart as the comic cutup and Ice Cube as his requisite straight man (think of them as an African-American version of Martin and Lewis).But the concept begins to pall early on, as too many of the scenes run on well past their sell-by dates as far as generating any further laughs is concerned. A pity, in that, given better material, Hart, especially, might have made something decent out of “Ride Along.”","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZELFFOAYA08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX0KIAM#wasThisHelpful","R3GZELFFOAYA08","A19ZXK9HHVRV1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I am not a chef, I am not a knife expert,and I cannot cook much of anything fancy. I do, however, have a thirst for efficiency and the deepest appreciation for quality and excellence, and my review is coming from that perspective.The phrase ""The bitterness of poor quality lingers long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten"" is completely applicable in every area of life, but especially when it comes to the tools required to do a job quickly and do it well.When life demands I get down to business and create something in the kitchen, or lend a hand to the true pro in the food production process, more than anything, I want to have the best tools at hand. Over the years there have been many cheap ($5-$25) knives take up space in the drawers in the kitchen. Initially, these knives do a decent job, but over time they beg to be replaced, complaining that a tomato has become a significant challenge. Instead of their kitchen duties, some have even suggested they be retired and live out their existence as a form of cruel and rather painful form of home defense.Given there is a significant cost increase for this knife, from what I have paid for knives in the past, my expectations around its ability to deliver stellar results were unrelenting - as much as they could be for a nonprofessional.From the moment I took receipt of the shipment and took the knife out of the packaging, I was impressed. No matter what I flung on the chopping board, no surface was a match for the business edge of the Sabatier.I have read other reviews that called the validity of the 'Mother of Pearl' materials and also the metal used. For me, given the performance from this knife, it could be wrapped in banana skins for the handle and be made of Kevlar as long as it keeps cutting the same way.In summary, if you are a chef, or someone who knows a lot about knives, you might find fault with my review. If however you are like me - a non-pro - you may be just as delighted as I was to have this knife replace 8-10 of the older blunt objects sitting in the knife drawer.Just kidding on the cup of coffee...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGD5TI7WLGKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYHNFRG#wasThisHelpful","R2CGD5TI7WLGKL","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In reviewing this router, I am comparing it to my ASIN:B00PDLRHFW TP-LINK Archer C9 AC1900 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router, 2.4GHz 600Mbps+5Ghz 1300Mbps, 1 USB 2.0 Port & 1 USB 3.0 Port, IPv6, Guest Network.When it comes to Internet access, my needs in a router go beyond simply being able to surf the Web and check my email. They are more centered around being able to upload and download a significant volume of high-resolution images. As such, simply getting a signal is not enough to woo me; there has to be power available with the signal.When reading this review, consider that if your need for speed is not as demanding as mine, then this router may be more than you need. Alternatively, and not something I was able to test for, if you have a big family or office with four or more people with significant bandwidth demands, then this may be the better option for you.With my testing, this router did about the same as the TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900. I did side-by-side testing both routers using three different products - a Dell Laptop, an Asus tablet (that could only connect to the 2.4Ghz network) and an Asus Zenfone 2 phone.In terms of the specs for both models, they are quite similar.AC1900 with 1.9Gps on 1x 2.4Ghz (600Mbps) and 1x 5Ghz (1300Mbps) networks but the AC3200 has 3200Gps on 1x 2.4 (600Mbps) and 2x 5Ghz (1300Mbps) networks.Both the AC1900 and AC3200 have a 1Ghz Dual core processor.Both routers have USB 3.0 ports to share printers and storage across the network.AC1900 has 3 antennas and the AC3200 has 6.Both have 4 1 gigabit ports.Both use beam forming technology.Both offer guest networks.Both products appear to have the same set of functionality in the user interface.ProsTri-Band allows for two networks - 1x 2.4Ghz and 2x 5Ghz allowing one to connect more devicesSUPER easy setupGreat user interfaceEasily identify the devices connected to the network4 1 gigabit portsDesign  - very attractive.

"This is a great alternative to the rather limited electric or battery operated  products on the market. Having had a few over the years, I either lose the chargers or they simply break because of quality issues.This product reminds me of something I would see my dad having owned for 20 or more years. It has a solid feel to the construction, and the materials feel like high quality.The product does a great job, and the fact that one's skin is protected from ever coming into contact with the business end with the cutting edge is very comforting.The fact that it works perfectly, will never cut your skin, only the hair, and the old world appeal of a non-motorized, well-engineered product make this a 5-star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZSSLZ7HGLFU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A9JR8U#wasThisHelpful","R2ZSSLZ7HGLFU0","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having given this product a fair stab (4 weeks) at becoming something I love, it is time to do the review.Firstly, the product was unable to win me over. The first thing out of the box is that the tip looks like there is something missing or perhaps fell off in shipping. While not a design major, or anything remotely close, my brain had a hard time resolving that such a wide opening with holes on the sides was going to deliver a more powerful deluge of mouthwash than something more probe-like. Upon inspection of the images on the box and website I discover that it is how it was designed, and nothing is missing.After a full charge cycle I loaded the chamber and elected to give myself the full treatment by setting it to 3 and let it give the plaque a really good talking to.Unprepared for the sidespash and ricochet onto the bathroom mirror, I decided I should close my lips to localize the discharge as I continue my test run.  Now, with that problem addressed, an no more 'cleanup on aisle B' over the intercom, I face a new situation.  With each burst from this oral hygiene M16, I am treated to a new  and wonderful sensation - the joy of watching my cheeks enlarge as I inflate my face.  At this point, I just feel like I have been pranked and look around carefully for the hidden cameras.Upon conclusion of my first test run, with mirror cleaned off, and umbrella safely stored away, I look at the reservoir that holds the rinse and can't help but be surprised that I am almost completely out of ammo. Maybe I have used the same amount I would in a normal mouthwash, but it just looked alarming to have used so much.As I think about the marketplace regarding this product, there are 3 players in this equation. I have ranked them in order of winning to not so winning:Whoever makes the Breathrx mouth rinse.Phillips.The consumer.In closing, I have to wonder about the following bullet points in the 'About the product' section on the Amazon listing.Clinically proven as effective as floss for gum healthHealthier gums in 2 weeks, guaranteed#1 - If it is as effective as flossing... then .... I'm sorry, but isn't it just a super expensive (by comparison) alternative ?#2 - For any such guarantee to be valid, it has to be based on a measurable metric. Do we have to visit the dentist and get a checkup prior to the first use, and then return 2 weeks later.  Also, that guarantee is only valid for someone who isn't currently flossing, because as stated in point #2, this is as effective as flossing. That would mean if you floss, and switch to the Airfloss Pro, you will not see healthier gums.I could go on, and do the pros and cons, but i'm not sure it would deliver any new information. If you have made it this far, then I think you know where I stand on this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RS78C6H98KS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R3RS78C6H98KS1","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What impressed me the most was the stoneware interior that can be removed and washed separately. It seems to avoid the stains ans smells other slow cookers are prone to do.The color is a good neutral gray, and it can easily fit enough for in it for 6-8 people.It has four settings--off, low heat, high heat and keep warm. It would be great to have a light to show it's on though.It's a good size at 13.45 inches x 8.65 inches x 13.77 inches, so I wouldn't recommend it for meals for two.I can see how the meal is cooking through the glass lid.The handles don't get too hot to handle.The lid doesn't fit at all snugly, and you can almost move it in circles when it's in place. The vents are not in the lid, they are scored into the sides of the stoneware. Perhaps that's why the lid doesn't fit tightly, but it seems like a poor design feature.The lid holder on the side is a clever addition. Sometimes I have so much in my counters that it can be hard to find a place in a snap to leave the lid.The cord is only about 18"" long--not adequate for the way my stuff is set up.All in all, it's a good choice if you are cooking for a crowd and don't want the crockpot stained or smelling after being washed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LN7NE83D3JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5XJ9FG#wasThisHelpful","R26LN7NE83D3JD","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the purpose of being able to comment on this garment, I put this shirt through an extreme test, I wore it all day while driving in Texas.Since this is something I have done quite frequently (the driving, not testing out shirts), I knew it would be a good acid test to determine if it does keep you dry and comfortable.Firstly, I am 5""6, 160lbs and have a 32 inch waist, and this shirt fit me as expected.Despite the material being a little heavier than what I thought it 'should be' to deliver on its performance claims to keep me dry, I was pleasantly surprised.What I wanted to know was immediately clear after getting in the car, and remained unchanged all day.  This fabric is amazing.In addition to remaining comfortable, and dry, the additional component for me that makes all the difference  is remaining presentable. There is no point in feeling comfortable and dry if your clothes look wet, with this shirt, that was not the case.For me, the only negative is in relation to style. I feel the fabric is a little long in the body. For a shirt that isn't going to be tucked in, my preference would be for a shorter shirt but about 2-3 inches. While I took away one star for this, it in no way affects its performance which is more important :)In conclusion, in addition to the material used, the construction (stitching etc) yields a shirt that works well in high temperatures and is very durable. I can see this shirt lasting for many years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMA3Z2X4ZAZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4N5JFO#wasThisHelpful","R2LMA3Z2X4ZAZB","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This came in a few parts that were easy enough to put together. It has a four-prong base, four screws to attach the grill top into the cradle, and a swing arm to lock it in place.Once ready, this stands quite low off the floor -- about 3 foot high. I'm only 5""2, so it worked for me, but I can't imagine a tall guy working easily with this.The second issue I had with this is its light weight -- there is no weight in the base, and any child or dog could easily knock it over while it's grilling hot food.The third thing I found unhelpful is the uneven cooking -- I put some veg, 3 pieces of bacon and two burgers on it (about as much as it can fit), and had to move the meat onto the side that seemed to be cooking it faster.The fourth complaint is the fat drainage. I like bacon fat, but the whole point of this grill is to drain off everything. A lot of the fat collected at the top end of the grill and didn't even enter the groove in the middle to transport it away.On the plus side, everything was cooked in 15 minutes at the 4 setting, and the bacon didn't spit at me the way it does in a skillet.All in all, a disappointing grill.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10U1CFRAK7UWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWZA#wasThisHelpful","R10U1CFRAK7UWO","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.]Dorinda Trick has very evidently put her years of experience and knowledge into this gem of a book. While a lot of identity workshops and books use oft overused Christian tests and labels, Trick writes about seven redemptive gifts as identity markers, and spends time in each chapter going through the positive aspects of what you bring to the world and what you might need to watch out for if you have that particular gift. At the end of each chapter is a detailed blessing of that gift in you, which is written in a similar style to the Blessing Your Spirit prayers by Sylvia Gunter and Arthur Burke.Trick includes much of her personal story to freedom in the opening chapters, which helps lay a solid groundwork for the material she introduces in the remainder of the book. She also includes a questionnaire at the back of the book to help you figure out your most predominant and secondary gifts.I'd recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about self-awareness and personal growth or counseling and coaching others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZS3C5QYKEU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1943011001#wasThisHelpful","R2VZS3C5QYKEU4","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Usually when reviewing a product, I like to compare it to a competitor's product, or something similar, to give some understanding as to where my opinion is based.For this review, I can only compare the ease of use, power, and results to those previously achieved through the use of a more primitive competitor - a hammer. I will break my review into two parts, the good and the bad. Lets start with the bad.The documentation. The layout of the documentation and the ""steps"" to follow to use the product leave a lot to be desired. To dispel any fear about using such a product (especially for people who have never used anything like it before), I feel there could be a major improvement in the documentation regarding clear steps to follow.A graphic-intensive instruction set would be really helpful. Having photographs with the areas of interest detailed with numbers is fine, but having to read through the entire instructions to find out what each element is in order to follow the instructions makes for very difficult reading. For me, the main area of concern was how much pressure should be in the tank. This is not detailed anywhere in the documentation.On to the GOOD (or should I say awesome)!Once set up and running, using it is effortless and so enjoyable -- so effortless I feel guilty.All 3 attachments, (Brad Nailer, Finish Nailer, and Stapler) are super easy to connect and load.The results from each of the three attachments are simply incredible. At the pull of the trigger I went from being a weekend hack to producing professional results. Both nails and staples were completely flush with the wood surface and completely undetectable to the feel.In my operation of all three attachments, there was no jamming, and they all operated flawlessly.Wish listIn the operation of the product, my only real beef is I wish there was an optional set of wheels with locks that could be attached to make it easy to move the compressor around the room one is working on, instead of lifting it.I wish the electrical cord was longer.I wish the hose was longer.I wish the magazine held more ammo. :)I wish the kit included belt clips so you could carry the different attachments with you easily while on a project.I wish I had this during the last round of house repairs and remodeling.I wish I had something else to go work on so I could keep using this brilliant product.Conclusion - in comparison to competing products, I cannot comment; however, if you are looking to move away from a hammer (or a mechanical staple gun), this product will not only deliver results that will make you look like a rock star, but it will preserve your fingers from unfavorable interactions with the business end of a hammer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZD8HA2A7OSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNM60C#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZD8HA2A7OSF","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything you need from the only brand I trust to protect my phones. With the shift of cell carriers subsidizing the cost of phones to now adding the full price to the monthly cell bill, it makes sense to use the best when protecting your smart phone.This has a good matte finish, which helps it not slip out of the hand easily. Obviously an Otterbox case will make the phone fatter in the pocket, but the shell is light, so it's not too heavy in the hand. The scarlet red color isn't too bright -- it's a good rich red tone.Otterbox cases have been successfully protecting my phones on the front lines of life for some years. For this iPhone 6 case, the story is exactly the same -- a great fit, coupled with the best protection you can buy. In addition to the protection, the addition of the extended battery is not only brilliant, but for some, essential, especially for those who are frequently some distance from electricity (campers, hikers etc.). As another reviewer has noted, it seems to take a while to charge up the cover compared to charging the phone directly, but the extended life makes it worthwhile.ProsAmazing physical protectionCharges relatively quicklyStops charging the device when full2600mAh battery extends battery life x 2LED power check statusOnly a smidge bigger then the Defender caseNo camera/flash obstructionCons (not really a con considering the fact that the case is so good and has a battery in it, but worth a mention)The weight - case is 3ozThis case is a perfect option for anyone, but especially a road warrior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5DUX8UD0J5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2QW13G#wasThisHelpful","R1P5DUX8UD0J5W","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In writing this review, I can't compare it to previous experiences with noise cancelling headphones, or anything of a similar quality, but I will list the other products I have owned for the sake of having a point of reference. Additionally it is worth mentioning that I have headphones on most of my working day.The previous two headphones I have owned have been in the $50-$100 range and were thePanasonicRP-HTx7-G1 $50Sennheiser HD 212pro ($100)While I really liked the previous headphones mentioned above, I now realize the gap in quality now that I have the Bose headphones. My review includes the following sections - Audio quality, Build quality, and Comfort.AUDIO QUALITYFirstly, the noise cancelling capabilities are ridiculous (in a great way) . Even without switching on the noise cancellation, the headphones do an amazing job of eliminating sound from around you.  I did 3 tests of the noise reduction without any audio input.#1 beside my tower computer (which has 3 large fans) - result = silence#2 beside my air conditioner - result = silence#3 beside the washing machine and clothes dryer (both running) - result = silenceTo do a fourth test I asked my son to stand in the laundry room with the headphones on while I had the noise cancellation switched off.  Then I turned it on and I watched disbelief and joy sweep across his face, as I am sure it did when I had done this test moments before.Secondly, in relation to the audio reproduction, I wanted to assess the quality in 3 areas - Bass, mids, highs.For the reproduction tests I went to Youtube on my computer for videos with test audio with the search term Headphone test Music.The first test was with the video - ""Sound Test for Beats by Dr.Dre - SkillGamingHDI""This video has a strong bass component but weak mid and highs to speak of.  Despite that, it still does an impressive job of giving the headphones a workout.The second test was ""Bass and surround sound test"" Nice results but I feel the audio itself is not high quality.The 3rd test was ""Beethoven's 9th - Ode To Joy | Dolby Headphone 3D sound from Immortal Beloved HD 5.1"" Gorgeous quality audio source file and gave each range of the headphones a workout, where they all excelled.The 4th test was sorely focused on the low end response and was validated through playing the track ""Ultimate Dubstep Bass Test""Lastly I decided to bring up a favorite artist to reach for extreme bass, while still having a balanced range of mids and highs to assess - for this I listened to Deadmau5  4x4=12 (Continuous Mix) .Since the majority of my daily use is movies and not music I then went to Netflix and looked some movies including some of the most recent releases (for potentially better audio content) to test. Here are the results but remember, results are also dependant on release date.Black Hawk Down - Release date 2001 - Dialogue 9 - Action Sequences 9 - Music 9- Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 9Marvels Daredevil - Release date 2015 - Dialogue 10 - Action Sequences 10 - Music 10 - Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 10The November Man - Release date 2014 - Dialogue 10 - Action Sequences 10 - Music 10 - Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 10Overall a score of 10/10From my LG android phone the audio was not as brilliant, but that is a function of my phone and not the headphonesBUILD QUALITYA typical area of concern for me in headphones is the build quality, especially around any joints or any area that moves.I was delighted to see metal hinges which are embedded in rather thick plastic.  I do not anticipate any breakages in normal use of the product.Fabric covered headband - while this black fabric feels nice  to the touch, I think I would rather leather or another material to reduce the potential for the accumulation of dirt either from hands or hairOverall a score of 10/10COMFORTAgain, for me I wear headphones for many hours a day, so this can be a deal breaker. These fit perfectly, and in no way hurt my ears or present any negative elements from a comfort perspective -  they are a joy to wear.Over all a 20/10PROS AND CONSProsSound qualityBuild QualityComfortIncludes Headphone adapter for inflight entertainment that requires the two prong connectorIncludes a battery so the unit can be completely operational straight out of the boxIncludes and beautiful carry case that accommodates the headphones when they are folded upInline volume and play/pause button for controlling audio on the phoneInline mic for phone calls provides great clarity for the person listening on the other endConsNONE...In conclusion - for me the Bose Quiet Comfort 25 are completely wonderful, and I cannot wait to travel with them on my next flight to enjoy some inflight entertainment - until then, they will be in daily use here at the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XE8494UBOB4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VW7U8X4#wasThisHelpful","R2XE8494UBOB4Q","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has amazing power to get the task done, no matter if it is dust, debris or a liquid spill.Being as powerful as it is and with its size, it has the capacity to take a generous amount of dirt out of the way in a short timeframe without the need to empty it repeatedly in between small tasks. It works brilliantly straight out of the box.Our converted garage flooded during a bout of heavy rain, and this vacuumed up all the water with ease.

I will be interested to see how this is working after 8-12 months of frequent use. The hose is of a completely different grade plastic, and is the area of most concern.The air outlet port causes other dirt and dust not yet vacuumed up to blow all over the place.

"This does a great job and it prevents cursing. No really. Who woulda thought...?So you may look at this product and say to yourself, wait a sec, 12 volts? I'm a professional (or at least want to be seen as one). I need to have nothing less than an 18 volt tool hanging from my belt.Well, think again. Power is not the only consideration, and neither is size. For the longest time I have always thought that way, but this tool changed all that.I already have a Ryobi 18 volt impact driver, but as one might imagine, it is a lot bigger than this Hitatchi. For others out there, the thought ""Oh, let me get another tool that is smaller and less powerful that the one I already own"" may never cross your mind, but consider this:Two days after I took delivery of this product, my car developed a horrid squealing noise. Being the weekend warrior (in my situation, thats code for a frugal tight-fisted individual), I googled the situation and found a video on how to take care of it.To execute the remedy, I was required to lie on my back in the floor space in front of the front passenger seat in the car with my legs sticking out of the car, and work in an incredibly confined space up under the dashboard. When I saw the spot I was going to have to work in, I instantly knew that the larger Ryobi 18 volt impact driver would never fit and it was the perfect opportunity to try the Hitatchi.Not only did the Hitatchi make an easy job of undoing nuts that had never been opened since the car was made (some 10 years ago), but it was the perfect size to allow the driver with the attachment to reach the nuts. It delivers mad power,The icing on the cake is the little LED that illuminates the task at hand so you don't have to use your cell phone or something else to see what you are doing in confined dark places.If you already have an impact driver, it might not be suitable for every application. Having this as a Plan B is a great idea.ProsMad power - this thing is virtually unstoppable.Size - it is smaller and therefore more suitable for a wider range of tasks than larger tools.LED light - pressing the trigger will engage the LED light prior to the driver spinning up.Belt clip - easy to stash the tool on your belt or on your jeansTwo batteries - no need to explain that oneConsNA","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZ4D3IA02ONU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1WOCYS#wasThisHelpful","R2IZ4D3IA02ONU","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this vacuum. I am reviewing it minutes after using it because I am excited about the product and there are so many excellent design features and such creative thinking that went into this vacuum..I have mostly hard wood floors, so right out of the box I decided to give it the harder test of getting the dog hair off the rug in the living room. What a stellar performance.When I started using it I thought there was some obstruction and somehow it was dragging the rug, but no - the suction is just stronger than any other vacuum I have owned (including Dyson). In my attempts to get the dog hair off, it really only needed one pass across the rug instead of the usual two or three passes with the other vacuums -- Eureka and Electrolux.Pros:Power - tremendous suction powerSuction power is adjustable to allow for easy use on longer shag carpetsSize - It is so small and light (despite being very powerful)Easy to detach hand wand for smaller tasksStretch hose for hand wand - ample lengthAnti allergy filterShaft connected to hand wand remains connected to the wand when using the vacuum in a traditional upright vacuum mode, meaning you don't have to attach something else to use in wand modeRotating head for easy maneuverabilityBrush mechanism has an on off switchBaglessMain unit is easily removable from floor attachment making it easier and lighter to carry for spot cleaningIncludes additional small suction-powered carpet headIncludes small-reach narrow head with a brush that moves up the shaft when not in use preventing the loss of the brush attachment. This attachment will work on the hand wand or on the end of the shaft when attached to the hand wand for longer reachFloor head incorporates an obstruction overload mechanism that cuts off power to brushes when it encounters resistance. This prevents motor burnout or any type of damage to the head mechanism when something gets caught in the rotating brushes.Once the overload protection has triggered and the brushes stop rotating, just push the reset button with the tip of a penRed and green indicator lights on the floor head let you know if you are removing a little or a lot of dust in the products operationEmptying the dust bin is easy and quick, and the included small brush for spot cleaning can be used to clean blindsFilter is removable and washableCons: (definitely not a deal breaker or enough to remove anything from its 5-star rating)The angle at which the small suction-powered carpet attachment best meets the floor can not be changed, requiring one to be quite close to the floor to get the maximum use from it.In closing, this is a brilliant vacuum. The amount of dirt it holds before being emptied is less (1.5l) than larger vacuums, thus making it perfect for small residences - or (and probably more healthy) it just makes you empty after each use.Get one - you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2JI40U86CPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDRI#wasThisHelpful","R1C2JI40U86CPJ","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is seriously the best shaver I have ever owned. I have had many electric shavers over the years, and I'm comparing this to my most recent ones -- the Panasonic ES-LT41-K Arc3 Electric Razor Wet/Dry and the Remington Lithium Powered Rotary Shaver XR1340GOLF.Pros:It gets really really close without any skin irritation or burning sensation.I like the weight and size of the product and how it feels to hold.Looks nice in the charging baseComes with a travel bagHas a travel lock preventing accidental power on while in transitGood for use internationally with 120/240Comb attachment to trim your beardIn terms of a close shave, it is better than the Panasonic and way way better than the Remington rotary shaver.Cons: (Not deal breakers (because the shave is so close) but worth mentioning)There should be a clearer indicator that when fully charged it displays the remaining minutes (60) rather than % charged.When the charge cable is in, it does not go fully in and has the appearance that there is something wrong or something stuck in the socket.There are 3 rows of shave heads and the two outside shave heads are for longer hairs and the inside middle row is for short hairs. This means when you have a goatee, the skin closest to the goatee hair will only ever be reached by the longer hair row.  In my mind, it would be better if one of the outside rows was another short hair row, thus enabling you to turn around the shaver so the shorter hair blades can get in there.You cannot charge it without the base. It is something extra that I have to bring when travelling, and if I lose or forget it, I cannot charge without buying another base.In closing, it does a great job at the one thing it is supposed to do. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8M20WDO9YWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGQR8X6#wasThisHelpful","RM8M20WDO9YWU","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:-This curtain blocks out the light really well. I used a curtain rod that lets the curtain wrap around the sides, and from outside, with all the lights on, it looked like the lights were off.- Curtain has Velcro tabs that you can stick to the wall on the sides and bottom if you really want to make sure it seals against the wall.- Color is pretty accurate which is nice. I've received a few curtains from Amazon where the color didn't match the picture at all.Cons:- It definitely has a ""you might see this curtain at grandma's"" old lady pattern to it. This makes it hard to make it look good in any room in my house.I can't really comment on energy saving, since that would take quite a while to have evidence of and it's not particularly hot or cold outside right now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LB47KOX7ES10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXMZHB2#wasThisHelpful","R1LB47KOX7ES10","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The visual appeal and design of the product makes it one you are proud to have on the countertop. The quality is what you would expect in a professional kitchen.Once it is in one of its pre-programmed cycles, it slows down to allow more of the items to sink in the liquid (to make sure they are reached by the blades) and then it speeds up again.

"I am not a video expert, but I do shoot some video, and this product is a smashing addition to your rig, even if you don't shoot often. I just ran a field test with my Canon 5D Mark III and a Rode shotgun microphone.I have never owned anything like the Tascam DR-60Dmkii, so my review is centered around how using it improves shooting with a mic that just goes into the camera.For the biggest test I did, I went to a fairly busy boat slip on the river to see how it would handle audio from a distance. I have to say I was astonished.For this test, I was filming from around 60 feet from the boat slip, and I got audio I would never get without this.In the playback I discovered amazing audio for the following:The sound of the hand crank gears as the boat was pulled up onto the trailer.The owner's wet sneaker twisting on the metal of the trailer while hoisting the boat up the trailer.All associated sounds with getting off the trailer and getting into the truck.The engine starting and being put into gear.The tires on the wet boat ramp.The individual drops of water falling to the asphalt from the boat as it left the water and continued up the ramp.I have used the Rode microphone on its own before and it's 'good,', but when you are shooting HD like the 5D Mark III captures, I have come to realize that going with 'good enough' on the audio is a shame. Without the Tascam, I would never have had enough reach with the Rode microphone to get all the additional details in the recordings I made.So that's the first part about what I find impressive.

"If you are reading this, buy one today. :) Completely stunning results from this Pioneer subwoofer.I must admit I am surprised that this, being the best sub I have ever owned, that it is a Pioneer. It's not that I think they make bad products, but it's not the first maker to spring to mind if I think of top-of-the-line audio components.The 4 subs I have owned in the past include brands like Jensen and Polk Audio, and in the past, when selecting components, I will admit I had typically been swayed by the ""bigger is better"" school of thought. The Jensen I was using before putting the Pioneer into my surround sound rig has a speaker that is 2 inches larger, but the Pioneer out-performed by a long shot.My home theater components include an Onkyo receiver and 4 Yamaha tower speakers, along with a Polk Audio center channel and a Polk center rear. Side by side with all the other subs I own, this appears to have all the same controls and features. but the difference is in the quality of the bass and that fact that no matter what level I set it to, there is simply no distortion.ProsUnapologetic deep, deep wood floor and pant-leg-shaking bassNo distortion - just powerful performanceConsThe blue status light on the front of the sub: Needless to say, one can tape over it or turn the sub 90 degrees to the left or right so it is not visible. Many people probably wouldn't care, but when I watching a movie, I don't want any visual distractions.In closing, if you have the money and have only had subs that cost less than $599 in the past, then I suggest this sub as a delicious upgrade to your existing home theater setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZH0VCESN6P6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQES9UQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZH0VCESN6P6R","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll spare you on the plot details, as so many other reviewers have done that already.This was a good read -- well-written, paced plot with rising action, satisfactory ending. Flanders has a self-deprecating sense of humor that she weaves through everything, which adds to the amusement of her MC's foibles.I found the MC's constant perspectives on things she came across as annoying a lot of the time. Most of them had nothing to do with the plot, and it felt as if Flanders was filling pages much of the time. Granted, they helped develop her MC, but if I had a free pass to sit in a room and listen to the rambling thoughts of a middle-aged woman, I'd pass immediately.Another annoyance was the number of characters in the story line --far to many to keep track of.Overall, though, I'd recommend it as a good read.

"Fits snugly around my 5D Mark III with one exception - not when the extended battery grip is on.This would be a 5 star rating if it accommodated having the battery grip on there too. It just bunches up when you try to use the thumbwheel on the grip to secure the item in place, and then the skin no longer fits snugly. I would have to take an Exacto knife to it if I want to use it when the grip is on there too.Since it doesn't claim it will include the grip, it does what it's supposed to do -- protect the camera body. It fits well and is very usable, as long as you remember what all the buttons are for, since you can no longer see them (or at least, I can't).Sometimes the buttons take a little extra effort to activate, but I can't imagine a product of this nature for which that is not true.In summary - if you don't have the extended battery grip then you are golden - get it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YV14WB2EO7FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FUZ06G#wasThisHelpful","R1YV14WB2EO7FF","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a more affordable backlit keyboard than most, and comes with 6 programmable keys x 3 banks (so 18 keys in total), but when typing it does strange things.When using the CTRL key to navigate entire words in a sentence, it jumps around a bit further than you might be used to.

"This is a brilliant product. For my review: I have it connected to my Sony Bravia 42"" TV with a wired Internet speed of 115 mbps download and 11 mbps upload, as well as having it hooked up to a 7.1 surround sound.I was able to download games I already had got through PlayStation Plus that connected to Steam for free, and was able to download and play them in minutes.Compared to a larger gaming tower, this won't deliver the same experience; however, for a living room gaming platform/PC, the performance is beyond any current platform.Pros:It's fairly to set up, but I would recommend using a keyboard to speed things up.Boots into exclusive user interface that overlays Windows 8, giving a clean experience while protecting the system (if used by young kids)Different user accounts for different family members/roommatesComes with Windows 8.1 and can be used as a PCThe ability to perform traditional Web-based functions on your HDTV in high qualityGames like Minecraft, RuneScape, Maple Story, etc. run very well and fast at the highest quality. I also had YouTube streaming in the background for music, which didn't produce any extra lag for drop in fpsIt comes with a controller.True 1080p quality on any gamePC gaming on the TV without having to move in a computer beside the TVAble to stream Hulu in Windows 8.1 (Playstation and other Internet-enabled devices only work with Hulu Plus)Quad core i5 3GHz, 1TB drive, 8 gigs of ram, Custom Nvidia Maxwell GTX GPU 2gb videocard.Both CPU and Ram upgrades are possible, in addition to adding more hard drive space.WiFi and wired Internet speeds (when wired, getting full 115mbps speed versus a max speed of 42mpbs on the PlayStation 3)The ability to use a keyboard and mouse if you feel the need for more keysIt has a very small footprint.It is extremely quiet.ConsThe Xbox controller it comes with requires AA batteries. A PS3 controller is much more practical.The first game I played through Steam (metro: last light running at 1920x1080 resolution and quality very high) produced a great experience for 20-30 seconds ... until the fps shot down to about 5-9.Also, if the volume on the desktop has been muted, it will mute all volume inside the alpha ui overlay. So if another user was using the unit as a desktop and the next user booted/launched the UI and tried to play a game, they may not know to go back to the Windows 8 environment to un-mute.**I was most excited to play Medal of Honor again after about  a 10 year gap, and while it is on Steam, it's not a console game. The Steam store that runs through the alpha user interface would show the game to me as buy-able, and I would have thought that since this is a PC, Steam would detect that this is a PC with a keyboard and allow me to buy and play. I exited the Alpha UI and found the game through the Steam app was available for purchase, just not through the Alpha UI.In summary, the PS3 which was the main source for all things that entertained us, and it has barely been turned on since. The alpha is perfect for someone looking for a PC/console hybrid and doesn't want to buy both.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy a console and computer -- for $550-$900 it's a steal. Perfect for a dorm room or  a house where light computing requirements exist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HYN2CWG3YZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7AFDI#wasThisHelpful","R18HYN2CWG3YZA","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous featuring, great design and really good shaverUPDATE - Rating Changed & additional details added. See below...UPDATED Summary. I only use it if nothing else is charged or available, or I need to shave while in transit. My suggestion would be to forgo the stylish looks, the 3 month subscription to the magazine, and get something with less 'makeup' and more time in the gym.ORIGINAL *****************As the title states, the shave from this product is really good for an electric shaver. In this review I will compare it to the Philips Norelco AT830/46 4500, the Panasonic EX-LT41-K Arc3 and a Gillette Mach3 razor.Having an everyday functional product that is gorgeous to look at is not necessarily a true feature or benefit. Having said that, this product is completely gorgeous, and seated in its brilliant stand, it just has a luxurious look to it. Even though it is designed with golf in mind, its lines and colors make me think more of F1 racing, which adds to the appeal.ProsDesign, design, design. I actually want to bring it to the studio and shoot it as a product project for my portfolio.While not the best shave (compared to a blade), it is a very good shave.Fastest shave yet from an electric shaverEasy to cleanBarely irritates my skin - definitely less than other rotary heads (all rotary heads irritate my skin)Drain hole in base of standRuns really quiet, which I prefer in a family home with just one bathroom.Fabulous looking charging stand (makes me think of a segway)Comes with a great carry case that should fit all toiletries on a tripConsIn my experience, none that are unique to rotary head shavers - just not as close as a blade or pivoting head and irritates my skin a little (possibly that could be the fact that this was the first shave with this product, and after my skin adjusts to it after using a blade for so long, that might no longer be an issue).The last item of note is not a con, just a preference, and that is I would prefer the beard trimmer to be a bit wider. It does a great job right now, just a bit wider would cover more ground faster.Summary - If I had to get a rotary shaver, this would be the one to buy.UPDATE *******************You only get one chance to make a first impression but sometimes that impression isn't the whole picture.Ok - whatever good impressions I had about this shaver from the first few times I used it - I wouldn't say I was wrong in what I wrote based on those interactions, however I have new information stemming from later usage of the shaver.After about 5 uses I went to have a shave one day. When I started using it, I felt the shaver actually pulling hairs as they were getting caught in the rotary mechanism while I was shaving.My initial reaction was, 'I must have forgotten to charge it.'  I placed the unit in the base and came back to it a few hours later when the led indicator showed that it was fully charged.Same thing again, pulling hairs.  I have always thought the shaver sounded (based on every other shaver I have owned) like the battery was nearing the end of its usefulness. Think of your current electric shaver and when you are using it, that sound while shaving from a fully charged battery is a 5.  Well this shaver sounds like its at about a 2. It sounds like what I would imagine a toy shaver might sound like so its safe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0JO425JNK5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBZQ6YA#wasThisHelpful","RK0JO425JNK5T","A3M7BCQKSQAK4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M7BCQKSQAK4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a Wonderful Life is annually shown on various networks around Christmas, suggesting that it's reserved for that time of year. Really, I think it's a movie that's appealing for any time of the year. What's really important is its prevailing message. James Stewart and Donna Reed are stellar in this timeless classic.

"Okay, this is a 4 star (well, 3.5) review of an album from one of my favorite bands of all time. I give it lukewarm praise, because this album solidified the commercial direction the band was taking, which is something I didn't embrace. Blue Oyster Cult is not a commercial band, let's face it. Their first 3 albums are masterpieces, with a sound all their own. I don't know of any other band that has such a unique sound to their music that can't be duplicated. Spectres followed the successful Agents of Fortune from a year earlier; 'Agents' hinted of a forthcoming commercial sound, but was still rooted in their earliest sound. With Spectres, it's apparent that the band wanted more of the mainstream. The opening track, GODZILLA is a concert favorite, but I don't see what's so good about it.  It's rather bland and unimaginative. The rest of the tracks don't hover much above mediocrity. Still, Spectres is to be respected for its experimentation. Their next album, Mirrors is even more experimental, but resonates a tad more for me, as the songs on that album are a bit more sophisticated. Spectres is still essential to own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QG1YIVDU3SOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O5MNJO#wasThisHelpful","R1QG1YIVDU3SOS","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small space heater features two settings (750 and 1500 watts) which provide plenty of heat for any modest space in the home or office. This is a fan-forced heater with a thermostat. On the lowest thermostat setting, the fan will kick on and off very frequently, so it's a good idea to have it set on the highest setting initially to heat up the room to avoid this. This unit also has a safety mechanism that shuts off the heater when knocked over. Finally, I like the top handle for ease of carrying, instead of the very common handle-less heaters out there. This product is of very good quality, as it's durable, and can therefore withstand moderate wear and tear.

"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is just about on the level of 2 and 3 (mediocrity), which basically is a mediocre movie with surprisingly few scares. Yes, Freddy is in top form here, but that's the only real highlight. I'm not a big fan of excessive special effects in horror movies, either. In some ways, this feels like a sci-fi movie. If you're going to make a horror film, keep the lasers to a minimum! Also, this movie gives John Carpenter's The Thing a run for its money when it comes to the gore. And if you like 80's music (I do for the most part), this movie provides plenty, along with the 'big hair.'

"This contemporary-look version of the classic of classics game Clue still has that nostalgic feel when played. The game that requires some skill (not recommended for kids under 6, in my opinion), due to the process of elimination in solving a crime, is a household (or mansion) name in board games. For those who've played this game many times, it's all too common to cut to the chase when naming a suspect, room, and weapon when making a suggestion or accusation; the condensed way of saying it is (for example): ""Mustard, Ballroom, Wrench."" We've all done this at one time or another, to save time. Overall, Clue is a fun game, not just for its simplicity, but also for the curiosity it generates, because we all want to know ""who done it.""

"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 has Freddy taking on many forms (which is interesting), but this movie feels more like sci-fi than horror. Furthermore, the creators should've made up their minds as to what direction they wanted to go in terms of darkness; this movie yanks us back and forth between darkness and lightness. While there are some memorable scary moments in this movie, there aren't enough to keep your interest for a 98 minute movie. Finally, this movie has the feel and look (at times) of two very famous horror films (The Shining, The Thing 1982) in terms of special effects. This third installment in the series is just as inferior as the second, and just as unnecessary. This movie is simply a special effects extravaganza, and distracting at that.  The plot vehicle (dreams becoming real) is unique for the horror genre, but unfortunately the acting is subpar in supporting it. Overall, this movie is very mediocre, as it doesn't capture the imagination like the first movie. Here, the imagination is handed to us via all of the 'goodies.'

This movie is lacking in imagination, attributable to it being rushed into theaters not even a full year after its predecessor. This was to jump on the bandwagon of 80's slasher films competing with each other. If more time and care went into the production of this movie, it would've probably been more appealing. This movie is surprisingly not scary, and doesn't have much darkness to it. I don't recommend this movie for those seeking a real scare; you're better off with the first movie, or one of the early Halloween movies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CCD39TQP4OHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0780630858#wasThisHelpful","R2CCD39TQP4OHO","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This iPhone charger certainly does its job of charging, but not without some concerns. First, the charger becomes very warm to the touch, even shortly after you plug it in to charge the iPhone. Second, (and this is a safety concern), the two prongs have broken off and got stuck in the wall outlet. When this happened, I had to throw the charger away, and removed the prongs with a non-conducting tool, as this poses a safety concern due to the potential of electric shock. I just wish Apple would make a more durable and safer charger in the future.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DR70C9U0HZN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P374NKS#wasThisHelpful","R1DR70C9U0HZN0","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this treadmill for 7 months now, and use it daily. As long as you properly maintain it (cleaning around motor components and underneath the belt), it shouldn't require any significant repairs. There are warranty options, and I chose a one year warranty that covers everything. What I like most about this treadmill is its versatility; I feel like this is a much above average product that doesn't break the bank. There are several nice features that enhance the whole workout experience. I like the workout programs that it offers, but find myself inventing my own programs. Furthermore, though standard on most treadmills these days, I really like the heart rate grips that you can utilize to chart where you're at from a cardio fitness standpoint. Oh, and I love being able to plug in my iPod to listen to music while I work out! This treadmill has speakers for those who don't want to use their own ear buds. A safety key is used to power on the machine after plugging it in, so the machine doesn't run if the key isn't used, which is good if you have small curious children. And electrical usage? I'm smiling at the fact that this unit doesn't use that much electricity. I've found the belt to be a tad squeaky in the summer months (owing to humidity), so don't let this deter you into thinking there's some sort of mechanical failure. As long as you lube it on schedule, it will perform at an optimal level. If there's one thing about this unit that is lacking, it's the inferior performing fan, which emits very little air. But hey, isn't it all about sweating? I recommend this treadmill for its quality and value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKXQKW3PZFZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090X04EA#wasThisHelpful","R2RKXQKW3PZFZL","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pippi Longstocking (1969) was released in late 1973 in the U.S., after being successful in Europe. The voices of the actors had to be dubbed over in English, which easily shows in the out of sync talking in relation to mouth movement. While mildly annoying, it doesn't take away from the movie itself, as this first installment is worthy of praise. Pippi and her new friends seek one adventure after another, and the overall tone is cheerful and the mischief is playful. I overlook the almost laughable special effects (such as when Pippi lifts her horse, or when she lofts her tormentor into a tree), because a movie like this doesn't need the best effects to be good, and the obvious fact that this movie was made in the late 1960's. Overall, this movie is fun, and recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UAKAEM9451N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A0GYB4#wasThisHelpful","R30UAKAEM9451N","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Filles De Kilimanjaro (1969) continues Miles' experimentation with electronic instruments, though still not the full-blown fusion of In a Silent Way or Bitches Brew. Here, were treated to a post bop sound with fusion, resulting in a very unique, much more subtle sound than its predecessor, Miles in the Sky. I can't help but think of myself sitting in a hotel lounge and enjoying these songs, as they have that feel and sound to them. The title track steals the show, with electric bass that moves the song. The song itself is very elegant, and the bass adds the final accent, giving it real presence. Filles De Kilimanjaro is absolutely essential for any Miles fan, or jazz fan for that matter; it's an often overlooked masterpiece of groundbreaking fusion elements. The bonus track (Tout De Suite) is a slightly longer version of the original. Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ZT8GCMDJYOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006GO9K#wasThisHelpful","R24ZT8GCMDJYOS","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first listen, Miles in the Sky (1968) is a tough album to digest, because it's purely transitional, with post bop elements, rock beats, avant garde, and ultimately fusion permeating its unique sound. The songs have a groove to them, dominated by its drumming. Brassy, electric, acoustic- it's a little bit of everything. However, it all makes sense as you listen a second or third time, because it has a uniqueness all its own.  I purchased this album in order to truly appreciate a band that was evolving into what would be called 'fusion' a few releases later, with In a Silent Way. I wouldn't put Miles in the Sky in my top 5 Davis albums, but it's still essential to one's collection as a groundbreaking gem. 9/10","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6G14ZRQ1NHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMWEI#wasThisHelpful","R1E6G14ZRQ1NHE","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, let's face it: this group made an indelible impression in rock history with their 17 minute masterpiece of psychedelic rock, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. A one hit wonder? Yes, but a sustainability unmatched by no other one hit wonder, as this song is still played quite a lot today. Iron Butterfly hung around for a few more years, but weren't able to match the success and nostalgia of this album. The other five tracks on this album are respectable, and definitely worth a listen, though greatly overshadowed by the title track, which is presented in long form, live, and single form. Overall, this is essential 60's acid/psychedelic rock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YTJ719WUA93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002IAO#wasThisHelpful","R18YTJ719WUA93","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twin Peaks- Fire Walk With Me (1992) isn't a whole lot like the TV series of a few years earlier, though it has the general tone and feel of the series. Here, the characters are a lot more mysterious and dark, and the plot is more complex. At times, the plot is hard to follow, but at least the viewer knows that there's a mystery to solve. This movie offers objects of interest, much in the manner of a later movie (Mulholland Dr.), in order to try to piece things together. This movie is sort of hypnotic in its approach and delivery; Laura Palmer is thrust into a strange world, taking the audience with her. Overall, this is vintage David Lynch at work; a movie that begs for answers to strange happenings. I must say that the critics were harsh with their ratings of this movie, as it's certainly way better than the panning it took.  I recommend this underrated movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A90I73CYUEDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000056BP1#wasThisHelpful","R1A90I73CYUEDL","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***** This review contains spoilers. Love Story (1970) stars Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal as a free-spirited couple that goes through trials and tribulations (Oliver's poor relationship with his demanding father, and Jennifer's fatal illness), but their love for each other is eternal. While watching this movie, I could just feel the intensity of each scene, as if it's so real, rather than the sometimes unrealistic love that is found in some Hollywood movies. Ali MacGraw gives the performance of a lifetime as a sharp-tongued vivacious and very comical young woman, and carries this throughout the whole film, as if nothing can crush her spirit. This movie has a tragic ending, which makes the average person want a happy ending (due to the loveability of Jennifer), but if that somehow happened, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is. In a sense, we the audience have to get on board when it comes to the sad ending and endure the frustration if we are to appreciate what a true love story is really about. Casting MacGraw was the perfect choice, as well as O'Neal; they seem to have the perfect chemistry on screen. The prevailing message of ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" is very powerful here, and used perfectly. The special features are good, too. Love Story is one of the greatest movies of all time, and certainly in my top 10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDA9355V5QGV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFYK5M#wasThisHelpful","RDA9355V5QGV2","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca (1940) is Hitch's American debut, and it doesn't disappoint. It takes quite some time for things to get going plot-wise, but it's worth the wait. This is a movie that has excellent cinematography and direction, similar to another film of that time period, Citizen Kane. It also has similar music to Citizen Kane, or better yet, Citizen Kane has similar music to Rebecca, as that movie came out a year later. Joan Fontaine is perfectly cast as the second wife, and reminds me of Ingrid Bergman and even Kim Novak. The overall feel and effect of the premise of the movie is subtle and slow-moving, but nevertheless effective. It helps that this movie is in black and white, because that tone brings out its underlying darkness. While this movie isn't anywhere near my favorite Hitch movie, it is still very recommended, despite the sacrifice one must make with the slower pace that is reflective of the time period. The special features are excellent and plentiful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCI5XV5BZOXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001D8W7EU#wasThisHelpful","R1XCI5XV5BZOXN","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black Christmas (1974) is a good horror movie that provides some real chills and edge-of-your seat moments. In some ways, this movie reminds me of the Halloween 1978 movie, as the telephone is a prominent feature. Furthermore, it has the teenybopper/young adult element. This movie also has a few notable actors (Margot Kidder and Keir Dullea) who bring some balance and credibility. Casting Dullea seems Keir-oius, as it's a bit surprising that he would accept a role in a B type of movie after he found mainstream success in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If anything, it's noble that he didn't think that being in this movie was beneath him. Overall, Black Christmas is somewhat of an acquired taste, as it has cheesiness alongside some very serious moments. All things considered, this is a good movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUVVFLR0GOCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IMUYJM#wasThisHelpful","RVUVVFLR0GOCF","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking is the ideal family movie; it features Tami Erin as the nonchalant, spunky redheaded girl who can touch a nerve or two with those she meets. This movie is a sometimes forgotten gem, because this film franchise has actually done better overseas in terms of box office gross, but still resonates in the U.S. This is the prototypical G-rated movie, in that it can appeal to a wide audience. I remember my first ever movie attended at the theater was a Pippi Longstocking movie (in the mid-seventies), and enjoyed it. Years later, it's nice to see a mild resurgence of this neat little character. I recommend this as a good family movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJ4M2QVMS141/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000059H76#wasThisHelpful","R2PJ4M2QVMS141","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Under Siege (1992) stars Steven Seagal, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Busey, who take this movie to another level of edge-of-your-seat action. Erika Eleniak is the perfect supporting actress, and with all action movies, there's a lady to complement the hero. With a plot that flows and is easy to follow, you are thrust right into it from the get-go. Though a bit predictable at times (as most action movies are), it still immensely entertains and leaves one wanting more. Under Siege is a movie that has many thrills and humor thrown in; the critics say that it's ""Die Hard on a ship"", but I think it's worthy of its own identity, and one of the best action movies of all time. Steven Seagal has all the right moves and one-liners for an unforgettable movie experience. The picture and sound are crisp for this blu-ray, too. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBXC02NHFYOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JLPMPI#wasThisHelpful","R3CBXC02NHFYOC","A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
