"At some point during Star Wars, Luke Skywalker's story evolves from his individual quest and struggle to being part of the Revolution as he dons a pilot's uniform and joins a squadron of star fighters battling The Empire.  It works.In Mocking Jay, Katniss Everdeen battles not in an Arena for her individual life, but joins the Rebel Army in District 13, first as a rally-symbol (the Mockingjay) and later as infantry when the rebels make their final assault on the Capital of Panem.  It doesn't work as well.The author was better at portraying the individual combat in the Arenas in the first two books than she was at fitting Katniss into a larger enterprise.  I thought the battle scenes were not as clear in my mind in this book as the very engrossing pictures she painted of the individual contest zones in Books 1 and 2.  The Rebel headquarters seemed awfully small, as did the population, for it to be successful in battling President Snow's army and rallying the other districts to an uprising.  It just didn't work as well for me.Not that this book isn't interesting and worth the time.  If you enjoyed Books 1 and 2, this is fairly enjoyable and carries forward the themes of what freedom means as well as the relationship between the individual and the state.  The love triangle is also brought to a conclusion and loose ends are tied up and resolved.  Readers are introduced to a heretofore unknown District 13 population that has checkmated the Capital since the revolt seventy years before.  Hidden from the rest of the country, Katniss' rebelliousness and connection with the oppressed citizens of Panem as a result of her success in the Hunger Games sparks an uprising that allows the District 13 forces to literally come out of their holes and fan the flames of a budding uprising.Katniss is largely a spectator to that process in the first part of the book.  Anointed the Mockingjay, she is used as a propaganda symbol to rally rebels to the cause.  She continues to struggle with Gale and Peeta and what each means to her as well as her place in her new world for most of this book.While the book is entertaining in parts, there is much less action (save for the final chapters) and more pondering than in the first two parts of the series.  Still, the author does successfully broaden the themes that span her first two efforts and conclude the story with surprises and plot turns that do make it overall a satisfying experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANU6TSRWLVRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439023513#wasThisHelpful","R3ANU6TSRWLVRW","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Nicholas Sparks book, though I have seen a few of the movies made from his work.Overall, I liked the book.  I thought he did a fine job of capturing the reactions of two kids to the breakup of their family, as well as the daughter's coming of age occurrences over the course of a summer.  Being a Dad, I also liked the way he portrayed Steve, the Dad, who is struggling to remake himself as well as deal with his grave illness.Ronnie, the seventeen year old daughter who is at the center of the story, arrives at her father's beachfront home under protest.  She's almost eighteen, just a few months away from not having to be ordered to spend time with a parent she feels abandoned by and is angry at.  This book is the story of Ronnie discovering Ronnie and confronting her reality.  She is aided in this process of realization as she interacts with the youth in her Dad's town, confronts her abandoned gift of music she shares with her Dad, and grows to appreciate her Dad and the finality that his grave illness confronts her with.Other characters such as the outcast local girl Blaze, her ne'er-do-well boyfriend Marcus, the town's chief hoodlum, and new boyfriend Will provide the personalities and situations that enable Ronnie to move beyond attitude and embrace her future as well as her past.  The Marcus/Blaze/Will line was well-done and I thought (from the distant perch of a parent's perspective), portrayed some of the challenges faced by youth in sorting out love, peer pressure, fitting-in and rebelliousness in an interesting and believable manner.This book was a quick read, with good characters, believable situations and as Nicholas Sparks apparently does well, heart-wrenching situations and occurrences that must be faced by the main characters as the story heads towards its bitter-sweet end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IB42PWUUTHUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446570966#wasThisHelpful","R2IB42PWUUTHUR","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One hopes that ""Escape from Camp 14"" acts like a clarion call in the night and motivates the world to address the sustained evil that is the Kim Family's North Korea.While Hitler's Concentration Camps lasted no longer than the twelve years of his ""Thousand Year Reich,"" North Korean concentration camps are reaching their sixty year mark.  That time, along with the original Kim's dictum that enemies of the state should have ""three generations of their seed removed"" from his fiefdom means that there are thousands of Koreans who have been born - indeed bred - in concentration camps and know nothing of life outside the wire.So it was with Shin Dong-hyuk, the product of a father who was awarded a wife and allowed (as all prisoners so rewarded are allowed) to spend five nights a year with his bride.  Shin was the offspring of that arranged pairing and literally never new anything except guards, beating, privation and work from his earliest years.  Enrolled in ""school"" until his mid-teens, Shin's schooling consisted for the majority of the time of work in the camp at various chores.  Rudimentary Korean letters and math were provided, but he grew to maturity literally not knowing anything about the outside world.  He never heard of China, the United States, South Korea or had any context at all in which to compare his bleak world.  He knew only guards who were in total charge of his life and his class of prisoners who were his competitors for food and the other necessities of survival.So thoroughly controlled by the camp system, Shin witnessed the killing of a six year old classmate over five kernels of corn, turned in his fellow students for infractions, participated in beatings of his classmates as he was beaten - and knew no remorse, guilt or feelings.  Kim even turned his mother and older brother into the guards when they talked of escape, furious that their efforts would lead to his execution under the assumption that he would have known of their plans (he was arrested and tortured anyway, as the guard he tattled to failed to inform his superiors that Shin was the one who exposed the escape attempt).  Kept in a perpetual state of exhaustion and starvation, clad in rags and subject to the beatings and humiliations of the lowliest guard at anytime for any reason, Shin was an animal reduced to thinking constantly of survival.By luck he met a political prisoner who had served North Korea abroad before running afoul of the regime and who was able to paint a world outside the wire for Shin.  Even luckier, Shin and his friend concocted an absurd escape plan that gained for Shin his freedom when his friend's body hung on the electric wire of their camp fence and Shin was able to climb over it to the world outside.Blaine Hardin has written a thin, but powerful and necessary book chronicling Shin's experience and escape to and adjustment in the West.  He intersperses Shin's story with facts and descriptions of life in North Korea and the camp system that keeps hundreds of thousands of North Korean's behind wire and struggling daily to avoid death from starvation, execution, beating, overwork, the amusement of jailers and/or neglect.  It is truly a fascinating glimpse into a world rarely seen by the outside and about which few specifics are known.North Korea is truly a bizarre place that has seen organized evil practiced on its citizens by a small, ruling clique.  The government deserves to be overthrown by whatever means that could be accomplished and these North Koreans deserve the world's sympathy and attention.  Blaine Hardin by this book and the gripping story of Shin Dong-hyuk has hopefully made that needed attention more likely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DRW3GP2BJG99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670023329#wasThisHelpful","R2DRW3GP2BJG99","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very fine history that fills in the life story of a famous American event that is known to many but not known in detail.The debate over John Brown - Freedom Fighter or terrorist or both? - will remain one of the touchstones of discourse regarding his time.  This fine book by Tony Horwitz does not seek to answer the question.  What it does is provide a well written history of the man, his Kansas activities and the Harper's Ferry raid that bears his name.Fans of Tony Horwitz may be surprised that this book carries none of the witty asides found in his ""Confederates in the Attic"", ""Blue Latitudes,"" ""Baghdad Without a Map,"" or any of his other works (at least those known to me).  In those books, Horwitz has a bit of Bryson in him, mixing travel, history, tidbits and witticisms.  This book is a straight history, and well done.Brown is a fascinating figure.  Wedded entirely to abolitionism and one of the few willing to advance the cause with action as well as thought, Brown's single minded focus consumed his life and that of his family.  He was an early immigrant to Kansas, to counter the Border Ruffian immigrants seeking to turn the territory into a Slave state.  Brown had his first taste of blood there in reprisal for pro-slavery raids on free-staters.  His actions spawned a national recognition earning for him the nickname Osawatomie Brown (for the battle there as well as using the area as a base for his raids).His life work culminated as a planned thrust into ""Africa"" as he termed the slave holding South.  Brown recruited men, materials and money and formed his raiding party, only thirty some strong, intent on seizing the federal armory at Harper's Ferry, Virginia.  He sought to provoke a slave uprising, and - as he stated to his followers - create a great guerrilla army that would operate in the mountainous regions around the Shenandoah, spreading south and eventually rooting slavery from its base.His plan was that of a starry-eyed zealot, his tactics and execution lacking of military thought or continued action once implemented.  Personally fearless and unflappable, and with a commanding presence, he was unable to translate those qualities into effective action.  Sitting in the Harper's Ferry armory after successfully taking it, Brown dawdled, faced a growing militia from the town and outlying areas and was quickly overrun by US Marines led by Robert E. Lee (then Col.) and J.E.B. Stuart (then Lt.)Brown's trial was swift and his execution soon followed.  He did have enough time, as well as a rapt audience eager to hear from this man, to explain and write with great moral clarity about his cause and his motivations for action. He succeeded in galvanizing focus on slavery and its evils as well as the willingness of a righteous man to take action against what abolitionists (and even others uncomfortable with the institution) saw as a great cancer on our democracy.Horowitz addresses the tantalizing question of whether or not Brown in his own mind wanted to succeed with his stated military plan.  Or, the author contemplates, did he see his raid as a useful focal point; destined to succeed in bringing on the great question of slavery in our country and its path to extinction by failing and forcing the South to defend with arms and the legal system America's 'peculiar institution.' We cannot know for sure, but Horowitz does a fine job framing the question in this very good history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDWJ0FZGF2JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080509153X#wasThisHelpful","R2UDWJ0FZGF2JF","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Besides being an interesting and mysterious serial killer story, ""The Monster of Florence"" impressed me most with an understanding of the protections those accused of crimes in the United States take for granted. Certainly the Italian system where prosecutors have much more power to hold suspects and power over the appeals process leaves a lot to be desired in terms of civil liberties.Over a twenty year period ending in the mid-1980's parking and necking - the common culmination of early dates - had been a deadly amorous activity in the countryside outside of Florence, Italy. A killer or killers had murdered a number of couples out at night on lonely lanes. The police could not crack the case, though numerous suspects came and went over a period of years.An American author met Italian journalist Mario Spezi (who had been doggedly tracking the case) and became captured by the mystery. The two set out to investigate and themselves came under suspicion by Italian authorities who by all accounts were deeply embarrassed by their failure to solve the crime or even come up with a good theory of who was committing these crimes against passion. With Spezi jailed, the focus of the book becomes the Italian justice system, where rights are enjoyed not as enshrined in our Constitution but by the sufferance of the state.This is two tales in one; the murder story and the investigation of the same; and, the byzantine travel through the Italian justice system as a suspect.I thought the book was enjoyable and informative, though uneven in parts. All in all, an ok read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0UPZXBUYEBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UYV1PQ#wasThisHelpful","R3K0UPZXBUYEBJ","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not usually a literature guy (preferring non-fiction and popular novels), but I read this because it is a classic and I wanted to experience Hemingway beyond my high school reading of ""The Old Man and the Sea."" (and honestly, because while dating my wife she revealed this as one of her favorite books and that aroused my curiosity.)This is a story that deals with the larger questions of life (and essential truths) and man's place in the world or at least in a challenging situation.  So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature ""literature"" a while ago.Protagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.  A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack.  While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.Thus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.Hemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field.  His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur).  I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TX4GC9HEL5KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684830485#wasThisHelpful","R1TX4GC9HEL5KQ","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Genghis Khan is one of those figures from the past who is widely known but most don't know much more about him than his name and reputation as one of the great ravagers of history.Jack Weatherford has described the world and empire of Genghis Khan in this wonderful book that I found enjoyable and very well written.  The story of ""The Great Khan"" is remarkable.  He rose and lifted a people who were backward, remote and possessing few resources to a dominant position in  Asia and astride the great trade routes of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.  Weatherford demonstrates how the hardened Mongols (who eked out a living in very demanding environment) possessing fierceness, horse skills and ability to live off the land and operate fluidly and with mobility, became master empire builders when wedded to one of history's gifted leaders.Weatherford describes Genghis Khan's life and generalship of the empire but also the methods and management of that empire during its rise and rule.  It is a fascinating story that leaves the reader with a very full picture of the Mongol nation and Genghis' leadership.  Let's face it, if Genghis Khan is known at all it is as a brute who led a brutal nation from his saddle.  While this is true and Genghis led one of history's bloodiest armies ever let loose to conquer, the author fleshes out that picture and both Genghis and his empire's story are told in fullness.This is a very well written and interesting history that filled in a gap in my knowledge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7CVAUOHNGH1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609809644#wasThisHelpful","R7CVAUOHNGH1A","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of ""Band of Brothers"" should enjoy this book focusing on one of the commanders of Easy Company and bringing the whole Dick Winters story to light.Winters embodied the iconic everyman hero of World War II - a young man called to do a job who performed it excellently, selflessly, without braggadocio.  This Winters dominated the original book, but in ""Biggest Brother,"" the author gives Winter's life story.Obviously a lot of the story turns on Winter's service in the European Theater of Operations, but this also delves into his upbringing and his experience after the war and ultimately as a hero thrust into the role by Stephen Ambrose's' wonderful book and the exciting mini-series upon which it was based.Winters was no Sgt. York or George Patton, but the ability for many readers to see themselves (at least themselves on a good day) in Dick Winters as he performs excellent service in the deadly pursuit of war proved to be uplifting and helped underscore the story of our citizen army called to do a very tough job in World War II.  I am glad this book was written so that Winters could get his due in a full biography.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MXBKD4ZX1B4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451218396#wasThisHelpful","R2MXBKD4ZX1B4G","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those quirky little works that is fascinating and you learn lots of interesting tidbits about a subject you never would have thought would have made a book.Mary Roach has written all about dead bodies throughout history and how they are used, misused and brought to their state of room temperature.  It turns out that bodies have been and always will be used to demonstrate ""stuff.""  They have tested methods of execution, taught doctors (the section on plastic surgeons practicing on bodiless heads is creepy but fascinating), been used as crash test dummies and provided the raw research on alternate methods of disposal such as composting (you can, in a sense, reemerge as a flower every year if your composted body fertilizes the garden).  The famous ""Bone Yard"" in Tennessee where bodies are left to decay to aid forensic science is explored as well as the employees who have jobs there (and undoubtedly never lack for bar talk when asked ""so, what do you do?"").This is so different and quirky that it fascinated and I had a tough time putting it down.  An enjoyable read that will undoubtedly be a departure from your usual repertoire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATMUQJMU0I7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393324826#wasThisHelpful","RATMUQJMU0I7K","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is informative and accessible.  For the non-clinician, it gives a very good history of the development of the field of medicine, broadly construed.I've always kept in mind that physicians killed George Washington by bleeding him, the established practice of the day to rid the body of the ""bad humors"" that were thought to cause illness.  Much of the history of the development of medicine focuses on many wrong ideas and false starts with the occasional beneficial treatment or practice stumbled upon and largely misunderstood.  For much of history, healing was a matter of luck that was enhanced for those who avoided physicians or hospitals.This little gem of a book traces the development of surgery, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, and the like over the last couple of thousand years to the present.  It also discusses modern practices and the reader will certainly come away thankful that they live in an age where some of the body's functions and chemistry are understood enough to make a trip to the hospital on the whole a good risk, rather than the life threatening experience it was up until the modern era.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2NXGJ1TEAAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393325695#wasThisHelpful","R1T2NXGJ1TEAAS","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers have noted, this is a different kind of history that is interesting in part but disappoints.While purporting to be about ""The Dinner"" that saved America, it is mostly about the events leading up to the dinner and the issues and personalities involved in striking a deal that legitimized the American experiment in 1790.American finance and stability had to be created in order for the new government to gain a footing soon after Washington's inauguration.  The need for credit worthy public debt and the problem of state debt incurred as a result of The Revolution vexed the Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton and the anti-Federalist leaders James Madison and Thomas Jefferson (this even though Hamilton and Jefferson both sat in Washington's Cabinet during this episode).Jefferson invited the other two to his famous dinner where a deal was hatched that Congress ended up embracing - assumption of state war debt by the Federal Government (which Hamilton wanted) in return for the eventual placement of the permanent Capital of the Government on the Banks of the Potomac River on land ceded by Virginia and Maryland (which Jefferson and Madison wanted).  The essence of political compromise and on an issue that really was crucial to the viability of the Republic.This book doesn't offer any new insights or ground as many reviewers have noted.  It tilts heavily toward Jefferson in the never ending debate of who was the statesman and who was the opportunist between Hamilton and Jefferson (I think the book is unfair to Hamilton).  And, the author has included recipes of food found at Jefferson's table that is out of place in a book like this, but does have the virtue of adding something different to the tome.All in all, an ok summary of the assumption and public debt issue and the story of a great compromise forged at Thomas Jefferson's table.

"This modest book is not a biography of Churchill per se, but a description of what made Churchill tick by examining momentous experiences in this most momentous of lives to get at the essence of the man.Johnson, who knew Churchill and had the opportunity to observe him closely during the great statesman's career, shows how Churchill's tenacity, drive, energy, great ability to communicate and incredible self confidence kept his position significant in or near government for most of the period form World War I through the mid-1950s.  There are conclusions drawn from Churchill's many successes as well as his failures - the Wilderness years in the 1930's and the disastrous Gallipoli campaign he championed in the First World War - that show how the mettle of the man was forged.As Johnson admits, this is not meant to be an exhaustive biography, and in less than 200 pages, there are many parts of the Churchill story that do not get mentioned or are mentioned only briefly.  What Johnson does, and does extremely well, is create a vivid impression of the man himself and illustrate what it was that made Churchill the towering figure he became.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ONEC1OYL06B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NSVEKK#wasThisHelpful","R2ONEC1OYL06B9","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers have noted, this easy to read book is more about Sherman's March to the Sea than the occupation of Savannah.Sherman was an innovator.  Having learned from Grant's campaign to the back door of Vicksburg by way of Jackson, Mississippi, Sherman proposed to cut the eastern Confederacy in two after his 1864 captue of Atlanta by cutting his supply lines and communications and living off the land to move his army of 100,000 across a broad swath of Georgia to the coast at Savannah.  It was audacious, but Grant and Lincoln agreed and General Sherman undertook his famous march that ""made Georgia howl.""The March was imposing, with only scattered troops opposing him. His deft movements and broad front convinced the Confederate commander to slip away from Savannah as Sherman approached and the northern army was able to occupy this vital port easily.  Sherman's announcement to Lincoln begging to present as a Christmas present the City of Savannah buoyed the North and the President.This is a good overview, not as thorough as some treatments of the March but easily accessible and written in an engaging manner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JH4M9LJPBG1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046LUF1S#wasThisHelpful","R2JH4M9LJPBG1B","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent little book is a ""how to"" for getting elected to local office.  Yes, it was written 2,000 years ago and the office was Counsul of Rome in 64 BC, but the lessons are the same as one would use to describe successful campaigning today. (I say local, because travel time and distance meant that only citizens of the City of Rome voted and of course females, slaves and others classes were excluded.  It really was a ""press-the-flesh"" campaign that needed to reach a manageable number of people for success).The lessons are the same then and now because the subject is ""how to get humans to vote for you"", which translates into ""how to work with human nature""  This book is about how to make a connection, curry favor, get others to help you and how to avoid making people not want to support you.Written by one brother to another who is questing election to Rome's highest office in the Republic period, the slim guide lays out its advice in a series of fifty or so numbered maxims.  These are short paragraphs that speak to things to do and things not to do if you want to be a successful candidate.  Each maxim contains a couple of sentences of explanation/rationale which makes this a superb guide because it not only advises, but convinces the reader of the credibility of the advice.  Thus, we get instructions about making friends; about soliciting the opinions of those whose support you covet; about learning about your opponent's weaknesses and past and using that information to knock the opponent before undecided voters; that it is better to make promises and leave voters with hope and later disappoint them than to tell them ""no"" and disappoint them prior to an election; that being hopeful and building the hopes of voters is a winning strategy.  These truisms are very cynical, but the reader needs to keep in mind the sole objective of the book is to instruct on the waging of successful political campaigns and not on statesmanship.This is a quick read (an hour, hour-and-a-half or so) with the original Latin on one page and the translation on the facing page. The translator also provides a glossary and brief historical context that bridges the specifics of Rome 20 centuries ago for the modern reader.  Any contemporary observer of politics will recognize the lessons and ""how to's"" contained in this ancient tract and how true they are for the most part in contemporary politics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQE35P6JOOV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691154082#wasThisHelpful","R2KQE35P6JOOV6","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This superb biography by the Heidlers is informative, detailed and provides not only a full examination of the life of one of America's great legislators but also a summary of the great events facing the United States between the War of 1812 and the Compromise of 1850.Henry Clay's career is almost Zelig-like in his involvement in or close observation of every major event occurring in American government over almost fifty years of public service (most, but not all in elective office).  Clay has the distinction of both being the only person elected to the Speakership of the US House on his first day in office as a freshman representative, but also for consolidating power in that office and making it an effective legislative lever for the first time. So dominant was Clay, that he arguably was the person who cast the lot of the United States for war against the British in 1812.  Known as the Great Compromiser, Clay fashioned the Missouri Compromise as well has had a significant hand in the Compromise of 1850.The book is well written, thoroughly documented and tells the fascinating story of this man's life in a highly enjoyable manner. There are many lessons to learn from Clay's life.  Great evidence is given to show Clay as the master of personal politics.  He was genuinely a ""happy warrior"" who left sharp words on the floor of the Senate and had no trouble sharing a drink with fierce legislative opponents (this is a general statement - there were exceptions; occasionally Clay could be sharp and nasty during debates and had a few long running feuds with individuals that he carried into the social sphere of life - notably John C. Calhoun).  Witty, personable, able to carry conversation late into the evening and flatter without seeming insincere, much of Clay's power derived from his ability to cultivate friends and relationships.But as good a personal politician Clay was, he reveals himself a poor organizational politician.  In his quests for the Presidency and as leader of the Whigs, Clay was slow to adopt new styles of campaigning introduced by Jacksonians.  He took years to get off the front porch and out into the hustings to personally campaign for national office - a practice revealed as successful and expected after Jackson revealed its effectiveness.  He also is revealed as weak in terms of building organizations, seeming to leave organizational politics to the whims of trusted acquaintances and allies around the country long after his Democrat opponents had revealed the efficacy of strong campaign managers and tight organizations extending to the county level.Impressively, Clay is revealed as a man of principle and never waivered on his core beliefs in the American System (infrastructure and tariffs), the balance on slavery (personally seen as wrong, but Constitutional - the same as Lincoln's stance pre-1863), need for a national bank and a president consigned to carry out the will of Congress rather than dictate to it (However, knowing Clay through this book, one can well imagine him as a very involved and active President had he been successful in any of his five quests for the office).  His highest priority, always, was preserving the Union.  Clay could see the sectional pull and the threat it posed to national unity early and always worked to keep sectional interests from tearing the country apart.  He supposedly said on one occasion that he would ""rather be right than president"" (leading many wags to say he would get his wish), and his effort to stick to core principles while pursuing the presidency gives some support to that mind set.  The book does show how an artful politician tries to emphasize and smooth positions around the edges as this border state man attempted the difficult task of keeping northern anti-slavery, pro-tariff voters and southern pro-slavery, anti-tariff voters with him during national campaigns.A very well written, detailed biography not just of a significant man but also a significant time with many lessons regarding the art of politics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3OUUVUGAECF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812978951#wasThisHelpful","R1J3OUUVUGAECF","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Better"" continues the story and meditations that Gawande started in his first book ""Complications"" regarding surgery and healthcare from the perspective of a doctor.  Written in the same engaging easy-to-understand manner as his first book, ""Better"" is similarly interesting and timely given the focus on healthcare as an issue in our polity.This book examines some of the issues that perplex and dominate aspects of healthcare delivery.  Gawande speaks of simple things that the healthcare system could do better - such as ensuring hand washing by personnel as decreed by every hospital and provider facility.  He also addresses issues such as physician compensation (noting surgeons are pieceworkers) and the weight of malpractice litigation and insurance costs on the healthcare system.  A missed tumor on the x-ray of a son of a doctor provides a specific counterpoint to the general argument about malpractice tha serves to bookend the topic well.His topics are varied; differences in cure rates at different clinics; public health and the campaign to eradicate polio; and, a very interesting chapter on doctors who serve as physicians attendant to death penalty executions and the intersection of their training and the necessities of performing this job that seems to contradict the Hippocratic oath.Overall, his book serves to illustrate an often miraculous and wondrous system that serves many with lifesaving interventions but that also could do better in many ways and still has issues to resolve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWO17PXYF0B6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312427654#wasThisHelpful","RWO17PXYF0B6B","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atul Gawande is a very engaging writer with a fascinating subject - which produces a very informative and interesting book.Gawande writes from a surgical resident's perspective on his training and the practice of his craft.  His book does an excellent job of humanizing a profession that seems distant and elevated to many who consume surgical services.  With case studies as well as meditations on some of the ethical and larger questions related to interventional medicine, Gawande draws a fascinating portrait of what it means to be a surgeon - at least from his perspective.This is a warts and all book.  The miracles are here, but so are the ""bad outcomes."" The reader will be amazed at what medical science can accomplish in terms of fixing and healing; and also frustrated - as is the author - with the current limits of understanding that render some cases, behaviors and situations perplexing.Obviously a very smart man, Gawande has also a very talented pen that renders ""Complications"" an important and enjoyable work","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2X1VJBUMKZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312421702#wasThisHelpful","R1P2X1VJBUMKZJ","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Lonely Planet guide and I'm very impressed.If you are planning a visit to the Grand Canyon that is more than just a one or two day drive by, I would say this book is a must.  Nicely sized with good photos and lots of maps, it is meant to travel along with you instead of just sit on your desk during the trip planning stages.The book is well organized.  There are helpful sections on traveling with children, regional activities and suggestions, and tours within the park (both north and south sides).  The hikes are a central part of this book and are well described with usual information: maps, elevation changes, degree of difficulty, etc., etc.  There are all manner of hiking options described, so anyone who wants to explore the Grand Canyon of foot will benefit from this book.  I liked the layout; the book is very visual and easy to access.  All in all, a very good guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRHXQ4TAYTR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741794048#wasThisHelpful","R3HRHXQ4TAYTR9","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this atlas as an in-car guide for the various around-the-country trips taken with family over the last ten or so years.  It is an excellent atlas that adds locations of parks, sites, and attractions greatly aiding those who wander the roads and are willing to wander off to stop and visit something that catches your eye.For example, when driving US 85, a long, straight road uniting western North and South Dakota, the map showed the ""Geographic Center of the US"" close to my route.  This diversion provided a memorable stop and pictures with my four young kids.  These types of locations are not shown on other atlases I'm aware of, making the National Geographic Adventure Edition perfect for those with the time and inclination to see some of the country while traveling.For a car atlas, it is durable and the pages turn easily on the spiral binder.  Readability is good, though large states of course don't get quite the detail possible on maps for Delaware, Vermont, Rhode Island and other small states, but I didn't find this to be a problem in terms of guidance or options for attractions and sites.Four stars because it hasn't been updated since 2004 and needs to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTA1SBJWMBSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0792289897#wasThisHelpful","RQTA1SBJWMBSW","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the words of my almost fourteen year old, ""very cool pics.""  National Geographic has produced another book that sucks the reader in with incredible photographs and a good adventure story.Ed Viesturs is a rock star among mountain climbers - at least to those of us who know the activity through the printed page and film.  His quest to summit all fourteen of the world's giant mountains (above 8,000 meters) without supplemental oxygen is chronicled in his own words (this book covers the first twelve of those mountains; the latter two he bagged subsequent to this volume).  While the story is enticing and well written, the pictures are simply stunning.  I've read quite a few books about adventures in mountaineering (although my experience is entirely through the printed page), and I've not seen a better and more inspiring collection of top-of-the-world photography.  Viesturs is also a solid descriptive writer who offers a good journey in his own words.While good writing can convey adventure and a sense of place, nothing beats photos like these for showing how stark, lonely and dangerous it is atop the world's highest peaks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R228GF5F52R5IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142620485X#wasThisHelpful","R228GF5F52R5IS","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had high hopes for this feeder. I hung it outside two weeks ago. Initially it appeared to be doing a good job, as the squirrels would climb onto it and the squirrel's weight would cause the feeder to close.Within days, the squirrels had figured out that if they stood on the base, they could eat freely to their heart's content.The leaves on the feeder are already starting to rust from squirrels chewing on them.A spring came loose from squirrel mischief. I reattached it several times but it continues to be dislodged by squirrels.The springs are no longer as bouncy as they were, with the result that the feeder ports are only partially open, not enough for birds to access.  I called and spoke with Perky Pet's friendly and helpful tech support: they suggested numerous ""fixes"" which didn't work.This feeder is not well-built and is not squirrel proof.

"This is a beautiful set of cards and accompanying book.THE PACKAGING AND UNWRAPPING:The box is a two-piece box with a lift-off lid. Box dimensions are 2 inches deep x  8 1/2 inches x 6 inches. The book measures 5 1/2"" x 8"". The cards are arranged in two packs in two indented wells in the box.THE CARDS:The images are beautiful and surreal. The four suits are Airships (Swords), Engines (Wands), Submersibles (Cups), and Leviathans (Pentacles). The cards measure 4 3/4"" high x slightly wider than 2 3/4"" wide. The image on each card measures 4 1/8"" high x 2 5/8"" wide. There is a white border with a title at the bottom.The Court cards are: Messengers = Page, Navigator = Knight, Lady = Queen, Captain = King. The Major Arcana, or the ""Gods of the Machine,"" have been renamed, except for the Empress and Emperor (the Tower is the ""Stricken Tower"" and the Moon is ""Moon Voyage""). Strength is VIII ""The Engineer"" who ""calmly tends a mighty robot,"" and Justice is XI ""Brazen Head,"" which was ""made to judge and discern everything within its intelligent workings.""Some of my favorite cards: Ace of Airships, being piloted through the sky: the massive ship looks as if it is passing directly overhead and has caught us in its wake. The Five of Airships depicts a mighty battle in space between warring ships: is the fate of our world affected below? The Eight of Airships shows a lookout piloting an Airship, fogbound, while threat of attack looms, with a beautiful skyline as a backdrop. The Seven of Engines illustrates a majestic machine which looks like a goddess: the card meaning reads, ""an operator looks to keep the engine alive as the workers strike."" The Ten of Leviathans shows two machines: ""an older crew and her captain encounter the power of a newer vehicle."" The Two of Submersibles portrays two divers entwined. The Seven of Submersibles depicts a lost underwater city.Of the Major Arcana, I like XIII the Spring-Heeled Jack (Death), who graces the cover of the book. Upon reading about him in the book, I learned he is ""the scavenger that sees off things that have run their time. No one knows whose roof he will land on."" One cannot bargain with this fellow, apparently! Other standouts are Solarium (The Sun), Regeneration Machine (Judgment), and the Aviatrix (High Priestess). My favorite is Moon Voyage, a travelling machine pointed at the moon.THE CARDSTOCK:The cardstock is matte, with a slightly glossy protective finish applied. They feel smooth to the touch. It has a nice thickness to it; not too thick and not too thin. It looks durable and has an attractive finish. They feel good in the hand when shuffling.CARD BACKS:Card backs are a reversible pattern of silvery white winged cogs and gears and a planet design on a deep blue-green, almost teal, background with a thin gold border. There is a tiny copyright on either side. On the main gear it reads, ""Dei ex Machina."" This symbol is also on the back of the book.READING THE CARDS:One can read them using the authors' system, which is described in the book. One can also read this deck using the RWS system, after a little time spent with the book. For example, the Three of Airships (Swords): ""A crew member falls from an airship and is thrown a lifeline. ... The Three of Airships often represents an irretrievable loss ..."" The Four of Airships (Swords), which might mean rest in a typical RWS deck, indicates: ""The airship is grounded for awhile, allowing the captain to take some down-time while repairs are completed."" The Matthews have constructed their system so that it conforms with RWS while at the same time it is their own system. Or, one can read these cards intuitively.THE BOOK:The 160-page book by John and Caitlin Matthews is a solid accompaniment to the deck, and creates an alternate reality which centers around the Imperium. ""You inhabit but one part of a much vaster cosmos, and are perhaps ignorant of the Imperium,"" it asserts. ""We urge you to acquaint yourself with its co-existence beside your own world, for it is but a step away.""It refers to the capital city of the Imperium, the twenty-two Gods of the Machine (the Major Arcana) that are ""the sacred presences which keep the machine of life turning in this world"" and which at one time in ancient history once ""walked among us, and we spoke directly to them--and they to us.""Vehicles enable them ""to roam the earth through the four elements."" The vehicles are the four suits of the deck. ""Airships fly through the air, Engines govern fire, Submersibles plumb the depths of the waters, Leviathans explore earth's pathways,"" according to the book.Part One introduces the deck's system. ""Exploring the Imperium"" covers the Major Arcana, The Leagues (cards numbered Ace through Ten) and their Legates (the Court Cards), and a chart which maps out the Courts of the Four Leagues, further discussed in Laws of the Imperium. The Laws of the Imperium links each suit with specific Major Arcana cards into a system of government. The Seven Initiates of the Apprentice subdivide the Major Arcana into seven triads. The Matthews' system is cohesive and thoughtful. It makes a great backdrop for these cards.There are 26 fantastic spreads in this book. Each of the 22 Major Arcana card has its own four-card ""micro-spread."" For example, The Apprentice (The Fool) has ""Apprentice's Try-Out Spread."" The positions are: 1. What does this adventure offer? 2. What can I trust? 3. What do I risk? 4. Where does the vision lead? Each of these spreads is unique ""so that you may test for yourself the power of each archetype.""In addition to the 22 spreads, one for each of the Major Arcana, there are four supplementary, larger spreads in Part Three of the book, ""Blueprints"": The Control Panel Spread, The Steam Goggles Spread, The Keys of Wisdom Spread, and The Cosmic Blueprint Spread, with sample readings for each.In addition to these spreads, under the triads section, the authors show a clever way to create a layout for each of the seven triads. There are also complementary opposites in the Majors, and a suggested way to create a layout based on them.Two pages are devoted to the Major Arcana and one for the Minor Arcana with black-and-white photos.CONCLUSION:There is a cohesive rhythm to this deck. The Steampunk Tarot transports one into another world. The images are lush and manifest this alternate reality beautifully. One can work with the marvelous system devised by the Matthews, and which is wonderfully suited for this deck, or one can work intuitively or using RWS. I am really enjoying my adventure with this tarot created by John and Caitlin Matthews, and the illustrations by Wil Kinghan are elegantly and skillfully rendered. This is a great choice for any steampunk or scifi fan.  This is both a useful and enjoyable addition to my tarot collection, and I look forward to the journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMP70B401D1M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080484352X#wasThisHelpful","RMP70B401D1M2","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can highly recommend The Hobbit Tarot for anyone who is a fan of ""The Hobbit"" and J. R. R. Tolkien. In order to read with this deck, a working knowledge of the book, ""The Hobbit,"" is very helpful. I re-read the book, and find that it has been a great study aid with the deck, in addition to the 96-page LWB which comes with the deck.Most of the cards directly refer to characters and scenes from the book (a couple of the Queens are an exception, as one, the Queen of Coins, ""represents all the mothers, sisters, daughters, and beloved of those in Esgaroth!"" and the other, the Queen of Cups, is a reference to Tom Bombadil's wife.) It is more of an intuitive reading deck than a RWS clone, although some RWS similarities can be found, such as Bilbo in The Fool card. But this is a themed deck, and to enjoy it, knowledge of the subject matter is helpful.This deck will be more easily read by intuitive readers who are well-versed on ""The Hobbit."" For those, and for collectors, this is a recommended deck and a real treat. The cardstock is lovely: matte and substantial. The backs are nonreversible, but it is hardly noticeable in the design. Strength is VIII and Justice is XI.For more Middle-Earth fun, there are some neat spreads in the back of the LWB: The Ring of Gollum Spread, The Sword of Aragon Spread, and The Arkenstone Spread.A great deck for Hobbit-philes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85M2HPVX26W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572816775#wasThisHelpful","R85M2HPVX26W7","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By far, one of my favorite decks I have purchased this year.The imagery is charming and resonates with me. I love the costumes and the atmosphere of the deck.The people in the deck, to me, are soft and gentle. Their faces, similar to the Hudes, do not show a lot of range of expression, but I like this. I feel like I can fill in their emotions in this deck. To me, their expressions often look as though they are bordering on a smile. Sometimes they are neutral. It depends on the reader what they will see in a face on a card.I love the cardstock. It has a matte finish, but the cards feel substantial in the hand, like they will last. The borders are reversible. I thought the green border might be too bright, but it is fine. Strength is VIII and Justice is XI.This is a RWS clone, yet it has subtle differences in some cards. On the Fool card, the dog stands beside the Fool. The Wheel shows a spinning wheel and a girl with the thread tangled in the wheel. The Queen of Pentacles is napping with a baby in her lap and curlers in her hair. The Three of Pentacles is a figure alone with three Pentacles, gold pieces, falling out of her hat, while she seemingly does not notice.I have enjoyed this one, and it is in my regular rotation. If you like this style of artwork and you want something a little different in an RWS clone, consider picking this one up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGD6RSWLX1ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572817127#wasThisHelpful","R3GGD6RSWLX1ZU","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tarot knocks my socks off. The art style and theme will either suit you or not. If it suits you, it is great for intuitive readings. It is moody and atmospheric. Like some other Lo Scarabeo offerings, it does not closely follow RWS, but I get wonderful readings from it.I will mention that the cardstock, to me, seems a little less sturdy than it did in decks made a couple of years ago by Lo Scarabeo.. These are noticeably thinner, though not by much -- and the cardstock is still of good quality. But I can see where the corners of the cards have been cut; the corners do not have an entirely smooth finish as I have seen in, say, Lo Scarabeo decks that were printed several years ago. When I weigh the deck, the deck weighs a few grams lighter than some of my older Lo Scarabeo decks.Card backs are nonreversible: a man's hand reaches toward a woman's hand, but the design is subtle and beautiful, and for me, it is not a distraction. Strength is VIII and Justice is XI. The LWB is in multiple languages, typical of LoS LWBs: this one is in English, Italian, Spanish, French, and Dutch. Each section is about 12 pages long.There is one spread included, a five-card spread called ""The Path of the Five Houses,"" also called ""The Road of the Five Doors.""This is already one of my favorite decks.

"The Mystic Dreamer has some beautiful imagery. As others have mentioned, the imagery is smaller than I would have liked once I saw the cards in person. This set is particularly well suited to beginners, although readers of any level, from beginner to advanced, can enjoy it. Many reviews here are from new readers using this set as their first deck. For that, they get a book and deck kit to help them on their way.There is some repetitiveness to the moon and raven images throughout the deck. The CGI effects are a bit obvious at times. And the borders are a bit intrusive.Still, this deck has its charm, and I will use it from time to time, although if the images were larger, I would be tempted to use it more often. Although, there are many who are fine with the size of these images and will use it as a daily deck, so if you are okay with slightly smaller images and you are interested in this style, pick this one up. Like other Llewelyn offerings, plan to make some room for the deck and box kit, as they do take some storage space if you are a collector with a lot of decks.

"My ""Lord of the Rings Tarot Deck & Card Game,"" has grown on me over time. When I first got it, I thought it was more a game. I looked at the cards but could not find any serious meanings within them regarding tarot. But that has changed.This is one you have to take a close look at, or it can pass you right by without one even realizing what an nice LOTR collector's piece it is, plus what an important tarot reading tool it is.The box itself is quite tricky to manage. To keep it in its best collector's shape, one should leave it in place and simply slide the cards and their tuck box out of the pocket they are in along one side of the box to examine them.This set is published by U.S. Games.Inside the tuck box, you will find a LWB entitled ""The Lord of the Rings Tarot Deck & Card Game: Tarot developed by Terry Donaldson, Artwork developed by Peter Pracownik, Game rules by Mike Fitzgerald,"" along with a Title card, 78 ""tarot"" or ""game"" cards, plus an extra card entitled ""The Lord of the Rings Tarot Card Game A Quick Guide to Victory Points"" which has to do with playing the game.The game play is explained on pages 28-39 of the LWB and is explained beginning in the following section: ""The Lord of the Rings Tarot Card Game - Rules by Mike Fitzgerald"" It states ""For 2-6 players, Ages 10 to adult."" Object of the Game is stated to be: ""In their quest to reach Mount Doom, players try to acquire the highest number of Victory Points."" As a round ends, the players reach Mount Doom. The journey is represented by cards discarded from your hand into the Journey Pile (the discard pile).Along the way, players can be influenced by forces from Middle Earth or by Dark Forces. There are Dark Points involved and these appear on certain cards with what is known as a ""Dark Forces"" symbol. Other cards have a ""Free Peoples"" symbol which represents Gandalf. Other cards have a Neutral symbol which can be associated with either good or evil. One card has a One Ring symbol: the Wheel of Fortune, which represents the Ring in this game. It determines who is the Ring Bearer.Now that I have described some of the game play to you, let me go back to describing these cards to you as tarot cards. This is why I originally purchased them: that and my love of Lord of the Rings.However, as a tarot deck, when I first got the deck they did not work for me for a number of reasons, and I will state some of their shortcomings here:Let's take a given card as an example. How about The Fool card?1. They use Gollum as the Fool. To me, it would seem that Frodo would be the Fool, as he is the one setting off on the great Adventure with the Ring. (More card examples below.)2. Also on these cards, there are very heavy borders, at least 1/2 inch thick on one side, and along the bottom even thicker. However, as I got to know the cards, I began to better accept these borders. They are almost used as ""scenes"" or, if you will, think of it as pulling back a curtain and looking onto a stage. It is as though the border is framing the action and is in fact part of the action. So the borders do not bother me so much anymore.3. If you do not like keywords on your cards, these go beyond keywords. These put entire sentences on their cards. The Fool card reads: ""Gollum, by a pool of water, considers the many possibilities open to him."" While many tarot readers know that the Fool card *can* indicate possibilties, (a) it doesn't always indicate that; that is only one of a myriad of meanings; and (b) I don't really associate that phrase with Gollum at all. I think of many things when I think of Gollum, but that is not one of them. Gollum was fixated, trapped, but he was not ""open to possibilities"" in my book.4. The symbols for use in playing this game are quite big on the cards and add to the busyness and clutter on an already cluttered card.5. By the time you subtract the: (a) wide border, (b) keywords/sentence, (c) game play symbols - you are left with what is a relatively small piece of artwork.Despite these flaws, the cards are charming. The idea of having a game combined with a tarot deck is charming. And I cannot help myself: I do enjoy having the keywords/sentences on *these* cards: I find myself reading them. They have particular meaning to me because I love Lord of the Rings. So as a Lord of the Rings collector, I find value in their meanings. And those meanings would translate nicely over into tarot readings.I actually find this to be a perfectly readable tarot deck, if one chooses to work with it.Would I have changed some of the cards around? Yes. I still would have made Frodo the Fool. Lady Eowyn is The High Priestess in this deck, but I think Galadriel would have been better suited, as the High Priestess is generally one of ""secrets and the subconscious"" and ""understanding the possibilities,"" for without Galadriel's gifts and her gazing into the mirror (thus her knowledge of what to give) the quest would have failed.  Galadriel is secretive and magical.And I simply do not like their interpretation of the Death card at all. ""Wormtongue's insidious advice poisons the mind of good King Theoden."" This is not a traditional Death card meaning. The Death card is about uprooting, about going through a transition, about being in the path of sweeping change, about a rebirth, about an ending: closing one door and another one opening. None of those things are portrayed in this Death card.THE BOOK:Let me say a few words about Terry Donaldson's excellent companion book. It begins with a section on ""Welcome to Middle Earth"" in which he introduces us to Tolkien, Middle Earth, The Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings. Next is ""The Significance of Tolkien's Genius"" in which he discusses Tolkien's Silmarillion and more of the history of the Lord of the Rings. Donaldson ties the Lord of the Rings characters into society and into each one of us. He speaks of the weapons and the Rings as well.The Major Arcana and Minor Arcana are then discussed. Approximately 7 pages are devoted to each of the Major Arcana, including Lord of the Rings meanings, tarot meanings, negative aspects (reversals), astrological associations, and even a wonderful section in which the card ""speaks"" to us.In the Minor Arcana on page 182, one page per card lists meanings. The Minor Arcana, unfortunately, do not get the full treatment that the Major Arcana get: they get a very short paragraph on what their Lord of the Rings meaning is, and about two sentences on what their tarot meaning is. No reversals, astrological, or ""card speaking"" sections are given.Lastly, ""Reading with the Lord of the Rings Tarot Deck"" includes a section on meditating with the deck, reading for yourself, reading for others (this section gives some excellent advice!), and gives some really nice spreads, including a 7-card Gandalf spread and a Hobbit spread.WHAT YOU GET:1. 80-card deck in a tuckbox2. Paper Fold-out spreadsheet ""Gandalf Spread"" in the form of the Elvish Letter ""G""3. 268-page book by Terry Donaldson ""The Lord of the Rings Tarot""4. All inside of an outer box, published by U.S. GamesWHO SHOULD GET IT:1. Lord of the Rings collectors2. Tarot collectors3. Definitely Lord of the Rings collectors who are tarot readers4. Tarot readers who are looking for something different5. Board/card game players looking for a new card game6. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, who LOVES Lord of the Rings! :)There is some wonderful stuff here for any collector or tarot reader who likes Lord of the Rings. Despite its minor shortcomings, it is a nicely done tarot deck and quite an appealing collector's piece. Don't let that it has ""game"" in the title throw you. This one should be in any Lord of the Rings collector's tarot collection, plus you can actually read with it.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAD7EDZ4A80D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572810173#wasThisHelpful","R1JAD7EDZ4A80D","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just got my deck!! I LOVE it. This is by the same fine folks that designed the tongue-in-cheek Housewives tarot.Initial impressions: First of all, what can I say about the box! It is quite the presentation in itself. With faux printed bullets lining the paper rim, there is your ammunition for the Zombie Apocalypse. The box is meant to be an ammunition box so you have bullets to ""kill"" the zombies. ;) Very clever!Inside, tucked away and surrounded by black velvet-like material, is the deck. The cards are somewhat stiff, with a nice cardstock that will last for awhile. The cardstock has a matte finish.The 96-page instruction booklet lies on top of the deck. Each page is chock full of zombie apocolyptic goodness. Not a LWB and is not too big a book that you can't -- pardon the pun -- digest it. It's just right!I did a 4-card deck introductory reading. It was very revealing and fun at the same time; an interesting spin on the tarot!The imagery is extremely witty and clever. Anyone who enjoys zombies or horror should enjoy this deck. :) Anyway ... the imagery is loads of fun. When I first received my deck, I didn't even look through all of the cards ... I just started shuffling the deck because I wanted to be surprised by my first reading! Which was a blast!The cardstock is nice: expect thick, unbending, and matte. The black backs have a bit of a retro vibe. The imagery, cardstock and packaging combined gives a sort of 50s/60s feel to this tarot.Recommended for zombie fans, those with a sense of humor about horror, expecting a fifties/early sixties touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPSVTJ79130S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594745692#wasThisHelpful","R1FPSVTJ79130S","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I am thrilled that I went ahead with my purchase despite some misgivings I had.This is a really nice set of cards. I just got mine today, and I have already done my yearly spread.I was concerned that 200 cards would be a lot to handle.I like the quality of the bag. I wasn't sure with various reports of it getting torn, but I used the bag to shuffle my cards and I did not have any problems.The instructions in the book are straightforward. I did the yearly reading because the book says to start out with that one before doing my first weekly.Shuffling is easy with the bag. There is no need to make piles of cards. The bag is plenty sturdy.  I don't see it tearing unless someone is super rough with it.This is a really nice set of cards, and I am looking forward to seeing how accurate the readings are with it! I can see it being useful for daily or weekly draws or to supplement a tarot reading.Each month in the yearly spread gives you four cards which you read to make up that month's reading. A very pretty circular layout and with 48 cards, 4 for each month, it gives you a very good picture of what the year will be like. The author also encourages you in her book to look for relationships and patterns in cards between different months.Here is a sample month reading from the yearly spread: November. Bag - Somthing important, such as a new job or a raise. Tiger - Doing something risky. Taking a chance. Egg - Success assured with good plans and hard work. Tower - Solid foundation. Success with effort. Putting those four cards together, it sounds like a career- or work-oriented challenge will present itself in November. It is a risky move, but I have a solid foundation in the field, and success is ensured if I apply myself. Strategic planning is also a factor in my success. December shows Throne, a position of authority, and Arrow, being on the right path, so the cards look like I succeed.This is an excellent set and, if you have been on the fence about ordering it as I was, I would definitely say this one is worth having in any collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FXIRIC2V55X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572816708#wasThisHelpful","R28FXIRIC2V55X","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this as a replacement for the OXO GOOD Grips Soap Dispensing Palm Brush. I much prefer this brush due to the hefty weight of the item, the stainless steel look of the item which actually looks like stainless, and the extra height of this brush makes it feel good in the hand and makes it easier to use. It also fixed some problems with the older style soap dispensing palm brush which a previous reviewer alluded to. I had that brush and was never happy with it because it did not dispense soap properly, although it was a pretty brush.I have been using this brush for about 4 years without any problems.There is one reviewer who states ""don't bother with the replacement brushes."" I have had zero problem replacing the brushes on mine. Mine has not developed any leaks, and the top is not at all difficult to remove. That reviewer must have received an entirely different brush! My brush has been fine.One thing about this stainless steel brush that is not as good as the clear style soap dispensing one is that with the clear style, you could easily see the soap level. With this brush, the stainless steel accent mostly hides the soap level. It is not really an issue, as you can tell when the soap is running low.This is very handy for washing dishes or scrubbing pots and pans. It has various types of replaceable brushes you can twist on and off: sponge pad, plastic mesh, and the regular bristle. It lasts a long time due to the replaceable heads and goes well with many kitchen decors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KPZAU7X4INXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F3NIVU#wasThisHelpful","R2KPZAU7X4INXR","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The back of the bag is brown and matches the card backs; a nice touch. The inner lining is grey with grey tassels.Only special decks get bags in my collection.

"It is described as ""5 B&W TV AM/FM/weather (7-band) radio Fine tuning knob for weather band Double fluorescent bulb light Bright-beam flashlight Mosquito repeller Emergency siren Splashproof Includes AC & car adapters Requires 9 C batteries.""""Mosquito repeller""? Not sure how that one got thrown into the description. Never saw a mosquito repeller on it. I would have been happy if, out of all those things on that list, it had just tried to do ONE thing well! Like be a good lantern.Clearly the B&W TV won't work anymore. But even when the TV would work, the thing just wasn't a good idea, because it's trying to do too much and the lights are positioned poorly. It uses unpopular and harder to find C batteries.The lights are positioned with one in front and one cockeyed off to the rear / side. The rear light is lopsided and not nearly as nice as the light I ended up using the most frequently of all the emergency lanterns I have tried, the eGear 10-DAY Lantern, Silver.

"By far I would recommend this storm lantern over any of the others I have tried.I live in a city directly next to the Gulf of Mexico where we get hurricane threats all during that season.I need a lantern that is long-lasting like this one, and that can handle extended power outages that might last for days.What I did not expect was for this lantern to still be working -- 8 years after I purchased it on Amazon in 2004!The adjustable ultra-bright 12-LED light is amazing. You can set it to get only the minimum light in a room, or turn it up for more brightness. This light does not produce heat. This is very important in the hot and humid climate where I live, especially if you are going for days without electricity or A/C.I highly recommend this lantern to anyone looking for a reliable storm lantern that will last them for years to come!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA57QZI5ZZFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002C9ZUW#wasThisHelpful","R2HA57QZI5ZZFI","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not recommend these for two reasons:One, they have a short battery life.Two, the call quality is terrible with these batteries after a short while. It is because they are rated 800mAH.

The battery life may still be short on an 850mAH battery, but at least the volume on your calls will sound louder and you will have fewer dropped calls.I bought a battery rated 850mAH. The call quality was significantly better, which is why I will not go back to ordering these.

"This is a great little Sony DVD player and it has been going strong for 2 1/2 years!It has a very small footprint. It is easy to set up.I had some trepidation, because my last Sony DVD player died with a read error; the Sony player stopped being able to read discs. So I was concerned about whether I should stick with Sony.But so far, I have had only great experiences with this little player!It is extremely lightweight. It has played every disc without complaint; discs from the library and from Netflix.It shows no signs of letting up and has just been really solid in every way!The only thing I am not as happy about is the new remote that came with it. It is not a big deal: it doesn't have an eject button on it; but it's sometimes a nice feature. Also missing is the commercial skip button. The remote is also not glow-in-the-dark like the previous remote.One thing I really like a LOT about the new remote is its size! It is half the size of the other remote. It is a lot easier to keep on my coffee table, or toss in a drawer.Overall, I recommend this because I've had really good luck with this Sony DVD player and its longevity, and I think it's a solid model. It is quiet, and when it is off, there are no lights to contend with. If something happened to it, I would want the same player; it's been just that solid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WN0YFEKK110/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IBHUU8#wasThisHelpful","R31WN0YFEKK110","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The imagery on this deck is rich and will be appreciated if you are a goth fan -- and may even earn the appreciation of some non goth fans.Llewelyn states, ""Alchemy 1977 is famous around the globe for their stunning gothic artwork and steampunk accessories. Fans of this iconic brand will recognize and appreciate the powerful and seductive images in this extraordinary tarot deck. This captivating mix of art from world famous gothic illustrators ranges from traditional horror to lush supernatural scenes to medieval fantasy.""Kings are dragons: what fun! And the suit of wands has been replaced with black roses: a nice touch. The cards themselves have me feeling I am in a dark and wonderful world. A werewolf makes an appearance. There is a tattooed faery on Temperance. There are lots of skulls. The cards are lustrous and detailed and richly colored, and so is the world where these creatures live.The only downside for me is that I don't read plain pips so well.  If I come across the Six of Cups (three sets of two silver cups filled with what appears to be blood on a reddish backdrop), it is more difficult for me to read that card than if it were illustrated. Some of you will not have that problem.This deck is a beautiful one by Fournier, distributed by Lo Scarabeo. It comes with a LWB and the backs with a skull pattern are non-reversible.If you are into goth, it is a must-have.Even if you aren't, this is a beautifully detailed, rich, dark deck.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKR8HIX8G4FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738733636#wasThisHelpful","R1KKR8HIX8G4FV","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I found this to be a lovely tarot, with beautiful imagery, when I received mine, I was a bit disappointed with how small the images were.I don't feel that I can use this as a proper reading deck, but if you do not have a problem with reading small images, this deck will be a superb reading deck for you.The card size is 2 3/4"" x 4 7/8"". However, there is at the bottom of the card a large area in white for the card name with a double border in gold-ish ink.  On the sides there is also a border. Due to the size of the borders, one loses a lot in the size of the actual image.Otherwise the imagery itself is stunning: ethereal, spiritual, almost reminiscent of the Rohrig tarot.If you do not mind small imagery and can read it as such, you will find some wonderful surprises in this deck. Jim Morrison from the Doors is on one of the cards (the Knight of Flames). That it has princesses, such as the Princess of Swords in flight, gives it a sort of Thothy tone.The Minors aren't exactly illustrated. I say it that way, because the Ananda is kind of special. The Eight of Cups show eight cups floating down a river, or rather, suspended above it. But there is a lot of imagery in the card. So it isn't a plain pips card. There is plenty to draw from there in a reading.It is printed by AGMuller, and they are one of my favorite printers. I love their card stock.The card backs are reversible.I recommend this deck if you can read with small images, because it is an exceptional deck.~~""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

"This tarot deck is a feast for the eyes, dripping in gold. The fronts of the cards are heavily foiled in gold. It is a very innovative, unique deck and one that I am glad that I have in my collection. The ""idea, technical innovations and graphics"" are by Pietro Alligo. The LWB and instructions are by Giordano Berti and Tiberio Gonard.THE DECKThe reversible card backs are in colors of paisley and muted red with images of Jesus Christ in the vein of Orthodox Churches which the Golden Tarot of the Tsar celebrates. They blend beautifully with the deck.Justice is 8. Strength is 11. There are Knaves, Knights, Queens and Kings.The card stock is a nice one, and easily shuffled. My cards slide easily and have a nice finish.Speaking of the box, the box itself is quite lavish. There is gold foil used extensively on all four sides and the top of the box. Given that it is on a backdrop of red and blue, it is quite pleasing to the eye.THE CARDSAll meanings per the LWB (reversed meanings not given):The Fool shows ""The possession of Gerasa -- Recovery of psychological faculties. Return to health.""The High Priestess shows ""Saint Paraskeva -- ""The future not yet revealed. Silence. Hidden Knowledge. The mystery of faith.""The 4 of Chalices shows ""The prophet of Elijah on Mount Horeb -- Invention. Omen. Enlightening. Dream.""The 9 of Chalices shows ""Joseph welcomed by the Pharoah -- Promotion. Increase in salary. Reward.""The 2 of Pentacles shows ""David plays the horn -- Lightheartedness. Thoughtlessness. Simplicity.""The 3 of Pentacles shows ""Saint Luke paints the Virgin -- Work upon request. Glory without gain.""The 4 of Wands shows ""Miracle of the icon of the Virgin -- Unexpected opportunity. Prosperity.""The 8 of Wands shows ""Saint Leontius fights for the faith -- Long-distance conflicts. Legal action. Hard struggle.""The 2 of Swords shows ""Saint Michael judges the souls -- Assessment problems. Conflict of competencies.""The 8 of Swords shows ""Martyrdom of Saint George -- Inner crisis. Great suffering. Loss of freedom.""READINGWhile stunningly beautiful to look at -- and I still think they belong in any collection -- there may be some issues depending on the reader for use as practical reading cards:1. In order to get the most out of this deck, one needs to have a good familiarity with saints and Christian symbols as taught in Orthodox Christianity.2. The scenes in the middle of the card are somewhat small; depending on one's eyesight.OTHER THOUGHTSThe Golden Tarot of the Tsar seeks to celebrate Orthodox religion (especially that of Byzantine Russia) and the teachings therein. The LWB gives a nice explanation, thanks to the succinct but thorough introduction by Giordano Berti.This deck is a beautiful deck to use around the December holiday season, as its red-and-gold colors make it very festive for a table.  It would be a great deck to use for Christian querents.It is also a terrific way to use the enclosed LWB to have a history lesson on the saints or Orthodox Christian events. Since each card depicts a different scene, there is a lot to learn here, or take as a refresher course.This is one of the most beautiful and unusual decks that I own. I do not read with it, but it is a prized possession in my collector's decks because of its beauty, uniqueness and the amount of gold on the cards. I do not have another deck like this one. The card images alone and the way the cards are constructed are one-of-a-kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDE9N833BU8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738702390#wasThisHelpful","REDE9N833BU8Y","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the excellent companion book to the Tarot of Prague tarot deck. It adds greatly to one's appreciation of the deck, although one does not have to have the book in order to appreciate the amazing Tarot of Prague.The book, however, is highly sought after, and well it should be, as it is filled with secrets unlocked about these 78 wondrous cards that only those who possess this book will know. Karen Mahony herself (one of the creators of the Tarot of Prague and half of Magic Realist Press) has written this, so it should come as no surprise that the book is excellent: from the print quality of the pages to the very covers.Inside it states, ""A tarot based on the Art and Architecture of the 'Magic City'"" and indeed, the city of Prague does appear to be magic in the hands of Karen Mahony and Alex Ukolov. Their whimsical, bohemian touches blending the architecture of Prague into a tarot deck have lent this tarot a wonderful glow from within that carries a special magic of its own.Inside this book lies much history about Prague. For example, the Chariot card is discussed in depth, as are all the cards. The sources for the card elements are given in detail for each card. Included is the Royal Route, which is a road in Prague ""traditionally taken by Bohemian kings on their way to coronation."" There is a lengthy explanation given of the Royal Route, as quite a few cards in the Tarot of Prague include imagery taken from buildings along the Royal Route. In the Ace of Cups, for example, the Lion is from a building on Nerudova Street, which is along the Royal Route. The carved wooden relief in the Ace of Wands is from St. Vitus' Cathedral, which is along the Royal Route.We learn about Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, about the Charles Bridge, and we learn items of interest along the way such as the myth of the Melusine. There is magic abounding in Prague, which may account for the magic that seems to spring forth in the tarots published by Magic Realist Press!""The Tarot of Prague"" is a very enjoyable read which will explain in detail about every card in the deck and have you wanting to plan your next vacation to Prague.Highly recommended.~~""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

"If you pick up this tarot, you will find yourself wanting to know more about Prague. You may well find yourself wanting to travel there. I know I do.This tarot creates a marvelous fantasy world that is half tarot, half history lesson on the beautiful city of Prague. Gleaming statues, magnificent architecture; all are intermixed with the Magicians symbols or the Moon's beautiful backdrop. I ended up housing my Tarot of Prague in a gorgeous Moon bag with the print of that card (the makers of this wonderful tarot), with fringe! But I digress.The card stock is lovely. It is not laminated. The backs are black and white in a reversed pattern.This is a very readable deck: rich in symbolism. It is also a charming deck. It is a taste of Prague wherever you may be. You can pick up this deck and feel light-hearted at your very core. Pick any card out of the deck and you will be greeted by an artistic swirl of fantastic figurines on whimsical backgrounds with bits of architectural history thrown in that are centuries old, all in a readable tarot card.The book describes the Moon card as ""based on statue of Nox"" (Night) at 5 Nerudova Street. It is high up on the house and is partnered with an equally striking figure of the Day."" The book goes on to explain that on the Moon card, ""The background is the Vltava by moonlight. One of the two towers is the legendary Medieval Old Town Charles Bridge tower. The other ... [ ] stands on Novotnho lvka."" Much more detail is gone into in the book.It is fascinating to read about the history in the cards. But even if one does not have the book, one can feel the history emanating from this deck. Most of the deck are themselves statues or paintings from Prague.  It is a quite remarkable deck and I know of none other like it.I hope one day to visit Prague and to take my deck with me and to visit all of the places that I see on it!Don't pass this one up. Grab one while you can.Plus it is done by the incomparable Magic Realist Press's Karen Mahony and Alex Ukolov.Highly recommended.~~""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

"The Circle of Life is one of my favorite reading decks ever produced by Lo Scarabeo. It is an underrated deck that should be looked at by any serious tarot collector or reader, from beginning to advanced. This deck works best with intuitive readers. It is in my top 10 favorite decks and is always on my reading table. It has a wealth of imagery that makes reading with it an amazing experience.  The slightly oversized round cards (about 4 1/4 inches in diameter) are gorgeous and filled with symbolism for interpretation.  I especially love The Fool, but there are so many beautiful cards here.  If you get the Deluxe version, you'll get a blue and gold satin bag for the cards. I have the Deluxe edition with the bag and love it: it is perfect for the cards. The gold satin cloth in the bag matches the gold card backs.  I like the card stock: it is neither too thin, nor too thick.  It feels just right in the hand.To shuffle a deck like this, I like to slide the cards around and shuffle them in a pile.  I find this makes handling this deck easy and a delight.  If you try to shuffle them like a traditional tarot deck, you may find it difficult.  Work with the cards, and enjoy them! It really is easy to find your own method for sliding these cards around; they are easy to work with and to handle as you will soon find out on your own!The imagery of the deck is fanciful forest creatures such as elves and fairies, wizards and creatures: some familiar, some not.  It is like a magical forest, and a celebration of nature and the interplay between the whimsical and the divine, with all of the lightness and darkness that can be found within the ""circle of life.""Although most people don't read reversals in round decks, you can if you so choose.  In a round deck, it shows the full range of a card.  You do so by reading all of the intervals between upright and reversed: in other words, how far off they are from upright, or reversed.  I like to think of it as reading them like the hands of a clock, or the phases of a moon.  They may be approaching a full upright position, just leaving a full upright position, approaching a reversed position, etc.  Use your imagination!  This deck lacks for nothing in that department.Note: There is no proper ""book"" that comes with the Deluxe edition. It is called ""Deluxe"" because of the silk bag that you get along with the cards. You also get a squarish ""LWB"" (little white book) in several languages: English, Italian, Spanish, French, and Dutch. Of this, not counting the page that lists the languages in the front, only pages 3-7 are in English. A 30-card spread is given and the 30 cards are referenced on page 31 in the LWB.I truly love this deck.  It is a wonderful addition to any collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OIJ80DEEM7KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073871299X#wasThisHelpful","R1OIJ80DEEM7KT","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for my third generation iPad.It has several useful positions. To me, the most useful one is the basic upright position, which in and of itself can be altered a myriad of ways, as the stand is very flexible: the top portion can fold into a mode that will take the iPad down into a typing position, for example.I use mine on a shelf next to my bed. The shelf is deep enough that the stand fits completely on the shelf. However, if I wanted to, I could bring just the edge of the stand forward, so that I could have the 30-pin connector facing downward and have it freely dangling for a charge. The rubbery grip material extends all the way from the front to the back of the feet of this stand, so it will sit firmly where you put it.There is another choice, if I want to charge my iPad using the Arkon stand on my shelf, and that is to leave this stand sitting back deeper on the shelf but turn the iPad 180 so that the 30-pin connector faces up, and charge it that way. Or, I could charge it in landscape mode -- but on my shelf with some of the other things I have on the shelf, landscape mode is a little tight, given my space requirements on that particular shelf, so I prefer to park it in portrait mode when I am using it on that shelf.Speaking of which, let's talk about how I can use that stand in a typing position to type on the iPad. This works best on a hard, firm surface, such as a desktop or table. Open your iPad, open any Notes or document app, and lean the iPad into a typing mode. The stand is flexible enough to adapt. Now you've got a great position for either the iPad's built-in keyboard or for a wireless keyboard. This is also a nice position to use the iPad for web browsing.Using the iPad in landscape mode in an upright position on this stand is great for looking at slideshows of photos, or movies. It makes a great frame for your pictures.This is a very versatile stand. You can pick it up at a moment's notice and take it somewhere else. It will pack easily and go with you. It folds down into one simple piece that can be cleverly placed into a sleeve or bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37G7317ZQDWUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CKVOOY#wasThisHelpful","R37G7317ZQDWUL","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These shredder lubricant sheets have kept my small Mailmate shredder running smoothly.

"I guess I must be one of the lucky ones, because my MailMate shredder is still going strong after having it for quite a long while.I use it for junk mail. I follow the directions and don't allow it to overheat.I also bought some sheets with oil added to them called ""shredder lubricant sheets."" I use them as directed. They are to provide ""optimal shredder performance.""The only downside to a shredder like this is the limited capacity, but I knew that when I purchased this machine.The upside is the machine's great portability and ease of use. I can easily empty the basket when full for reuse.I would recommend this shredder for light use jobs. If you want to stick it somewhere near your front door to stick junk mail into when you come home, it is perfect for that.

"What stands out to me about this bar are the natural chocolate and coconut flavors. The coconut is natural coconut flakes sprinkled on top. The box states ""delicious strands of naturally tasty coconut."" The chocolate layer is nice and thick, and really satisfies my craving for chocolate. These Kashi bars contain no high fructose corn syrup. The dark chocolate is made of evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, and cocoa.WHO SHOULD GET THESE:* Chocolate lovers.* People looking for a low protein bar.* People looking for a bar with all-natural ingredients.* A bar with no high fructose corn syrup* A bar with dietary fiberThere are other bars that will give you 10 or 20 grams of protein and less or about the same amount of sugar (7 grams). The only downside is that because this bar only contains 4 grams of protein, and 4 grams of dietary fiber, it doesn't leave me feeling satisfied for long.These work for a light snack, when I am in the mood for a bite of chocolate. They are great with a glass of skim milk. At 120 calories, and only 30 grams of fat, I highly recommend them, as long as you are not looking for a protein bar. For the chocolate flavor alone, these bars are a standout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SFFWHJX5XGG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ONPMN2#wasThisHelpful","R3SFFWHJX5XGG6","AF7DUY08T2J87","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7DUY08T2J87?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works great as long as your motherboard will work with a 20 pin power connector (most lower power motherboards are okay leaving the other 4 pins unconnected but not all of them) and doesn't need too much power. Unlike the 80 watt picoPSU-80, this has a 4 pin 12 volt power connector for those motherboards than need one. It seems very efficient. Compared to a 300 watt 80-Plus Gold supply, and using a fairly inexpensive 60 watt ""brick"" 12 volt power supply, the brick and the PSU-90 combo used about 10% less power then the 300 watt 80-Plus Gold supply. That's likely because the system I'm running idles around 10 watts and needs less than 18 watts under max load. That's too light of a load for 300+ watt power supply to be very efficient. My system is a fanless Bay Trail Intel J1800 with an SSD.This also runs fairly cool with my system. My infrared thermo reads about 35C with an 18 watt load. I don't know how warm it might get under heavier load.One thing to note. If you're familiar with power factor, most 12 volt ""bricks"" under 90 watts are NOT power factor corrected. So at light loads some need about twice the VA as watts. For example with my system it run 12 watts and 22 VA with a 60 watt brick. I did try a 90 watt Mean Well brick with power factor correction and it was even more efficient and the VA was barely higher than the watts used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1UUWHIMJMZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TWE3ZM#wasThisHelpful","R2T1UUWHIMJMZD","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This board is disappointing on several levels. First, even with a best-case highly efficient power supply the idle power consumption is about double an Intel Bay Trail fanless board (like the J1800). AMD just doesn't seem to understand power management. The difference between idle and full load power consumption is only a few watts.The heat sink is also marginal. Just sitting idle (no CPU load) in open air, the CPU heats up to 60 C. Inside a case without a fan, it hits 75 C. And under load in a case it overheats. What's the point of a fanless motherboard if it needs a fan? Intel Bay Trail boards stay cool without a fan.Biostar is not in the same league as Asus or Asrock. The BIOS has some poor English, there are limited options, the manual is a single folded page, etc.The performance, despite the higher power consumption and quad cores, isn't much better than a dual core Intel Bay Trail. You don't get twice the speed despite it using twice as much power.The only good news are the standard DDR3 SIM sockets (many fanless mini-ITX boards use laptop memory) and the full size PCIe slot (many fanless boards have  only a PCIe X1 slot or an old-school PCI slot). So, for some applications, this board might still be a good fit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12H30B6UGO1OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXP5610#wasThisHelpful","R12H30B6UGO1OZ","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was free with Prime so its hard to complain too much but I wouldn't pay money for it. Most of it is very basic common sense. It reads like a high-school paper written by someone looking to provide the required number of words while doing the minimum amount of work. The sky is sometimes blue, life is finite, and we all have to make decisions. The author offers up pearls of wisdom over and over such as some decisions are easier than others and it's good to anticipate problems. Really?If you've read any books or even a decent article, about decision making or procrastination, you've read 95% of what's in this book. For someone literally still in Junior High School there might be enough new material to make it worthwhile. For those who already know the usual common-sense advice, this is probably a waste of time. The author doesn't really even provide a new perspective, such as personal anecdotes, to lend a little more value to the tired material.I don't know what's up with Kindle reviews, but they often seem more suspect than the print variety--especially for Kindle books available for free under various programs. If you look up Chref, for example, he/she apparently reads roughly a DOZEN BOOKS A DAY and gives every single one a 5 star review.

"It's hard to find high output smart USB chargers that are well designed and not potential fire hazards. If you read the critical reviews of verified buyers you'll find many complaints for various no-name brands about overheating, bad smells, and even sparks and melted plastic. Most are offered by sketchy Chinese companies with little or no significant presence in the USA. TechMatte isn't exactly a big name, but at least they have a significant presence in the USA and this unit claims to be designed in the USA.Here are things to consider when shopping for a USB charger and how this one stacks up:- Maximum Output Per Port: Ideally each port should be good for 2.4 amps as the TechMatte is.- Maximum Total Output: Some devices offer 2.4 amps on one or more ports but the total output is limited--i.e. you can't draw 2.4 amps from every port at once. With the TechMatte you're limited to a total of 10 amps but it's very unlikely you'll ever reach that. You can charge 4 devices  at 2.4 amps or 5 devices at up to 2 amps each. Having 5 devices that each need over 2 amps would be very rare. But, if you're simultaneously charging a fleet of tablets, just consider this a 4 port charger. - Build Quality/Safety: A lot of people leave their chargers plugged in 24 hours a day. So you don't want some cheap no-name Chinese plastic wonder bursting into flames when you're not around (yes it happens). Ideally you want a unit with the UL approved seal on it. A FCC seal is also a sign of a well designed product. ETL is another recognized safety agency. CE approval, when it's real, is also worth something but sadly it's often NOT real on Chinese products (when challenged the manufactures argue it stands for ""China Export""--Google it). This charger has the CE and FCC seals but not UL or ETL--so I knocked a star off for that. It is, however, in a metal enclosure which makes me feel significantly better if something inside goes wrong. Most chargers are in plastic enclosures. It also runs cool (although I've not managed to push it much past about 25 watts yet). It also doesn't squeal, hiss, or buzz like some of the no-name Chinese designs. It seems both well designed and well made. - Smart vs ""Dumb"" Charging: Here's where things get interesting. Sadly, USB devices use a variety of different methods to charge at faster rates. Old school USB ports are limited to 0.5 amps of output. So to draw more than 0.5 amps and allow faster charging, some sort of ""negotiation"" has to go on between the device and the charger. Different companies sadly do this differently. Apple, for example, uses a completely different method than say Samsung. So an Apple tablet won't correctly charge (or charge at all) from a Samsung charger and vice-versa. Google Nexus/LG/Asus products are further different. A proper ""smart"" charger tries to overcome these incompatibilities by configuring itself in different ways and seeing what generates the highest charging current. This isn't a trivial thing as it's not something the devices being charged were designed for. So it requires both the proper charger hardware design and well though-out firmware in the charger. A lot of the no-name Chinese designs get this at least partly wrong. That's why you'll see a lot of complaints in reviews saying things like ""the XYZ Smartcharger charges much slower than the charger that came with my phone."" The TechMatte seems to get this part right. It appropriately charges everything I've tried. - Tested With: 1st gen iPad, 2nd gen iPad, iPod Touch 5G, Nexus 7 tablet, Nexus 10 tablet, Lenovo 10"" Win8 tablet, Toshiba Win8 tablet, LG G Pad tablet, 3 different Samsung phones, 2 different LG phones, and a Sony phone. It charged all of them at least as well as their factory chargers. This was verified with a Legion USB Meter and, in some cases, also by other means.In practice it's really nice to just have one charger handy and you don't need to worry about what you plug into it, finding the right charger, the right cable, the right port, etc. It just works and fast charges when possible. The TechMatte is one of the only third-party chargers I've found, for example, that will properly fast charge my Nexus 10 tablet (made by Samsung). It loses a star for no UL Approval but that's my only complaint. I'll follow up if I encounter any problems with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZSUSAQD0MPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NA9JQLM#wasThisHelpful","R2FZSUSAQD0MPP","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Legion is a nice device for a number of reasons. I've verified it's accurate to within a few percent using a high-end Fluke meter and it has a useful mAh (milli-amp hour) function that measures how much energy it delivers over time (something a lot of cheaper meters lack). This lets you estimate the battery capacity of a device. And, unlike the cheapo no-name Chinese designs, this device has very low insertion loss (the voltage drop caused by adding the meter into the USB circuit) which allows many devices to charge faster.Devices designed to charge at more than 0.5 amps, which includes nearly all tablets and most modern smart phones, are very sensitive to voltage drop as that's how they determine their maximum charge current. If adding a power meter causes even a few tenths of a volt drop under load, the charging current can be dramatically reduced. The same happens using cheap or long USB cables with thin gauge wire--something you can easily verify with this meter. The phone or tablet thinks the voltage drop is from the charging source being overloaded so it drops back to a lower charging current and the charging time becomes much longer.I like the fact this was a crowd funded project designed in the USA. It's also supported in the USA should you have a problem. Yeah it costs more than the no-name Chinese versions, but you really do get what you pay for.The Apple and Android modes, and the data on/off switch, provide additional options to help optimize the compatibility and maximum charging rates with various devices. If you already have a good smart charger, this device likely won't make any difference. But if you want to get the most out of a ""dumb"" charger, the options might help in some cases. And if you're using a PC port, or some sketchy public USB power port, disabling the data is a nice security feature.If you have a bunch of different USB chargers, and are not sure which ones go with what anymore, or which ones work best for a given device, the Legion will help you figure all that out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDFTN13CESTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6PKK7I#wasThisHelpful","RDFTN13CESTF","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And, on a few, like my Nexus 7 (1st gen), it reduced the charging current from 0.8 amps down to 0.5 amps making it charge significantly slower. It did nothing to help my Nexus 10 (made by Samsung), or Samsung phone, charge faster. Both charged at 0.5 amps with or without this device while both charge at much higher rates when used with their factory charger or a true smart charger.This doesn't turn a ""dumb charger"" into a smart charger like you might expect. You're better off spending a bit more and buying a decent smart charger with 2.4 amps.Unless you're specifically looking to charge Apple devices from non-Apple chargers, I wouldn't bother with this and consider trying a charge-only USB cable and/or a smart charger instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMA14Q5TR2FFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRRZ2QM#wasThisHelpful","RMA14Q5TR2FFV","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product listing states: ""Made of heavy duty materials featuring an extra thick ( inches, 6mm) cable, it PROVIDES A FASTER TRANSER RATE than most USB 3.0 data cables""Wrong! A heavier cable does NOT improve the transfer rate. A cable is either USB 3.0 compliant or it is not. The digital ones and zeros either make it to the other end of the cable intact or they don't. Thicker wire won't make those ones and zeros arrive any faster. It will either work, you'll get errors, your USB 3.0 device will disconnect, or it will fall back to USB 2.0 speeds. I wouldn't trust any manufacture making such false claims.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARKUKETW9MO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPCJMS0#wasThisHelpful","R1ARKUKETW9MO7","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beware these devices create a voltage drop and most USB devices designed to charge at more than 0.5 amps are VERY sensitive to voltage drops. That's how devices negotiate their max charging current. The ""smart"" chargers in the device (say a mobile phone or tablet) gradually draw more current from the charging source until the voltage drops below some preset value indicating the power source has reached its limit. They do this so they don't overload the charger or port either causing it to shut down or damaging it.A side effect of the way many devices negotiate their maximum current is any voltage drop from a long or thin cable, or a device like this one, will cause them to charge at a lower current than they otherwise would. To measure current there has to be a voltage drop. How big of drop depends on how well engineered the current meter is.This no-name generic Chinese meter is not especially well engineered. There are other reviews documenting it causes some devices to charge at half the current they do without the meter. That's because it has an excessive voltage drop.There's a YouTube video comparing this to several other similar devices done on a lab test bench. In general this fared relatively poorly both in terms of features and performance. The YZXStudio monitors are more expensive but offer a lot more features and lower voltage drop in their more recent models.So, in summary, a device might be accurate to a few percent in terms of measuring current. But with many USB devices, the voltage drop it creates is causing the device being charged to significantly reduce its charging current. So you end up with an error much greater than a few percent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAU19XFQ8TBEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3JSEG6#wasThisHelpful","RAU19XFQ8TBEZ","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing seems like a bargain until you try to take real-world pictures with it. The auto flash E-TTL just doesn't work right in many situations. Some pictures are properly exposed and others are horribly over exposed with much of the image blown out. This happens even with the camera in Green mode. I'm guessing the flash is sometimes miscalculating and/or ignoring the distance the camera sends it. It seems to have a serious firmware bug with the E-TTL implementation (at least with my Canon T4i, T1i and 50D--it does the same thing on all 3).The flash is also awkward to even turn on and off. You have to press and hold the power button for several seconds. If you hold the button for a few seconds until the display turns on and let go, the flash turns right back off! You have to press and hold it until the display turns on and then keep holding while the flash does this useless little display routine that someone in China probably thought was cute for it to actually stay on. It's frustrating.Battery life seems fairly poor. The same NiMh batteries that recycle nearly instantly after 50 shots in my Metz or Canon flash are barely usable after 50 shots with this flash (the power on/recycling slows to 5 - 10 seconds). And it only sort of has auto-shut. It takes forever to go to sleep and it leaves an LED on and still seems to have significant battery drain even while ""sleeping.""The price is very attractive, and the build quality seems decent, but the implementation is half baked. I also had trouble with a Neewer and other Chinese clones.

"This is a decent keyboard. One big plus is it has a thin Li-Ion built-in battery instead of a big bulge on the bottom to hold replaceable batteries. That makes the keyboard much thinner and able to slip inside some tablet sleeves as well as take up less space in a backpack. It's also very light yet the metal back adds a nice solid feel. This is a good alternative to expensive OEM tablet keyboards/docks.The keys feels decent and it paired easily with my devices, It seems to stay connected just fine. It's nice that it's readily switchable from Android to Windows to iOS. You have to get used to waking it back up when it goes to sleep (to save the battery). It takes a second or two to re-pair with your device. I think all Bluetooth keyboards have this issue unless they stay on all the time requiring you to manually turn them off (which would make for much shorter battery life).I do sort of miss not having a laptop-style touchpad mouse. For just basic email, messaging, etc. you can just touch the screen but for doing more serious work it would be nice. You can always use a small bluetooth mouse but beware some of the best ones cost nearly as much as this keyboard and it's yet something else to carry around.I knocked a star off for the cramped layout which slows down typing (but is still vastly faster than any on-screen keyboard). They would have to make the keyboard bigger to fix this issue and that's a trade off. It also sometimes drops keystrokes but not often enough to be a big problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JD8WVZGTZ6J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKW2410#wasThisHelpful","R1JD8WVZGTZ6J0","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The factory Ford tool is stamped steel with four snug fitting prongs so it can't rock back and forth on top the fuel pump ""jar lid"" like this one does. This tool is nicely rigid but only has two prongs and the slots are much too wide.No matter how I adjusted this tool, I couldn't apply enough torque to loosen the ring without it slipping off the plastic tabs (with potentially devastating results to your hand on the wrench if you're working in close quarters). After many attempts I finally used a hammer and large flat blade screwdriver to ""tap"" the ring loose. That turned out to be much easier (just don't break the plastic ring). You can tap it loose far enough to just use your hand to take it off making this tool unnecessary.I tried this tool on a Ford Ranger pickup and it might work better on rings with a different shape and different tabs.

"This pump was less than half the best price I could find on a factory (Ford/Mazda) pump and less than a third of what most shops wanted to charge. It even says ""Made In The USA"" on the top! It fit fine and, at least so far, seems to work fine. I took 1 star off because Airtex claims they supply new clips for the fuel lines with their pumps, and they're shown in the picture, but mine didn't have any. I took another off as the pump itself was loose in the Airtex box with just some plastic air bubble bags for protection. Amazon just threw that box in bigger box with no packing material at all. My pump arrived with the vapor trap at the top dislodged but I was able to snap it back into place. It's surprising the float sender mechanism wasn't damaged.Time will tell if I have any problems with this pump. But at least it's from a US company that specializes in fuel pumps, is made in the USA, and Airtex claims to be the largest aftermarket supplier. With Amazon's price nearly as cheap as the ""no name"" Chinese pumps it's likely the best choice. A mechanic told me the more expensive aftermarket pumps, from companies like Delphi and Spectra Premium, are often made by Airtex.EDIT June 11th: Even with the tank completely full the fuel gauge only reads about 95% of full. With the factory pump/sending unit the gauge would be slightly above ""F"" with a fill-up. Now it's just under the ""F"" on the gauge. There's at least one other review of Airtex pumps mentioning this issue so it seems their float or sending unit is a little off. It's not that big of deal but it's something to be aware of.For anyone replacing this pump on a Ford Ranger or Mazda pickup, it's usually easiest to remove the bed (or remove the bumper and rear wheels and slide it back) to gain access. You're much more likely to break the fuel line connectors if you try to drop the gas tank without the car on a lift, a transmission jack to hold the tank, and knowing exactly what you're doing as you can't really see the connectors. New fuel lines are hundreds of dollars from the dealer. There's a YouTube video of a guy who broke his trying to drop the tank.The bed is surprisingly light. One person can lift one side of the end of it. The hardest part are the six T55 bolts holding the bed to the frame. You'll need penetrating oil, a strong Torx bit (I bought the OTC 6111 here but a 1/2"" drive would be even better), and likely a cheater bar or serious impact wrench and impact bit.I needlessly bought the Great Neck OEM 25156 Fuel Pump Module Spanner Wrench but it didn't work. The only way I could loosen the ""jar lid"" holding the pump in place was with careful and patient use of a large flat blade screwdriver and a hammer. You don't need any fuel line disconnect tools for this pump. The two vent tubes use clips that you VERY carefully pry out to avoid breaking them. The two high pressure supply and return lines you release by pressing IN on what looks like a ""horseshoe"" tab that's tempting to pry out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62371ZWLOJXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C1KJKI#wasThisHelpful","R62371ZWLOJXE","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Insteon wall switches have a horrible reliability record. I installed over 50 of them and I'd say roughly 10 fail per year. Even some of the replacements have failed. It's a huge hassle to turn off the power, pull all the wires out of a multi-gang switch box, replace the switch, get everything stuffed back into the box (as Insteon switches are rather deep and bulky and leave little room for the wire nuts, etc.), only to have to do it all over again a year or two later. Insteon just doesn't care about quality.It's also worth knowing these things run warm even when the light is turned off. They draw a few watts of power even when ""off"" which may not sound like much but each watt is about $1 worth of electricity per year. So if you have 50 of these in your house, they're wasting $100+/year in electricity compared to conventional switches/dimmers. It's yet another example of Insteon cutting corners.It also sucks they keep changing things like the color temperature and brightness of their LEDs (or they simply buy whatever LEDs are cheapest that week). So you have 3 Insteon dimmers/switches ganged together, and after two have failed, they all look radically different. One is dim and warm white. One is a super bright bluish white. And the other is a medium bright sickly greenish white.

"The Kaito KA1102 is one of the least expensive shortwave receivers than can receive SSB but its performance is so poor I can't find any SSB stations to receive--even the huge high power ones like W1AW. It has a hard time even receiving any of the WWV time stations which even much cheaper radios can receive. Perhaps I got a lemon as there are many reports of Kaito quality control being poor.The user interface is also far from intuitive. Without the manual you'll have a hard time with this radio as several abbreviations and button functions are neither typical nor obvious. If you use it regularly I'm sure you'll get used to it but for occasional use you may need the manual. Such quirks like SSB only working on ""bank 9"" and even selecting ""bank 9"" are not obvious.The build quality is also rather poor. The buttons feel cheap and sometimes require a second push to even work. It looks and feels like a radio that should cost half as much. I wouldn't expect it to be very rugged or long lived with much use.The reception and sensitivity are marginal at best. With the built-in antenna fully extended the radio is mostly deaf from 3 Mhz to 20 Mhz. With the external wire antenna you mostly get more noise rather than more listenable signals. The AM radio band (0.5 - 1.6 Mhz) is decent but the AM/FM Sony ICF38 does better for less than half the price of the Kaito with much longer battery life (but doesn't have shortwave).Ultimately you do get what you pay for. The Tecsun radios are made in the same factory as Kaito and they likely suffer similar issues (at least at this price level). Both are examples of products designed in China to be as cheap to make as possible and it really shows in the KA1102. There are better choices from Sony, C. Crane, Eton, Grundig and Sangean but they cost more if you want SSB.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDNQ0H59IBGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00065X51U#wasThisHelpful","R1BDNQ0H59IBGW","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Perhaps his obscene wealth reduced his interest in offering quality products and acceptable customer support?I'm on my second GoPro Black Edition and both have suffered many of the same problems well documented here and elsewhere. Most notably it randomly kills its own battery in a very short time sometimes even while powered off. Some of the problems render the camera unusable in the field and are simply inexcusable. A lot of videos one uses a GoPro for are one-of-a-kind opportunities. I've already missed several with my Hero 3 as it didn't work when I needed it.Worse, instead of admiting there are serious problems, GoPro's support walks you through the same things most of us have already done (firmware updates, removing the battery, etc.) claiming they will fix the problem when they don't. They have to KNOW those things won't fix the problem, especially when a customer has tried them already, but they lie to you. How sad is that?It's one thing for a company to rush a product to market half-baked and full of bugs. It's even worse to pretend nothing is wrong when there's overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

"Most of the negative reviews of this charger are because people were expecting a fully automatic ""smart charger"" which is unrealistic at this price. But, the good news is, if you have overnight to charge you batteries, most don't need a smart charger. This is a ""trickle"" charger and, while it takes longer to charge your batteries, there's little risk of leaving the batteries charging for up to several days at a such low rate (for those who don't believe this, check the battery manufacture datasheets). It also won't cause your batteries to heat up, shortening their life, like a fast charger will.This charger is also UL listed, which is more than you can say for most of the no-name Chinese chargers being sold. Look up ""fire"" and ""battery charger"" on Google to see what happens to some no-name chargers that are not UL (or TUV, CSA, ETL, etc.) listed. To me it's not worth the risk of burning the house down. The no-name Chinese brands have little to lose and everything to gain from selling the most cheaply made products possible. While Lenmar has a significant US presence and can be held liable if one of their products causes property damage if it's poorly designed.Finally, this charger is small and doesn't need a power cord or wall transformer like many do.

"First the good news, these drives are really quiet and run relatively cool. They are also one of the least expensive 3 TB drives currently availble certified for use in some NAS models. At least with my shipment, Amazon seems to have (finally!) improved their shipping packaging for hard drives. Mine came double boxed.But the bad news is Western Digital quality control seems to either be nearly non-existant or they simply have cut too many corners with their latest large drives. I purchased four and one failed after only a month. You don't have to search very far on the web to learn many people are having problems with the 3TB Red drives. There are reports of people using these in NAS and other RAID arrays and, while they're waiting for one failed drive to be replaced, another drive fails which means they lose all the data in the entire array. Ouch!There are now only a few companies left making hard drives. It seems with little competition quality is no longer a priority. This is really sad considering how catestrophic data loss can be. I suggest doing lots of research before buying any Red drives. Check the reviews on Newegg for example and look for verfified purchases. WD seems to be rather active in ""managing"" reviews. It's too bad they don't put a similar effort into making better drives.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UG898OUHDKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JJLW4M#wasThisHelpful","R6UG898OUHDKX","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For under fifty bucks this thing is a relative bargain. The important thing with a portable TV is the reception. If you can't receive digital TV stations little else matters. The old analog stations are no longer broadcasting in most areas which means portable TVs without an ATSC tuner are nearly useless. This one has an ATSC digital tuner.I live about 5 - 10 miles from most broadcast stations and, with the built-in antenna, this TV did a decent job with most of the stations. The picture and sound are not great but good enough for occasional use. I also like that it has a video input which some of the cheap TVs don't. And the battery pack is removable which should help it stay charged if you don't use the TV for longer periods of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUMQ624REMLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W8WEGC#wasThisHelpful","R1OUMQ624REMLM","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good news is this charger folds up fairly small and is fairly light. It will charge many devices (albeit very slowly) even in overcast conditions. It's the only solar charger of this type I've tried that is at least semi-usable in less than bright sunlight. That's important--especially for emergency or other unplanned use when you can't always count on good weather.The bad news is I can see how some have received DOA chargers or had them fail. They unit uses very cheap looking solar cells and I can see how they may fail either from shipping damage or even just handling. If you put this in a backpack and carried it around for a few days it might not survive. Unlike cells with glass panels and rigid frames, the soft nylon folding case doesn't provide much protection for the cells.Many who have reported measuring the output of this charger, and  other solar chargers, don't seem to know how to measure solar output. You can't just measure the voltage with no load and measure the current into the near short circuit of a DMM as neither is realistic. Instead, you have to measure the voltage and current while it's operating with a realistic load. Measured in this way, this charger does a respectable job for its size and weight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLFVTW5DTY4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EVIWHY#wasThisHelpful","RZLFVTW5DTY4V","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's shameful TCP markets these bulbs as they do. It also seems at least some of the InstaBright line has been discontinued. Perhaps their poor performance is why?Like others here, these bulbs initially were brighter when first turned on but they quickly degrade after even 1% of their claimed lifespan. They also have shifted in color temperature to a less pleasant greenish hue. And, perhaps worse of all, I had one of three bulbs work for only a few seconds when it was first turned on and then fail completely. Of course it costs nearly as much as the bulb is worth to send it back for a replacement. I'm saving up TCP bulbs that failed prematurely and already have half a dozen to send back.Of course TCP also sells ""fresh"" (Ti) bulbs they claim clean the air! Their next bulb will probably claim to cure cancer. Other tests and reviews have shown their CFL bulbs have nowhere near the average life they claim. In short, TCP seems to be 90% marketing hype. Buyer beware.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSWK3GQP59O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LC0GRW#wasThisHelpful","R2XSWK3GQP59O9","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kaito KA1102 is one of the least expensive shortwave receivers than can receive SSB but its performance is so poor I can't find any SSB stations to receive--even the huge high power ones like W1AW. It has a hard time even receiving any of the WWV time stations at 5, 10, or 15 MHZ which even much cheaper radios can receive. Perhaps I got a lemon as there are many reports of Kaito quality control being poor.The user interface is also far from intuitive. Without the manual you'll have a hard time with this radio as several abbreviations and button functions are neither typical nor obvious. If you use it regularly I'm sure you'll get used to it but for occasional use you may need the manual. Such quirks like SSB only working on ""bank 9"" and even getting to ""bank 9"" are not obvious.The build quality is also rather poor. The buttons feel cheap and sometimes require a second push to even work. The fit and finish are sloppy. It looks and feels like a radio that should cost half as much. I wouldn't expect it to be very rugged or long lived with much use.The reception and sensitivity are marginal at best. With the built-in antenna fully extended the radio is mostly deaf from 3 Mhz to 20 Mhz. With the external wire antenna you mostly get more noise rather than more listenable signals. The AM radio band (0.5 - 1.6 Mhz) is decent but the AM/FM Sony ICF38 does better for less than half the price of the Kaito with much longer battery life (but doesn't have shortwave).Ultimately you do get what you pay for. In my experience the Sony SW7600GR, and shortwave models from Sangean, C Crane, Grundig and Eton all outperform the Kaito, are easier to use, and have much higher build quality (but do cost more). My Kaito is marginal Chinese designed junk.Tecsun is made in the same factory as Kaito and they likely suffer similar issues (at least at this price level). Both are examples of products designed in China to be as cheap to make as possible and it really shows in the KA1102.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTQCY8VWH49M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TC0NRS#wasThisHelpful","RUTQCY8VWH49M","AQOFHS4H4ELNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQOFHS4H4ELNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These come with a nylon? stitch reinforced belt bag that has enough room for other small items such as extra cell phone battery, etc.I wear glasses but prefer to remove them when looking through binocs to get the full field of view.

I did use a white marker pin to put a dot for the diopter offset for my right eye so I can quickly return it. I also put white dots on the focus knob and binoc body at 'infinity'.Love the view and as with any binoc you have to get used to finding the best settings and viewing distance for you. When all is adjusted I see only one big circle and can alternately close the left then right eye and all is in focus.There is NOT a threaded tripod hole, which would have been nice to have when I use a monopod stick for field use.Very light weight and very small even when NOT folded up.Some folks were asking about the minimum distance to subject and I can look out my windows and see the birds on my deck but I can't focus on the TV from where I normally watch it.

"This may be a fine device if you have an 'X10 system' but not for me. I use a simple X10 hand controller, with 16 buttons to turn stuff on and off, socket rocket for bulbs and lamp modules and appliance modules, etc.I expected this to work the same way but it doesn't.  You can't press an 'on button' and have this go off. Instructions say to press 'on' then 'off' then 'on' again and keep doing this as long as you want the sound. Not something you want to do when you need an alarm.As far as the sound, it's not very loud, not to me anyway and I tested it sitting next to it. It's pretty high pitched and might drive a dog nuts but nothing like my Stadium 105dB air horn.  The unit would lock up and not turn on again even with the required commands requiring me to unplug the device and reinsert it for one more single toot then stop working again.I don't know if it's important but the word ""PRO"" is not on the module as it is with some other modules.

"This is a very good Insteon 'only' controller. It can be programmed manually or even better by HouseLinc software (free).6 buttons depending how it is programmed. Makes a nice 'click' and a light flash when a button is pressed. I have the (top) of the first button to turn on my light dimmer and a quick click of the (bottom) down arrow to kill the light and 'HOLD' the bottom down arrow to dim. Nifty.I've had no problem with range. I takes 4 AAA batteries. Has a rubbery feel and non skid feet.  'NO' template is included so you can write you button names.  You use a piece of paper which is a kludge. It's not small but I like that making it easy to find. About hand size or slightly smaller.Outside of no templates the only thing I dislike is it will not send X10 signals so you may still need to keep your X10 controller.I like it and will get another on for the second story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EZ381SX07YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TRMITK#wasThisHelpful","R34EZ381SX07YM","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced the porch light switch which was in a duplex plastic wall box. Kill the power and check by flipping the existing light switch and if you have a volt meter 'use it' to verify the voltage is off.  AC voltage in the home can give you a nasty shock and depending on your health and which wires you get across (and how) it 'could' kill ya so make SURE there is no power to those bare wires.Ok, I hope you've done something like this before.  The wires extend from the switch and must be twisted around the proper box wire and a 'wire nut' screwed in to each wire bundle to hold everything together. Make sure there are no power wires that are showing bare copper. Some of those wires can kill you and some of are totally safe. Know what you're doing.The only reason I purchased the non-dimming switch is because it's a relay and I learned the hard way in my old X10 system that when a bulb burned out it often took out the dimmer but not an 'off and on appliance relay'.  This is not a dual-band device(if you're wondering) but they still work nice.It was pretty tight in the box when I started screwing it together and was glad my switch box was plastic and not metal. Again don't leave copper wire exposed on the hot leads or they may short when you try to push it into place.  It took two tries because the wire nut came loose but once in place it's beautiful and works perfectly. I'm gonna try the dimmer switch next.If you're uneasy about doing this get or hire or beg a knowledgeable person to help, you don't want a shock or fire hazard.You can link direct to a hand held controller or in my case a Passive Infrared Motion detector.  This is the Toggle Linc Relay wall switch and has a max rating of 480 Watts.  The Toggle actually stays in the center and if manually switched you just tap the toggle up or down and it returns to center.  The main points are, this is a relay and is non-dimmable. There are 4 wires coming from the module that need connected to the correct box wires.I hope this helps...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSK0VEQ8XRF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ICY0MG#wasThisHelpful","RPSK0VEQ8XRF1","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I now have 4 of these. I love them.I have a mixed X10 and Insteon system in my home. These come with a mounting 'swiveling stand off' that I feel helps with the Radio Signal by giving some space between the unit and the mounting surface, especially if mounting on a metal surface. The internal antenna is not up against your metal siding as the old X10 units were.There is a variety of jumpers that set various things and all can be externally programmed by a computer EXCEPT the sensitivity setting. Default is high and you can lower it 33% if it triggers too much. One of mine is set to actually trigger at body movement 'across the street' while another is above the door and looking down to turn on light. At night it turns on a light if there is movement around my car.  As with all products go to Smarthome website (or just search) and download the PDF file that has a full set of instructions. You get a single 'quick start' sheet in the box but I like all the details. Remember to save those PDFs somewhere you can find later 'on your computer'.I use the HouseLinc (now free) program to set what it links to but once that's done you don't need the computer unless you really want to do some fancy programming with complex settings.  The battery operated PIRs are RF and not power line operated. They send all their signals to and from the PIR over the air and not the power line so they need to be in range of an access point. It is true that the more Insteon devices (the power line devices) you have the better because they retransmit the signals.  I can't encourage people enough to use one of the free computer programs to program and monitor your units, it makes life so much easier than going to each device and you don't have to dismount the device.They are easy to paint to make them stand out or hide them. I put a strip of electrical tape around the seams and stick in a small bag of 'silica gel' in a open apace under the battery, but that's just me doing over kill again.I am so very pleased with all the Insteon products.

"This has beautiful light (1100 Lumens!) and it looks better to me than a 100 watt Incandescent bulb.The only problem I have with it and it's a deal breaker (for me) is it knocks out my X10 and Insteon networks which are part of my home automation.  I tried it in two locations neither using X10 or Insteon modules just a lamp I plug into the wall socket, and when I turn it on the two mentioned networks no longer respond for the other lights, fans, etc. Only thing I can figure is that it must be generating so much garbage on the power line it over powers the remote control power line signals.I tried it in a typical lamp socket and when turned on there is no more control by the X10 or Insteon for ANY modules.  Turn the LED off and all is well and things works normal.Next, I plugged the lamp containing the LED bulb into an 'Insteon power Line Filter'. The Filter is designed to remove power line noise that would interfere with Insteon operation and that is exactly what happened.Using an Insteon noise filter on the lamp allowed the X10 and Insteon networks to function while the LED was on (or off). Remove the filter and when on it kills all the signals.It's a deal breaker for me because expensive Insteon devices are all over my home and the places I would use this (directional light) is in ceiling fixtures pointing down and I can't install filters without rewiring which I can't do because I rent.It was NOT on a dimmer Nor was it controlled by any type of X10 or Insteon  device.Too bad, I wanted it to work. This one bulb illuminated the entire kitchen perfectly. I don't know if the interference is a characteristic of all LED bulbs but I do have one LED Bulb made By Insteon that works fine but was not as bright as I needed.  I have a CREE 60W LED that I may try but it's also dimmer than I wanted but is more omnidirectional.This bulb is non-dimmable which is fine for me and has a whopping 40,000 hours life. The light is somewhat directional.I think this is a good light. Lots of beautiful light for very little power and if you don't have X10 or Insteon it may suit you very well. It is the brightest I could find.Update and change of rating after verbal abuse from company:Well Stevie, I tried it again and again it produced so much line noise it killed both my Insteon and X10 networks so I wouldn't exactly say that it ""Easily replaces 100W Conventional bulbs in real life conditions"" it dosen't. I tried it in a real life situation and it failed to works as a conventional bulb so get over it.  You really need to work on your people skills fella. You whine so much about a perfectly good 3 star rating (which means 'ok') It's 'ok' get it? It's not great, just ok but the company policy of harassing purchasers deserves a 1 star because I really dislike your attitude. Therefore I must change my rating and recommend everyone to stay away from you and this product.The bulb is going into the garbage bin as I have nowhere I can u","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYC6OD34JW25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8ELO2K#wasThisHelpful","R3JYC6OD34JW25","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is for a USB 3.0 hub but I'm actually using it in a USB 2.0 slot on the computer because there is another 3.0 hub using the only 3.0 port on the computer. (My computer has 1 USB 3.0 and 3 USB 2.0 ports, go figure.)That's fine as I have about twice as many items that are 2.0 than are 3.0 (Today anyway).  The cord is perhaps a foot and a half (i didn't measure it) but it's too short for my needs so I purchased on Amazon ""Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type A to B Cable in Blue 6 Feet"". Note that one end is a 3.0 type A and the other is a 3.0 type B.I had a cheap 10 port 2.0 hub before with a tiny power supply and upgraded to this figuring future items will be USB 3.0 (and I'll have more 3.0 ports). There are 9 ports as stated and one 'Power only' port for 2.1A device recharging. I would rather have 10 ports available but I know some folks will have a use for the heavy duty recharging port.My only recharging is my Logitech headphone and it's recharging from one of 9 regular USB port.So, right now I have the stock 3.0 cable going into a female 2.0 jumper that goes to a 2.0 port on my computer.  This cable mess will be replaced by the above single cable.It has blue lights but at least they don't link.  The hub is now full with 9 USB 2.0 items and all seems to be working better than before.  I tried plugging it into my existing 3.0 hub but somethings didn't work properly (Headphones). The power supply is a big honk'n brick! 12 Volts and '5 Amps'!This was sold by AnkerDirect Via Amazon.I don't understand this statement: ""For maximum performance devices connected to the 9 ports should not exceed 8 Amps (total)! Unless it's getting some current from the host computer I don't understand where the other 3 Amps are coming from unless the power supply is actually rated higher than stated. (I wouldn't count on it.  Most of my 2.0 stuff is off most of the time and are connected just for convenience for when they're needed. Of course the rating was '12 Volts' (not the usual 5.0 volts) at 5 Amps and that would be 60 Watts total, perhaps that's where the extra current is coming from as a result of the voltage step down? It could just be magic. They did say 8 AMPS Max! Wow!Anyway,I arrived a day early, worked exactly as stated, not even hot but does have a short (for me anyway) connecting cable. The connecting cable from the hub to your computer HAS TO BE USB 3.0 and a 2.0 cable is not going to mate at the hub (mine didn't).Built in surge protection.Happy and would recommend this and hope the review helps with your decision as it is a bit pricy.

"Works fine and holds well and for the most part waterproof or at least water resistant.Only 'cons' are, the bottle is stiff and hard to press the glue out the tube.  I noticed some glue sticking 'inside' the bottle that 'might' eventually have to be removed if it starts blocking flow.  Nifty cap just kinds clicks in place and the entire two piece cap has a 'reverse thread' if you really need to get inside.My only other question is, now that I've used it a few times and sucked air back into the bottle how long will it remain good.I still remember those tiny metal tubes of ""Super Glue"" that you used and a month later the remainder was dried out.Only time will tell and it's still good after a few weeks of light use.I'm happy and hope this helps you in decision making.UPDATE a few weeks later:Still happy with this product but continue to have difficulty squeezing the bottle. Someone with stronger hands probably would have no problem. I just unscrew the tip and stick a screwdriver in to get a bit and use the screwdriver to actually apply to glue exactly where I want it. The glue just wipes of the screwdriver with no problem. I kinda like it that way.Some will shake their heads with my latest use. My laptop has a USB port that goes to a 7 port hub and external USB drives among other things. The connector and socket on the laptop would lose connection from time to time as I moved the laptop on my lap (It's a laptop) thus causing all kinds of serious issues with the external drives. You probably know where I'm going with this. :)  I cleaned the connections, plugged in the USB cable and put a bead of this glue around the plug much as one does 'caulking' in the bathroom and let it set overnight.  It solved my problem and has a slightly soft feel when pressed with a fingernail so I figure a bit of solvent and a screwdriver will pry it out again if I ever need to remove it. DON'T get glue 'inside' the plug or jack just the outside.  Remembering the days of serial ports and monitor connections where real screws or wire clips held the plugs in place I wonder why 'something' similar wasn't used with USB.  Oh well, sounds crazy but solved my disconnections and Windows sounding warnings and going bonkers.  As said before this stuff goes sets up clear and is slightly 'springy' not brittle.Yeah, he glued his USB connection to his laptop, must be crazy. :-) Out of the box thinking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPQFLYK5A6WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098T94KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YPQFLYK5A6WH","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Would it work on 3.o on the computer?

I can't take credit, I read that keyboards, headsets, mouse, pointers, etc 'MAY NOT' work on a USB hub if they were were designed for 2.0.Live and learn.Been using this for several Months now.

"Arrived quickly and well packaged.  I use the houselinc program and it was instantly found and incorporated into my Insteon network. NOTE: The Insteon number is on the TOP of the bulb xx.xx.xxI purchased this mostly to play with as my aging eyes have little use for a regular 60 Watt incandescent bulb let alone something shaped like an ice cream cone.I tried it in the lamp next to where I read and as expected, the light was more toward the ceiling with a shadow under the lamp. The light is very directional so remember that. It would be better suited in a ceiling fixture or to replace a low powered flood light. I liked the color temperature and colors seemed fine but the slightly less than 600 lumans is a deal breaker for me. The houselinc program allowed it to easily link to a motion sensor and with a little experimenting I was able to have it on at 10% brightness and when motion was sensed go to 100% brightness then back to the 10% level after I left the room.I would have liked to used this in my porch fixture again running only 10% which is just enough to see the door address and then switch to full brightness when someone walked up.  It will do exactly that but it needs to be brighter, perhaps equivalent to a 100 Watt bulb and OMNIDIRECTIONAL. Don expect much light to be cast toward the threaded end.If I use it indoors it will have to be in a fixture where the top is pointing down.The base of the unit does get too hot to be comfortable when I touch it but that temperature quickly subsides when off (it's only 8 Watts!).All of this is pretty much as I expected and it's fun to play with but rather than purchase several of these for an array I'm waiting for a couple of non-dimming non-Insteon LED lights to arrive, one is a 100 Watt equivalent but again it has the 'ice cream cone' shape the other (CREE) has the correct spherical shape but only equivalent to a 60 Watt.Ok, time to put my CFL bulb back in my reading lamp and find some use for this as it's too expensive to not use.Oh, these are DUAL BAND (RF and Power line signaling) devices which are really nice if you want to place them some distance from the house.So, com'on Insteon make a 75-100 Watt equivalent omnidirectional LED bulb.I wish it was a lot brighter.UPDATE (out of box application): My house (I rent) has a dual head Motion detector. It was a pain trying to get the right wattage for each light. I needed different light levels for each lamp. I noticed I heard a 'RELAY click' when it detected movement so I put these Insteon LED bulbs in and it works! I can now change the level of each bulb. The bulbs 'remember' their last brightness level when turned off. When they turn on it's at that level but I can also change it with the Houselinc program for say when there is snow on the ground Vs green grass or adjust for best security camera light level while watching the camera!

"I'm a big fan of science fiction and just grabbed this one as my first amazon movie to watch on Prime free.It was a happy accident as the film is a modern 2008 I think shoot of a fifties era alien flick except with great quality and cherry vintage cars.

"I have 4 other computers including an ASUS HD monster gaming machine.  I have a 'smartphone' but I purchased this little 10 inch ASUS to fit in-between.  This is my 'SURVIVAL computer'. No joking.  My intent is to have a computer I can 'grab on the go' and have video phone, Radio, and Internet access just about anywhere. If Internet and Cell is out, there is still a large archive of info I have transferred to read.  All my eBooks are available in the Amazon Cloud but I still download them to the Hard drive in case the 'cloud' and my account is unavailable.I hooked it up to my 1Gb home network and transferred (at 100Mb) all kinds of important files, books, maps, 'Kindle for PC program' from Amazon, Email program, program archive, etc, etc..  My disk drive has 2 partitions (which is good). Drive C contains Windows 8 (I hate) and other programs I've installed. Drive D, I use to save data.  It's just one physical drive but you treat it as two.You have a slot for SD memory card (on the right side near front. It comes with a plastic DUMMY card that you remove to use) and I decided to use mine as a location for the cache of Internet Explorer and Firefox and reduce the writing to the hard drive. This seems to work well.ASUS again for some screwy reason provides you with 3 USB ports but only one is the new Superfast USB 3.0.  The other 2 are standard USB 2.0. I don't know why they don't make them all 3.0 as they are backwards compatible even on the cables. (Look for BLUE USB cables and a BLUE insulator in the USB Jack/Plug for fast 3.0 speeds)The Ethernet port as is the old speed of 100Mb.  I want 1,000Mb so I use a 'USB 3.0 to Ethernet 1Gb adapter. Now I can use my home network at the superfast 1Gb (1,000Mb) speed. USB 3.0 to Ethernet 1Gb adapter such as ""Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter [ASIX AX88179 Chipset, USB to RJ45, LED Indicator, 18 Months Warranty]' for appx $22. REMEMBER to use Cat6 Ethernet cabling for 1Gb connection or everything falls back to 100Mb.  Yes, file transfers are faster from computer to computer and to my network storage drive.Windows 8 as in previous versions of Windows has an option to add extra memory (for some things) called 'ReadyBoost'.  It utilizes a (high speed) USP memory drive (aka Flash Drive).  Not all USB drives are useable for ReadyBoost and Windows will let you know. Appx $45 I use the SanDisk Extreme 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive SDCZ80-032G-X46. Other Flash drives can be used. I like this one as I know it works, has a light indicating activity and I used the on my Gaming ASUS larger machine that runs Win7.  There is a limit as how much memory can be used and I notice in mine Windows set aside a little over '30Gb for ready boost'! ReadyBoost is very easy to setup because you just plug it in to a USB port.Like others here, I also downloaded a free 'Classic Shell' program that gives me back my bottom left 'Start' button and displays things more like Win7 or even XP. I still  have access to the new format in the Win8 desktop if I want it. Its the best of both Worlds. Notice how Microsoft calls small programs 'apps' to appeal to the cellphone folks I guess.You can't add more memory in the traditional fashion as in swapping out or adding new chips. You are limited to the 2Gb of RAM. (But you can use ReadyBoost and USB FlashDrives).I can 'Tether' my SmartPhone to a USB port and use the SmartPhone as an Internet source. I measured 10Mb download this way.BTW I had an Internet outage a few weeks ago and learned about 'Tethering' which kept me from going crazy without Internet. This added to the decision to get something with a larger screen than my SmartPhone.I also have installed MagicJack on this mini-laptop which also has Skype. So now I have several means of communication if necessary. I keep all of this in a tote bag and will get an extra battery as backup.Only thing left for me to get is an automobile to laptop charger and perhaps a small Solar charger, perhaps fold-able.I have no problem with the mouse pad that comes with the machine I did purchase a small wireless Logitech 'couch mouse' which makes my life sooooo much easier. Someone commented about the built-in pad causing problems when using an external mouse if you accidentally touch it.  It's true you will be running BOTH at the same time HOWEVER pressing the 'fn' (special function key left lower side) and f9 at the same time will toggle OFF (or on) the built-in pad and no more accidents.My wireless works great at 'N' speeds and performance is the same as my other computers. Ethernet will always be a better connection than wireless. They both have their uses. Have NOT tried any of the local 'hot spots' yet.I wish it had handles.  Handles would make carrying it around safer and easier to tote. Perhaps I'll look for some straps for carrying when I don't want to use the bag with all its paraphernalia.I'll be looking into the ASUS boot sometime as someone recommend increasing the amount of memory to the graphics 'card'.  The only problem I have had was when it tried to run a super big business security program and there was zero CPU left. I still had RAM but no CPU available, so I need to watch the CPU intensive programs.The Power Cord fits fine and does NOT fall out.  I thought it did when it slipped out but discovered if you apply a bit of pressure it will actually 'snap' and give a firm connection. Amazing.This is the second week and I plan to update this review from time to time.I hope my comments were of help to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DOVN2JXUR8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQH8QTI#wasThisHelpful","R19DOVN2JXUR8O","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fault, I did not read the description thoroughly ""retractable CAT5e Cable"".  I have 1Gb system and all it would do was 100Mb.It would work in a pinch at reduced speeds, also the USB is NOT USB 3.0 and they did not say it was, I just expected more from a company like Belkin to be the latest since it's backward compatible.I would like to find a travel kit like this that uses the newer higher speeds for Eithernet and USB.That's what I get for 'assuming'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2AMQSFA3JDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGM3FFM#wasThisHelpful","R3N2AMQSFA3JDP","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased these USB 3.0 cables to extend my USB 2.0 wireless Headset. I Purchased 2 cables (I always get an extra).When connected it didn't work (at first). I 'jiggled' the connections but no go. I tried the second cable and all worked fine. I went back to the first cable and plugged it in and out of the computer's USB 2.0 port about six times and tried it and all worked fine. I purchase 3.0 extenders even when 2.0 would work for 'future' uses.I'm assuming the one cable had a bit of corrosion that needed cleaned off and as I had been using the computer port with no problems earlier it had to be the new cable. This isn't anything new to me and I know better but in my rush I was ready to toss a good cable in the trash and just go with the second one.I've plugged this in and out several times and there is no problem.Bottom line is, who knows how long these (or other) cables have been sitting around and in what kind of an environment.  One should be ready to scrub or clean USB and probably other cables from time to time and before first time use and don't be a hot head like me...I am happy with BOTH of these and would purchase more if necessary.I hope my review was of help to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMUKUM0XAP3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008219UMI#wasThisHelpful","R1HMUKUM0XAP3A","A274MXTX3DYLUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A274MXTX3DYLUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works great, I bought a large kitchen sized garbage can from ikea and its too big to fit standard kitchen bags in which is quite annoying so I have to get extra large kitchen bags which are basically normal sized standard trashbags and so it doesn't stay secured on the can until I got this. I was expecting a round rubber cord type composition but I probably didn't read the description thoroughly, this is more a synthetic braided outer covering overtop the inner rubber cord, kind of like some hair bands. It works great- the smaller size fit my can perfectly, its very secure, I just think having this outer covering of the band might make it less impervious to gross-ness whereas solid rubber is easy to wipe/disinfect/keep it white and clean looking. Regardless, great product and am happy with its quality so far. Seller shipped it promptly, it arrived before scheduled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28H8ODO30GA5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008E06ING#wasThisHelpful","R28H8ODO30GA5B","A16ZHJYDPDH4LI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZHJYDPDH4LI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please see my review for the smaller sizes- issue with screws that had powdercoating/paint that had come off and got everywhere (including my light carpet and my hands). The 66-120in size had beautiful screws without the messy finish, their finish was much prettier and better yet, stayed on the screws! Very elegant and classy look, very well made and sturdy.

"beautiful, well made, strong, good hardware, very elegant in appearance, well packaged (manufacturer). My only beef, and not enough to detract a star, is that the sizes smaller than the 66-120in, the screws included are painted brown and the paint is like powder that comes off, fills the bag the screws came in and got all over my hands and carpet. It made a mess and took days to come off my skin and is still not off my carpet despite numerous scrubbings and leave ins. Interestingly, I also purchased the 66-120in and those have a finish on the screws that does not come off at all!

"I spent 4 years struggling with littmans. I was swayed by the sheer availability and color choices. I eventually switched from a basic littman veterinary to a littman cardio. I couldn't hear anything. Tried different ear pieces. Didn't matter if it was large animal or small I struggled. Finally after listening to a Rottweiler/lab cross with my cardio and hearing nothing abnormal, a clinician told me to listen again and use his welch allyn. It opened up an entirely new world to me. I heard a grade III systolic murmur, and more heart and lung sounds than I had ever before. I was so excited to get one and simultaneously angry that I'd wasted years not hearing ANYTHING I was supposed to. I get great clarity and loudness whether I'm auscultating an overweight 2 ton draft horse or an adolescent rat or an tiny budgie. I can actually count the heart rate of an excited mouse. I can not only pick up extra sounds but subtle lack of sounds in chests. I can hear great GI sounds. The quality and sound is phenomenal and I also splurged on the accessory kit that included the pediatric bell for my small exotic patients and tiny kittens and puppies. I'd spend twice this much to be able to go back and avoid all the money and time I wasted on a littman. They may work for some but not for me and I have great hearing. I am so excited and in love with this welch allyn and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R246JKTX607ZHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PSRQL8#wasThisHelpful","R246JKTX607ZHU","A16ZHJYDPDH4LI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16ZHJYDPDH4LI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"HUGE. Fits a huge percentage of my clothing. Great for moving or long vacations. quality nylon and zipper. DO NOT buy if you need compartments or want your clothes to stay flat and neat and folded and wrinkle free.

"I was really looking forward to trying this sight after how much James Yaeger raves about it, and it's highly regarded as one of the best combat sights out there. They're beautiful sights, bright and crisp, solid and of high quality. Come with a nice kit of tools and loctite type stuff, directions on how to assemble it, etc. The company did a great job of making a quality product that's very user friendly. And I loved how the big front dot shows up so clearly when acquiring a sight picture, as well as the vertical line of the rear sight. Good stuff.HOWEVER ... There is a major design flaw that I could not overcome.As you can see in the picture of the sights, the rear sight is kind of a 'shelf'. If you think logically about how the rear XS sight lines up with the front sight vs other sights (a deep notch cut out in between two dots), you'll realize that when you line up the sights on target, the pitch of your aim is canted a lot higher than it would normally be with typical sights. I.E. you're aiming high. Very high.That's why in the directions, they talk about super-imposing the front sight on top of your target, and James Yaeger talked about hitting farther targets by basically visualizing away the bright white outer circle and imagining just the tritium dot super-imposing on the target.But, when you line up the sights properly, even with the front sight over the target (as opposed to under it; apple on a post), you end up shooting high. Like even 6 inches high at combat range. People say ""They're combat sights. They're not supposed to be super accurate."" However, they ~could~ be, if it weren't for the fact that the rear sight is putting your aim point too high. So I tried to adapt for a while. Tried to shoot more instinctively, focusing on snap shooting while just focusing on the front sight and the target. And I was able to do a lot better and get (vertically) much more on target. That said, though, at the range, there was just way too much unpredictability when it came to vertical placement.Ultimately, I decided to remove the design-flawed rear sight, and keep the big dot front sight, which is AWESOME. The rear sight I installed in its place is the rear sight from a Meprolight set, so now I have two rear orange dots, and the big white XS front dot, and that works really well.Incidentally, the rear sight was a real bitch to remove. The red lock tight stuff included in the kit glued the sight onto the slide so tight that I was pounding on it in a vice with lots of different tools for over an hour until the included drift tool was destroyed and I ended up having to use a screw driver to punch it out. I sure am glad I had elected to not cover the top holes of the rear sight with the loctite like Yaeger had recommended.Despite the problems with the rear sight, I'm still very impressed with the quality and design of the product, and fully intend to look into the XS Big Dot product line for shotguns, etc.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCYYHSYWRS13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ATZKLA#wasThisHelpful","R3TCYYHSYWRS13","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These steel recoil spring guides are great. I don't know if it makes any difference in the feel of shooting, but they feel nice and solid. A couple of things to take note of, however:1. If you get one with a design on it, realize that there's nothing to keep the design (like this punisher head) oriented straight up in the right position. As the slide moves, the design will move randomly, end up upside down, etc. I ended up exchanging this punisher one for a plain steel one.2. Being as these are made of steel instead of molded plastic, they are comprised of parts. I was surprised at the range the other day when the recoil rod exploded apart while I was shooting. The larger end of the recoil spring guide is a piece that actually screws onto the guide rod, holding the springs and the entire thing together. Imagine a big steel thumbtack with screw threads instead of the stabby part. After comparing the gathered parts to a similar steel guide rod I have from the same manufacturer for another caliber pistol I have, I was able to reassemble the parts. Using some heavy pliers to hold the springs down and out of the way, I applied some lock-tight and screwed the piece back in--problem solved. If I knew better, I would have seen it coming. For a while, that end had been gradually unscrewing itself over the last few trips to the range. I noticed something odd in the way of the end (pictured with the Punisher skull design on this item) protruding slightly from the end of the gun at rest. Didn't know why, couldn't figure out why it was happening, but it didn't seem to be hurting anything, so I let it be. Now, I will be watchful and inspect this aftermarket rod every once and a while to make sure the screwed-on end isn't backing off again.They say that this upgrade is totally unnecessary, as the Glock factory recoil spring guide rod works just fine and never really breaks. They also say that if it DID break, the Glock factory recoil spring guide rod is something that ~could~. So I like this steel one. But be aware that you may have to maintain it from time to time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKESBR5019F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD5B7KS#wasThisHelpful","R1XKESBR5019F0","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty good solution to carrying Glock .45 magazines. I've had a hard time finding an OWB single mag holder for double stack Glock .45 mags (21). The OEM Glock plastic one was too flimsy and didn't fit well on a wide belt, most blackhawk ones, etc., are too tight for a .45 (although they work great with my 9mm), cloth ones by Voodoo Tactical, etc., are too bulky and have mixed QC results (I got one with a broken stitch).This one ended up working very well. Soft leather. Looks good. And like other reviewers have said, it kind of looks like something else other than a magazine. Like some sort of cell phone case at first glance. Being horizontal, it doesn't stick up past your belt, where vertical ones might rub your back or otherwise annoy you from time to time. Depending on where you put it on your belt, it might get in the way of putting your hand in your pocket, or it might not get in the way at all. Took a little trial and error to figure out.Attaching it and detaching it from your belt is easy enough. However, the one week point I see there is the velcro. Having a thick magazine in it like I do means that feeding it through my belt and attaching to (attachment) strap from the top means that there's only about half as much purchase as you see in the stock picture. I can see the velcro becoming worn out over time, and maybe starting to have trouble with it accidentally detaching from the belt while going about my day. Who knows. But it would have been nice if there was something more secure there. Like maybe an adjustable clip.A Glock 21 magazine is pretty big for this, and is a snug fit, but not too big that it'll be hard to pull the mag out if I need it. Obviously, double stack 9mm mags and others would fit just fine. There's a good amount of adjustability. However, with smaller mags, it seems that the more you adjust by tightening down the magazine retention strap, the more you'll cut into the velcro area that the belt attachment strap needs. So there'll be a point where a thin enough or short enough mag wouldn't fit.You can see in my picture that I'm wearing it to the rear of my EMT pouch (knife, light, pen). Wearing it too far forward (in front of the EMT pouch) made it stick out in a weird place on my side that got in the way. Behind, however, is perfect, because I don't notice it, and being that my EMT pouch is dropped a little, they fit together efficiently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NR4F1D8CYPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VMX9U#wasThisHelpful","R29NR4F1D8CYPU","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're looking for extended parts for the Glock 30s, this is it. I had a hard time finding an extended slide release that would fit a .45 size Glock in the stainless steel (as opposed to black) finish. First, I tried ordering the ""Ghost"" slide release, but that one ended up being too flimsy and not flush enough against the side of the 30s (I.e. was susceptible to catch something).The extended slide release supplied in this kit fit just fine, and works well. The pins swapped out easy and look good. And the take-down levers are also great. I never intended to use those, as I had already ordered an installed a stainless steel Lone Wolf take down lever. But I installed this one on another Glock, and the way that the grips are angled make this one even easier to use than the typical (Lone Wolf or OEM) extended take down levers.

"These look awesome online, and in person, until you realize that its apparent mass-production leaves a lot to be desired in quality control. This particular seller made continuous mistakes sending me the right color mask, so I had the opportunity to see three separate products. Each had their own unique problems with symmetry, and it seemed that after the masks were heated and shaped, they were each 'skewed' by varying degrees as if they weren't properly protected when cooling, or as if they were squished to one side or another.As other reviewers have mentioned, the design is very hard on the bridge of your nose. The placement of the foam inside is poor and insufficient (and not centered), and the way the straps hold the mask on by pulling it toward your face, if you want to keep it secure enough to play airsoft, amtgard, whatever, your nose will take the pressure. I had to buy a softball nose protector-cage-thing to attach to the inside of this mask to make it work.So it looks really cool, and visibility is very good too with the side windows.

"I bought this book as a potential gun-themed children's book, also to support the cause, and also to provide some support in the face of all of the bogus reviews steeped in liberal BS and sarcasm. (Is there a single 'real' review here?)While I support the open carry movement and love the idea of a book like this, there were just several ways in which the authors failed to accomplish what this was supposed to be. One thing to note, while it's not a big deal, but it was a surprise--this book is large. 8.5"" by 11"". For some reason, I expected it to be smaller.This book depicted a 13 year old main character, Brenna. It didn't really mesh with the design of the book. Many 13 year olds are reading adults books, and this book, with its large print and illustrations, seemed more like it was aimed at maybe 8-10 year olds. Maybe that's because the authors wanted to make her a little older so it'd be less controversial when her parents took her shooting at the end? Who knows. But it seems aimed for 8-10 year olds, but they're supposed to identify with 13 year olds, and then the writing style is basically aimed at adults, which brings me to the next point.As far as a story, it's terrible. I've seen this in a lot of 'libertarian fiction', but it's really bad here. The narrative is the loosest attempt to deliver the ideals of open carrying and its arguments into a story. This book doesn't know whether it wants to be a children's story (for 8-10 or 13 year olds ... who knows) or a long article about the arguments and merits of open carry. There are ways in writing to deliver the semi-political points an author wants to make without bashing people over the head all the time with dry and lifeless talking points. Like realistic dialogue. And concrete examples of abstract points. And not having characters say stuff that real people would never say in day to day life. Kind of like, ""You just never know when you might need to protect yourself and love ones. People wear seatbelts and have fire extinguishers. They hope to never need them, but it's best to be prepared, I always say!""As a children's book, this is a fail. It may be best approached as a novelty item for adults, and a compressed explanation about open carry, its arguments, its merits, and a few author opinions that aren't necessarily consistent with the rest of the gun loving world (like the parents keeping their daily carry pieces locked up in a safe. Practical gun owners who carry daily and have a 13 year old kid who has been around guns all her life wouldn't need to lock up their guns. Their kid would be well educated. Or the author's interpretation of the 2nd Amendment and the 'militia' thing.)I would read this to my kids if it was written for kids, but it's not. Still not a bad booklet about Open Carry, though.**Edit**After reading through some of these reviews some more and seeing how polarized reviewers are about this little book, I'm amazed at how many gun-haters there are on Amazon, and I'm certain that my 'helpful reviews' rating will plummet now that I've jumped into this, because I'm clearly outnumbered.Do take note, folks contemplating this book beyond the tip of a smug, bigoted leftist nose, the number of reviews here that are *not* Amazon Verified Purchases. I guess a lot of ugly-spirited people love to waste their time spouting off in the wrong place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZLL3UVWOF5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618081012#wasThisHelpful","R3RZLL3UVWOF5Q","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Last Winter I was beset with a terrible lingering cold/flu that went on and on, and my typical medicines and self treatments weren't gaining any ground. So while researching further remedy, I came across a YouTube video of a woman demonstrating how she used one of these to clear her sinuses. I went to Wal-mart and bought a pack with one rinse bottle and 50 packets.I'm very impressed with this product's ability to clear your sinuses. It does work well; there's a reason it's got so many good reviews. Mixing with warm water from the shower and adding a packet made a rinse that didn't burn my sinus cavities, and it seemed to work really well and left me feeling better temporarily.However, I'm pretty sure my misuse of this product made me go deaf for a while. In the video I watched, the woman demonstrated spraying up into the nostril while making a 'howking' sound/action, which forced the water through the sinuses and to the back of the throat. When I tried to repeat the motion as expertly as I could, forcing the water through and trying to suppress my gag reflex, I didn't think much of the fact that I was also filling up my middle ear with the rinse solution, forcing the solution up my Eustachian tubes.Today, when I read the directions, I can see a single sentence saying that if you feel water in your ears, to STOP using the rinse. Back then, thinking that I was doing it properly, looking back, I think I forced all that phlegm yuck and infected junk up into my middle ears, and filled them with a soup of toxic stuff about to be attacked by bacteria.Over the next several days after starting to use the product (incorrectly forcing the solution up my Eustachian tubes), my cold developed into bad sinus blockage headaches, then into an ear infection. One day, I found my middle ears were full of fluid (and toxic nastiness), were unable to drain through the Eustachian tubes, and at around lunchtime, the pressure became so great and painful that my eardrum ruptured. Later that night, my other eardrum ruptured, leaving me 95% deaf. My ENT doctor the next day told me that it was the worst ear infection he'd ever seen, and it took over 2 months to heal and regain my hearing.This is a great product, and I still have it, and will likely try it again to clear my sinuses, without the howking action that forced the solution into my inner ears. Without the howking action, it just sprayed up one side and comes down the other, as well as draining somewhat in the back of the throat as well. But be careful how you use it, and make sure you're learning to use it from the right source (the directions), because it can cause serious damage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5N2WNZCBKFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7QMYE#wasThisHelpful","RO5N2WNZCBKFK","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so pleased to see when I received this item that it was based on the Walther/S&W P99. My girl and I purchased a couple of these after a fun evening playing shooting games in an arcade. Always looking for new ways to train for speed and accuracy of firearm handling, I thought this would be the bee's knees, especially when I found that it's design was the same pistol as my real gun.Unfortunately, despite the great quality of the product (great trigger pull too), the Wii, with its one sensor bar, is just not up to the level of technology required to be calibrated for accurate aiming at the screen. The cursor on screen cannot line up vertically with the gun sites (the cursor is always too high when the sensor is below the TV, and too low if the sensor is on top), and as you aim further and further to the left and right edges of the screen, the cursor goes farther and farther out of alignment horizontally to the outside.So, what this effectively ends up being is a Wii pointer in the shape of a gun, where the gun's sites are meaningless, and you end up aiming by using the cursor, which I guess is better for shooting games than just using the remote by itself. But if you're into firearms and you think that this will improve your ability to snap-shoot? It won't. At best, it'll just get you more comfortable with quickly maneuvering something in the shape of a handgun. And it's fun as hell for the kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LC5D1RDLAGIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIHJ1N0#wasThisHelpful","R1LC5D1RDLAGIA","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to tell from the title or description of this hat (the model number listed is even wrong), but this is an ""Epoch"" brand hat, model HE30. You can see the Epoch logo on the cloth band on the inside of the hat. If you research Epoch, you'll find that they don't have much of their own independent presence on the internet, but they're listed a lot on ebay as Epoch.I've been searching for good Fedoras for a couple of years now with no real hat stores where I live, and frequently play hat roulette on Amazon. My size is pretty big, and it's hard to find stuff that actually fits. Hats sized as ""L/XL"" are too small on me, and most ""XL's"" are too, so I have to go more by measurements, and that's a gamble too.I ordered an XL of this hat because it claimed an inner circumference of 24"". It ended up fitting pretty perfect, maybe a tad loose. The hat itself is of good quality, soft, crushable, and easily as nice as many scalas, stetsons, and others I've seen. I have the black one, but if you ordered this in brown, it would fit in among the ""Indiana Jones"" style hats that are all over Amazon. If you look at the hats sold by Sakkas (no mention of the brand Epoch), or the listings for similar Epoch hats on Ebay, you'll see the technical specs vary a bit. The brim of this hat is 2.5"".Satisfied. About to try another Epoch.Update - Even though it started a little too loose, it seemed to conform to my head a little better (tighten somehow?) and fits perfectly. I did end up trying to buy another Epoch hat from this vendor, a teardrop fedora with a 2"" brim that similarly claimed a 24"" circumference, but that one ended up too small. So sizing is still a gamble, even with this brand. But this particular hat, the HE30, was a gamble that paid off.

"Bought this after looking everywhere for something to satisfy the concept of holding my pocketknife and a pen, possibly other pocketries. I have a Remington 3.5"" folding knife that I use frequently, but have had a hard time finding something in which I could carry it on my belt. I carried it in (what could effectively be described as) a belt pouch for a while, but couldn't access it quickly. So I tried this, and it works pretty well.This EMT pouch has four compartments. A sleeve in the back (for scissors), which I keep empty, the velcro-flapped pouch in the middle, where my knife fits very well, and two different sized loop sleeves on each side, where in the picture you can see a flashlight and a pen.In reality, the 'flashlight' tube works perfectly for a typical click gel pen, and the tube showing a pen in the picture is too small for all but the thinnest pens. It would be nice if the tubes were the same size so I could carry two pens there, but as it is, all I carry in this pouch is my knife and one pen, and I'm fine with that. Good, tough fabric.

"So, to be honest, I made my way here because I was looking for chew toys that would be good for adult humans. :)Incidentally, by boy was also born with problems that led to feeding issues and delayed oral development, problems with textures, etc. It took a long time to transition him to solid food, but he's a lot better now. Back then, we used those 'NUK' sticks, but this would have been a great item to help him if only it was more well-known. Never even heard about these things from feeding therapists or anyone else!Anyway, I purchased two. One for me, and one for him.As far as my son goes, he's currently 3 years old, and he's played with and chewed on this some, but hasn't been too interested in it. As I said, I wish I knew about these earlier. It's a great, high-quality chew, with multiple textures, and would have been very helpful in fixing all those oral problems. Would have been great for teething too, even earlier. This would have been far superior to teething rings and such.So for me. I've got some bad habits of eating when idle (even though I'm not hungry), and I've always chewed on pens, etc., so I had an idea some time back to find a good chew toy appropriate for a human mouth that could fill that need and avoid taking in the extra calories. Maybe burn off a little stress, too. Eventually I found my way to these 'grabbers', settled on this one, and I'm pretty happy with the product.Great quality. And the silicone it's made of is pretty invincible. Just so you know, this isn't like a hard rubber. It's CHEWY. Like chewing on soft rubber. I've been careful with the force I applied at first to avoid damaging it, but it seems no matter how hard I bite down, even with the sharp parts of my molars, it springs back, and the surface is totally unmarred. Although, I suspect I could damage it if I tried.So far it's fulfilled its purpose of something to chew on idly while at the computer. And it's had plenty of positive effects, which may be worth some consideration for all 'normal folks' who might think adult chew toys are weird.There really is something to the marketing of dog toys when they talk about cleaning a dog's teeth and strengthening their gums. As I chew on this, lots of things happen:- The little texture knobs press between my teeth and massage my gums.- My mouth produces saliva, which helps regulate the glands and also cleans my teeth.- The rubbery texture rubs against my tooth enamel and leaves my teeth feeling clean.- Obviously, chewing this grabber will strengthen your Masseter and Temporalis muscles, and probably the smaller jaw muscles, too. (Which makes the muscles a little sore for the first few days, as can be expected.)After I chewed on this for a while the first time, when I was finished with it, my gums felt like I just flossed 15 times, and my jaw felt like the alignment was different (straightened out). I've also taken the time to stretch my jaws apart after lots of chewing, since chewing on this was basically just the 'concentric phase' of an exercise, and I didn't want the muscles to tighten up. Going from 'never focusing on chewing' to suddenly 'lots of chewing' needs to be approached like any other exercise, including stretching and being careful not over-do it.We humans can probably get a lot out of regular chewing exercise just like dogs do. Apparently, TMJ (lockjaw) results from the atrophy of these muscles, and doctors have directed their TMJ patients to jaw exercises. So here's another thing we can do to keep a totally overlooked set of muscles healthy. A couple of days after I started chewing on this grabber, I flossed my teeth (I hardly ever floss; I know, I know), and the flossing didn't stress my gums AT ALL--because my gums had been exercising and were stronger.**Update**2012-12-26 - It's no longer a workout for my jaw (the muscles have grown stronger and adapted), but the silicone HAS weakened enough to where those time texture nubs have started coming off. The nubs are about 1/8"" x 3/16"" oval-shapes, not really a choking hazard.**Update**2012-12-30 - Haha ... so okay, the nubs have continued to come off, and now the silicone on the long end isn't as 'springy'. In fact, it's losing its structural integrity on the inside, and starting to split (from the inside out), so this definitely won't last much longer. I'm having to be more gentle with it now for fear of tearing it open. I could always chew on the loop end (as I idly chew on it, as you would a pen, while typing here), but that's pretty awkward to chew on without using your hands too.**Update**2013-01-27 - Okay, so this is good, but it won't last. From the last update to now, whenever the end starts 'fraying', I cut it back with some scissors. By now, this slightly 'P' shaped chew toy has become more of a 'U'. I can see it would be possible (but difficult) for a child to bite (vigorously pull) off a chuck big enough to be a choking hazard, but not likely. As a parent, you'd just have to monitor it every once and a while. The 'nubs' do break off eventually, whenever they're in the current focus area, but even though they might end up in your kid's mouth, they are too small to be a choking hazard. So your kiddo might get a few tony pieces of silicone in his tummy, but he won't choke on it. I suppose any chew toy, no matter how awesome, will wear down eventually.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ENRCTFK167Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018BWKQM#wasThisHelpful","R29ENRCTFK167Y","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this as a gift for a friend who likes death metal. Upon receiving the package, I used it myself to prepare some files for him and evaluate the drive's performance.Quality of the outer housing is so-so. Novelty, obviously. But if you wanted a real flash drive, there's plenty of those out there to choose from, right? Well, there's a push switch on the backside of the skull which allows you to slide the drive port in and out of the housing on the bottom. The USB port attachment, which typically metal on nearly every single flash drive on the market, is just white nylon plastic. So delicate. Be careful. The speed is below average, showing around 2-3 MBps when writing files onto the drive.It's a fun gift, but for use as a flash drive it's mediocre at best (suitable if you don't care).","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271FEZPUWEFWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SHHY6E#wasThisHelpful","R271FEZPUWEFWQ","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:55 MinsGreat little card holder. Looks good, feels good. Good quality. Great value.Here's a video so you shoppers can see exactly what it looks like.** Update 2 1/2 Years Later **I've still got this case and carry it in my pocket full of business cards every day. It still snaps closed pretty securely. The leather shown in the picture are like panels of metal with the fake leather coating the outside, so the leather has worn away on the corners, revealing the metal underneath. The panel on the underside has warped a bit to be concave in a way that the corners are trying to pull away from the main body of the case. If I wanted to, I suppose I could pull up on a corner and rip the panel from the case. Don't know how strong it's held on there, but I won't test it. It's still functional, but not very pretty anymore. I typically carry about 12 cards inside.I also have a soft leather card holder that I use for secondary wallet stuff (store rewards cards, etc), which has rounded at the edges as its aged since it's soft.

"It's nice. Brilliant white, sharp as hell, it is a Fedora more than some sort of Panama hat, so it you're looking for a white classic Fedora, this works. Lots of contradicting info in the reviews. But the brim IS just as long as in the picture. And the edges do snap, but not reliably. For mine, the back edge is snapped down, and if I try to snap it up, it snaps up the front too, so it's basically a turned-down brim--not like a Trilby like in the third picture. I put a feather in the side.Because it's straw, I've been terrified of how delicate it seems. When I try to pull it off or put it on with the pinch, I feel like I'm going to crease it and tear it, so I set it atop my head and push down into place from the sides. Pushing up from the sides under the brim is also how I take it off. I don't know if I CAN treat it like a normal hat and don't have to be so very careful with it, but it cracks and creaks with every move. Once I had an itch on my head, and my fingers went up to scratch it through the hat as a reflex, and CRUNCH. But the more I wear it, the more it seems to be softening up and seeming more sturdy. I also sprayed Scotch Guard on it in the beginning, which made it crackle a lot for a while whenever I touched it. But not anymore.The inside headband is an elastic cotton band. Works great, and holds it snug to your head. Sometimes TOO snug, but it loosens up. It seems the hat shrinks a bit in the heat. Some reviews say you don't have to worry too much about the size, and some say they got by well ordering a size down. Don't buy it. Order your size, or a tad larger if you're feeling adventurous. Which brings me to the bad point:(Oh, side tangent--mine also came in a box that was too narrow and making the brim curl up on the sides.)Dealing with the company and returns is a real pain. And if you don't fight for what's right, you'll be screwed. As you can see you have to pay for shipping. No Prime here. So my hat came to me, after I used the sizing chart, and was too small. The company actually expected me to pay for shipping again to send it back, and pay AGAIN to have the replacement hat sent back to me. That's THREE TIMES. Almost the price of the hat.Anyway, I got Amazon to give me a credit for the cost of shipping it back (good 'ole Amazon). Then Ultrafino (who I went back and forth with multiple times by email and phone, and they usually didn't answer their phone) intended to process and refund the old hat; told me to order the new size in the meantime. I paid the shipping for the second hat, since Amazon had already credited me the previous shipping. THEN I learn that Ultrafino only intended to refund me the purchase price of the first hat and KEEP the shipping charge I paid initially. So I got her to agree to refund the shipping too. Later, when the refund went back to my bank account, it was lacking the shipping charge, so I had to call back and have them refund me the additional amount. She said she'd process it that day. A week went by with no results. Finally after threatening to start a dispute with Amazon, she processed the additional refund for the original shipping.So finally, after a lot of haggling and hassling, I had a hat that fit me while only paying for the hat and shipping once. And I'll give Ultrafino credit for eventually agreeing to do the right thing, but they sure made it difficult.Great hat, but you'd better get it right the first time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AU85YOIK8D0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YDUVQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3AU85YOIK8D0S","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tried all sorts of ways to rig it to make it work, but it wasn't going to happen.The top mount is attached to my guitar at a bit of an angle, and when I locked the strap on (which locked on perfectly), the fact that the end of this strap, containing the mechanism is solid plastic (vs the soft bendy leather/whatever of normal straps), the strap lock did not conform to the guitar in an appropriate way, and stuck out awkwardly to the side.This while this strap is a nice concept, its application to my guitar absolutely didn't work.

The Dollar Sign design does, however, get in the way slightly when trying to push your money into it because of the extreme end of the 'S' that can snag the bills a little. Happy with my purchase.Update:I still carry this around, but it's not working exactly as a money clip any more. Got tired of the folded bills eventually working their way loose, so now the money in there is also wrapped with a rubber band. And the edges are sharp and poke at my leg through the pocket liner.

"This is definitely not 80 Lumens. The spot and concentration of the beam is much wimpier than it should be. I bought this to replace a Coleman that was somewhere between 75 and 90 Lumens, and that light TOTALLY put this light to shame. And the momentary switch of the tail-cap is very stiff--doesn't respond very well. Too easy to flicker accidentally when you fidget your thumb. I've definitely had better. Nothing tactical about this; I wouldn't trust it to use in tandem with a pistol.The metal housing is nice and solid, but the lens is obviously that cheap, thin plastic. The lanyard is low-quality, and is held on by a plastic collar, which I can see breaking in the future.Disappointing, but cheap enough (on sale for $20.xx) to avoid returning, and keep in a random 'I need a flashlight' place by the bed or whatever.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUT6H6INJUIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00175I0TK#wasThisHelpful","R1AUT6H6INJUIR","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:23 MinsYou'll have to excuse the quiet audio and initial poor lighting. Blackberry 9700's don't take great video, and it took me a round or two following the kids on the bike to realize that things would look a lot better if I actually turned the lights on. :/I didn't buy the YBike from Amazon, because I found a much better deal from a toy salesman selling his demo model. But this thing is cool. I bought this for my son, who's pretty small, just over two, and a bit behind on development from being born early and spending some time in the NICU. This kids in this video are my sister's, a little older than my son.Since I've taken this video, my son has tried the bike and is warming up to it. He's pretty young for it still, and a little tactily (spelling? 'relating to tactile contact') defensive. But he loves the bike. He's just getting comfortable mounting it, and is more comfortable pushing backwards than pulling forward. I know this will do great things for his balance. My son is just about (or right under) three feet tall, which means something like a 10-11 inch seat height, and he can sit on this just right, with his feet flat on the floor.Very sturdy toy. And a great thing to start with when the kids are still small and learning balance. Get a Strider or something later, when they've mastered movement of their own bodies. As you can see, however, even when they're older (the kids here are 4 and 6) and perfectly mobile, they still love these YBike Originals. They're a lot of fun. There's also a YBike Advanced, which is less stable and capable of going faster, turning sharper, etc., which I've recommended to my sister for the 4-year-old, who's having trouble figuring out the pedaling concept on a normal kid bike.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZZRNCUCSUC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KZP6L4#wasThisHelpful","R3PZZRNCUCSUC5","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So for those of you who looked around all over for a high-vis parka, here it is. It's great, it's less expensive than a lot of alternatives.This IS ... since there's no way to really tell ... a shell parka only. There's no insulation, no fleece inside, no removable liner, etc. Just a shell. Seems to be very weather resistant, though that hasn't been put to the test for me yet. This is a 3/4 style jacket, so it goes down the legs a bit, far past the waist. And it looks very sharp.It could use better pockets. For work, it would be more convenient to have better-designed pockets. I've seen other models (or other year's versions) of this jacket that have, for instance, normal hand-warmer pockets behind the two big cargo pockets on the front. The cargo pockets are held only by a velcro top, and there's definitely room for more pockets (document pocket, etc.), but it only has the two.The wrists are elastic, and there's a hood that folds into the collar. The jacket has that type of zipper that has a pull on the top and the bottom, so you can have a varying degree of zippered area, or just zip it like normal and leave the bottom pull all the way at the bottom. There's a drawstring for pulling in at the waist and another at the very bottom. The snaps are plastic, and could be sturdier. Pretty good parka, though.I'd order a size up; it seems to run a little small. You'll also need room in there for insulation layers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NT97IS14VVSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WEU7PO#wasThisHelpful","R1NT97IS14VVSN","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:15 MinsI totally forgot to say something VERY important in this video when I was talking about sizing issues with a previous order of the Trail version of the Minimus, and got side-tracked by talking about the sole or something. But take note. I normally wear size 9 4E shoes. I've ordered the Minimus in the past (direct from New Balance), and ordered a 9.5 2E (the widest these get), but it wasn't big enough--they caused foot pain. With THESE Minimus MX20's, I ordered a FULL SIZE higher than I normally wear. 10 2E. And that seemed to do it. No pain. So, wide feet? Go a full size up.If I end up having problems with these shoes later on, I'll update this description. Enjoy the video.Notes added as time goes by:- The shoes are so light, it's like I'm wearing slippers or water shoes.- Ground feel is considerably less sensitive than true minimalist shoes like Vibrams, but still more sensitive than normal shoes.- On this particular model, the circle-patterned soles don't have much in the way of traction. Very slippery on ice.2012-07-01 - Still wearing these shoes on a daily basis. Still super comfy. Holding up well, minimal wear on the soles.2012-09-16 - Still wearing daily. Seams, stitching, fabric, mesh--all holding up fantastic. No unraveling starting anywhere. The ONLY wear this shoes has been taking is the soles wearing down. Probably at about 50% now. Still plenty wearable, but will soon be flat, therefore no grip. Didn't really have any grip to begin with on slippery surfaces, so once the snows come, these will be put away until next year, I think. Still happy with them, still comfortable. Great for everyday life, great for working out.2012-11-01 - With the onset of winter, I've stopped wearing these shoes daily because they're totally vulnerable to water, and (as I remember from last winter) have no traction in slippery conditions. Back to 'normal' New Balance cross-trainers.2012-12-15 - Incidentally, I've noticed over the course of the year with these shoes, that I've developed some heavy callouses/bosses above some toe joints, and I was starting to experience serious pain/inflammation of the joint where my big toe connects with my foot. I thought I might have been developing GOUT for some reason. Now that I've been wearing 'normal' shoes for the last month or so, that joint pain is gone, and the callouses are going away. I don't think these shoes were good for me in the long run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IS8MG1RI5DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NGGEO4#wasThisHelpful","R38IS8MG1RI5DZ","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Don't plug the camera in before you start the installation.Great camera. Enjoy the vid.Updated annoyances:- The software does weird stuff if you've got a two monitor setup. Clicking between different 'mode' will make the interface window JUMP back and forth between both screens. Just an annoyance.- The Audio mic is okay, but not as nice as I originally thought. After I've made a few acoustic music videos for YouTube, I've been annoyed by the mic's distortion and splash when I hit high notes or sing loudly. Also, whenever you turn the cam software on, ""right sound"" is checked on by default, which applies a weird low-quality compressor and noise gate to the recorded audio, which means that if you're playing guitar and singing, those filters will destroy the result. Which is also really annoying, especially if you forget it on when you record a song, finally get through an entire take, then watch the video--and ""Right Sound"" screwed it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FY24OSDBXT0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LVZO8S#wasThisHelpful","R1FY24OSDBXT0Z","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Received a Coby Kyros MID8125-4G as a gift, and MAN it's been hard to find aftermarket stuff for it. Well, after much research, and seeing another few reviews, it looks like THIS was the case for the 8125. Although I wasn't totally sure until I received it and put the tablet inside.It works. It's pretty nice. I didn't have to do anything funky with USB settings or anything for the keyboard to work. The fact that it has a 'prop' on the outside of the tablet side is kind of nice--makes the tablet into something like a laptop. Construction seems good enough, and the keyboard, while small, is definitely a step up from using the touchscreen keyboard, which is even smaller.Pros:- Has two loops on the inner binding for attaching a couple of styluses. (One is included.)- Nice vinyl / semi-leather feel and look.Cons:- This was designed with no thought to where the cable connecting the keyboard to the tablet will be stuffed away and rest. Not to mention the USB female to Mini-USB Male adapter (comes with your 8125, is required to hook up the keyboard). So when it's closed up, you can keep the cable in the binding (sort of) with the dongle just hanging out like a bookmark. And the adapter cable? Who knows where that could fit. Hang out the other side if you're patient enough to close it right. It would have been REAL nice to make some sort of pouch built in somewhere to hold the cables, because there's nowhere for them to go away to.- The magnetic closure is weak, especially when you've got the cover jammed shut over a couple of ill-fitting cables with nowhere to go. I saw another reviewer solved this problem by adding a velcro dot. I'll probably do that too.- No USB power is routed to this keyboard, which means the Caps lock, Num lock, and Scroll lock don't work. Which isn't really a big deal, because you don't need them anyway. There's still a 'shift' key after all.- Definitely adds a lot of size/bulk to the tablet. Not as slick and thin to carry around anymore.Overall not bad, with a really annoying flaw.

" 1:00 MinsFor a while I was trying to figure out a way to replace my old Remington 870 furniture with something synthetic, AND figure out a way to put a good light on there. After looking over all manner of replacement stocks and forends, usually packaged together, along with lights with pressure switches that need to be mounted on the magazine tube, etc., I ended up going this route for a few reasons:- Replacing the furniture with a full stock/forend set, especially if I wanted Speed-feed or something AND a decent light (and mount) would be almost $200 or so for decent quality. What I ended up doing cost me a little over $80.- Replacing the old (SOLID) wood stock with something new would reduce the ability to use the stock as a blunt weapon, especially if I got one of those flimsy tactical AR types.- Most forends with rails were TOO tactical, which would be uncomfortable to use (full rails), or too heavy, and getting a pressure switch light would mean another mount and a cord hanging to get caught up in the action. A major advantage of a shotgun is SPEED, so I wanted to keep it light and fast and not be a gear ninja (mall ninja, gear whore--whatever).This stock is great. Good value, looks fantastic, and good rails that aren't overwhelming. It would be nice if the grip had a more 'rubbery' feel than 'plasticy', but it's okay. I ended up mounting the light on the left rail, back enough where I can easily manipulate the switch with my thumb.The light is also reviewed here:NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP230 - weapon light","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARKJ7RZWE18P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0GPZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3ARKJ7RZWE18P","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:00 MinsJust got this light in the mail today, so I haven't shock-tested it yet. That said, I looked at a LOT of lights before I ordered one, basing my choice on reviews, lumens, features, price, being low-profile, as well as suited for my needs: to put a light on a shotgun that was simple, cheap, reliable, and would keep my shotgun light and fast (don't want to be a farkle ninja).The first thing I noticed about the light is that it's made of aircraft aluminum, where it appears to be plastic in the pictures (I should have read closer, I suppose), and feels very sturdy.Oddities:- It comes with two back-plates (for the batteries). Don't know why. They don't seem to have different effects or anything--it's almost as if they gave you a backup for some reason.- When you're putting the batteries in, the O-Ring isn't seated very well, and falls/folds/slides in with the batteries or out of place pretty easy, so you must use surgical precision when putting in the batteries. No big deal, though.There are three different light modes: bright (full lumens), less bright (still pretty bright--maybe half lumens), and strobe, and you must cycle through these (which is a slight annoyance to me, but I don't know of any alternative). The switch is a revolving switch, kind of like the cylinder on a revolver, on the back end. Which you can cycle through it (click, click, click) to keep the light on or off, or just push it slightly with your finger/thumb in one direction or the other to have a momentary effect. Even if you push it momentarily without clicking it into the next position, it still cycles through bright/dim/strobe. This means I'll ahve to get very familiar with using it, so I'll always know the order if I'm stalking around or something and suddenly want to use the strobe, for instance.Fits great on a pistol, and is super easy to use with your off-hand index finger. Putting it on my similarly new Mako Forend for my Remington 870 shotgun (what I purchased the light for), on the left-side short rail, it's pretty easy to operate with my thumb. Also easy enough to cycle the action while holding the switch as a momentary light.Compared to other lights I read reviews about, it looks like this light is more likely to hold up to the shock. If it doesn't, I'll update this in the future.Great value.P.S. - Here's the forend that I reviewed separately:Mako Remington 870 Handguards with 3 Rails","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPOTBU40YUVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BNTX96#wasThisHelpful","R2LPOTBU40YUVZ","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course, I have a big belly. Maybe skinny folks won't have that problem.

"So when looking into the whole 'EDC' phenomenon, which I fell into as I was looking into options for something like a 'belt-pouch', I came across this along with the bazillion other similar models from Maxpedition.My purpose was to move everything from my pockets to a compact pouch I wanted to wear on my belt. Max's EDC pouches seemed good at first, but they opened sideways (from a belt), and also needed modification to wear on a belt. The H-1 was another option, but it was velcro only, and I wanted a secure snap. The M-2 looked good but maybe too small. I was also worried that this M-1 might be too big (look stupid and get in the way), and then I was worried that it might be too small for ~everything~ I carry.Got it in the mail today, and it's awesome. It looks great and has great construction (of course, from Maxpedition). I got the foliage color which was on sale. The belt loop is very stout. AND ... I was able to fit all of my 'pocketries' with a little room to spare. Doesn't stand out--looks like a camera case or something. Doesn't look dorky, but maybe it just doesn't look dorky to me. ;)Was able to fit:Front- Wallet- Blackberry Bold 9700 with armorBack main- Keys- Pens- Comb- Knife- Chap-stick- Business card holder with biz cards and rarely-used plastic cards- Some folded up paperworkI'm not using up all of the space. I'd like to still fit a pocket notebook in there, a tiny nail clipper, and maybe a thin flashlight. Pretty comfortable, but it'll take some getting used to to wear it all the time. I intend to modify it by attaching a cut piece of soft Velcro to the hook side of the flap Velcro, rendering said Velcro nonoperational. (Don't want to hear RIIIIIIIIPPPPP every time I have to access my phone or wallet. The clip is sufficient.) Currently not using the 'secret belt loop pouch', or the small front zippered pouch. It'd be nice if it had some outer pen-holder-loops like the M-2. The pens inside the main pouch will slow down getting to my keys, which will be a problem if I'm ever trying to escape a raging werewolf by quickly getting into my car.This will work well for carrying stuff on a belt.

"This is a great clipboard for door-to-door work in the dark.The material clip is strong, and the rubber corners hold. Tried and true design on many clipboards, and works better than metal-only clips. The retainer-clip at the bottom (that holds the inner compartment closed) functions better than a lot of those hinged-snap closures out there.The light is fantastic. It locks into place, looks great, and showing people your papers on a dark porch, lit up by the four lights ... looks freakin awesome. Very flashy. And practical. Lighting up (white) paper does offer a bit of glare that hurts night vision, but I'll try putting some clear tape over the lights, marked with red sharpie--see if that helps.I also like the way waiting for someone to open their door on a dark porch, with the light on and holding the clipboard in front of me ... makes me glow. ;) If I can't see a doorbell hiding in the dark, I'll just angle the clipboard to light my search, or angle the light to watch my footing when I leave.Typical space in the compartment, though no specific 'pen holder' area.The batteries that came with it were totally dead.Love this clipboard.--UPDATE 2012 February--Months later, I still love this clipboard. I did drop it once, and it fell hard, which seemed to jostle the electronics to the light had a loose connection, but whacking it a few times with my palm seemed to fix it, and the light's still fine. I'm also still on the ORIGINAL set of AAA batteries I put in back in October, and I use this light constantly on for 2 hours or more a night, 2-3 nights a week.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GN592D06VYC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BDH4YW#wasThisHelpful","R2GN592D06VYC7","A2BWD21IGC2B64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BWD21IGC2B64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a good buy.  I don't like it when people handle my hose and it kinks.  I like my hose to be stretched to the limit, bent, pulled, and jerked this way and that without incurring any damage or denting.With this, you can let anyone yank on your hose and wrap it around their hands or arms.  Your hose won't crack or kink.And when it's turned on, the water just gushes freely.  No obstructions, unless--god forbid--you get stones in there.  Then you'll have to seek the help of a professional.  Or just chop your hose off at the rocks.If you are looking to really spray far and wide with your hose, this is the one to buy.  50 ft long!  You can pull your hose to its fullest length, run in circles with it in your hand, or just toss it around.  It will not kink or leak.Also, ladies, this one is light weight.  So don't shy away from the hose.

"Interesting book about a strange man who was rejected by his people, became angry, and started a ""religion"" which would ruin the lives of millions.  From a man who had visions of Gabriel, Muhammad became a pedophile warlord gaining followers through violence and the promise of loot.An insightful look into the man who created an evil we deal with today.  An evil which threatens the very freedom of America, the sanity of the developed world, and the lives of our women and children.The similarities between Nazis and Islam are interesting.  I think this book reveals how a weak-minded man--like Hitler--caused such chaos and violence and terror, that the reverberations of his insanity are felt today in the Middle East and Worldwide.Buy this book. Then check out Spencer's other books.

Song after song.  It drones on and on and ruins the movie for any but the most devoted musical fans, in my opinion.It's just simply not worth enduring the terrible music for a few giggles.  And the plot is simplistic and hackneyed.  Nothing new here.  Same old gags and plot twists.If you are 12, this will be a giggle fest.

"Look, it's not the original in any way.  It is informed by the original one.  You'll catch a lot of re-used or updated ideas in this film, which is like finding an Easter Egg.  But after a while, the movie has to stand on its own.  It barely does.  Let me explain:If you have never seen the original, this movie will be a nice scary treat.  If you have seen the original, this will be a neat curiosity.  In either case, you do NOT want to waste money buying this.One reason for this is the writing.  The characters accept some insane paranormal situations with ease.  They hop to action as if it's no big deal to enter another dimension filled with nasty spirits.  People smile or giggle at the most inappropriate times.  They make cute jokes.  The teen is made out to be a useless bizzotch, yet the little boy is quite a cool character.  Which makes no sense, in my opinion.  If your sister was inside a TV, you would take things seriously and be on the verge of a mental breakdown.The effects are excellent.  They are not explained at all.  The acting is wonderful.  But the dialogue and lack of development in some scenes really ruins the mood.It's as if the movie could not decide if it wanted to be funny and campy or serious horror--which, as we all know, spells death for a horror movie.When writing a moving genre film you really have to have the characters take things seriously to make it scary.  You have to have people acting realistically.  This movie fails to do so.But if it's your first dip into this kind of film, go for it.  It has a few scares and freaky moments.  If you're a veteran, pass it by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGY4W7FZF333/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AK040Y#wasThisHelpful","R1GGY4W7FZF333","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is not that deep, but it has a lot of action.  The dialogue is not memorable, and it gets lame at times.Ultron is a a maniacal lounge singer.  Just does not seem to fit with the Ultron from the comics, but Spade is amazing, so he brings a new life to the villain.A running joke about Cap just gets beaten like an old dead fish, over and over.

It's just a well-done romp through a few Marvel characters' lives with a boat-load of effects and action.Not bad, not great.  Wouldn't buy it.  Once you see it, there is not much to re-see.

"Much better than you think it will be!  Well-done, enthralling Western.  The performances are amazing.  The settings perfect.  The story emotionally charged and thrilling.  This is a revenge story that pretty much hits all the notes it needs to.  Mads is incredible, as usual.This is an example of what true artists can do with smaller casts, great scenery, and good writing.  This is a damn good story, plain and simple.  The kind of story that leaves you wanting to know more about the characters, and sad that movies can only be so long.Watch it.  It's right up there with Slow West, Echoes of War, 3:10 to Yuma, True Grit, and Appaloosa.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YE6V7A7QR2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012QQSOG2#wasThisHelpful","R21YE6V7A7QR2O","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is pretty bad, but mostly because of its pacing and depressing atmosphere.  If you ever wanted to know why people hate or fear communism, watch this movie.  It is a slow and grueling and sad mystery which unfolds at the pace of a bout of constipation.Yet the acting is absolutely incredible.  If you're an actor, watch this.  Incredible performances.  More said in a facial expression than in a line of dialogue!  I find that beautiful and impressive.The settings and costumes were perfect.  This film really had the ability to be a major piece of historical entertainment.  It just drags on and on.  That coupled with the horribly depressing lifestyles of people under a communist regime make Child 44 hard to watch--hard to finish, frankly.But maybe it's just me!

"This movie has a bunch of great actors, a neat idea, and an eerily 1981 feel to its settings.  I wanted to like it, but the plot moves really slowly, nothing much happens, and the soundtrack is an array of ANNOYING synthesizer sounds.  Seriously, the music sounds like it was played by a hobo who broke into a church late at night.  Just terrible.  Not spooky.

"Fantastic post Civil War western.  The acting is perfect.  The settings beautiful and accurate.  If you enjoy learning about this time period, Echoes will transport you back to how it was for some people.You will not see what is coming.  The characters are interesting and reveal themselves layer by layer--which of course leads to some troubling effects.  The plot is well-written, interesting, and keeps you in this dull moment of tension that never ends.  Speaking of the ending, good luck predicting it.This is a thinking person's movie, but when the action happens it is gratifying--and bloody.Great movie.  Slowly paced, but full of tension.

"Nice try, but this movie gets stale pretty fast.  Like a Mummy's armpit.  The acting is great.  It starts out strong, creepy, and plausible.  But soon we run into silly vermin that change sides later in the movie.  We meet with some SyFy Channel special effects that do NOT impress.  And of course a very LOOSE and tenuous connection to the Book of the Dead.  The hieroglyphs are redundant and child-like.  The plot really does not engage your mind.The story would have been better if they veered into the alien angle they threw around in the beginning.  Instead it gets very cheesy in a mythological manner.  And then the mythology is not really given any rhyme or reason for existing.  Furthermore, the movie turns an Egyptian god into a borderline mentally-retarded beast.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD, MATEYS!I cannot understand the super-strong kitty cats who live in the pyramid by eating each other.  How silly.  They attack the characters for half the movie, then attack the dumb god who is killing everyone too.  Then we have a god who cannot figure out his way out of the pyramid!  WHAT!?!  But an Egyptian soldier by himself, a bunch of nerdy scientists, and a pair of clueless film makers CAN?  Ughh.Sorry, but a three-sided pyramid does not make a right.

"While the acting was excellent and the story is plausible, the movie never gets very exciting or interesting.  Penn is in amazing shape and even surfs for no reason in the film, and its great to see him in an action movie.  But the action is sparse.  The story drones on.I'd love to see Penn in a well-thought-out action movie, spy thriller, or even a superhero movie, because the guy is pretty amazing when the action starts.

There are a few twists you won't see coming, but you will die laughing.  These guys go on an adventure that bring them up close and WAY too personal with gangs, yuppies, gay people, the help, hired criminals, random people in the park, and prisoners.  It's all hilarious.

"I like James but I love Bas Rutten a hundred times more.  It was an exciting possibility having these two in the same movie again, but the writing here is TERRIBLE.  Bas Rutten gets a small part that makes no sense.  He really should be a headliner like Bruce Willis.  He can do the action AND the comedy.  What a shame, seeing him play second or third fiddle to the untalented masses.  Speaking of untalented, James is constantly wiggling and rolling and making faces in a desperate attempt to be funny.  It never is.  If you naturally laugh at seizures, this may make you giggle a bit.There is a waste of time teen love story that goes nowhere for no reason.  There are a ton of cardboard characters that LOOK funny, but never get a chance to perform any comedy.  The funniest thing in this movie is one of Blart's associate's haircuts!I will say that the last fight scene was KIND OF funny.  It kept my attention.

"Incredible fight scenes, but the plot is a teenage James Bond fantasy.  Imagine an Ender's Game set in a spy school instead of outer space.  The kids will LOVE this movie, but there is not a lot of intellectual meat on the bones here.  The plot is hackneyed, full of the same old crap like an obligatory love interest, an underdog hero plucked from obscurity, a parent who did miraculous things secretly, schoolmate bullies who have to be won over by the plucky little hero's bravery, etc.This seriously is a young teen's James Bond film.  If your kids love the Hunger Games or Harry Potter franchises, rent it for them.  But be ready to read a good book between fight scenes.  Following the writing is like chewing the cud.

"Fantastic western.  Enough violence to please.  A heartwarming story that turns dark real fast and twists until the very end.  Beautiful vistas and forests behind every scene.  Incredible acting.  What's not to like?  You won't see the end coming.  Every fight is brutal.  And, though the pacing is slower than most films, this movie delivers big time!

"I'm not sure the movie ever started.  This film is a slow, meaningless drama.  I literally started reading a book while watching it.  Yes, it is that slow.  I'm not sure why they didn't just put commercials in the film, between scenes, because it felt like I was watching an old Little House on the Prairie episode.  With zombies.  Once in a blue moon.  Slow, boring, and pointless.Although, I have to say that Arnold's acting is very good.  He has matured as an actor.  Why the heck does it have to be in THIS dumper?  Oh well.Maggie is like a virus.

"It is beautiful to behold, demonstrates a few interesting ideas, then descends into utter silly nonsense.  (Some spoilers ahead, mateys!)  Laser guns that sound like dogs barking.  Hover shoes that are such an obvious rip off of Back to the Future, the hero even grabs the back of a pick-up truck and hitches a ride like Marty McFly.  Then we learn the hero is half canine and the girl falls in love with him (for no reason) and actually says, ""I Like dogs"" when she almost begs him for sex.  The stupidity grows.  The universe has an unending bureaucracy that the characters navigate and it's supposed to be funny all of a sudden, as they follow an android lawyer through myriad offices.  What the hell?  And it gets worse.This movie is so bad that Mila Kunis looked like she was reading a magazine while reciting her lines. No passion.  But how can you blame her?  The writing was really foolish.

"This is a terrible representation of Batman and his world.  It is a cheesy and corny romp through some great characters, who are ruined with juvenile dialogue and a total lack of realism.  This is a little kids' movie AT BEST.  Do not watch this expecting any kind of intelligent design like The Dark Knight Returns or Batman vs. Robin or Batman: Assault on Arkham.  This is not for adults.  It's for kids who still think Batman is a Lego figure.  Which is fine, but disappointing.The premise had real potential, but it is ruined.  It's just a lot of animal robots and beloved characters saying very stupid things to one another.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRIU63AN6CEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZG41NC#wasThisHelpful","R2YRIU63AN6CEI","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film has the worst title ever.  It is misleading and does no justice to a pretty interesting story line.  Robin is nowhere near as annoying as he was in the Son of Batman, which was terrible.  Here is he simply unrealistic.  A 10 year old kid who belongs on the Mortal Kombat roster.  Yeah, right.  Pretty ridiculous.  But once you get over that fact, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.Bloody, adult, and filled with intense action scenes and weird enemies.  The movie sort of rewrites Batman's history a bit with the Court of Owls idea--a bunch of rich people who think they should decide what's good for us all.  Kind of like the American government, just better dressed.Again we see that Batman and Robin argue over the use of force--where it should end.  With death or capture?  Of course, Bats is afraid of becoming evil, so he never kills.  Thus proving once again how inferior to the Punisher Batman will always be.That said, this movie has its fair share of violence and blood.  The bad guys get it good, but our heroes come VERY close to death as well.  It's an intense and suspenseful ride that Batman fans will appreciate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3408KTJ21PTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5AD06A#wasThisHelpful","R3408KTJ21PTC","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting movie.  A heist from a very different perspective.  The acting is great.  The characters are unevenly written but appealing.  The plot has a few twists you will not see coming.  So, all in all, this is an enjoyable film.  The problem is that the movie is paced very slowly.  This is NOT an action bonanza with special effects and people jumping around and doing gymnastics they could never do in real life.Black Sea is a very realistic, gritty, and claustrophobic tale told at sea.  The characters are tossed into a crock pot, ill-prepared and desperate.  Then that cinematic crock pot is thrown down a flight of stairs and we all wait too see who comes out alive and IF anyone comes out of this tale rich with Nazi gold.

"This is one of the worst graphic novels written.  The idea of the Punisher going into space to kill bad guys is exciting.  But these writers RUIN every aspect of that premise.  First of all, the Punisher and the entire Marvel universe is re-imagined here and placed in space.  As if that was needed or even possible to do well in one graphic novel.  So you get a four-armed Incredible Hulk alien.  You get Punisher with a stupid cape and a hairline from the 1980's WWE.  You get silly scenes taken right out of the Star Wars bar scene.  Just embarrassingly bad.  Not creative at all.  Derivative and insulting.The Punisher is more of a Flash Gordon with a touch of DC's Lobo.  Nothing true to character.  It is a disgrace.  He has a Buck Rogers side-kick robot.  A talking ship that pretends to be a woman who he argues with.  Like an I Love Lucy relationship--with FRANK CASTLE!  This story is SO BAD!  As if some geek on heroine tried to write the Punisher into a prime-time comedy skit show.And the DIALOGUE!  It is the WORST writing I have ever read.  The info dumps are terrible.  The jokes are corny.  The conversations are confusing.  There are a million phrases that ARE NOT EVEN NEEDED--like when Frank talks to himself.  Everything everyone says in this book is STUPID.  Even the Marvel villains talk GHETTO!!!  What the hell is up with that?The art is good.  It has a Norman Rockwell meets early comic books kind of vibe to it.  But a good drawing of a terrible story will never do anyone any good.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  This is so bad that I want my money back, your money back, my memory wiped, and a small coma to get over what these people did to the icon Frank Castle.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUX6MQJ8GRRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785163670#wasThisHelpful","R1RUX6MQJ8GRRF","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three stars is gracious.  The acting was superb, but the movie is just a LIfetime drama on steroids.  For me, personally, the mystery dragged on and on.  And then the truth had to be unraveled like a sexually abused onion--piece by by gooey piece.  The ending is so convoluted that some will call this a masterpiece and others will be rewinding to see the hints in the film.  Me?  All I know is, I'm not buying a loft with a bunch of dudes.There is a moral here: Break up with your wives FIRST.  Then go horn around.  Loft unnecessary and, frankly, way too expensive.Second Moral: Women, if you meet a man with a loft he shares, RUN.Third Moral: You notice how there was no black guy doing this crazy, gross stuff?  No Hispanic?  No Chinese guy?  The only good white guys are Italian and Irish, ladies.  :)Oh, and the wives in this movie are just as bad as the guys, so enjoy this misanthropic romp through human sexuality.

"Love this thing.  Well-made, packs away easily, and looks nice.  Most importantly, the prickly sensations quickly give way to a warm and relaxing pressure that can cause you to fall asleep.  I cannot believe it.  Every part of your body can be exposed to this pokey delight and feel better afterward.  The only warnings I have are these:1) Don't move around a lot.  Find the areas you want targeted and stay put, letting your body press these tines into your skin to trigger pressure points and draw blood to the areas.  The more you wiggle or squirm, the more you feel poked.2) Try this out on a bed FIRST.  The pressure of your own body weight will do the trick, but the experience will be less intense than it will be on the floor.3) The best results come when you lie upon this mat and pillow without clothing.  If you wear a shirt when targeting your back, for example, you will miss out on the deep healing and relaxing properties this mat triggers.  But, some people need to transition slowly, so I understand.  Just do NOT stop at using this while your targeted areas are clothed.Excellent relaxation tool.  If you do fall asleep on it, the sensation you get after waking is weird.  Like the tingling of a limb that falls asleep.  As the blood rushes back into the prickled areas.  It passes fast.BUY THIS.  Use it nightly before bed and watch how your sleep is affected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBWCR228NVW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEN1KTC#wasThisHelpful","RJBWCR228NVW7","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No rips, no tears, no stretching, no shrinking.Definitely recommended.  The cape comes off.  It's attached by velcro squares that have served us well so far.Buy it.  The sizing was accurate.

"Great game.  I cannot believe I enjoy this COD so much.  I thought franchise was stuttering and reaching its end point, but Advanced Warfare is a big improvement.  Pretty much an all new game in many ways.This was a gift, and I am so impressed that I am going to buy the Season Pass.The vertical warfare, new weaponry, futuristic abilities, etc. are so much fun and seamlessly integrated.  I also notice that the standard gaming setting is more realistic.  If I blast the hell out of some guy's head with a laser, he goes down.  Nobody survives more than two well-placed sniper shots.  And hitting airborne soldiers is a lot easier than you think, once you get used to riddling them with bullets by aiming toward the front their trajectory.  I love launching grenades from my wrist, using a temporary shield, using a temporary Predator-ish invisibility, and enjoying unlimited ways to get from point A to point B because of my exo-suit.And let me end this review with a promise: ZOMBIES mode with futuristic weapons and an exo-suit is the most fun I have had.  You will die.  But the voice-acting by these celebrities is perfect.  The new breeds of zombies are scary.  And the graphics are fantastic.  I'd buy this game just to play all the Zombie maps.ONE CAVEAT: My game has been freezing every once in a while.  I can play for an hour and then suddenly the thing freezes.  I can play for two and then it freezes.  Requiring a forced console shut-down.  Not sure why.  But I am not the only one, as I hear.  Probably an update needed.  Why am I not angry?

"Love this game.  One of the BEST turn-based strategy games in existence.  The PC version looks much better, but this version is great--especially if you are closer to the TV than not.Customize your soldiers' equipment, abilities, and even languages!  Lots of combat options to tweak.  The voice acting is great.  The story lines are entertaining and kind of creepy.  There are a few stand-out characters.  Then, of course, there are the four ""cheat"" characters based on well-known gaming personalities (Sid Meier, for example).  If you are a sci-fi geekazoid, you HAVE to try this game.  It burns away the hours and leaves you smiling.You can even torture yourself with impossible difficulty levels and game enhancing disabilities.  It's a game that you can make as hard you wish it to be.The aliens are unique and have their own powers--only some of which you can duplicate through research, interrogation, and autopsy.  But you have to catch the critters first.  The robotic servants of the aliens are pretty scary--one of which needs to be handled carefully, or it can destroy your entire squad in six moves.Freaky aliens that create zombies screech into your face.  Cyborg aliens fly into combat.  Heavily armored reptoids make it feel like you are fighting tanks.  Alien commanders and ""ethereals"" who can take control of your soldiers can extend game play quite a while..It's all lots of fun, because you never know what lurks in the dark or around a corner.  Plus, the aliens try to flank you and escape disadvantaged positions, so the outcome can change at the drop of a hat.Also, when your soldier dies, he or she is dead.  Bye bye forever, Sergeant Dirk Bobblebrain (Or whatever you rename him).You can genetically enhance your soldiers, discover psychic powers, create cyborgs, and research alien tech to acquire better weaponry, vehicles, and armor.  The possibilities are endless.  You can make research more difficult, psychics rare, genetic enhancement and psychic powers non-compatible, and so on.  Lots of cool options which make replay value REALLY HIGH.Oh, and the music is impressive.  It really sets the mood.  Whether you are investigating a crash in a forest, invading a giant abductor vessel, trying to escape an alien-infested wharf--the music is scary and adrenaline-inducing.So, go get some green blood on your boots, soldier!  It's killing time!BUY THIS GAME.  On PC too, if you can.

The writing was trite, hackneyed stuff we have literally seen before a million times in other movies.When the action sequences look like Liam is slapping people and they fall away in outrageous physical reactions, you know the movie is crap.  This was a TV movie quality production.  For example, when they film Liam running away, he is LITERALLY doing a casual jog.  His ""SPY"" techniques and revelations are only exciting to the cops in this movie, not the viewers.  It is lazy writing we find ourselves bogged down in.

"The writers had no idea how to end this touching film.  It ends abruptly without the full story of her life even hinted to.  But other than that flaw, the movie is a beautiful, heart-wrenching exploration of a disease that affects way too many people in this world.  And we take it for granted,  But when it arrives in a family, EVERYTHING changes.  And these actors bring to life all of the grief, human weakness, and hopeless acts that erupt in the face of this disease.Now, this movie depicts an affluent family dealing with this disease, which is not very realistic for half of America.  So, the characters have money to lose, vacations to take together, and other bull.  So this aspect of the setting makes Still Alice a weaker presentation of this disease's effects on a family than it could have been.  The true devastation of this disease is not felt when the family has an enormous cushion of cash to throw at it.But the acting is top notch.  The characters are interesting and realistic.

"Pretty great film about an American hero.  The thing is, this super soldier is one among MANY who feel they need to FINISH things.  They need to protect us all.  They need to go back and save their fellow heroes.  A lot of us don't get it.  We are separated from the reality of the war going on in the sandy hell-holes of the Middle East.  Apathy sets in.  This movie helps you understand who these human beings are, and it makes you grateful that they are on OUR side.  It also shows you that they are just like you and me!  They've got a LOT to lose, yet they fight an insanity overseas to make sure it stays put.This movie depicts those savages in the Islamic terrorist organizations very well.American Sniper depicts the calm-before-storm in war, the frenetic surprise combat situations in war, and the simple humanity of our soldiers very well!  One second here, next second dead.We also get to see that the Islamic maniacs have a few super-villains of their own, like the Syrian sniper Kyle has to deal with.The movie bounces back and forth between leave time and tour time, a few flashbacks, and the sad realities of war.War is sh%$, but when the animals in the Middle East bring it, only guys like Kyle can help us face their evil.  And make no mistake, you will see their evil in this film.  Do some reading afterward,  We truly are up against an almost-fantastical breed of evil human beings who control a brainwashed army of zombies.The bad reviews are by people who do not understand war, do not WANT to understand Islam, and frankly would get us all killed if they ever gained political power.  Watch the movie before you call Kyle a psychopath or warmonger.  This movie is an Anti-War movie if there ever was one.  But it recognizes that, because of some evil humans, there is a peace we can only have THROUGH war.This one man's story mirrors a LOT of other soldiers' lives.  Read his book.  My only complaint is that I wanted to see more about the war on the ground.  More combat situations.  More action.Support the troops.  Pray for them and wish them well.R.I.P Kyle and all we have lost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKBLDB786JYYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHVE8I#wasThisHelpful","RKBLDB786JYYG","A1S1BJFTA644TU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S1BJFTA644TU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is funny how a story can grab you right from the beginning and you really can't say why. Not because the writing isn't good, because it was, nor because the characters weren't quirky and lovable, because again, they were. But just because for whatever reason, the story, while not completely original but totally unique in design, was just so much fun to read and had you eagerly turning the pages.That is what book one, Compulsion, did for me. So it was without a second thought, that I picked up Persuasion, and dived right in. I was ready for more Berrie and Eight and all the crazy happenings that went along with them and Watson Island.I was not disappointed. The danger is greater, the risks are higher, and the secrets are more hurtful, deadly, and in overabundance.I absolutely loved how strong Berrie is getting. How determined to do what is right, regardless of the consequences and regardless of who she is helping. But most of all, I love Eight and Berrie together, but sadly, Berrie being Berrie, is also what tears them apart and it was sad to see so much arguing, anger, and hurt happening between these two but it was also completely understandable.More than anything, the atmosphere of Watson Island, with it's magic and curses, hoodoo and voodoo, is what really makes this novel shine. I love the lore, the mystery and the dark mysterious and sometimes gothic setting of the island. It truly screams out to me and makes me crave more.I loved where this whole series is going and I wasn't quite ready for it to end, no matter how painful that ending was. I want so much for the Watson's and the Beaufort's and I truly truly hope, they all get their happily every after.Boone once again enchanted me with her writing, her ability to paint a beautiful dark scene and her talent for making it all stand out, stand up, and shine.*An ARC Copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T8W146KOPVQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKYL8C#wasThisHelpful","R2T8W146KOPVQY","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After falling in love once again with Estep's writing in Cold Burn of Magic, (okay okay I was a huge fan before but you get the idea!), Dark Heart of Magic was one of my most anticipated reads for fall of 2015.As I picked it up and started reading, it didn't take me long to remember exactly why that was the case.Estep has a way with words, not to mention characters. Her heroines are always tough, fierce, feisty, and full of sarcasm, some of my most favorite traits in a protagonist. Add in her unique talent of making something over used, completely new and fresh, not to mention plots that are every bit as fast paced as they are addicting, and you truly have a read that stands out and is every bit as entertaining as those of us that are familiar with Estep's work, have come to expect from her.And her second installment in the Black Blade series was not a disappointment by any stretch of the imagination.Once again filled with mystery, great one liners, humor, friendship, action, and danger, this series truly is a stand out series in the genre of young adult.Every bit as fun as it is adventurous, this second installment lived up to the first and made me anxious for the third.I'm on edge curious about how this will all end but have complete faith in Estep's ability to deliver with a well rounded, well written story.*An ARC Copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVJXH6QFIBWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617738263#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVJXH6QFIBWE","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ann Noser wowed me with her debut novel and her very original take on the paranormal world. So when I heard that her new book was going to be a blend of some of my favorite genres, I knew I had to try it.And I wasn't wrong in thinking that this would be another original take on something done before.It was imaginative, fun, fast paced and full of surprises. It once again showed that Noser does know how to write and because of it, she can make her characters jump off the pages and come to life, which is exactly what she did in Dead Girl Running.I loved all the conspiracies and the mystery behind The New Order and of course the death of her father and 52 others. There was so much that was hidden and as it all slowly unraveled, I found that I had a hard time putting this down.I won't lie, the ending was a killer and now I'm dying to get my hands on book two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RYHJ0ITJFO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014L9Z51Y#wasThisHelpful","R18RYHJ0ITJFO5","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the crazy ride that was the third installment in this series, I was eager to jump back in and see where the gang from the Donovan Circus were. How they were dealing with their victories and their loses as well as the danger that I knew was still out there for this rag tag bunch of specials.This was a fabulous addition to the series. It made me sad, it broke my heart in places, especially as they are all trying to grieve and be strong as well as it making me happy that for the most part, they are still a unit. Still strong, still together and still willing to do whatever it takes to help Lucy and get things done.But most of all, it made me remember all over again why this series is so unique and fun.Lucy has grown so much in so many ways and has taken on not only the job of protecting those around her and keeping them safe, but all the people out there like her. In fact, she may have taken on a little too much. But thankfully, she has some pretty amazing friends to help her out along the way...when she lets them that is.All in all, I loved this book and am so excited with all that I just know is to come. Long has impressed me with her writing and how each new book in the series, gets better and better and it makes me even more eager for book five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PGTEAMFHTGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015T4WP6S#wasThisHelpful","R8PGTEAMFHTGR","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doxer has always amazed me with her writing ability and the wonderful, imaginative stories that she creates so it was no wonder that I found this second installment in the Candy series so fabulous.If some of you recall that read my review for Like Candy, I had some reservations about the main character. I loved the story but at times Candy was childish and jumped to conclusions way too often and even though I really liked her by the end of the story, I still wasn't completely in love with her character.I love it when an author can make me do a 360 and completely change my mind about someone. Not only did she change my mind about Candy, but she also made me rethink my opinion about every character since the ending of book one.Truly this was so much fun. It has so much more to it that I couldn't help by be sucked right back into the story for a second time, and this time, I loved everyone, well, not everyone, but most of them.Candy grew up a lot in so many ways that it was refreshing to see and not only did it make me like her more because of it, but I actually really started caring about her as well.This was a fabulous second installment and I'm really hoping there will be more books in the series because I think it would be so much fun to continue to watch Candy grow and evolve into the person she wants to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK62YYWQPM73B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TBKNVU#wasThisHelpful","RK62YYWQPM73B","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Many Lives of John Stone is an unusual book. Told in multiple dimensions and through two main characters, it is a story unlike any other I have read.With a very slow start and a writing style truly unique in voice, it took me a bit to get into it but once there, it wasn't hard to read on and want to know the rest of the story.Sadly this was not a time travel story but rather you traveled back in time through the entries of a diary, and while somewhat disappointed at that, I did enjoy the diary entries.It was fascinating to learn about court life in France and the history buff in me couldn't help but gravitate towards those entries more than anything else. Especially as the story unfolded and we really got to know who John Stone is.While sometimes wordy in description, the story did have a unique take on the overall plot of the story and in the end, I did end up enjoying this more than I initially thought I would.*An ARC Copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCXM8Y6SJW8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481426370#wasThisHelpful","RHCXM8Y6SJW8Z","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantasy has quickly become one of my favorite genres, something a year ago, I never would have imagined saying but, there you have it.When I read the first book in the series. Snow Like Ashes, I knew the author had come up with something original and fun and I couldn't wait for more. In fact, it was one of my favorite fantasy reads of the year and so Ice Like Fire was one of my most anticipated reads for 2015.This sequel crushed me. It tore me apart in some of the worst ways but also in some of the best.It played with my emotions, stomped on them, laughed at their sorrow and then slowly built them back up with kind words, pretty gestures, and lovely smiles, only to start the process all over again.To say I loved it, would be an understatement. This was everything I was hoping it would be.Lies, deceit. Betrayals. Promises. Friendships, secrets. Gah! So much happens and I sadly can't talk about any of it. Meira grows so much in this. I adore her. She makes mistakes, she isn't perfect but she does it all for her people, for those she loves and cares about. She is fierce and determined but still loving and kind and that is why she is the true heroine of the story. I am so proud of the person she has become and the person she has yet to be. I am in love with this series and after all that transpired, I need more. I crave more.It is going to be a very long few months until the next.

"To say that Ms. Fine has outdone her self with this series is not enough. To say how eloquently written and told this sequel to Of Metal and Wishes is, is still not enough.To say it is a  beautiful, heartbreaking, emotional, and wonderful read that was truly worthy of the first book, still, does not do this series nor this book justice. But it is all of these things.My heart was repeatedly stomped on, bruised, healed, ripped apart, and then mended again. Many times I smiled, laughed, loved, cried, and just felt so many things while reading this. In short, this was a true Fine novel, in all its wonderful glory.I loved every single bit of this emotional good bye to these amazing characters and was so thankful that Fine let us take this journey with her. She is an amazing writer and it shows in all her work. I will not be forgetting this beautiful told twist on a classic that stole my heart and burrowed deep into my soul.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8PRUTGPMRCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144248361X#wasThisHelpful","R1R8PRUTGPMRCL","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With quite a few heavier reads lately, I was so in the mood for something lighter and honestly, just something fun. I got exactly what I was looking for in Monsters In My Closet.I am a huge sucker for secondary characters that are every bit as fleshed out and fun as the main characters. There is just something about knowing that someone has the protagonist's back that makes a read better for me. I need witty banter, humor, and a strong bond between people and thankfully this book delivered on all counts as well as making the main character downright lovable and endearing.I had so much fun with this! Zoey was so fun and lovable, this read really did have a bit of it all. Humor, suspense, a slight romance, mystery, great unique paranormals, a great setting, really, need I say more.I am seriously looking forward to reading book two and it definitely won't take me long to pick it up and dig right in.

"Once picking this up and diving in, it didn't take me long to remember why I loved this series so much.With it's rather unique premises and wonderful writing, I was quickly once again immersed in the story and couldn't wait to see how it all ended for Jack, Emma, and Cooper.Filled with the eery, the magical, the wicked, and a fabulous southern background, I love the mystical side of this series. Fantastic characters that grow with each new installment and a darker side filled with hate, revenge, and the demonic, this series truly is fabulous and one that stands out in the genre.I love how much Emma grows in this, not only in powers and confidence but as a person, friend, sister, and daughter. I always say but it always bares repeating, I am all about the character growth. It is one of my most favorite things to see in a series, especially one like this where growing matters so much to keep the story flowing and going in the direction that it should.Nolan did a wonder job tying everything up and ending this in a way that fit the theme and mood of the rest of the books. I absolutely had so much fun once again being immersed in this world and the wait for this, was so worth it. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPX03Q56EZMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLB6X6#wasThisHelpful","R3LPX03Q56EZMU","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The perfect creepy blend of Japanese lore with American culture.Ghosts, demons, doll possession, curses, mysterious tattoos, murderers, legends, and so much more.

"Having loved the richly dark and creepy Japanese lore from the first book, it was without a second thought (other than if the lights were on, it was daylight out, and someone else was home with me) that I picked up The Suffering.I was so ready to be on that scary roller coaster ride with Tark and Ki once again and couldn't wait to strap in, hang on tight, and get the ride of a lifetime, or at the very least, be scared silly by the thought of the creepy possessed dolls and monsters that seemed to lurk around every corner or rather, persons, from the first book.I was not disappointed.This time told in Tark's point of view, the story was not only ramped up in every way possible, but so much fun coming from a male (sarcastic)  point of view. I didn't realize how much I loved Tark until getting inside his head and seeing things the way he does.And yes, in case you were wondering, the fear factor is definitely ramped up as well. Chuleco knows how to write and write well. This story was completely captivating and wonderfully done.The lore, the monsters, the curses, possessions, ghosts, demons, I just loved all of it.

"Amy Bartol has done something that I didn't ever think possible, she made me fall in love with a genre that before now, I never really paid much attention to. Not because I didn't like it necessarily, but because I just never had any interest in it until now.She managed to capture my attention from the very first book in the series and not only hold it, but with book two, be in love with it. I couldn't put her books down and devoured them all. To say I have been anxiously awaiting the release of book three, is quite the understatement.Kricket, Jax, Trey, Wayra and yes, even Griffen and Kyon stole my heart with each new book and I have become so invested in their stories that I just knew this last book, would be epic.It is never easy reading the last book in a series. You want to devour it at the same time that you want to savor it and if you are anything like me, you war with yourself on which you should do. In the case of Darken the Stars, I had to devour it, I didn't have any other choice. Once I picked it up, I was immediately whisked right back into Kricket's world and I didn't want to leave until her story was over and I was hoping like heck, that however it ended, it would be a good one. One that would finally give Kricket some peace and hopefully happiness and love too.This book played with my emotions more than any of the others have. I was torn between those characters I already loved and cared about, to liking characters and even loving certain characters, that I never looked twice at or thought I would actually feel for, let alone grow to care and love.The story took unexpected twists and turns that I wasn't quite ready for. Kricket is in a tough position no matter what she chooses and like always, she has to look out for those that she cares about as well as trying to keep herself safe and protected. There is no easy choice for her.There is no easy road for her to go on. No matter what, I knew someone was going to get hurt and I thought I would be prepared for that.My emotions are still all over the place with the ending and honestly, I'm not going to say a whole lot about it other than Bartol made it realistic to the rest of the storyline, to who Kricket has always been throughout the series and for that, I am thankful for it. Was it the one I was expecting? Not. At. All.But that's okay too, I'm happy with the way it all went down and especially with the fact that with the ending the way it was, I could definitely see a spin off or even a sequel come about eventually.All in all, a very realistic and believable conclusion to the series.*An ARC Copy of this was provided by the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLFB2FA04KVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF4B496#wasThisHelpful","R3QLFB2FA04KVF","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is hard not to jump at the chance to read a mystery in the young adult genre, simply because there are so few and even fewer that are actually written well and keep you guessing until the very end.I am pleased to say, that Ms. Kelly succeed on both counts. Not only was this written well, with hints and foreshadowing along the way, but this did indeed, keep me guessing almost until the very end about what was really going on.To say this was a pleasant surprise, would be putting it mildly.The plot was fast paced, the characters very well fleshed out, the setting felt very real, and the chilling murders, notes, and mystery kept me constantly on my toes wondering if I knew who the killer was and why.I ended up reading this in one sitting, flipping the pages trying to get to the end to see if I was right and had it all figured out.Ms. Kelly truly wrote something that I think will please any lover of a good mystery thriller, in any genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQATD677JSM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633751651#wasThisHelpful","RWQATD677JSM7","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A perfect read for this time of year when we start to want to read about those things that go bump in the night.Suspenseful, intriguing, mysterious, creepy, and with characters that feel alive, this was truly a fun read that had me rapidly turning the pages and trying to guess what would happen next.This had everything I have come to love about Alender's writing and didn't let me down.If you are looking for something different, fun, and a bit scary, this is the YA read for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349DH6PJ5XQA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545639999#wasThisHelpful","R349DH6PJ5XQA1","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to be honest, this isn't a book I would have normally picked up on my own and having never watched the main character' show before, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I picked this up.I can say this turned out to be a delightful and even fun and sometimes funny and informative read all about the life of Dr. Jan Pol.I feel like after reading this not only do I understand a bit more about the life of a vet, but I feel like I actually know Dr. Pol as well.This really was quite the read and even though it wasn't something I normally read, I'm glad that I picked it up and gave it a go.*A copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24BF0ZQDBB0VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409121#wasThisHelpful","R24BF0ZQDBB0VE","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having not read the original series I was a little apprehensive jumping right into this new series. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about.Ms. Clamp did an amazing job not only explaining past events but also exactly what the Sazi were. I never felt lost, confused, or wondering what was going on. Instead I was intrigued by the strangeness of the town, the events that took place, and the mystery behind it all. Drawn into the story after the first chapter, this story was one that was hard to put down simply because I had to know what in the world was going on.Captivating every bit as it was unique, I truly had a great time reading this from the beginning to the very end.Luna Lake was like no place I have ever been before, the residents even more so. Strange to the extreme but oh so interesting, this was a read unlike anything I have read in the genre, from the beast that lurked in the shadows to those that lurked in the very heart of the town itself, this was a fun and entertaining UF series.*An Copy of this was provided by the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV54TXY08A5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765377209#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV54TXY08A5C","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to admit, right out front, that normally, I'm not one to read books that have anything to do about cheating. I loathe them on principle alone but every now and then, one will come along that will completely capture my attention, and not only hold it, but make it impossible to put the story down.And while when I picked this up, I didn't realize it contained any sort of cheating or O honestly wouldn't have started it, I couldn't help but read it after the very first chapter. I was completely caught up in the story from the very beginning and instead of putting the book down in disgust, I stayed up until four in the morning reading it because, I just had to know how it all ended.I'm not going to say very much more about this story, other than I loved all of the characters and I was sad that some of them were hurt and sad that some weren't, but more than anything, I will leave you with this, even if you don't like these sort of reads, even if cheating, like me, usually leave you frustrated and disgusted, take a chance on this one.

"As some of you may know I have only recently really embraced this genre and have declared it a favorite. And while it is quickly becoming a favorite, I do still struggle with it at times and am leery of starting series and books from authors I truly know nothing about.Which is why even though I read the prequel and enjoyed it, I went into this with no expectations and if I'm being completely honest, a little leery as well. I had no idea what to expect when I opened the pages.I can tell you what I got though, a fun, fast paced read full of mystery, twists, and characters that you will simply adore.While I really liked fierce, kick butt Rie, I adored the pixies! Yes, you read that right, pixies. Gikl, Niinka, Possn, Hiinto, and Tiik were just so much darn fun. They were mischievous, spunky, and almost always getting into trouble, not to mention their slightly scary ability to munch on the bad guys. There was just something so fun and endearing about their loyalty to Rie and how they always had her back.The  mystery was a great one too and honestly, the twists in this, I didn't see coming. Not to mention the wonderful blend of sups and magic and this was a read that I had a hard time putting down.I really enjoyed every single aspect of it. It was well written, well designed, and the world building  had just the right amount of detail without being a huge info dump at one time and becoming overwhelming.I honestly enjoyed this so much and I can't wait for more. The author truly has created something unique and original while still holding true to familiar concepts and creatures. I have to applaud her on her ability to mix so many details together and create something fun and unputdownable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XTJ95BRPO7KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROBHMFY#wasThisHelpful","R1XTJ95BRPO7KJ","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cat Winters is known for her beautifully detailed, creative, and imaginative worlds. Worlds that transport you back in time to another place and more often than not, to something other.It is for all these reasons that I didn't hesitate to pick up The Uninvited.I needed that small taste of the other she is so gifted at creating. I needed the beautiful world I knew she could paint and more than that, I needed something unique, original, and enchanting.Winter's has an amazing ability to blend history with fiction and give us just a touch of the macabre along with a hint of romance that truly makes her novels stand out and shine.I love this era. So much happens, good and bad and Winter's managed to show the best and worst of both sides. Prejudices, war, death, sickness, but also love, honor, and women really coming out into the world and taking charge.I loved Ivy's role in the story. How she didn't stand by and let those around her take charge of her life. She didn't let them lead her around or bully her. She saw what she wanted and she went after it. She helped those that needed it, regardless of color, social standing, gender, or origin. She was strong, determined and I loved her character because of it.The slight paranormal aspect that Winter's weaved into the storyline gave this just enough of that otherwordliness that I have come to crave from her writing and put enough spin and twist on the story that I truly, didn't see the end coming.Winter's once again created an imaginative tale that despite it's slow start, had me turning the pages eager for more.*An ARC Copy of this was provided by the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEJ1FQ7SPIP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQROY40#wasThisHelpful","R3HEJ1FQ7SPIP4","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Colleen Houck's novels are always so well written, so beautiful and enchanting that they are hard to resist. In fact, she is one of the few author's that I will pick up, knowing that a love triangle and drama and angst might ensue and still not care, because her writing simply overshadows all the rest.Her ability to weave mythology, romance, mystery, action, and adventure, all into one tale is truly breathtaking and her latest novel Reawakened was no exception.Where to begin with this? It was, simply put, a fabulous read with mythology, romance, adventure, and danger weaved into every single page and almost impossible to put down.Even with a slower start, it didn't take long before I was completely wrapped up in Amon and Lily and what awaited them.This was every bit the adventure and swoon worthy romance that I have come to expect from Houck and then some.

"I have a confession to make, I didn't love the first book in this series, in fact, I forced myself to finish it. And months later, decided to give the second a chance because some many people loved it.And while I did like the second book, I still wasn't blown away by it and was still wondering, what all the fuss was about.You see, it wasn't until book three, this book, that I finally got it. That something clicked and I understood what all the fuss was about.Can I just say, I love Rachel, Ivy, and Jenks so very much? I mean, truly, I get it now, I really do.This book was so much fun and I ended up reading late into the night to finish it and knew without hesitation, that I had to buy all the others. Thank goodness this series is over because now I get the privilege of being able to binge read the whole thing and it's summer so lots of late night readings for me!So yeah, this series has everything I like in a good urban fantasy. Witches, demons, fairies, pixies, vamps, weres...the list could go on. Add in romance, action, adventure, danger, and Harrison truly did write something funtastic.  I'm so excited to jump into book four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7XE6Z05Y0MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006057299X#wasThisHelpful","R2F7XE6Z05Y0MT","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will find me hard pressed to ever pass up the chance to read anything that has to do with witches. For some inexplicable reason, I am always drawn to them. Maybe it is the possibility that with magic, anything can happen. Or maybe I'm just a big kid at heart and still believe that in some way, in some form, magic does exist. ;)Either way I knew I couldn't pass up the chance to read a story about a young girl both witch and demon and this was a really interesting story line with some very fun aspects.In fact, I actually really enjoyed it. My only big complaint was that the protagonist wasn't very lovable. In short, even though she is sixteen, she is prone to acting like a two year through most of the first half of this story and even into the second. She is a brat, a very selfish one but yet, some how, this story still managed to make me want to continue to see what would transpire next.Don't get me wrong, Syd isn't all bad. She does have some good and unselfish moments that shine through but even with those moments, she didn't completely redeem herself in my eyes. I did however love the whole witch demon aspect of the story and her crazy grandma, was a hoot.Throw in a demon cursed to be a cat, a dog that is anything but normal, a coven of witches, vampires and of course, one demon loving father and this was something that isn't like anything else I can think of out there right now in the genre.And even with Syd's faults and some extreme immaturity, this was a fun read that I found hard to put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20MWGFB29LM4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Y10VB0#wasThisHelpful","R20MWGFB29LM4Q","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The urban fantasy genre is really the one genre that I can never get enough of and while I adore it, I'm always on the lookout for something that stands out. For something that hasn't already been done time and time again.Immediately I fell into the easy writing that Neil is so known for. She has a way of painting a setting and it's characters that seems almost effortless. You are transported right into the heart of the story and into the characters lives from the very first chapter and it only gets better and better after that.Admittedly, it didn't take me long to be completely wrapped up in the story, invested, and hooked.This was absolutely enthralling, entertaining, and completely original. Once again, Neil shows that she knows how to take an existing setting, shake it up and create something completely new and unique and most of all, fun.With a whole cast of interesting characters, both human and supernatural, magic, danger, war, and mystery all thrown in with just a hint of a romance to be, and this truly was a wonderful start to what promises to be a stand out series.*An ARC Copy of this was provide by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166S7SWCJ79AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451473345#wasThisHelpful","R166S7SWCJ79AC","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was hard not to already be half in love with Amber after reading Burying Water, which was why, going into Chasing River, I didn't hesitate at all. I knew I already liked her, cared about her, and wanted her to have one heck of a story.Throw in a gorgeous Ireland setting and a handsome guy with a hero complex not to mention an Irish brogue and really, you can't go wrong.I really enjoyed this read. I knew I would but it surprised me with how caught up I was in the chaos of River's family, in the IRA, and all the other little twists and turns this story took.Throw in a relationship that gasp is not filled with angst and you had one heck of a slow burning, but quick romance that was every bit as hard to resist and it was to put down.This wasn't quite as action packed as its predecessors but it was every bit as good and dangers still lurked here and there that the cast of characters had to suffer through and endure together.Overall, this was a very enjoyable read that for me, stood out in the very prevalent genre of new adult. No same old same old here.

"We all have those authors that we instinctively go to when we need something fun, original, and well written. Something that will keep us on the edge of our seats, engaged in the story from beginning to end. Something we will think about when we put the book down and something we will still be thinking about long after it is over.Jennifer Lynn Barnes, is that author for me. She hasn't let me down yet and her latest release, The Fixer, is testament to why that still remains the same.I adored this whole freaking book. I devoured it. I laughed, I smiled, I stressed, I held my breathe, I sighed, and I couldn't put it down.Tess, Ivy, Adam, Brodie, Vivvie, Asher, were all instant hits. They all made me smile and laugh numerous times, and I couldn't help it, I fell in love with them all as the story progressed.The storyline was completely engaging, completely unique and the added bonus of a mystery and a thriller, on top of a coming of age story, was something that was completely irresistible.Did I mention that I really loved this story? And honestly, I can't even begin to describe why other than the above already mentioned. It was just appealing, fun, exciting, action packed, mystery filled, funny...I could go on and on but eventually I will run out of adjectives to use that apply. So, just know this, I loved every minute of this read. Barnes is an amazing story teller and I love that even the bad guys, are hard to resist.I am so excited for this new series and will be on the edge of my seat waiting for book two to be released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WNAUOQ2JIJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619635941#wasThisHelpful","R13WNAUOQ2JIJT","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What makes The Secret Keeper stand out, is the very concept behind the actual story of the Secret Keeper herself. Something fresh and never done before, and let's face it, that is always worth pursuing when we are talking about the young adult genre where so many books feel like they are reincarnated versions of a book you're sure you've read before.Carling takes us into a small town very few have probably ever heard of, let alone passed through and makes the mundane anything but boring.Engaging characters and a storyline every bit believable because of the very nature of the gender and ages of the characters, she mixes it up and throws in a paranormal element that is every bit as entertaining and it was creepy to imagine and think about.A clean read that still manages to have a sweet romance, great friendships, and a creepy mystery that make this hard to put down until the very end. A fast paced plot and quick moving adventure that is every bit as dark as it is creepy will keep you on your toes and make this book worth your time and something that you should put on your to read list for this summer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30C21MRJ5DGYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0FZWHS#wasThisHelpful","R30C21MRJ5DGYK","A20XM6F911RIDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20XM6F911RIDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am 40, but I still have crazy combination skin: a few very dry areas and a few very oily areas. I have found a few women's products that do a nice job moisturizing and giving me an even skin tone for a few hours without causing breakouts. A good moisturizer can actually reduce my oily skin. This is nothing like those.When I read ""sensitive skin,"" I assume dramatically-reduced or no fragrance. This has a relatively strong smell. I've seen worse, but if you are sensitive to putting fragrances on your face, this is not going to work for you. The aroma is kinda minty/chemical: not offensive but not especially pleasant either.Also, I assume ""sensitive skin"" formulas make an effort to prevent clogging pores. I have never used a moisturizer that caused breakouts and clogged pores as badly as this one. If you are even slightly prone to breakouts, avoid this product.The one good thing about it is that a tiny tiny bit goes a long way. It's pretty good as a travel-size hand lotion. I kept it in my glove box until I used it up. It's too expensive to use as hand creme.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8DVNJA44P0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BF7HCG#wasThisHelpful","R1V8DVNJA44P0V","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this phone on the Sprint network for the past 21 months.Twenty-one months of frustration with Sprint service is enough. I am very excited that I can fire Sprint in three short months.Ten months ago I bought an iPad mini from Verizon. I carry both devices. I frequently get messages on the iPad ten minutes before the iPhone. Sprint's data service is so spotty, even text messages and voice mail are delayed. It can often be longer, but a ten minute delay is typical (visual voice mail and Apple messaging).I can never rely on having a solid data connection. When traveling in rural areas, data is impossible to find. In many of the same areas, I get strong 4G or 3G on the Verizon iPad. Owning both devices clearly illustrates how inept the Sprint network really is. Even in a metro with 500,000 people, I frequently am forced to find a wifi hot spot in order to use the web to get data or files for my work if I don't carry the iPad.Sprint is weak in cities, and useless in rural areas and small towns. I travel frequently for business and I regret my Sprint purchase daily. Unlimited data is not a value if you cannot access it.The 4S is a good device. If you are considering the 4S, I definitely don't recommend it on Sprint. I would trade my iPhone on Sprint in a heartbeat for the klunkiest phone n Verizon because the phone is crippled by the Sprint network. If you are considering the 4S on a different network, I highly recommend spending a bit more for a 4G device. 4G networks are ten times faster, even on reliable networks. A positive smartphone experience is dependent on good data service.In 2013, the 4S is beyond obsolete because of the 3G data service. A 3G-data iPhone 4S on Sprint is so crippled that I would only recommend it if the person has constant wifi access. If you do have constant wifi access, an iPod touch is all you need. This phone on Sprint is obsolete and is not really a good choice for anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WQSRO42X8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074R14TI#wasThisHelpful","R10WQSRO42X8Z4","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great alternative to buying purpose-built Bluetooth headphones or a stereo headset.I have a few sets of headphones I love to use, but lack Bluetooth functionality. This solution is superior in many ways to buying a Bluetooth stereo headset, because it adds wireless and telephony to your favorite wired headphones.The included headphones are decent quality. They are on-par with Apple's in-ear model. They fit well, and have a good range of sound. They stay put and are more comfortable than most in-ear models I have tried. There is no need to bury them deeply into your ear canal like some high-end in-ear models. The only thing I dislike about the included headphones is the orange color. The included headphones don't block out all external noise, but they probably block out too much sound to use them while jogging or walking on the street where you need to be aware of your environment. Again, the plus is that the device works with any headphones, so if you need a more open design, just use more open headphones with the bluetooth unit.Calls sound good and the mic is average to above-average. Callers didn't have any complaints about hearing me. The device is as good as using the Apple wired headphones with in-line mic that comes with an iPhone.Connecting to an iPhone was simple. No directions are really even needed if you have ever connected a Bluetooth device in the past.Battery life is good enough. I'll update if I ever manage to run it completely dead. I have listened for 3+ hours at moderate volume without any battery warning or failure. I don't use this as an always on headset without listening to music, so I cannot sufficiently judge the standby time. It actually can outlast the battery that comes with my Sennheiser bluetooth headphones, which often dies after a couple hours.The form factor is great. it has a clip similar to a pen clip and I usually wear it on my collar, shirt pocket, or button fold of my shirt. I really wish the buttons weren't bright orange, but that is a minor complaint (I colored mine with a black sharpie).The only complaint I have is the lack of an on/off switch. You use the ""phone"" button on the bottom to switch it on and off. I have twice left it on and found the battery dead a day or two later when I went to use it. It doesn't indicate whether it is on or off in any way other than a tone played through the headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9V7RKUNJ2WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYUJL2S#wasThisHelpful","R1W9V7RKUNJ2WL","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided I needed this after my first trip with the Soundlink Mini. The Mini is prone to being switched-on by moving around in your bag.This case does the trick. It protects the Mini from scratches and prevents unintentionally turning the speaker on. It provides very little (zero) padding, and doesn't appear to be waterproof. I like it. I prefer that it take up less space and have less padding. The whole idea of the Mini is that you can pack it without bulk, and this case preserves the Mini's dimensions.It looks great. The speaker is a work of art, the bag compliments it.The pocket provides enough space for the charger and its cord. Not much extra space, but it isn't needed.The big drawback is the price. It's made in China by near-children for slave wages. It should be half of the asking price. Minus two stars for made in China combined with the high price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITU2UASEG3SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D42AESY#wasThisHelpful","RITU2UASEG3SP","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really expected more from the asking price. This thing has Walmart build quality and can't brew as well as a $25 Mr Coffee.It does quickly brew an eight or sixteen ounce cup easily and quietly. It doesn't look bad on the counter. Those are the only good things I can say about it.The brewer is pretty light weight. I've only had it for about a week, but it really doesn't feel like it is built to last. Nothing in particular, just the general feel from ultra-thin metals and plastics.Using the regular strength setting, the coffee is weak. I'm not a person who likes ultra-strong coffee. It is downright watery using the recommended amount of coffee, using a medium ""drip"" grind, and using the normal setting. I use medium/light roast beans with a rich fruity/citrusy flavor profile that I purchase fresh from a local roaster. Comparing the flavor to my $20 Mr Coffee or my $100 Melitta, it is very disappointing. Using the bold setting and a slightly finer grind, the coffee is barely what I consider a normal strength cup. The only way to get rich flavor is to use more coffee than is recommended and more coffee than is reasonable for such a small serving.Coffee is consistently almost exactly 170 degrees Fahrenheit.This does not accommodate taller 16 oz travel mugs (including most of Amazon's most popular travel mugs).

"first, this thing is insulated very well and keeps coffee hot for several hours.It's pretty tall considering the volume. Unfortunately it will not fit my single-serve drip coffee maker. Definitely check the specs if you wish to use it in this way. It is unusually tall for 16oz.The reason I rate it 3-stars is the latch. It's huge and it presses against my lip while I'm drinking. It would not have been difficult to fix this while they were designing it. My skin is incredibly sensitive to breakouts and I know it will give me issues where it rubs under my lip. They really need to lower the latch and make the tab on the lid longer to accommodate it.Insulation: 5-starslooks: 5-starsEase of cleaning: 4-stars (the lid is easy to clean, but it is so narrow you will ned a bottle brush to do a good job)Latch design and drinking comfort: 1-starOverall design: 2-stars (it looks great, but that giant latch right in front of the spout is a deal-breaker)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YP75R9QQC05R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PO9T6M#wasThisHelpful","R1YP75R9QQC05R","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been searching for a better bluetooth speaker since I bought my Jabra Solemate a few months ago. I fell in love with the compact form factor and packability of the Solemate, but the sound left something to be desired for music. If this will be your first sub-compact travel speaker you are in for a modern treat. Even with the mediocre sound of the competition, the convenience of this type of speaker is a godsend to anyone who travels or spends time outdoors.This speaker is made for music. I listen to classic rock, classic soul, and 90s-10s alt-rock. Highs are clear. Mids are clear and undistorted. Even at full volume, ""busy"" music with a lot of bass layered over vocals will not muddle the sound. Bass is full and feels great in a small-medium sized room. The reason to buy this over other similar products is the quality of the bass. My Jabra Solemate has great mids and highs. This thing has full range sound. If the room is much larger than about 200sq-ft, the Bose Mini will begin to feel a bit small, but it is room-filling full range sound in smaller rooms. It really is good enough to be the only sound system in a bedroom. It will work in a pinch in a larger living space. Outdoors, it has enough power for background sound at a large gathering. I held a cookout for 40 people recently and it was adequate in an area of about 20ftx30ft. You really could not appreciate the bass in this outdoor setting, but the sound was clear and several people asked where I bought it. It moves enough air that in a small room like my kitchen or bathroom, I swear I can feel the bass through my shoes. It really can ""thump"" in a small room. If you love to really feel the groove of a bass guitar or the thump of a bass drum in rock music, this will satisfy!Connecting is a piece of cake. Anyone can do it and you probably won't need the manual. The only drawback to this device is that it will only connect to one source at once. I am spoiled by the Jabra in this regard. The Jabra will connect to my iPhone and iPad at the same time. The Jabra will switch between bluetooth sources depending on which one demands audio output. This Bose will only connect to one at a time. I have a 50/50 shot of which one it chooses. If it chooses the wrong one, I must switch-off bluetooth on the device I want it to ignore. Maybe someday Bose will fix this with a software update (fingers crossed).As an alternative to Bluetooth, you can connect a device using a 3.5mm male-to-male cable (not included).The build quality is excellent. It looks like it was designed and built by Apple. It is made from the same aluminum material as Macbook Pro laptops. It feels very substantial in your hand. Heavy for its size. It is about the size of a 1/2-liter bottle of water, and it weighs 50% more than the bottle of water. The bottom is rubberized so it won't vibrate off of a tabletop. The only slight drawback to the build is the feel of the buttons. They are recessed below a plastic covering. I fear that these buttons are where the device will eventually wear out based on my experience with similar controls. Only time will truly tell how durable it is. This is the type of device which will get daily use from most people, and the price means it should not be disposable: durability is a must.  I'll update in the future if I have any issues.I really like the dock. It is much easier than fumbling around to shove a cable into a device. More portable products need to include a dock. I keep my Bose Mini near the front door resting in its dock so it's ready when I need it. Unfortunately, Bose selected a proprietary connector for the power supply cable. I would have preferred a micro USB charging connector. On the plus side, the power supply is compact with folding prongs and can serve as a travel cable without the dock attached.Battery life has been great, but I haven't tested it to see if it will last the advertised 7 hours. The day I held the large cookout, it was kept at near full volume for about 5 hours with no problem. I have had it in a hotel at low volume for about 5-6 hours without recharging. A really great battery-saving feature is that it will automatically shut down when not in use. At bedtime, I like to play music from my phone when staying at a hotel with the sleep timer set. When the phone stops delivering music, the Bose Mini just switches off so it won't be dead in the morning.Some of the competitive products will act as a speakerphone. This Bose will not. I don't really consider this to be a drawback because the speakerphone option of most of the competitive products is an afterthought and doesn't work well (like my Jabra Solemate).Bose offers a travel case which will hold the Mini and the travel power supply for $45. It really should have been included and $45 is steep. Having said that, I will probably be buying it. I had the device loose in an overnight bag a couple weeks ago and it switched itself on because the power button brushed up against something in my bag. I heard the chirp from my bag indicating that the device had connected and was able to switch it off. It really needs a semi-rigid case for travel.Bose has built a winner here. This is going to be like the Macbook in a year or two: everyone will have one and never travel without one. It is so much better than the plastic-y budget competition that the choice is easy. Buy this now; you will be delighted. It's worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FU45UPGMCU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5Q75RC#wasThisHelpful","R22FU45UPGMCU6","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this for about a year to conduct beer tastings in liquor stores for an area brewery. I have assembled/disassembled mine 60-70 times. I have also used it twice for a backyard BBQ.Looks: The table looks cheap. Plastic, thin aluminum, and an ugly surface pattern covering thin masonite. It really needs a table cloth to be very presentable.Amazon product image: Be warned that the main Amazon image is not the exact table shipped. The image with the mother and daughter further down the page is the actual product. The difference is that there are no braces between the legs on the actual product. When I purchased this the product image was correct, but somehow Amazon has added a new image of a slightly different table and is using it as the main product image.Ease of setup: It is a bit awkward to assemble the legs. It isn't really a burden, but screwing the legs together is a chore when you are in a hurry to get everything together. The plastic device to join the two sections is a joke.Durability: The table is wobbly. The threads used to assemble the legs are plastic and not built to last forever. The whole thing feels very cheap and unstable. That being said, I have set this thing up dozens of times over the past year and it still works as well as the day I bought it. It's wobbly but has never collapsed or tipped. I regularly set it up with a plastic tub containing a case of beer and 20lb of ice, for a total load of around 50lbs. I would not recommend putting more than this on it. 50lb is pushing it. I also always stand next to it when I'm using it for beer tastings. I would never walk away from it. It would easily be knocked over if someone wasn't paying attention and bumped it. I would not want to set it up in an area where kids are playing either. This is the kind of thing that kids could destroy in seconds. I have only used it on a flat surface. I doubt it would stay upright on a bumpy lawn or any surface other than a smooth flat floor (you would really be pushing your luck).I have scraped it pretty badly in a couple spots. It also has water damage. It has only been used a few hours at a time and is always thoroughly dried after use. It hasn't been handled roughly either. Don't expect it to look new for long.I'm here shopping for a new table because this one has been a bit of a letdown. I'm looking at the made-in-USA Spiderlegs-brand wood tables for next time. I definitely would not buy this Coleman model a second time. The price is right, but it is just too cheap-looking and cheap-feeling. Coleman is all about meeting big-box store price points and not about quality. This thing screams ""made in China."" They didn't need to even include that on the label.If you need a product to look sharp, feel especially stable, or set up in under a minute, you should consider another product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M1MRJ1OVJ7YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YXR766#wasThisHelpful","R1M1MRJ1OVJ7YC","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, this is the best streaming device I have seen for Amazon video (including Amazon Prime). Amazon isn't available on Apple TV, and the Sony Playstation is complete crap as a streaming box. Sony seems to force an update download every week, and it takes an eternity to boot up and load the Amazon App. The Roku is ""always on"" in low-power standby and the Amazon app loads quickly.The other major plus of Roku is the fact that it runs the Vudu app. This app is essential if you own any Sony Blu ray disks. Vudu will allow you to access and stream your Sony ""Ultraviolet"" library. When you buy a Sony DVD which includes streaming, it can only be streamed via ""Ultraviolet.""I use Amazon Prime and buy the occasional Sony Blu Ray, so I really needed this device in my home theatre. It's better than dealing with the awful Playstation updates and slow bootup.Now, if you want it for the ""channel selection"" and Netflix, you are out of your mind for buying this over Apple TV. Apple TV is superior in every way.The user interface of Apple TV is better. the Apple looks better and is more intuitive. Apps on Apple TV load almost instantly. There is more wait-time when using Roku (but not nearly as bad as Sony PS3 or Sony connected Blu Ray players).  All Apple TV apps use the same UI. Most Roku Apps (including Netflix) are inconsistent and suffer from clumsy ugly design.The Roku has more ""channel"" selection than Apple at first glance. Once you browse through them, you'll realize that most of the ""channels"" are simply video podcasts. Apple TV has a podcast app which will allow easier access to all of this content. The Roku ""channel"" store is pretty useless and full of junk content.Both Roku and Apple TV can stream content from you film library on your computer. If you already use iTunes, you are already set up for streaming to an Apple TV. On Roku, you will need to set up one of several clumsy attempts at providing the same service.The wifi antenna to the Roku must be weaker than the Apple TV. I get solid HD streams from Netflix with Dolby 5.1 on Apple TV. On Roku, I often get a blurry picture which may (or may not) improve, and stereo sound. This is using the same 16MB ATT UVerse 802.11n connection and same Wifi router.Tech support form Roku is above-average. I contacted them using text chat to try to improve my Netflix streaming. A knowledgable rep spent quite a bit of time with me. We eventually determined that the device signal was weak and I would not get the same performance as with Apple TV (despite being ten feet from a top-shelf router).The Roku remote is flaky at times. I think it may go into sleep mode and take a moment to wake up. From time to time it just doesn't respond. The headphone option on the Remote is killer. I live in an apartment building and I love being able to use headphones at night.This is a decent device, but compared to Apple TV, it is a bit half-baked. It is nuts that it retails for the same price as Apple TV. It is the best option if you need access to Amazon Prime and Vudu. Just be warned: this is far from a 5-star device, regardless of the reviews here.An apt comparison of this device and Apple TV is to think back to MP3 players six years ago. You could buy an iPod and get excellence and a nice user experience, or you could pay less for a clumsy off-brand MP3 player. The Roku is like the off-brand MP3 player. The only difference is that this thing is just as expensive as the iPod.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJMOCC2J3YC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGGDVOO#wasThisHelpful","R2TJMOCC2J3YC1","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice well-designed speaker, but I am disappointed with the power. I am tempted to give four stars, but for the price, it really doesn't deliver.The sound has more richness than many tiny ultra-portable speakers. It has clarity without being too tinny. Highs are slightly exaggerated, but not to an annoying level. It only distorts when the volume is at 100%, and even at full volume distortion is minimal. Clarity is ideal one or two button presses below peak volume on my iPhone. It must have some sort of electronic equalizer to mimic bass sounds without actually producing much actual bass. You get a rich sound, but bass drums and bass guitar grooves lose all of their impact. It does a great job of accurately reproducing voices, even in the low mid-range.It only has enough power to create a moderate amount of sound in a small room. The multitude of glowing reviews here are misleading. This speaker does not fill a room with sound. I would not want it as the only sound system in any bedroom or area where you will listen to music for an extended period of time. At home, it lives in my bathroom where I listen to music or podcasts while I get ready for work, and I occasionally use it in the kitchen.I have a Soundfreaq SFQ-02RB Sound Step Bluetooth Wireless Speaker (Black) on my desk which blows the Solemate's sound away in every way. It's louder and has a much better range of sound. The Sound Step is not travel friendly, but it does have a built-in battery and Bluetooth so I can use it out on the deck or in another room easily. The Soundfreaq is about the same price as the Solemate. If you need a Bluetooth speaker but don't plan to travel outside of your home with it, the Sound Step or a similar item is a much better choice.Solemate is best for hotels and travel. It's small and light enough to pack in a suitcase and can be powered/charged using you computer's USB outlet. Even if you travel frequently, I would recommend that you listen to some of the competition first. For $100 more you can get dramatically better bluetooth travel speakers. For $100 less you can get similar speakers without the wireless and built in battery features.If looking for budget travel speakers, consider the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker for about $25. They don't have the convenience of wireless connection or a built-in lithium battery, but they serve a similar purpose well and the sound is almost as good. Saving $125 is worth having to plug in a cable. The Orbit M also takes up less space in your bag. Solemate is a bit big for packing in a computer bag for presentations. The orbit M takes up less space.The worst part about this item is really its price. It would be a great item at half of Amazon's price. I got a gold box deal, and still think it is overpriced. If it were fifty to sixty dollars, I would be in love with it. At one hundred fifty, it is a poor value.Edit after using for several weeks:I like this more than I did at first, for two reasons. First, I like to portability. I compared it to my Soundfreaq Sound Step earlier. Well, the Sound Step is much less portable and I really only use it when I'm at my desk where it permanently resides. I use this thing all the time. Every morning I use it to stream music and just tote it around the house as I get ready. It lives on the sink while I shave and shower. I carry it into the bedroom where I get dressed and iron my shirt. The portability is great and it is pretty durable.I love it for travel. It is so small that I barely notice it in my bag. If I need a charge, it's great that it can charge using a normal micro usb cord and I already have a ton of those (same charger as Kindle, most Android phones, most non-Apple MP3 players, etc).The connectivity is great. It connects to both my phone and my ipad immediately when it is switched on.I still have the same two major complaints and one minor complaint. Fist major complaint: it is not really powerful enough. If you plan to take it to the lake or the park the volume level may disappoint. It is adequate for a hotel room.The second complaint is the price. It should be <$100.My third minor complaint is the voice prompts. They are silly, embarrassing, and unnecessary. It verbally says ""solemate is connected"" when you switch it on. It also says ""battery is low"" when it needs juice.The battery life is adequate but not spectacular. You'll get several hours from it. If you take it on a trip, it will probably not need a charge for a day or two.I still kind of wish that I had saved my money and put it toward a Bose soundlink, but this is probably even better if you're not considering anything in that price range.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZYS8QAXPNHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008R524MW#wasThisHelpful","R35ZYS8QAXPNHM","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this is a bit different than Q's first couple soundtracks (Pulp, Reservoir) which contained lots of great seldom-heard super-cool 70s tunes. This collection is closer to what you get with Kill Bill. It has more 70s cinema music than radio hits. There is some original and resampled hip hop that's not bad, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't own any hip hop albums made after the mid 90s and usually isn't a hip hop fan. There are a handful of ""classic"" western tracks which are more novelty for film nerds, than fun to listen to, but overall the music is enjoyable. I haven't watched the film yet, but I'm sure all of these will grow on me after I've actually seen the flick.Amazon is selling this for less than half of the cost of the same album on iTunes. Five Dollars versus fourteen dollars (prices on Christmas 2012). It's a pretty great value.Keep in mind when you buy from Amazon, you don't get the final ""credits"" track from RZA. This track is essential to the soundtrack and will set you back a dollar and thirty cents on iTunes. It's an original track written to re-tell the movie while the credits roll.If amazon included the RZA track ""Ode to Django,"" I would rate this album four stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZGEXANHIJSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AL3KEE8#wasThisHelpful","R3KZGEXANHIJSG","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, Zebra pens are usually great. They write smoothly on almost any surface. The ink dries on contact and won't smear. They're generally great pens and this has the same stellar ink cartridge. The ink cartridge is the only good thing about this item.The body of this thing is a joke. It's mostly cheap plastic and the parts don't fit together well. When you place the cap on the end for writing, it doesn't stay put. It has an O ring that is supposed to hold it together, but it is too small. You are left with just a very short uncomfortable pen. It's too short for comfortable writing without the cap in place.Also, it does have a place for a lanyard ring, but doesn't include the small ring needed to use it. I don't think it would work well as an attachment to your keys anyhow. The cap isn't tight enough that I would trust it not to fall apart in my pocket.This is a great idea implemented badly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJ0TT8IDD5I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055EB35W#wasThisHelpful","R1EJ0TT8IDD5I0","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like:Call quality is acceptable. As good as any other wireless headset I've used and far better than my Sennheiser MM400s. The vibrating neckband is killer.I like having an analog on/off switch. This is missing on nearly everything these days.The form factor is great. I wear it everywhere under my shirt collar in a business casual environment. Hints of wires would be visible if you are wearing a more formal white business shirt, but my collared polo and sport shirts hide it well. The form factor is why you should buy this and why you will love it. As I stated before, I own the superior Sennheiser MM400 which has amazing audio quality. I rarely have the MM400 with me because it is not designed to wear as a business accessory. The form factor of these is perfect. Absolutely perfect. These will go with you everywhere. You will not look like a gadget spaz like the guys using the normal bluetooth accessories. When wearing the buds, you are wearing plain buds. They easily tuck away under your collar when not in use. The only bad thing about the aesthetics is the flashing blue light, but this is concealed by your collar.What I don't like:Unfortunately, the stereo sound quality is pretty poor. They don't sound as good as stock iPhone/iPod buds. They sound like cheap $10-$20 buds. Highs and lows are clipped. They funnel all sound into the muddy mids. Imagine a stock FM car stereo from 1984. I'd gladly pay $200 more for this form factor with the sound quality of my Sennheiser MM400s.Conclusion:Buy these. Buy them now. For <$50, they are a great value and you will use them every day. I gave them 3 stars but they really almost merit four when you consider how flippin' cheap they are.For listening to music in a less-portable more-conspicuous form factor, buy yourself a pair of good quality Sennheisers (wired or bluetooth, they are the best for sound quality).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAFJX5LFTL5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052YFYFK#wasThisHelpful","RIAFJX5LFTL5A","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had these for a couple months and broken them in well. I received them from the Amazon Vine program free of charge to create a review. I have plenty of headphone variety in my drawer already, but I am a big fan of Sennheiser and couldn't pass up the offer.Features and look:These are semi-compact. They are more conspicuous than most cans which are designed to be folded and tossed into a bag, but aren't too big to wear on the street. They fit on your ear, not completely around it. They are very lightweight and comfortable for longer term wear. I would rate them as more comfortable than most closed-back headphones. They fold flat enough to stick in your computer case or backpack and not use up much space.Sound:I have a pair of the identical headphones with an open back design and I was really surprised by the sound quality. Usually an open back design produces more realistic ""open"" sound, but these are comparable to the open design in audio quality. Good full range balanced sound. Not tinny and not bassy, just great full balanced sound. They block a fair amount of outside noise, more than I expected for an on-ear compact design. Sound leakage isn't bad either at a reasonable volume, so these are great for listening without disturbing others. They block enough sound that they aren't good for biking/driving or walking/jogging when you need to be more aware of the environment around you.VS in-ear designs:They are far superior in comfort and sound to any in-ear buds I have tried under $150. Even high priced in-ear buds can't compare. Leave ear buds to circumstances where portability is the only thing you're after. You can find open back headphones for $25 that are superior to most high-end in-ear buds.Negatives:My biggest gripe is the fact that they don't have controls for iPod/iPhone on the cable like the similar open back model I own. I have become accustomed to this convenience and I highly recommend considering a version that has the in-line iPod controls if you use an Apple iDevice. Sennheiser charges too high a premium for this feature, but it really does add enough to the enjoyment. The design is a bit busy-looking but not ugly. They don't fold quite as compactly as some portables like the open-back px100.Conclusion:If you don't use an Apple device that uses the in-line controls and you want some outside isolation, these are a good value. If you want cans for exercising or need to be more aware of your environment the Sennheiser px100II is a better choice (PX100 is more compact, great sound, open back). If you do own an Apple music device like iPod or iPhone or Mac, then I would spend a few dollars more and get the in-line controls on whatever headphones you choose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8MHG5XI2SZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SNPTSM#wasThisHelpful","R2X8MHG5XI2SZS","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never owned a burr grinder before, so I cannot give a comparison to any other similar product. I also simply use this to brew drip coffee, so I can't speak to its abilities in grinding for espresso or French press.It does do what I bought it for very well. It's easy to use and easy to clean. Using it is easier than buying ready-ground coffee. It makes zero mess on my counter and looks pretty good while just sitting there.I never even cracked the manual. The quick start guide is all that is needed. Very simple operation. You simply choose a grind size, strength, and how many cups you want to brew. Now that I am happy with the settings, I only need to place a filter under the spout and press start. Honestly, I didn't even need to do any trial and error. The quick start guide shows the range which works best with paper filters and drip coffee. I set that, left the brew strength set in the middle, and set the number of cups to four (just right to fill my 24oz mug). Fill the hopper with beans and press start. In a few seconds it places exactly the right amount of coffee into the filter. Drop the filter into the machine and I'm done.Again, I cannot emphisise this enough: It is actually easier than scooping from a preground container into the filter basket. I press one button and it just does what I need it to do.I've been leaving 1/2lb of beans in the hopper at a time. They seem to maintain their freshness fine. The top of the bean hopper is sealed, though it is not air tight because the bottom is not sealed.The best thing is that the coffee tastes better than I have ever made at home. I can't believe that I can brew better coffee at home than can be bought anywhere (at least anywhere around here). I don't use a fancy brewer. I use a compact Mr Coffee that set me back around $25 if I remember correctly. I'm using freshly roasted beans from a local roaster. Now that I'm brewing at home more often, and drinking more coffee, I'm considering the purchase of a larger thermal carafe model so I can brew more and take it along with me to work. The folks at Starbucks are going to wonder what happened to me.This thing was on my wish list for a while because I could not bring myself to spend $200. Now that I own it and have used it, I regret waiting so long.Edited for longer-term impression:I've been using this for another 1.5 years now. It is still going strong.I purchased a french press about a year ago and this machine is great for that too. The coarse grind on the french press setting minimizes the muck in the cup, which is the big drawback of using a french press. I don't use the press a lot because I'm lazy and don't like the cleanup, but it's nice to have the option.I love how simple it is to portion out just the right amount using this machine. Sometimes I use a 10-cup auto drip. Sometimes I use a pour-over device for smaller amounts of coffee. Every time the measure is spot-on.Like I originally wrote: put the filter under the grinder's spout, select the number of ""cups,"" press start, drop the loaded filter in the coffee brewer: this is all that is required for great fresh-ground coffee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFSIBGT1624O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043EWFAM#wasThisHelpful","R3VFSIBGT1624O","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, the movie.It's not what I had hoped. I heard about it from a Brian Cranston interview. It stars Gosling, Cranston, Christina Hendricks (love her), and Albert Brooks (a great actor, writer and director). Cranston speaks frequently about how he chooses great roles based on great scripts. His judgement wasn't so great here. Contrary to some other negative reviews, I wasn't hoping for a movie with nothing more than car chases and gangsters. I was hoping for a smart well-written thriller. It is none of these. It is a slow-paced bad story for the first 45 min. Gosling is either a very bad actor or he was directed to be bad. His role is basically to give flirtatious grins to girls and the bad guys. The bad 80s-style music makes it worse. After the boring initial 45 minutes passes, it is filled with ultra-violent gory scenes, which still manage to be painfully dull. Lots of violent murders. Stomping of heads. Shotgun blows to the head. Bloody stabbings. They even manage to make Christina Hendricks appear unattractive. You will do yourself a huge favor if you skip this movie completely. Don't rent it. Don't buy it. Skip it.Now, to make things worse, Sony seems to have invented the worst possible digital movie service possible with ""Ultraviolet.""Of late, I only buy Blu Ray when a digital copy is included. I own a connected Sony Blu Ray player and an Apple TV to stream movies to my television. I want the option of streaming movies rather than using the physical disc. I know I am not alone because many Blu Ray discs include a digital copy. This is the first (and last) title I'll buy with Sony's ""ultraviolet"" digital copy.The experience of obtaining and using the digital copy with this disc is horrible.Here are the steps (no exaggeration, it's a truly awful experience):-Enter the unnecessarily-long code at a long manually-entered url-Next, you log into the service. Your previous Sony service logins don't work. Even though Sony has probably tortured you by making you sign up for useless services in the past, they make you reenter your info again to get access to your digital copy. They actually make you sign up for two new logins to use this service: once for Sonypictures.com and again for ""Ultraviolet."" After signing up for the two Sony services, you merge the two new accounts.-Sign up to sonypictures.com service (name, birthdate, email, password, pick two security questions - system has a bug that causes the page to randomly refresh and forces you to restart the process)-Sign up to sony's ultraviolet service (same info as above, all over again for a separate account)-open your email to verify the two accounts with an email link-link the two accounts-go back to the original link and reenter the movie redemption codeOK, I jumped through the hoops. Now I can watch my movie! Maybe not.The problem is, the only way to watch the digital copy is using your web browser on your computer. There is no Roku access. There is no way to watch it with a connected Sony Blu Ray player (I own Sony's latest connected Blu Ray player). There is no iPhone app. There is no iPad app. There is no way to watch it with Apple TV. There may be an app for Playstation 2, but I doubt it considering that the connected Sony Blu Ray player doesn't have one.Sony's Ultraviolet service, and thus the digital copy included with this disc, is useless. Don't buy this if you expect to own a digital copy. If I want a digital copy that I can use with one of the many digital devices connected to my television, I must download a pirated copy or go through the hours-long process of ""ripping"" the blu ray with Handbrake or similar software. Alternately, I can download it from iTunes for $20. No thank you Sony. Perhaps I'll just download pirated Sony films from now on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6DP4MWRJ1GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064NTZJO#wasThisHelpful","R2P6DP4MWRJ1GR","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm writing this because of the negative reviews.  I've owned this tool and used it heavily for over a year with great results.I replaced a worn out DeWalt NiCad 14 volt with this tool.  I bought Rigid because I have had really great reliability with a corded 1/2in hammer drill for about five years.The 12v lithium battery seems like a miracle.  It never seems to run down.  You will never run it dead before your backup battery recharges, unless your using it with a huge hole saw or some other absurdity that it isn't designed for.  One battery usually lasts all day if you're just installing a bunch of screws with it.  I install beverage systems for a living and do a lot of mounting and light drilling.It is feather-light.  It's easy to adjust the speed with the trigger.  It's plenty-powerful for any drill bit that will fit the chuck.  Battery stays powerful until it's almost completely dead.  It has a nifty work light.  Batteries recharge quickly and last through most any job.A few people here have complained that the battery charger indicated that the batteries were bad and failed to charge them.  I had this happen once: It didn't take much to determine that it won't charge a battery that is stored in a very-cold environment.  I moved the batteries inside and it returned to normal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25S39DEPL99JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W0ZI0E#wasThisHelpful","R25S39DEPL99JL","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice sturdy fabric, and a very nice look and drape.  Not ""no iron,"" but they don't require ironing if you get them out of the drier promptly (better than other flat front casual dockers).  Much more professional-looking than typical cargo pants.  Waist is slightly flexible, but it's well hidden; they appear to have normal waistband.  Room in the seat without looking baggy.

"This is the best watch I've owned in my life, at any price.  I have worn this watch every day for a year now.  It keeps perfect time and the solar charging works great.  There is no need to lay it in sunlight or worry about long sleeves; it gets plenty of light to stay well charged from simply using it like any other watch.  I've had no issues with moisture entering the case from showering, handwashing, dishwashing, or swimming (unlike some waterproof timex watches I've purchased in the past).  I've definitely whacked it on things many times and it has held up well. I have a couple minor scratches on the glass, but it's more durable than any watch I've owned.The minimalist face is a great casual look.  It's easy to read the time and date at a glance.  The size is ideal: just large enough to let you know it's a mens model without being too big or heavy.  I only wish that they offered this model with a perpetual calendar.I have no complaints about the band.  It has held up well and still looks as good as the day I bought it.  There are metal grommets in the holes, and the clasp is stainless steel, so I expect that the band is going to last for many more years to come.I just bought a fancier-looking Citizen eco-drive to wear when I want a dressier look.  I've bought many watches in my lifetime, and I plan to buy nothing but citizen from now on.  No batteries or winding, affordable, durable, and great looking.If you are looking to buy a casual watch, this is the one to get.  I guarantee that you'll love it.Update after 4.5 years of use: It still works great. Still using the original band. It has never needed any service or battery. It is always running. I now only wear it about every-other day because I have another more dressy watch I like to wear. I keep it on a window sill when not in use and never worry about the battery. It's hard to believe a <$100 watch is mechanically good-as-new after nearly five years. I have some scratches on the mineral glass surface, but none are really bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R472LPQ8GTAFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EQS1JW#wasThisHelpful","R472LPQ8GTAFM","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a very amateur camera user.  I understand the basic terms and settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, image stabilization, exposure) but I am impatient and like to get things set and just use the camera.I bought this camera because I wanted the ability to use the camera indoors in low light without a flash. Due to the relatively high price, my expectations were high.My cam was delivered just last week, and having used it at an event in a local bar the best word I can use to describe this camera is ""magic"".  This camera takes in so much light it really seems like magic.The event I was documenting was in a very dimly lit room.  The only lighting sources in the room were incandescent chandeliers dimmed as low as they would go.I set my iso to 1000 in aperture priority mode, f2.0 (this level is only available in the widest zoom), adjusted white balance for incandescent, and took some shots.  Most of the shots used 1/6-second shutter speed, which was just fine due to the image stabilized lens.  The IS performance is improved over my last Canon compact.  I don't have steady hands, and I like to take quick sloppy shots.  If the IS in this cam can handle my hands, a very-careful steady shooter could probably get away with 1/4 second.  The resulting images were so bright and had such great color everyone that saw them was in awe.  The resulting images appeared more bright and colorful than with a naked eye.  Shooting with such high ISOs is like having night vision built into the camera.  Noise levels were low enough and color was so good that I can easily print very nice 5x7s from this night.I took a few candid shots of people in motion at the bar, so I had to bump the ISO to 1600 to get a faster shutter speed (at ISO 1600 I got about 1/30sec in the dimly lit bar).  At ISO 1600, color is still acceptable and very nice 4x6 prints, web postings, and email will be no problem.  ISO 1600 on this cam is comparable to what most compact cams produce at ISO 400.  I've never seen a compact cam take such great shots using high-ish ISO settings.I am just as happy with the results as when using my EOS 20D digital SLR.  A critical professional may argue that this cam isn't as great as an SLR, but for normal-sized prints and digital sharing, this camera makes images that are as good as a consumer SLR.My last compact was a Canon SD800is.  I love that camera, but images are mostly unusable above ISO400, due to muted color, and grain.  The S90 goes two full ISO stops beyond what can be done with a typical $300 compact camera.  Combine high-ISO performance with the f2.0 option and you can take great shots in 1/3 of the light required for most $300 compact cams.Adjusting camera settings is a dream.  I am just as in control as I am with my EOS 20D SLR.  I've used friends' canon rebel SLRs, and the controls on this compact are even better than them.  Between the front ring, rear dial, and shortcut button, you have instant control of three camera functions without even really looking.  All of the controls are customizable.  If you've ever used other canon cameras in the past, you won't really even need to use the excellent printed manual (yes! a printed manual!).I've not taken enough shots with it to test whether the battery can actually deliver 200 from a charge, but 200 isn't really great battery performance and I bought a backup battery from an Amazon marketplace seller for longer outings (under $30 shipped).I also highly recommend the Canon compact leather case.  This camera easily fits in any pocket, but I'm pretty sure that pocket lint and dust is what did in my last compact camera.  The Canon compact leather case for the S90 mounts on your belt and offers light protection away from keys and pocket lint.The body is comparable in size to Canon elphs.  My SD800 elph is 1/2in shorter, but the height and thickness is identical (not counting the lens ring, which makes the overall thickness of the S90 slightly thicker).  I posted comparison pics between the SD800 and the S90 in the gallery.The rear display is really sharp and is viewable outdoors.  I haven't bought a new camera in over three years and the display blew me away compared to my other cameras.  I really can't compare the display to newer cams.Simply judging by the way it feels in the hand, the build quality is just average.The only real performance weakness is continuous shooting.  Continuous shooting is really really slow.If you want a compact and think you'll ever want to photograph dimly lit subjects without a flash, this is THE camera to own.  The price is 40% higher, but it takes in 300% more light.  Unless you're shooting a lot of action, this cam is probably a better choice for people considering consumer-level SLRs like the Canon rebel line.I can't imagine anyone regretting buying this camera.  It beats other compact pocket sized cameras by a wide margin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BQ8F7IR88IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LITT42#wasThisHelpful","R29BQ8F7IR88IM","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Battery:It uses old-technology Ni-Cad batteries, rather than modern more powerful lithium ion.  I'll update this review later and comment on battery life, because I haven't owned it long enough to really review that important aspect.Features:It does not have a torque setting like even the cheapest drill-drivers.  Torque setting is present even on sub-$100 drill/drivers. Torque setting is important to avoid stripping screws (although with the low RPM of this item, it isn't as likely).  It turns slowly but does have a decent amount of torque.  Switching from pistol-grip to straight is a somewhat-useful feature. There is an LED light that switches when the screwdriver is engaged, which is an incredibly useful feature (screws are frequently in tough to see areas).It includes a two-sided driver bit with #2 phillips on one side and medium-sized slotted on the other.  The bit fits into a 1/4in holder on the front. This driver does not have a chuck.This item is perfect for a home user who only rarely needs an electric cordless driver. An electric driver is an incredibly useful device and this does the trick for 1/4 the price of a high quality small drill motor. Frequent do-it-yourselfers should consider spending more for a small lightweight drill/driver with a lithium ion battery.It isn't the most sturdy or best performing tool around, but the price is so low that it's a great option for light consumer use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Q6ZGCVJLUXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HWS2H2#wasThisHelpful","R15Q6ZGCVJLUXS","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pleased with the sound of this item. It has superior sound to my iHome portable alarm clock speaker system: both louder and better sounding.

Most speaker docks prompt you to switch to ""airplane mode"" when you plug in an iphone, this one doesn't annoy you with the prompt.I like the ability to use it in either portrait or landscape mode.  This is a feature missing from virtually every other ipod speaker, and is essential for watching movies on the iphone or ipod touch.If you're shopping for good-sounding speakers and plan to watch videos, this is an ideal choice. the weaknesses are that it lacks a car adapter, a jumper for laptop input, FM radio, and a remote, but it is still a very useful device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7SNTSKQ9MS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M78L64#wasThisHelpful","RT7SNTSKQ9MS2","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've owned larger Letherman tools like the wave, that I found were waaay too heavy to carry in a pocket (they are best if you plan to wear them on your belt in a holster).  I've owned the juice tool which lacked a sturdy locking blade, and was too thick and heavy due to seldom used tools (micra is better for users considering this tool).  I've owned the skeletool which was really nice, but still a touch too big/long to be truly pocketable (skeletool is 20% heavier and 1/2 inch longer, which makes a difference if you keep it loose in your pocket).This tool is light and small enough to carry in your pocket every day.The plier is sturdy and only large enough for smaller nuts or objects, around 3/4in or less.  Altogh advertised as a ""needle nose,"" it really doesn't fit into tight quarters like a true needlenose.  The blade is non serrated so it's easy to sharpen at home.  For righties, the blade opens easily one-handed, locks open solidly, and opens when the plier is folded (having to open the plier to access the blade is the major drawback of a lot of larger multitols).I don't miss the screwdriver included in the skeletool because I have a leatherman micra on my keychain.  This tool plus the micra is far more useful than any one tool on the market.If you really really need the screwdriver bits and you use the pocket clip, the skeletool is probably a better bet, but this tool is more useful to me because I like to keep my pocketknife inside my pocket.  A useful sturdy plier, a really high quality blade, and nothing else.  If you're considering this item vs the skeletool because your wave is too big, this is the one to own unless you really want to compromise size for a flimsy screwdriver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTLZGU90ZFSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T84THW#wasThisHelpful","R3FTLZGU90ZFSZ","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This device is pretty easy to use and the quality is very good, I've even used it in a noisy delivery van and had good results.It has a feature where it will broadcast audio to your car's radio instead of the built-in speaker.  This works about as well as most FM modulators (like the ones available for MP3 players).  It is pretty reliable once you find that perfect frequency, but as soon as you drive outside of your city, you must find a frequency that works well at your destination. I use the FM feature only when I'm in my home city and then use the built in speaker for traveling outside my city. If you don't find a nice quiet empty spot on your FM dial, static is really bad and audio will cut out occasionally, forcing you to use the built in speaker.  I was very pleased to discover that the iPhone 3GS will not only broadcast calls to the device via bluetooth, it sends all system audio to your Jabra, including music, podcasts, and message alerts.  I keep my iPhone on a charger and stow it in the console, and can listen to music from it over my radio, and take calls as they come in.Voice dialing works really well, even better than when using the wired headset that was included with my iPhone 3GS.Battery life is very good.  I've been using it for two weeks without charging it and it performs as well as it did with a full charge (in two weeks I've made or taken probably 30 short calls with it and sent hours of music to my radio from the iphone with it).  I'm a little bit worried that it my suffer some battery life issues this winter because the included documentation states that the battery may not hold a charge if stored at below freezing temps. It charges via USB and the package includes a USB car charger adapter (which also works with an iphone cable) and a USB-to-miniUSB cable for charging the Jabra.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G90SVOC2B3CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EN109C#wasThisHelpful","R3G90SVOC2B3CK","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this for about a week now. I think it's worth the money as long as the company doesn't disappear in the next couple years and the device continues to work over that period.Before connecting, you go online to Ooma's website and register your device, choose a phone number, give it your 911 address, and give a credit card number so that you can access the premium features if you decide to keep them. Premium features include improved caller ID, voice mail accessible from the internet, and an instant second line. Premium features are $10/month but it is easy to opt out and keep your internet phone line free of monthly costs. They do charge $12/year after the first year to ""free"" customers to cover a federal regulatory charge.Setup was a bit of a struggle for me. When you initially connect the device, it begins to download updates. The software update took longer than 15 minutes indicated by the setup instructions for some reason, and after 30 minutes or so I called the support line to get advice. I spoke to a real person quickly, but she was not much help and I was told to wait another three hours (operator was obviously very young, didn't really listen to my specifics, and had a thick spanish accent). After three hours, I called again and was connected to a more helpful person who had me up and running in about ten minutes. I use an Apple airport router and needed to change one setting on it that wasn't mentioned in the instructions, but the router indicated an issue and made it easy to change. The phone is installed between your cable/DSL modem and your router or computer so that it can manage internet traffic and optimize call performance.Now that it's connected it works satisfactorily. Call quality using my Panasonic Dect6 phone varies a bit. My internet connection is DSL and delivers 750Kb/s upstream and 6Mb/sec downstream, considered ""elite"" by ATT. If I am using the internet to stream video to my television from Netflix or I'm downloading a largish file on my computer, outgoing calls take about 15-20 seconds to connect and the audio quality is occasionally marginal.  If I'm not using my connection for anything other than web browsing, the audio quality is very good and connection is very very quick. Overall it's landline quality about 80% of the time and cell phone quality for the remainder.The only ""bug"" I've noticed is that although the caller ID displays the correct incoming telephone number, it doesn't always display the correct name.If you are paying for a land line or miss having a land line this is a very good value. A land line that includes unlimited domestic long distance costs $40/month from ATT. You'll spend about $20/month for other VOIP providers.  $12/year is a great price for unlimited calling throughout the entire United States, and justifies the big upfront price tag in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251WBL77ZREDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O3W4LE#wasThisHelpful","R251WBL77ZREDJ","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received my cans, ordered from Amazon marketplace seller accessoryseek: they are discount-store quality and not the same color as the ones pictured here.First, these are sold as much for aesthetic appeal as they are sound, and the cans I received have black rather than tan pads. They do not look like the ones in Amazon's photo.Second, the sound is below-par for headphones costing over about $20. I haven't broken them in, but they have muddled mids, accented highs, and very little bass to speak of.  They are below the sound quality of phones that are distributed with MP3 players like the ipod.Third, they appear to be a miniature on-ear closed design, but they leak as bad as open-back cans.Fourth: these cans are not very comfortable.  They are at rigid right angles to the head band if the head band is extended at all, so they don't rest on the ears properly (unless your ears are exactly at right angles to a line drawn between them).Fifth: as of writing this review, the seller Accessoryseek is still listing these on Amazon.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this seller unless getting something other than the pictured product is not an issue to you.I can't say for sure that the product I bought isn't a counterfeit, so the real deal may actually live up to the reviews for other colors of the ATH-ON3 that I have read on Amazon.  Based on other Amazon reviews, I'm about 60% convinced thatthe product I bought is counterfeit. It's possible that Acessoryseek bought these not knowing that they aren't real, but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't avoid that seller anyhow.I had hoped that these would be a stylish alternative to my Sennheiser 100s, but they aren't even close.  They are headed to my junk drawer and I'm out thirty bucks.  I guess when a price is too good to be true it probably is.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLWXSWUD7CDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M9BU0I#wasThisHelpful","R3DLWXSWUD7CDE","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned these for several years now and rarely used them because I hated the sound.  I took some really good advice and broke them in.  They have really great sound only after being pushed hard for several hours.  When you receive these, immediately plug them into a radio, turn up the volume, and let them break in for at least 36 hours.  The difference is astounding compared to listening out of the box.  Before breaking them in, bass is scratchy and sound is more muddled.Once broken in, the sound that these make is very crisp and separation is more evident than with most cans.  I don't know much technical data about them, but they seem like they have separate drivers for mids, highs, and lows.  They have a sound similar to quality speaker cabinets.  The range of sound is good, but the highs have a lot more punch.  Bass is present, but they don't have the amped-up bass sound that a lot of people seek out for listening to pop music.I don't have any problem driving these with portable players.  They sound great whether they are attached to my home amp or to my tiny ipod nano.Isolation is good, with little sound leakage at moderate volumes.  Even at high volume, sound leakage is minimal.  Most external sound blocked.These are great for any type of music, even classical where many speakers and cans fail to reveal small details.  When listening to loud rock, hard driving bass and drums won't drown out vocals and highs.HD280s are comfortable as full-sized closed cans go, but all closed cans can feel a bit hot after extended listening.  They fit completely around the ear, not on the ear.  They are somewhat tight compared to lighter weight open portables, but this is necessary for good sound isolation.  They aren't light, but aren't uncomfortably heavy either.  I have a rather large head and haven't had the fit problems some other reviewers have mentioned.  My hat size is 8, so if you are 8 or less, don't worry about the fit.  If they feel a bit tight you can store them for a day or two over a box and stretch them out a bit (I did do this).  I wouldn't recommend buying any cans before trying them on first if it's an option, but unfortunately it is seldom an option.In my opinion, they are too large for portable use or travel.  They're great for use at home.  I also own the HD202s which sound almost as good, but are more travel-friendly  The 202s don't have quite the frequency range clarity, and rest on top of the ear so isolation isn't as good.  These 280s have a long heavy-duty coiled telephone-style cord which doesn't really have tangle issues.  The cord stretches between about 6ft and 10ft, the 202s have a thin super-long portable-style cord which becomes tangled if you don't store it right.Keep in mind that no closed cans sound as good as open cans in the same price range.  I also own a pair of Grado SR80s, which are priced exactly the same as these Sennheisers at most stores.  The Grados sound more realistic and are more comfortable IMO, but the open Grados leak tons of sound and provide no isolation.  If leaking sound and lack of isolation are an issue these Sennheiser HD280s are the best choice for home use.  If leaking sound isn't an issue, seriously consider the USA-made Grado SR80s for their superior comfort, sound, and retro style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY841UVX7BXBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065BPB#wasThisHelpful","RY841UVX7BXBU","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just completed the painful process of moving.  Rather than deal with a bunch of free half-destroyed flimsy boxes from the liquor store or grocery store, I bought some quality boxes.I bought these Bankers Smooth Move boxes, and also some traditional boxes at Lowes.With traditional boxes, you need to tape the bottom and the lid for security and stackabliity.  With the Smooth Move boxes the bottom and lid are closed origami-style.  The reinforced bottom folds down and locks in when you unfold the box.  The lid folds down and is secured with tabs that fold into the convenient handles.  The handles and entire box are very sturdy.I like how easily they fold up for future use.  No cutting or untaping like with regular boxes.Worth every penny.  I paid $2.50 for traditional boxes at Lowes.  I'd pay twice that for these, and you get ten for $30 at Amazon with free shipping ($3 each).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYU8YK6VIN5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027CTFBO#wasThisHelpful","R3JYU8YK6VIN5Z","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing was incredibly easy to set up.  Follow the step by step setup to password-protect your main and guest network.

I have a DSL connection that tests at 5Mbps wired via ethernet, and I get that full speed in every room in my house via the wireless N connection.The only trouble I had with it was the fact that the documentation doesn't say anywhere that macs can't read NTFS-formated drives wirelessly via this router.

"This is my first Mac computer.  My first four computers ran Win 3.1, Windows 95, XP, and Vista (from about 1995-present).  I have quite a lot of time spent on each of them.  Switching from Windows to Mac is not difficult, but it can be a bit frustrating for a week or so.  There are Windows features that you will miss, but they are mostly overcome by overall advantages in my opinion.I've spent two weeks with this machine now.  If I had written this review after one day, I would have probably stated that I regretted the switch to Mac.  After getting more proficient with the machine and realizing how well it works, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.This review is going to be a mix of my impressions of both the hardware and the Mac operating system from a new Mac user perspective.The only difference between my machine and the one on this product page is that I ordered directly from Apple and upgraded the hard drive to 250GB (from the 160GB base option).  I am using 2gb of ram and the lower-end processor.My Mac OS impressions:The biggest thing I missed from Windows at first was the task bar.  Mac uses the ""dock"" to replace the task bar.  The dock is kind of like the quick launch toolbar in Windows spread out across the entire bar, with large icons.  Having used windows with a task bar for the past 13 years, I missed the ability to see all open programs and switch between them with the task bar.  The dock has a tiny dot below the icon on running-programs, but nothing else to separate it from other program and folder icons.  The dock is not nearly as useful for multitasking as the task bar.The saving grace that rescues the Mac from awkward app-switching while multitasking is called expose.  Expose is activated by either pressing a key or using a multitouch gesture (four-finger swipe).  Expose uses the entire screen to display all open windows and allow you to switch between them.  It's like alt+tab on steroids.  Having used the machine for a couple weeks, I miss using expose when I use my Windows machine.  As much as I hated the dock at first, I have to give the advantage to the Mac for managing multiple windows while multitasking.The controls for open-windows are quite different than in MS-Windows.  In Mac, there is a resize, hide, and minimize button instead of maximize, minimize, restore, and close.  To close an app on the mac you need to use a menu command or keyboard shortcut.  The Mac resize button kind of works like restore/maximize, only it's a bit more awkward.  A commenter here pointed out that it resizes the window for ideal viewing without using the entire screen.  I find myself resizing windows by dragging corners more than I ever did on a Windows machine.  I really miss the ability to maximize, if for no other reason but to avoid distractions.  The green resize button may be better on an enormous monitor, but not on a 13"" notebook.  When you minimize or hide an app on the Mac, it is only available from the dock and is hidden from expose.  I'll give the window size-management advantage to Windows in this contest.  The windows system is just easier and more logical in my opinion.  It isn't a deal-breaker, but I do miss the Windows ""window controls.""  If you are a frequent user of the F11 key while web browsing in Windows you'll have to kiss that feature goodbye.  Neither Firefox nor Safari will go full-screen.Windows Explorer is ""replaced"" with an app called Finder.  Finder is kind of like the start menu and an explorer window all rolled up into one.  Compared with older versions of Windows, finder is adequate but Vista's explorer is quite a bit easier and more logical to use.  I prefer Vista's preview pane to Mac's coverflow.  I miss the ""up folder"" button.  I have found myself mostly using the view that puts files, folders and apps into a column view for easiest computer browsing, and it just isn't as elegant as Windows Vista.  The lack of a maximize button has caused frustration especially in the finder, because the finder likes to stay in a very small window unless you drag the corners.The Safari web browser is nice and quick and has a decent security reputation.  I have been switching back and forth between Safari and Firefox.  Firefox has crashed a couple of times and I really like being able to use multitouch gestures with Safari, so I'm leaning toward making Safari my main web tool.  Reading RSS feeds, and the bookmark toolbar are really well done in Safari.  Browsers are so personal that it's difficult to recommend one over the other, but as a Firefox user in Windows I think I have high standard and Safari has met or exceeded them.I absolutely hate the iPhoto app.  Iphoto does not allow you to organize and browse your photos in folders.  It imports your pictures and sorts them itself based on time/date stamps on the photos.  This works fine for personal vacation snapshots but it completely mixed up the rest of my images.  Folders that were neatly organized for work projects, and fun web clippings, and adult stuff were all shuffled into one big mess after I imported my image collection.  I ended up just deleting all of them and not using iphoto at all.  Right now I'm just using Finder to browse my photos and the preview app to view them.  Light editing work isn't possible in the preview app and I still haven't decided what to use for a basic photo editor yet.  Vista's photo app is junk but it's still superior to iPhoto if you like to keep your photos organized using your own folder system.  I know people who love iphoto.  It comes down to whether you want the ability to organize your collection yourself.  If you have a big mess of photos, you'll love iphoto's ability to organize them via event and face recognition.Edited to add: you can organize your photos into ""albums"" after you import them into iPhoto, but be prepared to spend a lot of time reorganizing everything.  Even after you organize into albums, the main library screen gives you views of your entire collection (perhaps things you don't want everyone to see).I have not used Garage Band or iMovie yet.  I'll update later when I get a chance.Edited to add: I played with garage band a bit and it's pretty powerful.  It allows you to import and export AAC and MP3 tracks and record sound in multiple tracks.  Very easy to use.  The only other audio app i've ever used is audacity and I much prefer Garage Band.  I haven't used any of the music lessons it offers yet but plan to soon.I played with iMovie for a few minutes and it seems pretty nice and very intuitive.  I actually don't mind Windows Movie Maker, which is included with Vista.  I would not consider it a big step up from Win Movie Maker, but it's a nice app.The mail, calendar, and address book apps are basic but work very very well.  The address app will import common file types easily.  It will sync with yahoo out of the box.  Address book will only sync with Google contacts if you own an iPhone or iPod Touch.Everyone has an opinion about iTunes.  I'm a big fan of it.  It's exactly like the windows version only it runs a bit faster without the bugs. If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, the Windows-iTunes bug with time/date being wrong after the computer sleeps is not an issue on the Mac.Time machine is the Mac's backup app.  It is amazing and very simple.  I'm using an external drive plugged into my Apple Airport wireless router, as a backup disk.  My wireless disk showed up on my desktop instantly once I plugged it into the router.  Time machine noticed the external drive right away and went to work backing up my files (after asking permission of course).  Now my machine automatically backs up any changes every hour as long as I'm in range of my wireless access point.  Time machine is a big load off my mind.  If I ever have a drive failure or my computer is destroyed I have an exact backup of everything without remembering to backup my files.  Vista will backup according to a set schedule, but it lacks the ability to easily look through backups for specific files.  Time machine is wonderful and make wireless backup effortless.The Mac disk utility is almost as good as the one in Vista and it's easier to use.  It's far superior to the one in XP.  I used it to format my external wireless drive because the Mac router couldn't read NTFS formating (although the computer can read NTFS drives via USB for some reason).The graphics control software is a joy to use.  When I plug in my external monitor it immediately extends my desktop to the new monitor.  Adjusting everything from resolution to rotation couldn't be any easier.Boot camp is a utility that allows you to create a partition and install Windows as a secondary boot system (you need to own or buy a legal single-disk 32bit copy of either Windows XP or Windows Vista).  When you start up the boot camp utility, it gives you a choice between using either 5 or 32 GB of space for the Windows partition.  I learned the hard way that Windows XP SP3 won't fit into 5GB.  You need to give it at least the 32 GB (which left me with almost exactly 200GB on my ""250"" GB drive).  Installing Windows using the Boot Camp utility is very very easy.  Once you get Windows loaded, your OSX install disk makes quick work of installing drivers for all of your laptop's hardware.  It's too bad that Nvidia and HP aren't as good at putting together easy Windows driver packages as Apple.  In order to boot into Windows, you simply press the ""option"" key during bootup and it allows you to choose which OS to run.  Windows XP absolutely screams on this hardware.The hardware:The hardware is where this computer really shines.The biggest advantage is stability.  My last computer purchase was a vista machine.  To say that I had stability and hardware compatibility issues with my HP Vista desktop is an understatement.  The main reason I turned to mac for this purchase was the fact that the hardware, drivers, and software are made for each other.  This machine has ran flawlessly for the past two weeks.  I did have two crashes of the Firefox browser while watching Flash video, but only the browser went down rather than the entire system.I have connected an external monitor, camera, ipod, USB drive, and router to this machine.  All of the drivers were already installed and everything has ""just worked.""  The hardware is a joy to use when it just works.  It is difficult to put into words how happy I am with the lack of effort in using this machine.The speed isn't blazing-fast but it runs very well, even with many many apps and windows running.  My Vista desktop has similar specs, but my new Mac feels slightly faster.One outstanding productivity feature of this machine is the touch pad.  I honestly prefer it to using a mouse for office and browsing tasks.  I can't say enough good things about the multitouch gestures.  Two finger scrolling, two finger right-click, three finger forward and back in Safari, and four finger expose make this machine feel like like it is part of you.  Having the entire surface of the touchpad as the button is brilliant, especially for drag and drop operations.  The large size of the touchpad makes it very precise.The keyboard is really nice.  At first I thought the keys were a bit soft and the travel was too shallow, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer it to my more ""clicky"" desktop keyboard.  I don't know how I lived this long without a backlit keyboard.  The backlight is more useful than I thought it would be.The display is beautiful.  It has good color, a wide viewing angle, and is plenty bright for indoor environments.  I would prefer that the screen wasn't glass, but the reflections aren't as bad as I feared.  If there is a bright light source behind you, you'll need to angle the screen to reduce the glare but it's workable.The DVD drive is a DVD drive.  It feels slow and makes a lot of noise.  I've never owned an optical drive that I considered fast and quiet, and this one isn't any exception.  It works well, but isn't anything special.The battery life is incredible.  The seven hour battery life is not an exaggeration if you are using the computer for light browsing and office apps.  Expect about 4-5 hours if you're using it for heavy web browsing and a bit of media.  Listening to music with the display off would easily last over the advertised 7 hours.  Streaming high definition video on netflix using wireless will knock it down to at or below three hours.  I haven't watched DVD movies on battery power but I expect it to barely get you through a single two hour film with a bit left over.The size and weight are ideal for portability.  4.5lbs doesn't exactly feel light until you compare it to similarly spec'd machines that weigh a full pound (20%) more.  I wouldn't want a larger machine if I had to lug it around much.The speakers are quite good for a small light machine.  Don't expect much bass, but the sound is very clear with good mids and highs.  The speakers are plenty loud for listening to podcasts or music in a semi-quiet medium sized room or office.  I won't need to pack external speakers for use in my hotel room when I travel, like my last laptop.The ""magsafe"" power adapter is more than just a gimmick, and more than just a way to avoid tripping and breaking your machine.  The ""power brick"" itself is a lot smaller than my last dell laptop.  It's exactly the same size as the USB wall adapters that used to be included with ipods.  The cord is 6ft long and the brick includes fold-out wings to wrap the cord around.  It is very well thought-out for travel.  With the cord wrapped up and the plug folded into the body, the power brick only takes up about 2.5"" x 3"" x 1"" in your bag.  When you are using it at home or at the office there is an included 6ft extension cord for the power brick so you aren't as tethered to your desk.The computer runs very cool compared to most laptops.  Also, there are no vents where super-heated air blows out.  While I'm sure it uses a fan, I've never audibly actually heard it run or felt a stream of warm air from it.  I think it may vent through ports and the keyboard but it runs cool enough that you don't notice it.  Edited to add: it does get rather warm when watching high resolution video, but stays quite cool when web browsing or using normal office apps.  Even when very warm, the fan is still quiet (the only way to actually hear the fan is to hold it near your ear).The only drawback to the hardware compared to Windows machines is the fact that there is no option to hibernate when closing the lid.  It sleeps when you close the lid but it still is using a small amount of power.  If you're only going to be away for a couple hours this isn't an issue, but you must completely shut down when on battery power if you're going to be away much longer.This machine is a lot more expensive than similarly spec'd Windows machines but I feel that it's worth the money.  I'm a very satisfied Mac switcher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA3BK8I1XXDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P05NKG#wasThisHelpful","R1DA3BK8I1XXDW","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Performance:Moves air very well on high speed, but is loud.  Noise may be acceptable for a busy office or workshop, but is not acceptable for a quiet room in your home.Low speed is quiet but is only good for moving air in very small areas.Clip build quality is very solid.Features:Great mounting options with clip, base, or screw options.Doesn't oscillate (big drawback for me).Only two speeds: loud and powerful or quiet and weak.Size:It's smaller than a normal tabletop fan, but isn't as small as the pictures may lead you to believe.  It's about 2/3 the size of a normal tabletop fan.Value:Normal price is way too high in my opinion, especially considering the company recently packed up their factory and went to China for production.Looks:All plastic modern industrial look.  Not likely to fit in with your living room decor.  Would fit in fine in an office or workshop.Cleanability:Fans that are used frequently need frequent dusting.  The front grill is held on with a screw and four clips that don't look like they will hold up well to much disassembly/reassembly.  The rear grill is part of the motor and cannot be removed from the fan for cleaning.  Deep plastic grill will be tough to clean thoroughly.Drawbacks summary:High speed is too loud for use in a quiet home environment.Price.Not easy to clean.Conclusion:If you want a lot of air movement in one direction in a moderately noisy environment this thing is perfect.  If you want to add cooling comfort to a quiet room this is a poor choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EG9CIFIFSHLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OOJ7DS#wasThisHelpful","R3EG9CIFIFSHLV","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice alarm clock, but the price is too steep considering its imperfections.The main selling point for this alarm is the wake-to-light feature.  I am a heavy sleeper, therefore I'm a bit of a sucker for alarm clocks that promise an easier time waking in the morning.  Personally, I really see no benefit from having a lamp slowly increase in brightness next to my bed before the alarm sounds.  I've tried different ""sunrise"" time lengths (it's adjustable), and it really doesn't help me much.  I have also tried three different light bulbs of various wattage (60, 100, and 200watt full spectrum bulbs) with no real help.  The 200 watt bulb, although deemed acceptable by the manual, made the entire alarm clock get very warm to the touch.  There is obviously some benefit to the wake-to-light feature for some people based on other reviews, but if you're a heavy sleeper like me don't expect much.  The lamp strictly warns not to use any CFL or LED bulbs, even dimmable CFLs.  Only energy-wasting incandescent bulbs can be used with it.Another big drawback for heavy sleepers is that the volume of the ""buzzer"" is not adjustable, so if you need a loud alarm this is product definitely a bad choice.  Volume is adjustable for the radio, but it doesn't get very loud either.There are several things I do like about this product, and I think it might be a decent choice for people who wake easily.  It has a nice easy to read display.  The touch controls work well.  Setting various alarms and times is easy and intuitive.The sound quality of the speaker is decent.  The digital tuner on the radio works very well and even brings in weak stations without extending the attached wire antenna.  The only drawback to the radio is that it only has three presets and it is difficult to manually tune very far across the dial quickly (you need to press the tune-up and tune-down button once for each 0.1mhz change in frequency).The nap timer is a nice option which is lacking on a lot of cheaper discount store units.I like the sunset feature that allows you to press a button and have the lamp slowly dim over 30minutes as you get ready for bed.If this device was 1/3 the price I'd probably award it 3 or 4 stars.  Taking the absurd price into account I would not recommend this at all.  A simple appliance timer would allow you to switch on a lamp a few minutes before your alarm sounds and give the same benefit as this clock does for 1/10 the cost.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPO5MU53RBQ9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018853JQ#wasThisHelpful","RPO5MU53RBQ9S","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just installed my Reelight set this afternoon.  I went for a 1.5 mile grocery run after dusk just so I could give the new lights a trial run.  I'm quite disappointed in the light's performance.  It has a few good qualities, but doesn't come close to justifying it's high price.Installation was easy and only requires a phillips screwdriver.  It's so easy that there are no instructions included, only a four step graphic on the back of the box.  Installation takes about 15-20 minutes.  They do work fine with my quick release skewers, which was a slight initial concern for me.I own four bicycles and I bought this set for my neighborhood cruiser / grocery getter: an Electra Townie Euro 8D.  In the past, I have bought everything from cheap $20 blinky lights, to a $380 hub-generator setup.  I am very experienced with various bicycle lighting setups, and this is the worst light set I have ever encountered.This review is for the Reelight SL150, which features steady lighting (as opposed to blinking) and built-in capacitors to keep the lights burning for a short period of time after stopping, commonly referred to as a ""stand light.""I chose the steady SL150 over the flashing lights to compliment the battery-powered blinky I already own (SL120 flashes with stand light, SL100 flashes with no stand light).  Battery powered lights are best in flashing mode.  I already own the amazing Planet Bike Superflash which runs for many many hours on a single AAA battery in flash mode, with a very eye-catching pattern.  I wanted a solid light for contrast and added visibility.  When battery powered LED lights are left in solid-light mode they eat batteries quickly, so I bought this setup due to it's generator setup to conserve battery waste.Both the front and rear lights have two small LEDs.  Modern LEDs range from dim lights that illuminate power buttons on home theatre equipment, to incredible 5watt lamps that put out as much light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb.  The lights in this kit are exactly like the dim bulbs that clutter the buttons on electronic equipment.  They emit light, but just enough light to be visible, not to grab your attention.  The light output is similar to widely available $10 light sets.I knew these were considered ""be seen"" lights rather than ""see-by"" lights.  I didn't expect these lights to actually illuminate my path.  I did expect them to draw some attention from traffic, which they do not.  The lights also provide almost no side visibility.  I don't think side visibility was even taken into account when designing these lights.The stand light function is very poor.  Stand lights should stay lit long enough to make it through a traffic light, one or two minutes.  The stand light on this model only lasts about ten seconds, which is absolutely useless.I only have a few good things to say about them.  I do like the mounting bracket because it makes the lights difficult to steal.  I like the fact that the light housing includes a reflector in case of light failure.  Mounting the lights on the axle is a good idea because a lot of rear lights don't have a good visible mounting location.  The permanent-on installation is nice because it keeps my bike in legal compliance after dark without remembering to grab my lights.  The lights create zero perceivable drag while in operation.Considering the fact that similar, dim battery-powered lights cost under $15/pair, these should sell for under $40.  I paid $65 here at Amazon, and Amazon's price is competitive with other online retailers for this product.  This is a great idea poorly executed.  Hopefully some day the manufacturer will find a way to get it working better.For anyone considering this product, I recommend that you spend a lot less on a Planet Bike superflash and a good quality led flashlight that can be mounted on the handlebars.  A setup like that can be bought for under $50 and will give you rear visibility of about 1/4-mile and usable illumination of your path.If you are sold on generator lighting, spend the $160 for a good bottle generator setup or $350 on a good hub generator setup.Spending $65 on this set is not does not save any money.  When you compare the price to quality generator setups it seems like a great value, but comparing this to a B&M generator setup is like comparing a Wal Mart bike to a fully outfilled touring bike.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HW5OYBHAWNR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PLEIC4#wasThisHelpful","R3HW5OYBHAWNR3","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All necessary hardware was included.It allows one-handed adjustment of the monitor's tilt, height, swivel, and even orientation (portrait or landscape, if you've never used portrait orientation you're in for a productivity-treat).There are no knobs or clasps to mess with when making adjustments, even height adjustment.  It's a breeze to adjust at-will.Plenty big enough for my 22"" monitor, and should even fit slightly larger monitors in both portrait and landscape mode.I rated all categories 5 of 5 stars except for value, because $50 is a little steep for an accessory for a $150 item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6M403075ZR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FLXW90#wasThisHelpful","R1T6M403075ZR7","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a perfect bag if you're looking for a way to carry a small SLR with an attached lens, and very little else.  I really like this bag and will definitely get a lot of use from it.  I already own a larger more fully-featured heavily padded camera bag, and rarely use it because it is just too bulky.  This bag is perfect for most casual-photographer outings.I bought this based on specs at Crumpler's web site for my Canon 20D (same size as Canon 30D, 40D, and 50D).  Crumpler suggests this bag for mid size SLRs like mine.  It takes a little wiggle to get my camera into the bag and the fit would be better for a more compact SLR like the Canon XT, XTi, and XSi.  If I had bought this at a brick and mortar store, I'd probably exchange it for a ""4 million dollar home"" for my particular mid-size camera.The bag looks great, Crumpler makes great-looking durable bags.  This is my second Crumpler purchase.  The bag has lots of little pockets that can hold small items like a spare battery or memory card.  It does not have enough space for anything with any bulk at all, such as a charger, external flash, battery extender, or spare lens.  The main flap is well designed with both a quick velcro closure, as well as a more sturdy clip-closure.I usually use Canon's budget 18-55is ef-s lens, and there is plenty of room for it.  A slightly longer lens would fit.  The tightness of my camera's fit is a width issue, not a length one.The bag really doesn't have any extra padding to speak of, just the fabric that it is constructed from.  It's a camera-tote, not camera-armor.  The bag's intent is obviously to carry a mid to small SLR with attached lens and offer light protection, with as little bulk as possible.  It does this well.Highly recommended as a nice-looking minimalist bag to carry a small SLR cam.  If you have a mid-size SLR, I'd recommend the ""4 Million"" instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4MIL7YX6CIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W8VWBQ#wasThisHelpful","R2T4MIL7YX6CIE","A3I04RM049YS8Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3I04RM049YS8Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I saw other reviews complaining about not being able to set this camera up with an iPhone - I was discouraged. Turns out I had been alarmed for no reason because I was able to download Hubble with no difficulty to my iPhone 5s, and from there setting up the camera was as easy as any other electronic device in the house.I also saw reviews complaining that the picture was not clear. My picture is not hazy at all. It's not as good as my Canon Rebel or even as my webcam - but in full color I can see a picture that looks as good as the ""security camera footage"" or ""traffic cameras"" that I find displayed on televised newscasts.The camera does pick up motion - and sends an alert to wherever you like - in my case, the iPhone. And I can view whatever the camera's viewing from wherever I like as long as I have wi-fi.So - why not 5 stars? Two cons: 1. The camera was very laggy in responding to directions from my iphone to pan left-right-up-down. 2. Hubble - the proprietary software you utilize to USE the camera comes with a ""free trial"" of a service where your camera will RECORD footage for as long as it detects motion. This is faint condemnation, but I HATE it when ANYTHING I'm sold comes with a ""bait and switch"" and you can get a ""full version"" of whatever you want for an extra price. I understand recording video footage takes up electronic storage - but there should be a capability to do such a thing to my PC hard drive if I like - at no additional cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15I5K3396PQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123CQQXM#wasThisHelpful","R15I5K3396PQ9","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are many bait and switches in the history of business. For the home printing business, the lure is getting a low-cost printer - many of decent quality for less than $100. But THEN you have to buy the ink, which is often as much as the original cost of the printer (if not more.) Epson busts this bait and switch business paradigm with their series of ink-tank printers. I was provided a sample in exchange for this review.If you only print a few things at home, you may want to stick with the inexpensive models (if you're not buying new ink cartridges often.) But if you print a lot this may be the golden ticket! The Mrs. opened a restaurant six months ago - and we've been printing menus in black and white as she changes the menu often depending on the season, etc. We were cost-conscious about making changes. Printing up 20 pages with a word misspelled seemed a minor catastrophe! With the ink-tank option, we can not only print in large volumes, but we're not limited to black and white. (Color cartridges would run out in two months previously.) Now we can print menus - and changes - with color adornments, and we will be able to do it again when the season changes.We printed a color photograph (onto photographic paper) and the quality was as good as we'd expect having it printed professionally. In the world of do-it-yourself technology, Epson has become the new standard for this market - those who want to print a large volume at home. It's not faster than our old printer. It doesn't have more automatic features (the paper feeder will only accommodate a few sheets at a time. It DOES set up easily to our wifi. When filling the ink tanks there are multiple instructions advising you to do it carefully, less you wind up with an ink spill. Once filled it takes about 20 minutes for the ink tanks to prime the printer.

"I'm sure that the LeapFrog family could tell you all about their product and the things that went into developing their products, but what we were interested in was ""could we get out nine year old grandson interested in reading."" He struggles, and he's self-conscious about it, but rather than seeking help reading he just shrugs and says ""reading is BORING"" and has previously fought every attempt we've made to stoke his interest. Video games, NASCAR and WWF he's very interested - but reading?I'll cut to the chase: we received our sample for free in exchange for an honest review. Honestly - he not only loves it, he uses the LeapPad and his educational software now preferentially over his sports video games.

"What I knew previously of JQA was from the movie ""Amistad"" and David McCullough's celebrated biography of John Adams. The father and mother, Abigail, of John Quincy Adams prepared him for greatness. Essentially home-schooled by his brilliant parents and standing alongside the likes of Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers, he had only three years of formal education prior to his entrance at Harvard. H.W. Brands' biography of Franklin called that great man ""The First American."" In The Remarkable Education of John Quincy Adams Phyllis Lee Levin has detailed the formation of America's first great progressive mind. Young JQA watched his father defend the British soldiers of the Boston Massacre and learned to rule his emotions with intellect - not unguided passion. By the end of his career - after his Presidency and while a member of Congress - Adams had rarified his views to become one of the chief voices advocating against slavery. Decades before the Civil War he defended the slaves of the ship Amistad who had taken matters into their own hands after being taken slave after the U.S. had outlawed international slave trade.Levin combed through volumes of first-hand accounts and condensed the mountains of material into this 544 page-turning biography. Her narrative smoothly transitions between the words of Adams and those around him and her own conclusions. I feel I know the man, and I can think of no higher praise for a biography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XI5XL3VWKXTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279621#wasThisHelpful","R1XI5XL3VWKXTU","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Volume Five is an absolutely superb 3rd Generation Bluegrass Band: like Blue Highway they are each individually superstars on their respective (usually multiple) instruments, but in the case of V-5 they all harness their personal virtuosity in favor of a collective sound that is seamless. On Run they mix original tunes in with covers that were so good it was as if I was hearing these Iconic songs for the first time. Crowd favorite Fox on the Run was so associated with the Country Gentlemen that other bands were loath to try it  the way rock bands were hesitant to take a hand at Free-bird. But since the passing of Charlie Waller Volume Five has picked up the torch, and they set it to Fox on the Run in an arrangement that is such a pleasure to listen to  its the musical equivalent of watching a Maserati drive by. John Prines Paradise comes vividly to life in an arrangement that begins in the urgent key of F, then midway kicks it up to a more Bluegrassy G with Patton Wages banjo break  all before Glen Harrells vocal comes in with an even bluesier bend before the final chorus, with the 3 part harmony kicking it up a whole nuther notch. As Emeril would say: BAM!!!Slow mournful ballads are mixed it with up-tempo barn-burners, and like the best bands before them, hot instrumentals are sparsely mixed in with vocal show-pieces that are accented by some of the hottest picking on the planet.Bill Monroe would be pleased to know his music has never been stronger  and no-one is playing as a more complete band right now than Volume Five.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7OBHPQGTKZRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4KFO9S#wasThisHelpful","R7OBHPQGTKZRS","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume Five is an absolutely superb 3rd Generation Bluegrass Band: like Blue Highway they are each individually superstars on their respective (usually multiple) instruments, but in the case of V-5 they all harness their personal virtuosity in favor of a collective sound that is seamless. Glen Harrells lead vocals are a pleasant, soulful baritone, with a yearning urgency that grabs the listener and pulls you into the song. His fiddle lines are silvery smooth. On banjo (and guitar) and tenor vocals is Patton Wages. His banjo hearkens back to the purest roots of Scruggs, but also twinkles with the modern flourishes of Vestal and Baucom. His smooth tenor vocal soars and bounces and sticks on top of Harrells lead lines like they were brothers by another mother. Chris Williamson anchors the group instrumentally on bass, and rounding out vocal trios alternating with Jeff Parton, who adds Rice-like rhythm guitar along with flat-picking leads that sound like hes been studying Sutton and Kenny Smith from the time he could hold a herringbone (which I suppose is likely true.)From the earliest days of Bill Monroe and Flatt and Scruggs Gospel music has been woven inextricably into the fabric of Bluegrass and on The Day We Learn To Fly they accomplish the more difficult task of adding 12 new Gospel Gems to the Standard Songbook. Hearing these young men sing and play thrills my bones all the way to the marrow. Do yourself a big favor and give them a listen.

"I don't toss out the word ""Greatest"" lightly.  If you asked ""who's the greatest guitarist?"" I could go on for 30 minutes and I'd likely not be able to give you a list of less than ten players.  Mark O'Connor has earned MY vote for ""America's Greatest String Musician"" in a career that included winning National Championships on SEVERAL different instruments - as a teenager - prior to going on to record and tour with literally a ""who's who"" of the leading musicians alive: a SHORT list would include Yo-Yo Ma, Stephane Grappelli, James Taylor, Pinchas Zuckerman, David Grisman, Steve Morse and Wynton Marsalis. Mark's main instrument is the violin/fiddle - and I think he'd not object to me pointing out that although they're the same instrument - in the minds of *some* people, they're as different as night and day. O'Connor was first a giant in performance and improvisation, followed by his brilliance as a composer, with pieces which were recorded and performed initially by O'Connor himself, but now are being played around the world.  Mark absorbed the music of texas fiddlers and gypsy jazz and bluegrass breakdowns and classical concertos and has reimagined it for the enjoyment of us all.  As if that weren't good enough - he now makes his musical method available for all - this recording is accompanied by a string instruction book designed to turn the aspiring fiddler into mature musical chameleons rather than automatonic robotic slaves to the written page of *some* musical methods. If you didn't already know Mark's background, you might be surprised to find a recording (and music book) that stretches from Bach to La Bamba to Bob Wills. He makes music that is beautiful, complex, and explodes boundaries. We are all richer for his gifts.

"I was previously unaware of German toy manufacturer Schleich until I came across this item:The Mrs. and I have grandchildren now, and we're always on the lookout for gifts that have a little meat on their bones.  Schleich is obviously the Cadillac of toy-makers.Note: this is ONLY the Animal Nursery and doesn't come with any of the famed Schleich figures.  Without the figures (which again, MUST BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY) this is like a Safari Doll-House... without the dolls.  But - the Schleich animals by themselves, although beautiful, sturdy, anatomically correct and to scale - are figures of limited imagination.  WITH the Animal Nursey imaginations are sparked to life.  The building (like all Schleich products) is incredibly detailed.  It looks like the Honey-I-Shrunk-The-Kids laser was sent to Kenya.  The doors and shuttered windows open and close and the inside of the building is a veterinary clinic with benches and rooms with furniture.  The realistic thatched roof lifts off so that the imagination-fired kids can move their figurines freely inside the nursery and make up their own tales about injured and healing animals.We accompanied this purchase with 21 Schleich figures including a Veterinarian complete with stethoscope and medical bag with a little red cross. (Like almost all Schleich figurines the Vets come in male and female versions.) Now the  Lion and Zebra and Giraffe and Elephant have a place to meet and heal, and your young animal lover has a fun way to develop those neural connections in their developing brain.The Nursery gives target ages as 4-10.  The animals come with tags on their legs saying 3+.  If the child(ren) in your house are looking to recreate the ""Toy Story"" version of ""The Lion King"" this is where I'd start.Pros: Extremely sturdy and detailed.  Minus nuclear explosion we expect these to be passed down for generations to come.Con: This degree of detail and durability doesn't come cheap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYZ9X19PRI1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XEAGMA#wasThisHelpful","RJYZ9X19PRI1N","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Mrs. ordered 12 of these torches and we like 'em a lot - we just don't QUITE love them.  The good - in exposure to sunlight the solar cells charge the batteries well - they're light activated for charging and dark activated for turning on the lights.  The ""torch"" part consists of 3 lights behind a frosted globe.  One of the lights flickers so you get the effect of a flickering flame.  Reviewers who complain that these don't put out a lot of light are missing the point (have they been around an actual tiki torch lately?)  Tiki torches are for effect - not for light - and the effect of these solar tiki's is quite good.  I get up pretty early for work and I can STILL see the Tiki's flickering at 6 in the morning - not bad for something that runs off the previous day's sunlight.Now the bad - the torches are perched inside of a brittle/flimsy plastic and this same plastic is used to make the 3 piece poles.  I say flimsy and brittle because it looks and feels flimsy and brittle up close - from just a little distance it looks like bamboo.  In reality this ""flimsy and brittle"" plastic hasn't broken so I'm talking myself out of saying they're brittle and flimsy - but up close they just don't feel sturdy.Now the really bad: they come with black plastic stakes intended to insert into the ground - these things are USELESS.  Out of the 12, 3 immediately broke with the meager physical effort of inserting into the ground.  The solution: (a good solution, but with extra cost) Tiki makes tiki torch stakes made of sturdy metal.  We pounded these into the ground with a mallet and now our solar tiki torches stand nice and straight.

"Amazon has scolded me for not reviewing this product within 30 days, but since one of the pre-eminent claims of these guitar strings is that they are ""long-lasting"" I felt justified waiting longer to see if they're as advertised.The good news: they are.Hardly any guitar strings don't sound good the day after they're put on.  And hardly any guitar players have the time or money (or free strings) to change strings a couple of times a week.  (If you're breaking guitar strings frequently - I recommend you check your technique for putting the strings on, or winding them or your playing technique.)So what do I look for in strings?First - the sound.  Almost all strings sound too bright and twangy when first applied.  Then they turn into... what?  Good strings mellow quickly into a wonderful, warm sound - what Eddie Van Halen called the ""brown sound.""  I think he said it was like the difference in the sound between hitting a block of wood and hitting an anvil.  Anyway - these strings sound good.Second - how long do they sound good?  As I said - most strings sound ok day 2.  But if you're not breaking strings often (and again - I can't emphasize enough that you SHOULDN'T be...) it would be awesome if your strings still sounded good months later.  I've had MANY name-brand sets sound just DEAD a week or two later.  The best strings still sound warm and powerful after many months.

"I grew up as a reader in an era in which biographies were written in a way that grabbed my young brain and pulled me into the story.  This is not to say that Neal Thompson's book is not even-handed and well-researched or that it plays as fast and loose with ""the facts"" as did Ripley himself, along with some of his contemporaries such as Hearst or P.T. Barnum.  No, this gripping and ripping tale made me turn the pages until there were none left to turn.  Robert Ripley, in effect, never grew up, and he became an extreme proponent and made his fortune with a little old fashioned entrepreneurial spirit mixed with equal parts ""reporting"" and ""pandering"".  He traveled the globe looking at the ""believe it or not"" amazements of the world - and of history.  Initially he transmitted them to us in his wonderfully imaginative drawings, but over the years he had collected enough real-life oddities that he had to display them in his ""Believe It or Not"" Museums.Remember pulling into rest stops, hotel lobbies and restaurants along your way to vacations and seeing the display stocked with colorful leaflets begging you to go to THIS or THAT attraction?  SEE ROCK CITY!  VISIT CAPE CANAVERAL!  SEE THE GRAND CANYON!  The young version of me would pick up a dozen of the most interesting to read on the trip.  I never failed to pick up one for Ripley's museums.

We put up bird feeders so that we may see the little critters up close partaking.  This feeder is not only the most attractive of our four, but it is perfectly symmetrical, meaning that the square shape allows four symmetric feeding stations attached to U-shaped perches.  (The manufacturer states this U shape is preferred by birds, but I didn't ask any to confirm...) Our other ""main"" feeder is asymmetrical.  It's free to turn in the wind on it's hanger, and if it's not turned at exactly the correct angle, when birds come to feed, your view is obstructed.  What good is that?  The antique copper finish on this feeder looks attractive and the ""all in one"" design doesn't give me the chance to lose screws or bolts when cleaning the refilling the feeder.  A cable runs through the center of the feeder and through the antiqued copper lid/roof.  The roof simply lifts off the feeder - allowing you to access the inside easily - then the roof slides back down the cable to sit squarely on the feeder again.  Simply stated - it couldn't be easier to use.  At under 20 bucks I don't think you can find a better-looking and easier to use bird feeder.  Cheers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KO0JNB6K6OY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PNBU68#wasThisHelpful","R2KO0JNB6K6OY4","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Jabra speakerphone does all of the things it wants to do - to some degree - but at one of its three most important tasks, it's noticeably worse than just using the microphone on the iphone.I was using it with an iPhone 4, and the audio I RECEIVED was excellent.  The device is also wonderfully compact - it comes with a padded case about the size of the palm of your hand, and the USB powering cable has a built-in wrap-around storage groove.  The Jabra is a nice, sleek, modern black, with LED lights to indicate battery charging, mute, volume control, blue-tooth connection, plus the simple green phone icon for making a call and the red one for hanging up.If the speakers on your laptop aren't particularly good, plugging the Jabra into a USB port improves the sound.  I was going to give two stars until I tried this function so I'm giving an additional star based on that alone.The problem is this: modern iphones and androids are so spectacularly versatile and useful that even my phone - two generations behind ""cutting edge"" had a microphone that worked much better than the mic on the Jabra.  In other words - having the Jabra set up in the center of a group gathered around a table may offer better sound for the people listening around the table - but the person RECEIVING your call will have noticeably worse audio than simply setting your cell on speakerphone and putting it in the center of the table instead.The Jabra LOOKS more modern and impressive... but the audio sent should be at LEAST as good as the phone by itself, shouldn't it?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4GSZXYI1C9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUO5RI#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4GSZXYI1C9W","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still remember Yahtzee games from forty years ago and the excited yell of anyone who rolled the coveted ""Yahtzee"" - five dice with the same number.Twenty years ago I bought a Yahtzee game for my own family - and it was just like I remembered it.  Which would have been fine for circa 1970, but in the video game era is frankly a little slow.  You wait YOUR turn while all the other players in the game take their three (or less) rolls of the dice.  There is a bit of strategy to it, but the degree to which blind luck determines a game was hammered home to me recently when I downloaded an electronic version of the game for a handheld device - not as fun as the game I remembered from my childhood.This new Yahtzee game adds action and excitement to the relatively stale concept: all players roll at once and an electronic button in the center of the playing board allows players to jump in and claim needed dice combinations.  This game keeps the best parts of old Yahtzee and adds needed excitement.  Good for old Yahtzee fans and anyone looking for an exciting dice game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72KYEXIXYNA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARQW1MM#wasThisHelpful","R72KYEXIXYNA3","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Oster Electric Wine Opener has less ""show"" appeal than any opener I've seen - so if you like making a production showing off your skill with a corkscrew this kind of defeats the purpose.But that's not me so I'm glad for this opener.  For about ten years we've used a nifty device Vinotemp Cork Mate Wine Bottle Opener - VT-CORKSCREW that uniformly and easily removes the cork - but then you're left with the cork impaled on the screw and it's sometimes difficult to remove the cork.This device works slick as a whistle.  First of all - it comes with a seal-cutter to leave a nice even edge on the foil top to the bottle.  Then you just insert the top of the bottle into the opening on the bottom of this opener and press the bottom.  It whirrs and after a few seconds you can tell by the sound and feel that the cork is free.  This part only makes it as good as our previous opener - but THEN you push the button in the other direction, the opener whirrs and the cork is extruded back out the opening.Opening a wine bottle has never been easier.  Also costs substantially less than our admittedly still working fine Cork Mate - and don't know whether durability will become an issue.  I suspect the Cork Mate will still be working fine (nothing electric) long after the rechargeable battery on this Oster has given up the ghost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JB2I79XQ4RI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TLMBTS#wasThisHelpful","R2JB2I79XQ4RI4","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brush has several features that make it a full cut above any other Windshield Ice-Scraper/Snow Brush I know of:1. The sturdy and comfortable rubberized handle extends - not flimsily, but into an extended ""locked"" position.  This allows you to more easily reach the hard to reach places.2. The sturdy but soft bristles are attached to a head that swivels: you can use it like a ""standard"" snow brush, but you can also turn it 90 degrees and use it more like a snow ""push broom"".Ideal for auto users in snowy climates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NT81XTRKQKB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DKKN7Y#wasThisHelpful","R2NT81XTRKQKB1","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First things first: I don't know whether this review will ever be (or stay) posted: at present the book is only available from 3rd party sellers at close to $100.  That's crazy.  (Amazon review reviewer - before you decide to delete this review, consider whether or not you want your company a party to blatant price-gauging.)  Hopefully the publisher will decide to offer the book directly on Amazon for a reasonable price.  I just got mine directly from [...] and paid only $34.99 for an autographed copy. ($24.99 without the signature)Now to the book:I must admit I was jealous when I first heard someone was undertaking the ""definitive"" biography of Tony Rice.  After trying (and failing, like everyone else) to PLAY like Tony, I began to consider myself something of a writer and was thinking about undertaking a project such as this myself.Thankfully, Tim Stafford and Caroline Wright beat me to it.  With unprecedented access and mandate from the man himself to tell it all - warts and all - the picture of one of the most gifted, imitated and mysterious figures of American music emerges.Presumably you know something of Tony Rice or you wouldn't be reading this.  He partnered with pretty much everyone in American string music from about 1970 to present, along the way acting as a central figure in the greatest Bluegrass Band in history (actually - in at least TWO of them)J.D. Crowe & The New South, Bluegrass Album as well as in two different string jazz bands. The David Grisman Quintet (US Release), Backwaters  His style was so ubiquitous for three decades that EVERY flatpicker copied him - then had to go to great pains to NOT copy him if they were forging the next frontier of acoustic guitar (such as Bryan Sutton).  Tony has maintained such an aura that if he is in a room of the biggest names of his business: Ricky Skaggs, Alison Krauss, Mark O'Connor, Chris Thile, Jerry Douglas - it is understood that Tony is the coolest cat in the room.  (Part of that aura is that while he was establishing himself as undisputed king of lead guitar he was also the undisputed lead vocalist of the era: in bands that included Skaggs, Krauss, Sam Bush, etc - Tony was always, without question, the lead vocalist.Krauss writes that when she received her platinum record for ""Baby, Now That I've Found You"" (the first platinum recording, I believe, in the history of Bluegrass) she sent the record to Tony and struggled over a typewriter trying to find the words to express her gratitude over his role in her development as a musician.  She wrote that tears flowed and when Tony received the letter he must have thought ""what is this film doing on here...?""Simultaneously perhaps the most musically inspiring and least ""knowable"" figure of Americana, Rice comes alive in these pages, through his words and those of his contemporaries including all of the above, plus other seminal figures such as Bela Fleck and Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt.The book closes with a comprehensive catalogue of Rice on over 200 recordings, plus a special section on Tony's famous guitar - the 1934 Martin D-28 - perhaps the most valuable acoustic guitar in existence.I'm no longer jealous - just happy and thankful that this book was made.  Thanks to Stafford, Wright, Tony and 40 years of musical memories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YURBYXVDBIWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0578051133#wasThisHelpful","R2YURBYXVDBIWB","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guitarists love and hate capos.  They let you adjust pitch so that you can play in weird keys without having to use weird chord shapes and fingerings, but it is incredibly difficult to get a good balance between ""easy to use"" and ""holds the strings properly - without buzzing.""  (Not to mention guitarists HATE it when pianists or non-capo users call the device a ""cheater"".  Hey - the best barre chords don't really give you as good of an E-flat as a good capo. But I digress.) The Planet Waves Capo does both - and well.  Previously marketed capos either held the strings tightly - such as the Shubb - I love my Shubb - inobtrusive and holds the strings securely right where I want it.) But the mechanism of the Shubb made it impossible to work single-handed (very important if you want to change position mid-song.) OR the easy to maneuver capo kept a weak grip on the strings - inviting buzz - and were usually large monstrosities that required awkward hand positions for some fingerings.  This capo goes to #1 in the rotation - it not only holds the strings well and is easy to reposition with one hand - it is easily adjustable so it will grip a narrow neck like my strat and a wider, rounder neck like on a classical guitar.  Steel string acoustics are perfectly held by the Planet Waves.  It's made of sturdy components and I expect it to last decades. Highest possible recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIV2ZKZEX5D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BPI3AA#wasThisHelpful","R2LIV2ZKZEX5D3","A36EW68H08UOCS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36EW68H08UOCS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I knew when opening this one however I should be good because it came with a lifetime guarantee. I initially was  impressed what the overall durability,and overall quality of the charger you can tell they put effort into making it last.  The connection nice tight, secure connection when plugged in , I hate when charges fit loosely. I was very pleased to find this charges not just our iPhones and iPods but our iPads as well not all chargers will be supported but this one did.

These are  intended to be the no show socks so perfect for wearing with shorts without everyone seeing them however I do have smaller feet so I am not sure if them coming up a little high was the sock itself or not. They are super comfortable on your feet. They are pretty thick also and the quality shows they will last quite awhile.  I love that the thickness will create a little bit of extra warmth this winter on your feet.  Overall all these are a great pair of socks I got to review at a discounted price but the retail price is so worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCH9GC9TXGDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEQ9EXK#wasThisHelpful","R2PCH9GC9TXGDB","A3JLI440JG0QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLI440JG0QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concentrated liquid inside this bottle is one of the best I have tried thus far, even better this tiny 8 oz. bottle makes 1 full gallon. You only need a few sprays to see and smell results so  you are bound to have some around the house for a very long time! All you have to do start out is dilute in water I personally bought one of those cheapie clear spray bottles and it worked great. Having two cats and a dog can create some odors, I must admit, some harder to get rid of than others. Angry Orange has a very pleasant citrus smell that eventually disappears in the mean time it smells great and not chemically like other cleaners we have used. It does a great job of removing odors rather than  masking them. This is a great little household cleaner as well I don't know who makes more messes the pets or the boys but I have used this to clean messes up equally. The overall value of this cleaner is phenomal when compared to the cost/ quantity of other brands. I am happy to have received this to test and evaluate for review purposes I will definitely  be rebuying in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32F7S95NR21JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI20SXA#wasThisHelpful","R32F7S95NR21JJ","A3JLI440JG0QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLI440JG0QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These socks are great for the upcoming  cold weather  I can't wait to wear them paired with a pair of nice boots! The patterns are pretty and the colorways are great also. I love how soft they are also they are so soft and comfortable on your feet, I have bought some wool socks before that were rough and itchy but that is not the case with these. These will surely keep your feet  warm and toasty for the colder months ahead. They fit comfortable around your ankles also,  this too has been a  problem with other wool socks I found them tight and almost painful at the top, these are just right.

"I am loving this case for my iPad mini. I love the look of it it it is simplistic but very stylish at the same time. I found it to hold quite a bit, at  first i tried it with just my iPad and found it to have extra room, I then tried it with the otter box on and was excited to find it fit with the otterbox on as well  which almost never happens with other cases I have tried. There is also a front pocket that is great for storing my little case that holds my headphones and charger and still have room for a small notebook as well. The padding on this case is very thick and provides great protection for your device. This is an overall case that provides great protection I love  that it is like an extra protection for someone like me who keeps a case on their device but wants to keep your device in a bag along with other related things so you can throw it in your bag and go.

"Rocky Mountain has created a good  procduct with this shoe deodorizer. I live in a house where the majority  are boys, very active sport playing boys. I am constantly setting play shoes and cleats outside to give my nose a break. I really liked this spray because it made of all natural ingredients  something we look for in our house.  The peppermint smell is very pleasant and actually alleviates odor not just masking it.  I used  it on all the boys shoes and was curious about discoloration at all not that I minded insoles becoming discolored ,but after realizing this was color safe I decided to try it in all the gym bags, glad I did . The stuff works great I have no complaints. I am happy to have received the spray  at a discount in order to test and review it.

"When we are in the car traveling as a family  we never have enough ports to charge everyone's devices. Qicent solved this problem with a great charger that includes two cigaretter lighter ports and 3 usb ports  perfect for our  family. This charger fits perfect in the cup holder on the backside of the center console so its easy for everyone to plug something in and doesn't get tangled up in the front.  It charges ipads great which I love because I have gotten some chargers before that our iPads are just too powerful for.  The device is built to last as the kids have dropped it a few times and it is still going strong. Overall all its a great device for adding some charging power to your car .

"HomePro Goods knew what they were doing when they made these great bags! While these are advertised as shoe deodorizer bags they are actually quite versatile because they naturally eliminate moisture that causes odor. My boyfriend is a cook and his work shoes  have a horrible smell after a 10-12 hour work day I knew that trying these out in them would prove they work on  anything. They definitely work  his shoes normally stay outside on the deck because the sneakerballs we have tried just mask the smell and I can't do floral smelling funk, gross!  I put one of the bags in each shoe and closed them up in our spare bathroom and checked on them after a few hours, I could already tell a difference in that short time  and by the next morning the smell was nearly non existent , unbelievable. I plan on putting one in each of the boys football bags also to help get rid of some  of the smell from the sweaty socks and other clothing.  I love that these have a hole at the top it was perfect for putting a hanger through and hanging one up in my closet, I live by the ocean and bay and my home sometimes has a damp smell in the summer. It really helped to get the smell from my clothing. What I love the most is that these are all natural so safe for my family, and that you recharge them in the sunlight for longevity you can't beat that. I am happy to have been given the opportunity to try these deodorizer bags out complimentary to test and give my honest review on. If you are in the market I highly recommend these, you can tell HomePro Goods put some thought into them based on the small details like the hanging hole, things that you don''t find in other similar products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XFXSYGS25O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ZL1QDW#wasThisHelpful","R29XFXSYGS25O2","A3JLI440JG0QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLI440JG0QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am loving this HUGE wall sticker! It is the perfect way to make a room look great with little cost and effort. I put this up in our master bedroom behind the bed and it is amazing how something so simple can make the  world of difference with your decor. I have used wall stickers before through out the house and quite frankly they are not all made the same, I have gotten cheap ones that you go to take them off the sheet and they have ripped before they ever make it to the wall. I have bought some with color that when removed have left a light tint of that color on the wall and then I have had some that are pieced together and the image doesn't align properly. I had no complaints  with this stickerbrand decal. It went on easily and quickly  and it hasn't starting peeling off like some. the price tag is great for such a huge piece also you can get something half this size and pay the same price. While I did recieve this decal at a discounted price in exchange for m honest opinion I wouldn't hesitate to but more at full price, I will definitely be looking into more  from this brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3298GPBE1XP6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048F7YX4#wasThisHelpful","R3298GPBE1XP6K","A3JLI440JG0QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLI440JG0QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am loving this bag because its is super cute and very versatile. It can be dressed up or down and goes with anything. I personally like how much it holds, it is very roomy inside I was able to place my iPad, makeup bag, wallet and many other accessories in the bag with more space for more.  It is high quality and durable and you can tell it will withstand normal wear and tear of everyday life, the studs on the bottom were a  nice addition as they keep the bag of the floor and keep it from getting ruined. A lot of my bags get ruined on the bottom because they don't  have anyway to protect them. The construction of this reminds me of higher end designer bags at a much more affordable price tag without substituting the quality, you can't beat that.

"This skirt is super comfortable! When I opened the package I immediately fell in love with the pattern, my niece fell in love with it and stole it from me she said it would make the perfect dress. She was right it looks adorable on her! It is made with a bit of spandex giving it the perfect amount of stretch. Not only did it fit me perfectly as a skirt it fit my younger niece as a dress very versatile, it can it be folded around the waist for shorter people. It can be dressed up a little with a cute shawls  or thrown on top of a bathing suit, When worn it stays and place, no sagging or falling  I am impressed with how well this skirt has held up after a few washes, he colors haven't bled or run, and it is still fully intact. I love that this skirt comes in many color options I personally got the black and white for a specific occasion however  I love all the other option. This is a high quality durable skirt and I am so glad I received the opportunity to get it to wear in exchange for my honest review.

"I am constantly taking pictures trying to capture all of those memories I never want to forget, I take so many pictures my family gets sick of me but it makes it so worth it getting that perfect picture.  Once I get the perfect picture of course I need a nice frame for it, this Adedco  frame was the perfect frame to put in the playroom with a picture in it of all of the younger generation of cousins together.  It is a classic, simple frame and looks great in the room. If you go into stores today frames have an outrageous price tag and are cheaply made( some out of thick plastic), not this frame it is made of wood and very sturdy. Adeco made this frame with thick glass as well not the cheap plastic inserts like some. I like the versatility as well, you can place this on a surface and it stands both horizontally and vertically , or you can hang it. I chose to put it on a shelf and it looks great.  Overall I am very happy with this frame it is better quality than most 4x6 frames sold at stores near m, it  looks nice, and  the retail price beats stores around here as well.

"I strongly believe in first impressions, this toy impressed me upon opening because it came with a nice velvety pouch that is great for storage and even better for discreetness on the go. This as awesome  for me and got me excited  about it before I could even try it out. After opening and examining it I took notice of the silky smooth texture, I prefer toys like this because they slide in much smoother and are just flat out more comfortable, this vibrator was no exception to this.  My favorite thing about this vibrator is the fact that it is waterproof, not only can we use this in the bedroom it is great for fun in the shower! My next favorite is the variety in speeds, with 10 different speeds of pulsation/vibration there is definitely no monotony. The girth of this toy is perfect not too thick not too thin, the curved tip is great for hitting the g-spot every time. When you turn it on you will be super shocked at how quite it is some toys you try out are loud and get even louder as you increase the pulse/vibe speeds. Overall this is an awesome vibrator, and it is up there as one of my favorites, the quality is great, and it does its job of pleasuring you well. I am impressed to say the least and am now intrigued with the brand and other things they have to offer because they definitely know what they are doing.

"We are ust now getting more into exploring in the bedroom and we love trying new things to spice up our sex life. I am impressed with this G-Spot Stimulator. It is small and lightweight but does wonders for your body which goes to show you size doesn't always matter. Upon opening it I found it twists off in the middle to insert your battery and that is also how you turn it off and on,super easy. Once I put the battery in and turned it on I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a light on the tip. I have never experienced anything like this and found it handy when put the simulator down in the dark and then going back to pick it up for more play time. I really like that this has a smooth, less strong vibration, its perfect for those nights where you don't want t get to crazy and want to have a little more sensual fun. When you insert it, its curved perfect to hit that special spot but I found I enjoyed it much more for clitoral stimulation. The soft buzz drove me crazy and had me begging him to stop and join in on the fun with me, apparently  he enjoyed my pleasure more than wanting to join in because he declined( not for long though. This toy is made of a an easy to clean material once all the fun is over.

"Aristocrat Homewares has really made a great product very creative and a brilliant idea. When I saw this my mind directly when to a good friend of mine who is a funeral director and wears suits everyday. When I go to his house and take a look in his closet my OCD kicks in but I can't touch it because he loves his ""system"". I knew this would be a great solution. Upon opening it and trying it out I really wanted to keep it myself this hanger can use it for way more than a suit. It is durable and made very well, lets be honest hangers aren't made well these days and aren't sturdy at all there is no way you can place a whole outfit on a hanger you find in stores. This hanger is amazing I was able to place a pair of jean, a cute top, cami for underneath, and a shawl on it. I then draped my necklaces ( I wasn't sure which I liked for my outfit)all onto this hanger, so cool.  For a man with suit this is great for  keeping outfits together and closets organized, but I see this hanger for so much more; pre-choosing outfits and accessories  for the week, easy traveling, anything. When on the go you can load up the hanger and throw it filled into a garment bag and keep it moving. I am truly happy I was able to try out this hanger at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review, I am truly impressed with it, its so innovative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMTPJTQXZKB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4G40YA#wasThisHelpful","R2PMTPJTQXZKB9","A3JLI440JG0QBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLI440JG0QBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ive been told numerous times about how different wine smells and tastes when its been aerated; about how many reds, especially, benefit from a good decanting.  Being the only person in my household who drinks wine, a decanting an entire bottle wasnt a great option.  This small, portable aerator was the perfect solution.  And now I understand what a difference it really makes.The device is easy to use.  Simply hold the decanter over your glass, and pour the wine through.  Do make sure you position the bottle so that the wine hits the little umbrella within; thats pretty important to the way the wine filters down through the system.  Youll hear the aerator working as the liquid is forced through the tiny holes.  But more importantly, youll smell it working.  The fragrance of the wine is really brought out during the process, and you wont fail to notice it.  In fact, youll probably pick up on things you hadnt before (even in your favorite wines).As for the taste  I can only describe it as opening up the wine.  Nuances Id never tasted before are suddenly at the forefront. Its almost like a whole new experience. Ive used the aerator with cabernet, a red blend, a ros, and a sauvignon blanc so far.  Each wine has been one Ive enjoyed before, but I have made sure to taste the wine both before and after, and each time the difference has been remarkable.This particular device is small and portable, easy to clean and to store (with its own stand), and travel friendly (a carrying bag is included).  It is also reasonably priced on Amazon at $19.99.  I cant recommend it enough.  You dont have to be a sommelier or connoisseur to appreciate it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111ZCOSE48P2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORZHJZI#wasThisHelpful","R111ZCOSE48P2O","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fish, Fish, Squish! is a board game for young children. It is designed for two to four players and those players should probably be very young children. The game box says ""5+,"" but I would recommend 5-10 as the core age group. My wife, after having played a few rounds of Fish, Fish, Squish! declared it the stupidest board game she has ever played. She liked it even less than. the old 80s Garfield board game or Miskatonic School For Girls. She's more of a DC Heroes Deck Building Game kind of woman.  Again though, she's not the target audience for this release. I however thought the game was flawed but cute and that very young children could have a lot of fun with this in short doses.Fish, Fish, Squish! doesn't take much time to play. The box says 15-30 minutes but in truth it is about 5-10 minutes only. In fact, set-up time (especially for four people) probably takes longer than it does to play the game. Now, this isn't something like Ikusa or Cthulhu Wars where you have lots of pieces to set up. Fish, Fish, Squish! is actually pretty simple in this regard. Some of the time is spent shuffling the 54 card deck and then creating a 6x6 grid out of them. Yes, you will set some of the cards aside in case the game reaches its conclusion without a winner. The real block of time is spent molding your fish to squish! Fish, Fish, Squish! comes with four bags of extremely high quality clay. It's fantastic molding clay and honestly, it's probably worth the purchase price of the game. The game also comes with four resealable bags so once you open the clay from their original airtight packaging, it won't dry out as quickly. I should note that because clay does eventually go bad, this does mean Fish, Fish!, Squish! has a limited life-span. The good news is that it will take a long time for the clay to dry out (We're talking months/years) and by that time your kids will probably no longer care about the game.The game comes with four fish molds, all of which are exactly the same, but you get one for each player to shorten the setup time. You make five fish of your chosen color by putting the clay into the mold and then removing it. Without fingernails, it can be hard to get the clay fish out of their molds and trimming the lines off the figures once released can take time and be tricky  especially if you have anal-retentive children who want their fish to be perfect. So again, setup takes long than the time to play the game.Actually playing Fish, Fish, Squish! is short and simple. Each player goes (from youngest to oldest) and on their turn, they flip a single card from the 6x6 grid over. This continues until someone makes a three-of-a-kind. This does not mean that they have three of the same fish revealed, but rather a line of three different fish (yellow, red and purple). This line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Once a player has made a line, they can squish one of the other players' fish. Lose all of your fish and you are out of the game. The winner is whoever still has a fish left at the end of the game. Pretty simple, right?Well, there are a few problems. The first is that with more than two players, you will almost always run out of cards in the 6x6 grid. Even with a two player game, that nearly happened every time. The game does have sudden death rules of ""add another line of six cards to the board"" but that doesn't mean even this will be successful.  You can end up having two or three sudden death lines (which uses all the cards) and have no declared winner. This is because of the randomization. Bad shuffling can end up with the cards not equally scattered across the grid, but with a massive clump of one color in a contained area. We saw it happen more than once. The randomness of the game not only increases the replay value of the game, but also can cause the game to be unbeatable  so to speak. This is a notable problem but one that can't essentially be solved because it really is just bad dumb luck when this situation occurs. Kids won't mind though, unless their fish squishing is down to a bare minimum. Perhaps it would be easier to make the game work as a Memory clone but with fish mashing. It wouldn't certainly remove the sudden death aspect that is often needed.Another issue is that some little kids won't process all the possible lines once the majority of the cards are revealed. Heck, some adults will have this problem. You will have three of a kind but a young kid might only be looking vertically or horizontally and forget diagonally. The good news is that the rules of the game note this and remind parents to help view all the possible outcomes that occur when a card is flipped. For adults that miss a three way that they have just made, well there's no excuse.Adults probably won't find Fish, Fish, Squish! very fun. It's a little too simple and shallow for them. The squishing of a clay fish is always satisfying, no matter your age group though. Young children (once they hit double digits, the fun factor in this probably decreases sharply) though, should have a blast with this. The game helps teach spatial recognition, pattern recognition, probability outcomes and lets you mangle something made of gooshy clay. I can't see this being a game kids will want to play for than two or three times in a row without getting board, or even once a day for weeks on end, but it is something that will be enjoyable in short bursts and something a parent can do with their child. With a price tag of under $15, you WILL get your money's worth with Fish, Fish, Squish. I'm just not sure for how long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AKO1NBQK6E5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8JGK0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1AKO1NBQK6E5Q","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally the only treats we can get all three of our cats to like are Greenies. Until now that is. All three of our cats really enjoyed these salmon and cranberry Kittles.Case Study #1: Shelly is a 14-15 year old Maine Coon mix. She eats anything and everything. She is not in the slightest bit picky. Each time we have offered her some of these treats she devours them. We think she might even be swallowing them whole. Now since Shelly is pretty much a garbage disposal, a glowing recommendation from her is not that impressive, but she does love these and ask for more when her treat allotment is done.Case Study #2: Malice is a two year old kitten. Her mother dies in childbirth and her sibling died soon after. She was the runt of her litter and ended up being fostered by my hare. So our tiny kitten who grew up to be a giant cat the size of my torso partially thinks she is a rabbit. As such she does not like meat. Or we assume this is why she doesn't like meat. She will eat some fish (swordfish and tuna for the curious) and chicken if it is rotisserie cooked, but that's it. She does not like wet food and strongly prefers kibble. She went gonzo for these treats. Which is a great sign. Like Shelly she wanted more and wanted them NOW.Case Study #3: Angel of Music is our almost one year old kitten. She is extremely picky. She loves her Royal Canin kibble and is willing to go on a hunger strike rather than eat wet food or even other brands. She doesn't like any meat except tuna and pretty much hates everything food-wise. With these treats, she stared at them for a while, then she licked them for a while and after a few minutes she ate them. This has been her pattern all three times we have offered her Kittles. The fact she deigns to eat them at all is a ""MIKEY LIKES IT!"" kind of moment and shows that across the board, our pets love these treats.Health-wise the treats are fantastic as well. they are two calories each and the first five ingredients are salmon, peas, potatoes, chick peas and chicken meal, so they are quite good for the kitties. There is a lot of protein to be had in these treats too, which is excellent. The price tag is a bit high on these treats (especially the Tuna & Cranberry variety), but since all our cats love them AND we have something all three will willingly eat, it's more than worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RF8ZCGDJ8K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP05CTG#wasThisHelpful","R38RF8ZCGDJ8K1","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A Naturalist Goes Fishing"" takes a look at eight different parts of the world with an eye on a specific fish for each region. In Manitoba, the focus is on the Lake Trout. In the Gulf of Mexico, Yellowfin Tuna is the catch of the day. France has Anchovies, the toothfish gets its fifteen minutes during the chapter on Antarctica. So on and so forth. In each chapter, the current conditions of each region and how changes to them have affected the fish population of the chapter are discussed and debated. It's a stark look at what humanity has done to the world around them. This just doesn't cover climate change, but pollution, deforestation, overfishing and more.Don't think that this book is a dry clinical read. Yes, it takes a stark look at regional developments and their fish population, but this reads more like a travelogue than a ichthyology manual. It is sometimes sage, sometimes funny, sometimes sad but always a captivating read. I don't even like fishing, but I really enjoyed this book in a manner similar to ""A Walk in the Woods"" by Bill Bryson. I will never attempt to walk the Appalachian Trail in its entirety, but I loved that book. Same too with ""A Naturalist Goes Fishing."" I have no interest in fishing, but the book and its narrative tone really made me interested in the author's enjoyment of the hobby and for fish in general. I also appreciated how much the author put into treating the fish with respect rather than as trophies. After all, they are living things and a source of food. It's not like they're a Heisman.Even if the thought of fishing makes you roll your eyes and you can think of nothing more boredom-inducing, ""A Naturalist Goes Fishing"" is still a very enjoyable read.

"This is a fantastic pizza wheel. It cleaves through the pizza with ease, yet it's not sharp enough that you would not fear a serial killer wielding this against you. It's very sturdy and glides through the pizza. It is very large though so those will small hands might find this unwieldy. At the same time though, the size of this thick and the strength of the wheel means this is the perfect pizza cutter for thicker pizzas like those done in the Chicago style. As well, I would recommend handwashing it as the size of the wheel  generally leaves the wheel spotty with water stains if you clean it in the dishwasher. Still, this is a great pizza cutter and it should last you a very long time","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6RPRSWWN2GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WEZO#wasThisHelpful","R1I6RPRSWWN2GI","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just purchased a breakfast nook for our dining room and decided to get this tabletcloth for it. It's a very beautiful dark green and the damask pattern really adds something to it. It's very stain resistant and you can wash it without worrying about it losing any color or being damaged in the wash. The tablecloth is quite slick so you might want to keep an eye on glassware or pets.You get a very well made and striking tablecloth for an extremely low MSRP (Amazon sells it for half that, which makes this all the more of a bargain).

"Nory isn't your typical kid  but how many books are about typical kids?  They always have magical powers or secret identities or destinies or quests, some secret power that will be revealed and they will save the day.  And they generally come from tragic pasts, too. Their parents have died and they've been raised in a horrid orphanage or by a mean aunt and uncle.  Well, Nory isn't your typical story book character, either.Well, she does have magical powers.  They don't work right, though.  Her past isn't  that  tragic though; her mother isn't living, but her father is alive and well and has a great job as a the headmaster of a very prestigious magic school.  Too bad he pushes her away. Maybe it's because he's still grieving, or maybe it's because she's different and weird. She has two siblings, who seem to love her a lot  but they aren't quite sure what to do with her, beyond trying to help her be ""normal.""Did I mention she is mixed race?  Yeah, the book kind of mentions that too, in passing.  Not many story book characters are mixed race.As the story begins, Nory's only ""mission"" is to get into Sage Academy, the prestigious magic school where her father is Headmaster.  Not only because it's the best school there is, but if she doesn't get in, it's kind of embarrassing.  And also she didn't apply anywhere else.But Nory instead finds herself living with her mother's sister and attending a ""regular"" magic school, in a class full of students just like her  students with ""upside down magic""  that's what you call it when your powers work, just maybe not like they're supposed to or as you think they should.  Will Nory learn the value of her (and her new friends') powers? Or will she keep trying to ""learn"" to be normal?Oh, to have been given Upside Down Magic when I was a child!  This book was a simply delightful read from beginning to end.  I urge every parent, cool aunt/uncle, grandparent, guardian, or anyone with a child in their life to buy this book as soon as it comes out!  And there are probably some adults who should read it, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1ZAPIL9ZDDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1ZAPIL9ZDDG","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this camera for my father to use and basically wrote this review around his time with it and his observations. He loves photography but he refuses to learn or accept digital cameras so when I have purchased him them, I end up having to return them or find them unused years later. This however is right up his alley. My father used to love Polaroid cameras when I was a kid and he had so much fun with the instant film. Of course, we all know what happened to Polaroid's instant cameras and film. That's a subject for another time. Me? I use my iPhone for cat pictures and that's about it.This camera came with a two pack of film and I had my father use the camera on his next trip to DC to visit us. The film went by quickly. Although the pictures are not going to be professional magazine level quality, they came out very well and my dad really enjoyed this camera. It's also reasonably priced, which made us love it all the more.The package contains the camera, a shoulder strap, AA batteries, a close up lens and the usual bells and whistles for a budget cameras. You have a viewfinder, extended lens, a tripod socket, manual flash, automatic focus, close up lens, and so on. It's a really nice camera that gives you ""widescreen"" style photographs. The camera does not usually come with film (this was for review purposes only).Like an old Polaroid, the film is pricey compared to digital prints and the resolutions isn't as good as some high end digital cameras. That's not the point though. The point is that the camera is an update of an old classic and it brought a smile to my dad's face. So this camera did everything I needed it to and more. Looks like the film will be an easy standby gift for him when various holidays roll around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E48DMT7YJVGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGOWK3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1E48DMT7YJVGH","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love cooking. My kitchen is full of all sorts of wacky gadgets from a gelato maker to mini pie makers. I actually find cooking relaxing. So when I was offered a chance to review this cast iron grill, I jumped at it. I love KitchenAid. I have their blender, their soft serve ice cream maker and many other items. I have to admit, I fell in love with this skillet as soon as the box arrived and I felt the massive heft of it. This thing is much heavier than you might expect. The weight on the Amazon page says only 6 lbs, but it actually weighs more than double that. So expect that.This grill is fantastic. I can't express it any other way. It works wonderfully and I love using it. The Panini/sandwich press topper is just a bonus. You CAN season this grill like a cast iron skillet or pot, but it has a porcelain enamel coating, so you don't really need to. The instructions say this the grill is dishwater safe, but they also say you're much better off handwashing this. Trust the instructions. Your grill will last much longer if you wash it in the sink instead of the dishwasher.Cast iron kitchen pieces can get extremely expensive. You get what you pay for. That's why I was surprised that this grill is so affordable. The MSRP is $199, which is indeed pricey, but Amazon sells it for much less, meaning you can get a high quality piece for your kitchen for a fraction of the usual asking price. I'd definitely take them up on that. This piece is very versatile, as you can use it in the oven, on the grill or on a stovetop. It's easy to clean (remember to dry it thoroughly) and it is a wonderful addition to your kitchen collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OA34L8P09VU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVTE6PQ#wasThisHelpful","R2OA34L8P09VU6","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have cleanser and moisturizing regimen that works.  But no matter how careful you are with your skin care, an unexpected zit will pop up from time to timeusually just in time for a big event or date. When that happens, I want something that will not just clear it up, but will do it quickly.  Preferably with as little irritation as possible.  I hadnt tried any of the Proactive products before, but I had heard good things about the products themselves (though I have been warned to never buy direct from Proactive) so I thought it was definitely worth a try.I know that benzoyl peroxide is my best bet for getting (and keeping) my skin clear and this product is a strong dose (5%).  I used it for several days in a row on a couple of tiny spots.  They cleared up really quickly (within a couple of days at the most), but I was left with dry, peeling skin.  This isnt actually unusual; many acne treatment products cause this, so it wasnt unexpected and I have ways of dealing with it.However, I found that the product just didnt work as well on the big monster blemishes (which I conveniently developed just in time to use this product on  lucky me).  You know the ones: the painful, hard, obnoxious ones you get once in a while (especially during hormonal changes).  Even in concert with my benzoyl peroxide cleanser, it still took almost a week before that one cleared up sufficiently.A two pack is $45.95 on Amazon right now  a two pack of really small tubes (.33 of an ounce each).  Is it worth that price?  I dont think so.  It does work, but its not a miracle product.  It doesnt work quickly enough on the real problem blemishes to warrant spending that kind of money on it. Thats why its only getting three stars from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW22IBI41ZD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSLO#wasThisHelpful","R1BW22IBI41ZD4","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These baskets are excellent for storing things like clothes, blankets, towels and other soft/fabric based items. They are lightweight and flexible, but they are not sturdy or thick. This means you shouldn't use them for heavy, fragile or sharp items. Sweaters - yes. Power Tools - no. They are excellent for maximizing space in you closet and for holding items that only get seasonal use. The ""sweater size"" baskets hold half a dozen sweaters give or take.

"We love Nature's Miracle. I've had an incontinent cat and a Rabbit who would sometimes spray outside of her litter box and for both, Nature's Miracle urine remover has been fantastic. It removes smells, stains and even non-urine issues like poo, juice and chocolate. So my wife and I were more than happy to take a review copy of their new product.Now it might surprise you to hear that we got this not for either of us, but our two year old kitty, Malice. Malice loves to smell everything, but she has some severe allergies to dust mites and trees. So she is on allergy shots once a week for life. We got this to see if it could help in conjunction with the shots, and I'm happy to report it really helped. It's not a long term solution, but the Allergen Blocker works just as well as getting allergens besides pet dander. We can squirt this in hard to reach places or in cracks like under the stove or fridge where we can't really clean, but the cat can still stick her nose under to sniff. Her sneezing is now almost nonexistent. She's much happier and so are we.This works quite well for people too. My mother is very allergic to cats and we have three so even when we come visiting, she ends up having a flare-up. Spraying this before a visit seemed to prevent the usual issues. So overall, we have some very positive experiences with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKBT77ZTUPLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX2N2U2#wasThisHelpful","R3FKBT77ZTUPLQ","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an algebra practice workbook, for children in grades six through eight.  Each section starts out with a pre-test, so you can see what areas the child should practice in.  The concepts for that section are very briefly reviewed, then it continues on with pages of exercises. Each section also ends with a post-test, to check that the child is picking up the concepts.  Areas covered include Algebra Basics, Fractions, Equations and Inequalities, and even some graphing. Answers are included at the back of the book.This book is not a complete algebra course. It should not take the place of tutoring or a remedial class for a child who is really struggling with the concepts.  Each section contains only a few paragraphs to review the concepts presented.  It does not go into in-depth explanations and in most cases only one example is given. If your child is really struggling with the subject, or is failing algebra, this book by itself is not going to fix the problem.If, however, you are looking for a way to keep the concepts fresh in your childs mind over the summer months, or if he or she just needs a little extra practice to get the concepts, this might be a good investment. Alternatively, if you have a gifted child who is interested in math beyond his or her grade level, this might be an interesting introduction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9P8H0R7AMF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1483816648#wasThisHelpful","R2F9P8H0R7AMF1","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I get a product that calls itself juice, I kind of expect it to be well, juice. So I was surprised when this review product arrived to see that this was actually ONLY 20% juice. This statement is blasted against the back of the package, which makes it more akin to Minute Maid fruit punch then actual 100% juice products. Generally this is done to cut costs, calories and/or sugar, but Purity Organic actually has as much sugar and calories as a 100% orange or orange/mango juice per serving. It also costs a lot more. Now you might think this is because the drink is organic, kosher and non-GMO. Unfortunately, this too doesn't hold up under scrutiny. I go to my local Co-Op or grocer like My Organic Market and get 100% organic juice products for less. So Purity Organic is needlessly expensive compared to contemporaries and is less of a juice product.This gets three stars because it tastes good and it tries to be socially and environmentally content, but for the most part, this is a product trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and from the other reviews here on Amazon, it definitely seems to be working.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKC6VU237DAVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009629MWA#wasThisHelpful","RKC6VU237DAVS","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You rarely say to yourself, ""Boy, I sure feel like making nachos on the grill."" In fact, I had never said that before in my life. However, don't let the name fool you. Cuisinart's non-stick grilling platter is exceptionally versatile and one of the easiest to clean pieces of cookware that I own.The 13"" platter can be used for a wide array of dishes, both in terms of serving and cooking. The non-stick coating is the best I've ever seen. Not only does gunk slide right off when you clean it, but it doesn't slowly but surely ship away like so many other products with a coating of this nature. Even if you don't cook with the platter, it makes for a fine serving tray as it is both light and durable.Note that the platter is HAND WASH ONLY.

"The Mai Couture Like a Diamond Trio is highlighter and blush on thin paper slips together in one packet, designed for quick easy use on the go.  In theory (or, on paper if you will  ha!) it sounds like such a neat idea.  Unfortunately in practice its anything but.The first thing I noticed was that the dust goes everywhere.  This is not something Id want to carry around in one of my nice handbags, because I can imagine the product staining the lining.My second issue was that I found the papers to be hard to handle.  Its actually a bigger problem with the highlighter sheets, since when applying blush youre generally trying to get the color in a larger area. I had a hard time getting the highlighter where I wanted it.  I had to fold and bend the sheets in an attempt to get the look I was going for, and wound up with more product on my fingers than on my face. With both the highlighter and the blush, I still had to blend the product with a brush anyway because of the harsh lines I ended up with  which I thought defeated the point of the papers?I did like the highlighter color very much.  Im very fair and it looked quite nice on my skin.  The rosier blush was lovely, as well.  I dont wear blush on a daily basis, but it also looked nice with my coloring.  The other blush was a bit too orangey for my taste.This is not a product I would get again, especially for $24.00 for a packet.

"So the boxes aren't very good. I have to state that right out. The tube is too small for our cat or either of our kittens. They can't maybe get their head in. These are so small I'm not sure how the makers thought these would be appropriate sizes for cats when they are too small for kittens. Maybe bunnies or guinea pigs.The boxes are too small as well. Our cat can't fit in either, and if you have cats you know how good they are at contorting themselves to fit small boxes. That speaks volumes about these. One of our kittens likes to lie in it, but they are so small, whenever she gets in, she knocks out a side panel or the bottom because they are so flimsy. Don't even get me started with how dangerous these can be if your cat gets on top of one. Like the sides, the top is removable and thus pops out/caves in from the slightest amount of pressure, say a cat or kitten walking or just laying on it. These things can be death traps to the less agile, clumsy or any cat over five pounds.My advice would to never, ever ick these up. The materials are shoddy, the boxes are too small for cats to actually use and the tunnel is simply unusable. Save your money and just give your cats the next box your Amazon order comes on. It's free and it will last longer.

"Look, I love Grimlock. I still have my original one, my blue G2 one, my Beast Wars version and several other variants. I especially love my Masterpiece Transformer version, who is certainly the best version of Grimlock to come out. So I when I was offered a chance to review a new version of, him, Grimlock, I definitely jumped at the chance.When the Voyager class version of Grimlock arrived, I looked at him in the box and was unimpressed. He did, after all, look nothing like *MY* Grimlock. Now I have the Alternators Grimlock and Pretenders Classic Grimlock, so I don't need him to be a classic T-Rex by any means. This was just weird looking to me. When my wife, who is pretty uniformed about Transformers saw him though her reaction was, ""OOOH PRETTY!."" She kind of fell in love with AoE Grimlock at first site and went from being nonplussed about our free tickets to the film to being excited because she wanted to see Grimlock on the big screen. Her Grimlock, mind you. Her initial impression to this toy (which she loves) and how different it was from mind made me realize I was condemning this toy for not being the classic ""Me Grimlock King!"" from the cartoon or the Budinsky/Furman Grimlock from the comics. That was unfair of me and the more time I spent viewing the toy on its own merits and flaws, the more I realized, this was a pretty good figure on its own. It's not perfect, but it's by far the second best of the AoE figures to me.The Voyager Class Grimlock is easy to transform, although I advise you not to use the instructions. Grimlock comes packaged in Dino form and the instructions are from robot to T-Rex. Whoops. Grimlock transformers pretty easily ATLHOUGH he has a couple pieces like his shoulder section in T-Rex form  (which becomes part of his back in robot form) that feels like you are moving it the wrong way and/or that it will break if you move it into the correct spot. it won't, but man will it seem like it is going to. I also like that this version of Grimlock has a moving jaw action but I do wish there was a way to permanently close his jaw instead of it always hanging open. He's not perfect, but he does look like a weird alien version of a  angry T-Rex.Robot Mode is fine. I'm not a fan of his feet, but that's personal opinion. He stands up fine and that's all that matters in the end.Overall, I'm pretty happy with Voyager Grimlock. He's no Masterpiece Grimlock, but he's also only twenty bucks rather than five to ten times that ala my Japanese import, so it evens out in the end. There is a ""Leader Class"" Grimlock that is prettier and contains both more chrome and colour to him that this voyager version...but he also costs twice as much. I'd personally stick with the Voyager. When my TFs start hitting the $40+ mark, I start to consider the third party market or Masterpiece figures - especially over a Bey-verse guy. All that said, Voyager Grimlock is pretty good for his price point and I'm happy to have him in my Grimlock collection. He'll never be my favorite Grimlock, or even in my top five, but he's one of the better, if not the best AoE transformers, so that's a big plus in his favor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKR9IQQ2BX54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECV4DBA#wasThisHelpful","RFKR9IQQ2BX54","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a big fan of the Dinobots as a young child growing up in the 80s. My favorites were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag was the first one I owned and he still has a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colours instead of silver, gold and gray. As much as some older TF fans like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apples and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag looks like the original but has the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelationSlug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His modes are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) looks fine if a bit garish. My wife likes how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people!Robot mode is where Slag falls apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head as shoulder pads instead of a helmet for example. Other parts are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino legs are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot.So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectations in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking. We'll call it a thumbs in the middle here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLC35PDD54K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECV4DD8#wasThisHelpful","R1FLC35PDD54K","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you like old school Konan, Kull the Conqueror, Appendix N style authors and the like? Then you may just enjoy Barbarian Lord, a new graphic novel collection which continues the saga of well, Barbarian Lord. Yes, that is his name.I wasn't sure if this was a prequel or sequel to the other Barbarian Lord releases out there, but to be honest, they all can work as stand-alones more or less.Barbarian Lord's main character may rub some readers the wrong way. He is definitely a Marty Stu in that he is great at everything and defeats any obstacle in his path with little effort or challenge.  He's also rather unlikeable as a person. He kills a person at the drop of the hate for any slight, imagined, over-exaggerated or real. Good naturedly rib Barbarian Lord? He will murder you. Try to take his land? He will murder you. So on and so forth. He also looks kind of like Dick Briefer's Frankenstein. I'm not sure if that is coincidence or purposeful homage. Barbarian Lord is not a good person, nor does he have many redeeming qualities, so if you go into this expecting a ""lawful good"" sort of protagonist, you will be in for a shock. I have to admit. *I* don't even like the character, but it is the writing and world of Barbarian Lord that makes it enjoyable for me.This particular graphic novel isn't very gory, even if it is violent. There are beheading and impalements, but there is gratuitous depictions of such like in a Geoff Johns comic. Instead blood and gore is left more to the imagination. The most violent thing shown is an eyeball flying out of a caved in skull and that is at the very beginning.The story of this particular graphic novel is a bunch of people who don't like Barbarian Lord are manipulated by a certain skullheaded antagonist into declaring Barbarian Lord an outlaw and casting him out of their village. From there Barbarian Lord encounters a few challenges and some new allies as he seek both revenge and to retake his rightful lands. The story is deeper than that quick description as you will see from reading it, but that's the book in a nutshell.The writing is where Barbarian Lord really triumphs. The book reads like a classic prose novel, with characters speaking in ways you would never see someone do in real life, but this manner makes the book all the more enjoyable. The odd turns of phrase, unique sentence structure, and even a poet vs poet battle make the comic as much fun to read as it is to look at. The cast of supporting characters (especially the birds and wolves) are fantastic too.I enjoyed Barbarian Lord for what it is, but it definitely isn't for everyone. Younger readers should probably stay away, and those looking for more likeable characters will probably be disappointed too. If you are a man of Howard and other similar authors, you will probably enjoy this for what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPRV8N9K71U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547859066#wasThisHelpful","R1CPRV8N9K71U5","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the semi-recent trend of the ""pick your own size"" paper towels, as it cuts down on waste and allows you the size paper towel you actually want/need for a spill, cleaning or napkin alternative. We tend to buy the Brava brand in our home because they are really absorbent and you can get a lot for a good price. We were offered this bulk purchase of similar style Bounty paper towels to review and found ourselves equally impressed with what we got.The paper towel rolls are enormous. In fact, they are so thick they don't fit on our towel dispenser. We have to whittle the roll down a bit and then put them on. That's not a bad thing, but something you should keep in mind. As well, because you are getting a dozen two packs, you will need a place to store these. Great for a big family that goes through a lot of paper towels, but if you live in an efficiency apartment or the like, you might want to rethink this purchase. The rolls even out to about $1.25 per roll, which is an excellent price.The towels do what they need to, which is suck up spills, help you clean, and give you something to wipe your hands on. I mean, it's not rocket science. For the most part a paper towel is a paper towel is a paper towel. Thickness and absorbency are the two real areas to judge these by and the Bounty towels do a great job. We're very happy with them and their results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1IM6FCWCGPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQ2T06#wasThisHelpful","R2H1IM6FCWCGPD","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet Chili Garlic chips seem to be the hardest Kettle Chip variant to find. In fact, although I've looked for them in stores, I've never seen them. This was my first experience with them and I have to admit, they were as addicting as they were tasty. I tend to be a very light snacker but I would find myself eating half a bag if I wasn't careful! It's spicy enough to be tasty but not so spicy that would offend a more sensitive palate. Even my friends found these extremely delicious and would ask if they could take a bag from me since this particular flavor appears to be nowhere in the DC metro area.Terrific chips, and buy purchasing them in bulk, they are quite cheap and will last you a very long time.

"I generally enjoy historical novels.They dont even have to be 100% historically accurate - Im a firm believer in artistic license, as long as the author doesnt claim otherwise, of course.  However, I just couldnt get interested in this.  The reason for that was that I simply hated the protagonist.Tom Hawkins is a man in debt, given a second chance (through the love of a good friend and  a healthy dose of luck).  But does he take his money home, blessing his good fortune and pledging to make better decisions?  Of course not!  He decides to stay out half the night drinking and carousing, and manages to get robbed on the way home. It didnt take long for me to start feeling like Hawkins was an idiot who deserved what he got.  I couldnt relate to him at all and had no sympathy for him.The writing was fine, and I feel that the author did a good job of trying to depict the harsh reality of life in a debtors prison in the 1700s.  Unfortunately, I can't give this a positive review, simply because my hatred of the main character and his constant copious amounts of stupidity kept me from finishing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWHDNWW9CWL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544176677#wasThisHelpful","R3IWHDNWW9CWL2","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is supposed to be a mystery novel about master sleuth Sam Levitt.  Unfortunately, theres not really any mystery here and Sam Levitt hardly strikes me as a master of anything  unless its a master partier.  Thats all they seem to do in this novel  eat and drink good wine.From the very first chapter, we know whos after Francis Reboul.  Theres no mystery to solve, really  another rich guy wants his house, a rich guy with a history of violence and a string of dead business partners.  They talk about the danger Reboul is in throughout the novel, but the bad guy only makes the one attempt at the end of the novel; an attempt thats so easily thwarted you sort of have to question the intelligence of he and his conspirators.The only thing I really enjoyed about the novel were the descriptions of the locales.  Thats about all it had going for it, and it was the only reason I finished it. Theres no mystery, no suspense,  little action, and even less adventure.

"Although I was never a big fan of Andre the Giant in the ring, I found his life and the stories told by his fellow wrestlers to be fascinating. So I happily picked up this graphic novel. While the book does take liberties with Andre's story (and the book admits to doing this) and portrays him in a far more positive light than long time fans might expect (cruder stories such as his Asian women fetish and habit of pooping in bathtubs are left out despite being some of the most famous stories), the book does do a good job at showing you key moments in Andre's life, whether it's the usual WMIII rigmarole or a fight he had with Bad News Brown/Allen (A black Canadian wrestler) over his use of the N word .At nearly 250 pages, this is a pretty long original graphical novel and wrestling fans should really enjoy the stories and nostalgia it provides the reader. Even people who are too young to remember Andre will still enjoy the graphic novel on some level, but int his case, the older you are, the more you will get out of this piece.I will say I didn't care for the art style, but that's really subjective. What matters is that out of all the books on Andre so far, this was the most fun to read, even if it wasn't the most accurate or informative. Still, it's a comic so it's not like you're going into this thing expecting the author/illustrator to have vetted everyone who even tangentially knew the man.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPEAAQ4R1N6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596438517#wasThisHelpful","R3PPEAAQ4R1N6L","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, my family grabbed this litter box because it looked neat and the ability to get a urine sample seemed like a good idea as we've had to do that before with our elderly cat and it was a pain.The Purr Fect Potty is easy to put together and well made. It's a finely crafted litter box and it looks great. However, our pets refuse to consider it a litter box. They simply don't know what to make of this thing.We have three other cat litter boxes in the house, one is a hooded box like this but much bigger and with steps for our elderly cat to get in and out of. One is the Merry Pet Cat Washroom / Night Stand Pet House which looks and works great. The other is a regular litter box with a high back to prevent spraying. So you would think the Purr Fect Potty would be something easy to adjust to. Well it isn't the refuse to go to the bathroom in it. The kitten plays with the pine pellets like a little human child plays in a ballroom. The elderly cat uses it as a bed. Not once have they gone to the bathroom in it.We suspect it is because the pine litter looks like rabbit pellets. We have an eight year old hare that is definitely the boss of the two cats. She's territorial and very aggressive if either cat tries to use her litter boxes. So either the cats think that because it smells and looks like rabbit food, they are not using it or they simply don't like the thing as it was intended.Checking other reviews on the site, no cat seems to actually be using the Purr Fect Potty, so I guess it must be displeasing to cats in some way we mere humans can't understand. Well, at least the cats are sleeping and playing with it instead of actively avoiding it. That's...something I guess.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FV84GNXVCVR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5VQSWE#wasThisHelpful","R2FV84GNXVCVR7","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first - the Neato Botvac 80 is NOT a replacement for regular vacuuming. If you buy it for this reason, you will be disappointed. That said, as a maintenance helper to keep the dust and pet hair picked up regularly, the botvac is fantastic. Sometimes it's just fun to watch it learn the house and interact with your pets. We have one cat that has a love/hate relationship with it as it runs from and chases the Botvac around the house.Pro:A large dustbin compared to other robot vacuums. It needed to be emptied after each room thoughCon:The dust bin is easy to remove from the bot, but to pry the lid off of it takes a surprising amount of force, which as you may imagine, causes dust to fly out and back onto your nice clean floor.Pro: The vacuum is pretty good at navigating your room. It quickly learns the layout of a location and you'll be able to figure out its cleaning pattern of a location after a few trips in that room.Con: There are a few quirks where the vacuum will insist it can fit under something it can't or will think there is something blocking it when there is only empty space and not go forward. In our study, the Neato always gets stuck under the couch and will cry out for help (which is kind of neat) and will do only half the room three times in a row, repeating itself and refusing to move beyond a certain point until it has circled the other half of the room three times. Only then will it make a single sweep around that other half.Pro: The vacuum can mostly be left on its own after it learns the layout of your home.Con: You do have to baby-sit the vacuum the first few times it does a room to make sure it doesn't get stuck. This isn't so bad except it takes three times longer to clean a room than a regular vacuum, so make sure you have a book or handheld gaming system while you wait.Pro: It's VERY quiet.Pro: it's always able to find it's charging base and doing so doesn't take long at all.Pro: It works on carpet, tile and hardwoodPro: It's usually gentle with furnitureCon: Except out extremely old Amish rocking chair heirloom which it repeatedly tries to climb. It looks like it's trying to mate with the poor chair.Overall, this thing is a great little maintenance machine. You can program to vacuum at certain times every day or every few days and our kitten (the one who has the love hate relationship with it) has even learned to turn it on to try and play with it. It's very cute.Although expensive, the Neato Botvac 80 is better in nearly everyway to the Roomba's. It's a wonderful cleaning tool and it makes your regular vacuuming sessions a snap. Just remember the small dustbin and slow length of time it takes to clean means this is an accessory or supplement to cleaning rather than your primary means of getting pet hair, gunk and dust off your floors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9K7H7ZIJHS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J08ITFG#wasThisHelpful","RF9K7H7ZIJHS4","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ill be honest here - I dont have a lot of dark spots or freckles to speak of on my face.  Outside of a few sunburns when I was very, very young and dependent upon someone else to keep me sunsafe, Ive tried to stay out of the sun and use sunscreen when that wasnt possible.With that said, I didnt think this product would make much of a difference in the way my skin looked.  I was wrong.First of all, its a fantastic moisturizer.  Most stuff just sits on my very oily skin and doesnt want to absorb - not so this. My skin drinks it right up.  It feels very light on with no greasiness at all.  It lends an almost matte look to my skin that lasts a couple of hours - and with my super oily skin, thats saying something.  Also, it smells great.Second, while I dont have a lot of discoloration to fade, I did notice that it made my skin almost glow.  I dont know if this is a lasting effect or something in the product that deflects light (normally these products use mica, but since mica tends to really irritate my skin, I dont think thats the case here).  The Amazon listing says that it will Reveal your most pearlescent beautiful skin, and thats the effect Im seeing.  The product doesnt add any color at all (trust me, Id be able to tell) but my skin has a lovely pearly sheen afterward.The only downside is that it doesnt contain any sunscreen.  Im fairly certain that a sunscreen would make it heavy and greasy feeling, though.  So Ive been using it at night and could see myself using it as a day cream under a foundation with at least SPF 15.For the price ($23.94 with Amazon Prime) I will certainly use it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA1TSEA9GZN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I073WLE#wasThisHelpful","R3OA1TSEA9GZN5","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been an Olay user since my teens.  Ive tried other products, but I always come back to Olay because I can trust my skin to their products and theyre reasonably priced.  Sure, Ive liked some products better than others, but Ive never had an Olay product damage or irritate my skin.  I cant say that about other brands.Id heard that gel moisturizers are better for oily skin, and skin is scarily oily!  So I was really excited to try this gel from Olays new Fresh Effects line.  I certainly wasnt disappointed!Most moisturizers leave my skin looking shiny (yes, even my beloved Total Effects 7).  Its rare that I come across a product that doesnt.  Dew Over is one of the few!  My skin feels refreshed after application - like its had a cool drink of water - but it looks soft and velvety matte.  It has a light, airy texture that goes on smooth and feels wonderful on the skin.  Whats more, I dont notice a thick sheen of oil hours later.I love the scent of the product, as well.  It smells so fresh and clean.The product does not contain a sunscreen. As nice as it would be to have that in there, it would probably change the texture and feel of the product way too much.  The products in the Fresh Effects line are made to be layered, so I do know that there is a sunscreen designed to be used with it.The Fresh Effects line is marketed toward younger women - those in their late teens and early to mid-twenties.  Im a bit outside that range, but I love what Ive seen from the line so far.

"I started using Olay Total Effects 7 as soon as it came out.  I loved that I could use one product for basically everything - in my twenties, I didnt need a separate night or eye cream as long as I used this.  It was available in several varieties, and Ive tried most of them.  That it was available with SPF (15) or without was a plus, because sometimes the foundation I used didnt have any. It was lightweight, never greasy, didnt irritate my skin or cause breakouts, and it smelled great. Ive tried many other products over the years but I always came back to Olay Total Effects 7.My lifestyle has changed significantly over the years, though.  Im a lot more apt to do outdoorsy things than I was in my twenties.  So I was really excited to see Total Effects 7 with SPF 30. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with the results.The texture is radically different.  This new Total Effects is a lot heavier than any of the other versions.  Its noticeable from the first pump.  It feels completely different going on.  It felt more like a thick, drug store brand sunscreen than it did a moisturizer.  Fifteen minutes after application, my skin was really shiny and greasy, as if the product didnt absorb.  I have really oily skin to begin with, so this was a huge turn off.  I also noticed some tiny bumps on my skin after a couple of days of use.I still love Olay products, and Ive learned by now (I hope) to stick with them.

"Although this is a very fictitious version of ""The War of the Roses,"" the acting, costuming and cinematography on The White Queen was fantastic. I can't say I enjoyed this as much as The Tudors or The Borgias and other docu-drama series, but as a mini-series this was entertaining for what it was. I'm not sure why this is being sold as ""The White Queen: Season 1"" when the packaging states it was a mini-series and I can't imagine what they'd do for a second season, but just know if you HAVEN'T watched this - The White Queen is not getting a second season. It was designed as a ten episode mini-series for the Starz network and that's exactly what you are getting here.The first three episodes were pretty good and we watched them in a row. The pacing was fast and the storytelling was tight but as the series went on, things really began to drag. it was as if the scriptwriters realized they were going way to fast through ""The Cousin's War"" novels and had to slow things down and drag things out to meet the ten episode commitment. As such, the pacing dramatically changed and we started to get bored with the series towards the end. We found the series to be worth watching, but it's not something we'd watch again or recommend for owning.

"Our place is big and Wi-Fi seems to have problems getting through the house so we have more than one extender. Our best one is the TP-LINK TL-WA850RE 300Mbps Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender, Repeater, Wall Plug design, One-button Setup, Smart Signal Indicator as it extends and strengthens the signal enough that I can have my gaming desktop on the other side of the house from the modem and it performs almost as well as if it were plugged directly into it. That's why we were more than happy to go with another TP-Link product as we have great experiences with it.The little one is cute and compact and has less of a chance of hitting anything, but the range on it is very small compared to other extenders. Even in a hotel room, which this particular pocket router was designed for is too weak and slow to work as an extender. If however, you take an Ethernet cord and plug it directly into the Pocket Router and your laptop/desktop/whatever, it works decently as it's merely picking up the Wi-Fi signal and using it directly with the device trying to get online. it still drops on occasion and I've had to reboot it more than once. Compare that to our other TP-Link extender which I can move freely throughout the house and it doesn't require a reboot or any internal reconfiguration.As a travel router though, this is decent. I took it to my parents who have no concept of wireless internet and used this to get online without having to be a few feet from the cable modem. I should also point out this works with both DSL and Cable, which is nice to see. So as an access point or as a wireless modem, this Pocket Router does its job nicely (it still glitches up and drops things though), but it's better than other options I've seen on the market.All in all, a thumbs in the middle. What my family really need this for (as an extender), it didn't work very well at all. As something to give me wireless internet in a non-wireless location, it works decently. However, it's rare that type of situation really occurs these days, so its usefulness is limited and growing moreso.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Z479CB0O7WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRMAOIO#wasThisHelpful","R34Z479CB0O7WS","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need a litter that clumps really tightly, and the first Arm & Hammer I tried just didnt fit the bill.  I wasnt expecting much from their new offering, but I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised.This litter has a very fine texture, more like sand than most of the clay or clumping formulas Im used to seeing.  My cats really seem to prefer it, going to the litter box filled with the Arm & Hammer more often than the others (which still contain their usual Tidy Cat).  So I guess you could say they dig it?It clumps really well.  I havent noticed any clumps breaking up (yet) when I try to scoop them out.  Thats been a big problem for me recently, and Im not sure if the quality of the clumping litters has gone down (due to formula changes) or if its my elder cats medication.  I do know its a huge, smelly pain when it happens!It doesnt track more or less than any other brand Ive tried.  It is really dusty, and it has an odd smell that I cant describe.  But not so much on either count that I wouldnt buy it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQ7LIY304DPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MDLUE#wasThisHelpful","RXQ7LIY304DPX","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, you should note that the Secret Creepers Crypt isn't really compatible with the core Monster Hall products, which are the dolls. The Secret Creepers are a toy line for recording and passing messages. Cute ideas in the 80s and 90s, but in this date and age of cell phones and text messaging, the toyline comes off a little dated or retro, depending on how you view it. The animals, which make up the Secret Creepers line are much large than the versions that come with the dolls. The scale is completely off and so mixing the core doll line with the Secret Creepers line just looks weird and noticeably off.I bring this up because it's important to note that the Crypt playset is only for use with the Secret Creepers. The previous animals will either not fit or just look really out place with this set. That means to really get any use out of the Crypt, you're going to have to invest heavily in the Secret Creepers line and like myself. This is neither bad, nor good - simply a fact that means you'll ant two or three other Secret Creeper figures besides the one that comes in this set. Otherwise it will look pretty barren. Even the packaging it comes in has three extra SC cutouts in paper form to keep it from looking empty.The set itself is well made. it's sturdy and very colourful, which should make kids happy. It also comes with a Crescent the kitten figure. Unlike other Secret Creepers which store and share short messages, Crescent is a motion activated toy, which is meant to guard the other figures. So if someone broke into your room to read your other SC figures' messages, Crescent would go off and scare them away or alert you. Unfortunately the toy is neither very scary or loud. It's a cute kitten figure, but it also lacks any joints. It a solid piece of plastic meaning it will only ever hold the one pose.All in all, the Secret Creepers Crypt is a bust if you're a Monster High fan. it's not compatible with the majority of MH figures and the SC line is a bit lame, definitely out of date and overpriced for what you get. That said, if you ARE a fan of the Secret Creepers line (We won't judge you), then you might as well splurge on this playset as Crescent is the best looking of the figures and this gives you a way to display them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TFRFNFXOK39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBW8ZIQ#wasThisHelpful","R31TFRFNFXOK39","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My stomach really doesn't like regular vitamins, so for the past few years I've been using gummy vitamins, which taste better and go down easier. The Sundown Naturals versions are a lot smaller than other brands like vitafusion and other brands. These are low in sugar (2 grams per serving) but still taste good to your tongue. You get your full RDA on things like vitamins C, D and B-12, but only 50% of Vitamins A, Niacin, B-6 and Panthothenic Acid. Most gummy vitamins give you higher RDA percentages than these, which also takes into account why they are so much larger than this particular type.Twenty dollars for a three-pack of 50 gummies each (which is what Amazon.com is currently selling these for at the time of my review) is a big high-priced. The kind I usually get are ten dollars for a pack of 90, so I could actually by two packs of my regular kind and get more gummies and for less than the Sundown Natural three pack. As such, I'll probably stick my usual gummy vitamins, but this was an okay for a change.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19J7YZG2TQE7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKN6KD0#wasThisHelpful","R19J7YZG2TQE7U","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really nervous when this case came out of the box with only a ""Quick Reference"" card rather than an instruction booklet.  However, setting it up was extremely easy.  I had no problems getting the device to pair with my Fire HD the first time.  I let it charge for about an hour before I tried to use it the first time.  After that, I charged it overnight.The case itself is plastic.  It doesn't look much like most of the leather and leather-like folio cases currently on the market.  That isn't a bad thing, really.  Those are just what I'm used to.  The Fire is held in place by a piece of molded plastic - that seems to be the new norm for a lot of the new Fire HD accessories. It has a flap with internal magnets that holds the case closed and functions as a stand when the case is in landscape mode.I challenged myself to write this entire review on my Fire using this keyboard and I did it!  Here's what I learned.First, the cons: I have had problems connecting once or twice.  It is a pain in the ass to have to turn Bluetooth off and on again, but doing that resolved it fairly quickly. I have no idea what the battery life is like.  You cant tell how much juice it has left.  At least once it completely refused to work, but I can't be sure if it was a dead battery or if I needed to reset the Bluetooth. The apostrophe doesn't have its own key and is in a stupid location.  For anyone trained to touch type, this is a huge problem. Because the screen is in contact with the keyboard when the Fire is in the case and it is closed, and because it is impossible to hold the Fire in one hand to read while in the case, I cant see this becoming a full-time storage case for my Fire. I'm a little concerned that the constant removing and replacing the Fire in the case is going to damage the plastic thing it sits in.  Or worse, that the plastic thing will eventually damage my Fire. It isn't easy to set up, really.  I've fumbled it more than once trying to get t to stand in landscape mode. It could cause a person to drop their Fire and damage it.There are pros too!  Just not as many, maybe: It takes some getting used to, but it isn't extremely hard to learn to type on. The main problem I have is the apostrophe, as mentioned in the cons. It is pretty.  Not a requirement for a keyboard case, but I felt it worth mentioning. I really like the soft, flocked lining in the interior.  It would be just perfect for protecting the Fire screen...if it touched it at all (it doesn't ). It isn't heavy.  I've been carrying it around in my bag for days and have barely noticed the extra weight.  Of course, it would be even lighter if I didn't have to continue to carry my Fire around in a separate case, but whatever.I will also address a couple of concerns I've seen noted on a couple of other keyboard cases:  The magnets are inside the front flap of the case and cannot fall off, and the case did not have a weird odor.This keyboard case is currently selling on Amazon for about $80.  I honestly don't think its worth that much and wouldn't be included to pay it.  Amazon sells several other keyboard cases that offer more protection and have keyboards that are much better laid out.  The cons just outweigh the pros, as far as I'm concerned.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1457UNRSO84KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPM1FZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1457UNRSO84KA","A3U0S17XYK8XMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0S17XYK8XMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The last 9 have been more basic hats for my children's neighborhood friends for the holidays and my own co-workers. I am uploading a picture of the basic hats, including the one still on the needles half finished (the angry bird hat has already been wrapped for Christmas Eve).

At the time of this review I noticed another reviewer said the shoes were not leather as described. The shoes we received are exactly the brand and material described in the listing at this time, Steve Madden Black Leather. My husband was very happy with thrm, saying they were much more comfortable then most. This is a serious compliment as my husband has used a LOT of dress shoes. He is hard on shoes, being a very hands on upper manager in a grocery store. He is constantly on the floor moving and is extremely involved with his departments from helping with truck unloading to display designing to cooking for 12-20hrs a day depending on the situation and season. He goes through shoes (and shirts and pants) every month or two because he must wear dress clothes.

"Both my boys have a genetic growth disorder so their sizes are a year or two behind their age-wise sizing. I bought a size 7 for my sz5/6 seven year old based on reviews(had to search for Urban Republic to find enough reviews to make an informed choice) that said this jacket runs small. I agree that the size 7 jacket fits small. I bought a size 4 for my sz2/3 four year old and don't feel the size 4 runs as small as the size 7. The size 4 is noticably too big on my youngest where the size 7 fits more or less the same as a size 6 might with just the arms maybe being a smidge farther down the wrist to the palm... or not.The outer material of the jackets feels like most boys sports winter coats. One review on another listing said they are not water resistant despite the fabric feeling like it might be. So I was just going to buy a can of water proofing spraythat is used to make hiking/camping gear water resistant. The inner liner is very soft and the coat feels like it will be nice and warm this winter. We are in Missouri so our winters tend to be milder then those farther north, 20-40s mostly and I think these coats will serve the boys well for our temperatures.I have no complaints about the quality for the cost. I paid $14 for each coat and think they are worth the cost. The stitching may not be perfect (as mentioned by another poster) but it isn't like it's squiggly lines instead of straight lines or something. In fact, we've been looking at similar coats in Kohls,  Macy's and JcPenney's for $20-30+ (on sale, original supposedly $50-$100+). In all cases the stitching is similarly not perfect. It's what comes from doing things more and more based on machine and quantity production versus by hand and quality. I found no major or noticable to the casual eye flaws in the stitching or otherwise on either jacket.Because of some of the aforementioned (not being water resistant, being made for milder colder temps, being 100% polyester and being made in china) as of this review I would probably put a price point of about $15 on this. The $14 we paid I feel was worth the product but not necessarily a 'deal'.  Personally I have no complaints with the coats/jackets we received.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UZQHOACQ5UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSNOJ2Q#wasThisHelpful","R5UZQHOACQ5UY","A1Q3MDPIS017JE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q3MDPIS017JE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought several Bright Ideas Press curriculum books from a homeschool co-op. This is our first year using Bright Ideas Press materials and I've been very happy with them up to this book. I have already and will continue to give positive reviews for other Bright Ideas Press and Christian Kids Explore books and materials. We are Catholic so creation and evolution are not mutually exclusive for us. I was hoping for a Christian worldview book that presented a biblical view of creation to start our walk through general science. I wanted to start my kids from the christian creationist viewpoint, them move forward with God as the creationist in mind as we continued in science. There are scientific facts that back evolution to a point, but gaping holes that God easily fills. I was looking for a book that taught creationism, not a book that was set up to disprove evolution.If it was just some notes here or there, or even a specific lesson devoted to other theories I'd be ok with that, but this book feels like it is not teaching creationism except as a way to disprove evolution, and that is not how the book was represented. Some lessons are salvageable mostly as long as I bluntly ignore the continual assault on evolution (which is seriously in almost every lesson) and completely drop the last two units(out of a total of six units that are suppose to stretch over a year of teaching) which make no pretense at teaching creationism and focus wholly on discounting evolution.I feel more then half this book (and arguably all of it) could be billed as a book teaching 'why evolution is wrong'. If you are looking to teach why evolution is wrong, this would be a very good curriculum. If you are like me and want to teach creation science, this book may not be a good fit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235PSJPGWVN28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1892427230#wasThisHelpful","R235PSJPGWVN28","A1Q3MDPIS017JE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q3MDPIS017JE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We ordered this book along with several other Bright Ideas Press curriculum books through a co-op. This is our first year using Bright Ideas Press materials and so far I'm happy with the quality and set up of the books. I really like the set up a lot. This book gives you a supply list at the start of a unit and 'equipment needed' at the start of activities. I've had curriculum books in the pas which didn't and it makes lesson prep much harder. Glad to have that here!The previous reviewer talked about the additional reference books- I like the 'additional reference books' broken down by lesson in back. I looked through our library's online search and we have a lot of the additional books. However, as they aren't part of any of the lessons, just suggestions at the back of the book for additional research- I'm not concerned about what isn't available. Where we want to do additional research we normally look up our own resources online or in the library anyways.I also really appreciate the companion cd included in this book, it is more or less the book in cd format and is realy nice to have right there on the computer.I'm very happy with this book and think it was a good fit for our homeschool family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJ32O79BUXLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1892427222#wasThisHelpful","R3TJ32O79BUXLB","A1Q3MDPIS017JE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q3MDPIS017JE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this 5 piece set in size 6 for our 7 year old who's just moved into a size 6. The fit was good. Like most suits the pants legs were long, so I just hemmed them up leaving enough slack to take the hem out when he grows to increase the life span of the suit. The tie is an American Express tie which I've bought a cheap dress shirt off amazon that was the same brand and the quality makes me suspect it's something from overseas and not necessarily a name brand. The dress shirt sent with this suit did not have a tag of any sort on it. Not even to tell what it was made of- which is really suspicious to me. The fit of the suit was good and it looks nice.So I'm not complaining about much for less then $20 for a 5 piece suit.

So I was very happy to find out these do fit him like they claim they will =) The quality is maybe not the best (things not completely centered, stitching on the pads a little sloppy) but the feel solid enough and nothing seems wobbly to make me worry about his safety. They are really cute and with an added helmet I have no qualms about him playing with these.

"I have bought several Wilton silicon baking molds. I've used a round cake mold I bought years ago to make my family's birthday cakes. We moved last fall a few weeks after my husband's birthday and I didn't realize the round cake mold was missing until I went looking for it for my boy's birthdays coming up in June and July. So I went looking for a replacement. I ran into this and was instantly sold. The price, at the time I bought it, was about half of what I was expecting to find my replacement for and was a much cuter shape. Perfect for birthday parties! To my children's delight I did a trial run of a one layer cake the day I got it, because I was a little concerned about if the pan edges leaned outwards (something that wasn't an issue with my previous pan). They do a little, but after seeing the finished product I am confident I can easily make a two layer cake with this pan. I am really happy with the size and silicon material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26H8ZX2NC7ZTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYZHVZ8#wasThisHelpful","R26H8ZX2NC7ZTQ","A1Q3MDPIS017JE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q3MDPIS017JE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought our set from Amazon Wharehouse as an open box deal for $20. We recently moved and between what was broken, lost or down right forgotten we found ourselves needing a lot of these items. We are regular dollar store buyers, so the quality here was pretty normal for us. I would not expect this quality for the list price, which is currently more then 3 times what we paid. For the price we paid I am very happy with what we got. I would have preferred to get a apply core and slicer rather then the bagel holder (which actually came broken in the package). But I can afford to spend the extra $1 at Dollar Tree having saved several more with this package. We already have an electric can opener, so the manual one in this box will go in a drawer for in case that breaks at an inoppertune moment some day. It looks like the ones you can find in the dollar store and they are really only good for that one time save- they will break very quickly with any real use. The 51 piece is of course a tiny bit misleading. As expected it includes each separate measuring cup/spoon in the two measuring sets; as well as, each salt and pepper shaker.When breaking down the value of this (to decide whether it was worth it to us) I figured it out as if we actually went to the dollar store and bought the items each separately. There are 42 items here (when taking into account the salt & pepper set and 2 5pc measuring sets). So with my price of $20 that breaks the items down to less then 50 each. For dollar store quality we got half off. I certainly understand the reviews at the listed price being so negative. I am happy with what we got for the price. We only needed around half the items, which means we spent what we would have spent anyways for practically the same things at Dollar Tree but got lots of back up items for the same price spent (which, because of the quality we would be needing eventually).Something of note on the measuring cups is that the rings are useless. They don't connect and don't pretend to try. However, the measuring units are raised units. That means no print to rub off in washes (something we have dealt with befor). I'd rather have raised measuring units then working rings any day ;-)Overall I'm happy with my purchase. For the greatly reduced price we paid I feel we got a good deal and the quality is as expected. I would not suggest this product as a viable option for any price over, maybe, $35 at the most. I feel, for the quality, the price point worth of this boxed set is probably $25-$35, with the $20 we paid being an exceptional value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQQA3DH2I6OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XHOPPG#wasThisHelpful","R2VQQA3DH2I6OT","A1Q3MDPIS017JE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q3MDPIS017JE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have no complaints on the quality for the $10 or less price for 3. We just purchased the size up from what we expected to need and everything has been gold. We found this out befor purchase because our first purchase was of another set of these 3pk shirts and I was specifically hoping to find some spiderman shirts that were sized small for my 4 year old who has a growth disorder. We had scoured the stores in our town and found nothing spiderman in his size (he is the average size of a 22/23 month old, his body does not create growth hormone and we have to wait another year to supplement with shorts because of an growth on his pituitary we need to make sure isn't cancer). I read through the reviews on spiderman shirts on here and found that these packs were the cheapest option that sounded like it would fit correctly.

"I bought exactly the item pictured here at Big Lots. I'm unsure why this says satin in the discription. It's certainly not satin, just a cheap polyester feeling fabric. The manufacter packaging doesn't actually tell what kind of fabric is used, but I'm confident in saying it's not satin, lol. As I'm sure if it was that would definitely be a selling point and on the packaging. The original manufacturer price on the box is $20, I spent $6 on clearance. These are adorable at a glance but not on closer inspection. I had to look through the choices very carefully to find one that had no obvious flaws (really sloppy paint, glue all over, missing pieces). Even though I'm very happy for the price I spent I still recognize that I will need to strengthen this with needle and thread and better placed hot glue (after I manually remove the glue strings left on the product). I think the quality price point on this as far as what they are reasonably worth is $10-15. I felt I got a good deal at my price, but would have felt cheated very far into the teens or above.

"This belt advertises at 32 inches on the up side, which it technically does. However, because the hole that allows that 32 inches is so near the end of the belt tip, the look at 32inch isn't really appealing because the belt tip isn't long enough to slip under the loop unless the third or a latter hole is used. I do like the quality and look otherwise. I have lost almost 25lbs of baby weight and was wanting to use this to help cinch in the waists of some of my dresses to make them last a little closer to my goal befor I needed to spring for a new wardrobe. I'm not comfortable with the look of this on the 1st or 2nd hole, so I won't be able to use it for the intended purpose.

"We bought this at Walmart on sale for $5, normally $9.88 per the tag on the bottom and the sign at Walmart. I was walking around with my boys waiting for my husband to finish his eye appointment at an office across the street and saw these on sale, couldn't resist. My angry birds fanatic of a son had his choice between the black bird, red bird, blue bird, this king pig, another pig and one other I can't remember. They didn't have his favorite, yellow bird, so the novelty of a piggy bank that is king pig won out. Ceramic banks do break easily, as another reviewer discovered. I am a little concerned about that and have cautioned over and over that my son needs to only put money in this- not pick it up or play with it (we have hard wood floors everywhere but the tile in the kitchen and bathrooms and the carpet in the front room, so when he counts money it will be in the front room). The breakablitiy an issue with any ceramic piggy bank (the stereotype of dropping the bank or taking a hammer to it to get the money out isn't just a funny adage, it's real).

"I do not know what the Rock N Learn videos do differently, but where so many videos confuse him and we have to really go over them to use them as learning tools, Rock N Learn is pure gold for my oldest son. On top of the autism and non verbal my son also has a growth disorder and some other medical conditions. For these reasons we decided that homeschool was the best option for him for now.

He played the video 3 times in a row until I made him stop to eat befor going outside and play. As soon as he came back in he wanted to watch it again.

"I bought this on clearance at Walmart for $10. If I had paid even $15 I probably would have taken this back as not meeting reasonable expectations. For $10 it get's the concept well enough. The concept is about as far as it goes though. The pegs on both models don't always line up. The directions are very poorly done in both pictures and wording. You are about as well off winging it on your own (in fact several times I doubt I would have been able to continue on directions alone if I did not have a medical background to fall back on). The plastic pieces not fitting together perfectly was especially frustrating, several times on each model as I was working on further piecing the model together I would have to go back and reconnect previous pieces. The finished model has pieces that are slightly off on the plastic because the pegs simply don't work on those pieces to hold them together. The sticky/squishy effect is neat, but is all that is holding the organs together on the body, which is not very effective. It also makes me wonder how long this product is going to function, how long befor the 'sticky' is gone. Once the sticky is gone the model will nolonger be able to to hold together. The plastic case on the body has a hole where the torso is, so the displayed model is open to air.The concept is great, the fun factor with this is through the rough and it does supply a visual, hands on model of the human body and head. The accompanying reading material for children is also well done. For those aspects I gave this 3 stars. For the poor quality of the construction of the actual pieces; as well as, the poor instructions for assembly, I took off 2 stars.If you find this on sale it's worth picking up.

"I agree with others that this is great, but not 5 stars. The 2-in-1 is 5 stars. The only reason it loses a star is that the wheels are casters and not as low as a real creeper. I can't get under my Honda Odyssey on an 8-inch ramp-lift to change oil.That's not a terrible deficiency if you have a high-clear vehicle or are going to use this as a cart (although carts have upward handles).The table is heavy duty - not light enough that you would want to deploy it for light use but this works both ways - it's stable. I am planning to take it on scout outings for extra table space. You need stability with 20 kids in a camp.I don't like the leg-brace side locks. Nothing holds them into the seats but their weight and the table or scaffold's load. I will probably drill a pin hole to improve that so it doesn't jump out somehow.The caster bolts are not high quality. They're adequate but soft metal so the Phillips head strip easily. To get pressure you need a drill or T-grip. A straight screwdriver won't seat the bolts. The nuts are pre-welded and not far off or perfect. But, I couldn't use a retchet on any and a small crescent wrench on only two because there's no clearance. You should be fine unless a welded nut is significantly off. Maybe a needle-nose vice grip would work. The tension washers provided may slip inside the caster bolt hole since it's not a great fit.Still, even though the casters are too high and the caster hardware is third rate, this is a keeper. 4 stars all day long, but could be better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HG7JFQVCCCYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTSS084#wasThisHelpful","R2HG7JFQVCCCYY","A2VBTN6ZR67YOF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBTN6ZR67YOF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very happy so far. I've recently replaced a Sonicare, and this Oral-B has exposed some plaque that my old Sonicare allowed to build up.I'm not certain of which is ""better"" because I'm comparing an ""old"" Sonicare motor to a ""new"" Braun Oral-B. I've found that the Sonicare motors wear down with time and clean less effectively. I'd assume the same is true for the Oral-B.In fact, I remember feeling plaque exposed by the Sonicare when it was new very much like the feeling I have today with the Oral-B.What I DO like about this one is the Floss replacement heads - Sonicare has nothing like them. They seem to break up the plaque noticeably while the head that comes with the brush didn't seem to do as much, although that could be because it's a gradual process and started with the original head.I don't care much for the Bluetooth app, and am disappointed that this model has a NiCad battery - I seem to recall reading one review here that implied that it was replaceable (it's not). Charging required a full 22 hours, and to maintain NiCad there is the inconvenience of the ""discharging and completely recharging"" cycle periodically. All that battery-memory and discharge mumbo-jumbo is so ""last decade"" now that all the modern tools use lithium ion batteries without the worries. This isn't covered in the manual, so I'm sure a lot of customers kill the battery much sooner than necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4FFOIAW6LWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODHOA#wasThisHelpful","RM4FFOIAW6LWB","A2VBTN6ZR67YOF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBTN6ZR67YOF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Seriously - I've been brushing with a regular toothbrush for a while after my Sonincare died and ordered these with a new Oral-B 5000.

"This worked well for our yard on the edge of the Everglades in Southeast Florida!I ""nuked"" our yard a few days before a big 4th of July party out of desperation when I realized there were 40 people coming, many from California - where would they be all afternoon and late into the night for the fireworks show if not outdoors? The Everglades is on the other side of the interstate from us and we have canals through our neighborhood - LOTS of bugs of all kinds including nasty ""teeth with wings"" that I still have scars on my legs from bites 10 years ago before I knew better, hornets that pop out of nests in the ground, and the most painful ""dirt"" mosquitos (big, black and I don't know what they're using that hurts so bad when they get you).The California people stayed outside the whole afternoon and night - we had a blast - but the Florida people stayed indoors of course. In fact, the Californians spread blankets on the lawn for the show - we just don't do that here in the South. At the end of the night NONE of the fresh-meat from California complained of any bites at all. Floridians know not to even go barefoot on grass around here in July but after spraying with this it was a bug dead-zone and there were none left to feast on those know-nothing Californians. This spray saved them from pain and itch that they had never experienced.I'm sure it reeked havoc on the environment - especially our thriving population of assorted bug-eating lizards and dragon flies that depend on pests - and I feel a little guilty about that. Some of it might have eventually found its way into the canal at the back of our yard although I was careful to stay about 20 feet back. It worked so well that I feel guilty... but not TOO guilty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFM0U3CMVND2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ITJH82#wasThisHelpful","R1FFM0U3CMVND2","A2VBTN6ZR67YOF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBTN6ZR67YOF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just cleaned up after a nasty, nasty NASTY toner leak on the first one of these I tried! Until you've had one of these leak inside your printer you have NO idea of how bad it can be.TO FIX:IF you buy one of these and find ""splotches"" on your prints, you have a major leak inside. Go change your clothes (I should have worn gloves), place damp paper towels everywhere before opening (EVERYWHERE; plastic is not a good alternative because this stuff moves around), open ever-so-carefully, and slowly slide the cartridge tray out placing more damp paper towels as you go - don't carry this over carpets, desks, etc. without some protection. Remove all of the cartridges that are not yet leaking and place them aside. Now wipe-down the inside of your tray and printer. I did not use a vacuum because I could just imagine all that toner blowing everywhere. When you are sure everything is as clean as you can get it (you will NEVER remove all the toner - it will haunt you for the rest of the life of your printer), replace everything and throw any of these pieces of garbage remaining where they belong.

"Everything about this order has been a pleasure from the delivery time and how well it was packaged through setup and use.

They are low profile and look a lot better than the big plastic one we used for our prior umbrella.That umbrella was probably in the $190 range and this one is by far a more attractive, larger and better quality.  I really feel this is a very good value.Everything works smoothly including the 360- degree foot petal rotation and the cover that comes with it.It is huge and can cover the pool steps as well as a few chairs.

Be careful with the caps- one seemed to want to cross-thred but I didn't rush and finally it gave no resistance.  My fear would be opening a slow leak, since the caps are on the side.I am also thinking about connecting the caps with something rust and rot proof so the umbrella's slight movement doesn't eventually spread these enough to let the cross stand break free. There is nothing keeping them together and they only weigh down a 1-inch strip long each side of the cross.The plastic is heavy and the top is braced so it won't eventually break open.

Maybe this is because of the smaller (narrower) tin. I also find the sardines relatively beat up inside - missing skin and often broken.

"The other reviews here are great so I'll compare the Cumberland and Togiak for you. I purchased both. Both have ""backpack"" straps for short hauls (unpadded). Both are roomy! The Cumberland seems a little like overkill - really roomy but a bit heavier. Cumberland pockets are larger but the Togiak pockets have more chambers. There are no rod holders on either, but the Cumberland has two drink holders while Tojiak has none. The Cumberland has a large storage pocket net on the seat-back while Togiak doesn't. The valves are different - Togiak deflates slower but is idiot proof while the Cumberland has better valves but keepers that may break eventually. Inflating with the Classic Accessories Hand Pump is equal.I'm 285 6' and while I can't lay back comfortably on either to sun, my bottom rides above the water on both. The Cumberland is much higher, however. Don't count on back support from either but the Cumberland probably wins by far if you are lighter than me.All this said, we aren't using these for fishing - we use them for snorkeling at the Lauderdale by the Sea reef park. We rarely get on top because they both pull easily through calm water (if it's not calm or there's much of a wind, we don't go). Neither has a diver-down flag (required here) slot but with the Togiak I can use medium size office binder clips on the side of the seat. With the Cumberland alone you'd need to let the flag float too. There are no tow-rings so you have to use the d-rings on the bottoms (not a problem). With a long bungee, rope or backpack strap you can make a side-handle for each to hang a game bag, spear and lobster snare. This will also support tanks very securely with a hookah setup and probably a pump as long as its heat doesn't melt anything. You'll have to bring extra bungees as tie-downs though... don't wait until you are on the beach!We are never in surf so can throw our gear into the front mesh bow on our way into or out of the water.

"We do not eat a lot of meat in my house so we probably do not obtain a lot of the antioxident CoQ10. Since CoQ10 is not known to cause many side effects and is thought to improve heart and lower cholesterol, we've added it to our daily diet.

There is no aftertaste or smell, and I have not experienced any side effects. These are 100mg pills, so I only need to take one per day.There are not a lot of extra fillers although the capsules do contain the addition of black pepper, which aids in absorption.

"The Transformation Ultra is a thick, creamy lotion with almost no unpleasant chemical odor that I find with some self-tanners. Instead, it had a cucumber melon scent. I found it a bit too sweet and strong, but far better than the smell of chemicals.The lotion is thick and easy to apply. However, it goes on sheer and does not provide an instant tan like some of the other XEN-TAN products, and I ended up missing a spot the first time I used it. I applied it with the XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt. It is not necessary to use the mitt, but it did a nice job keeping my hands clean and was easy to rinse out. The mitt is sold separately and lasts through multiple applications.This tanner reaches full color after about 10 hours. It takes about an hour to dry and does not rub off until it is rinsed with water. I waited the full time before rinsing it off and the result was a deep, dark color tan which lasted almost a week. It faded naturally until the last few days when it became a little splotchy.I tried again, this time only leaving the tanner on for an hour before rinsing. The color was much nicer this time and more in line with my normal skin tone. And this time it faded evenly.I've tried many tanning products over the years with varying levels of success and find that XEN-TAN makes some of the best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1684C9THNXP4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R1684C9THNXP4V","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I go through a lot of disposable gloves cleaning cages and toys at an animal shelter where I volunteer several times a week. I prefer nitrile gloves for their strength and resistance to tearing, so I was happy to try out the Ammex gloves.These are higher quality and much more durable than the standard all-purpose gloves I had been using. They are also much thicker, which makes them stronger and tear-resistant. The extra-long cuff (12 in vs the standard glove at 9 in) is perfect to keep water from  splashing inside the glove when my hands are in the wash tub.While these are a little more expensive than standard type gloves, they are  strong enough to survive more than one use. Plus, I would often go through more  than one pair of standard gloves in one day, making these more economical than  they at first appear.These gloves run true to size. I wear a medium if I want a tight, close fit. Because I'm cleaning cages and taking the gloves on and off a lot, I went with a size larger.

"After many hours, I have come to the conclusion that this camera or its software is not compatible with my tri-band router. I consistently receive the response: Connecting failed, try again.I began by installing the latest version of the app on my Samsung Galaxy 4 and scanned the QR code. The software sees my network. I enter the password and after a minute or so receive the response: Connecting failed, try again.I have tried many times and it never connects. The quickstart guide and webpage are useless. Troubleshooting instructs me to be certain DHCP is enabled; it is. Next, it says to press the reset button on the camera and try again. I did that several times. Oddly enough, after it fails to connect the software offers an option to use a wired connection. This camera does not have a port for a wired connection.Thinking of more things to try, I thought perhaps it needed an SD card installed to connect (even though according to the quick start guide it is optional). So I put in an SD card. Didn't help. Still no connection.I am using a new (several months old) TP-Link tri-band router with 2.4 and 5GHz bands. Since the specs for the camera say it works on a 2.4GHz band, I verified that it is detecting proper band; it is. I then set my phone to only use the 2.4 band and not roam to the 5GHz band. Then I rebooted the phone, the router, and reset the camera and tried again from the beginning. The app sees the network, but gives the same response: Connection failed.Not ready to give up yet - I really wanted this to work - I decided to rule out a defective camera and tested it on a family member's network. They have an AT&T 2-wire combo router/modem. The camera connected instantly. We played with it for a while and it worked fine. The picture quality was good but broke up at the highest resolution, probably because of the low bandwidth connection. The sound was also good although only one direction.Unfortunately, I can find no way to make the camera work with my router in my home. However, if you have a router that the software likes, it may be a good, inexpensive option. On the down side, there is no way to know unless you buy the camera and try it out since there is little to no support.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TESR7TZ4UAGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167KVZTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TESR7TZ4UAGW","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very gentle makeup remover that did a nice job melting off mascara without a lot of rubbing. I have sensitive eyes that get irritated very easily so the less scrubbing I have to do, the better they feel.

"We do not eat a lot of meat in my house so we probably do not obtain a lot of the antioxidant CoQ10. Since CoQ10 is not known to cause many side effects and is thought to improve heart and lower cholesterol, we've added it to our daily diet. Since antioxidants are a supplement that works long-term, I didn't expect to see any immediate positive effects.The pills are about 5/8-inch medium-sized, easy to swallow softgels. There is no aftertaste or smell, and I have not experienced any side effects. These are 100mg pills, so I only need to take one per day.There are not a lot of extra fillers although the capsules do contain the addition of black pepper, which aids in absorption. This bottle of aCoQ10 is ubiquinone which is less expensive than ubiquinal but not as easily absorbed without a boost, ie the BioPerine (black pepper). That doesn't affect the quality and is more cost effective for those who can use this formula.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEDASKSNQUFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JWKWU2#wasThisHelpful","RKEDASKSNQUFC","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crow Made a Friend is a picture book designed for very early readers. Pages are brightly illustrated in watercolor with short, simple sentences that young children can easily follow. Crow himself is an iridescent rainbow of colors rather than the usual solid black, giving him a cheerful, inviting look. Drawings of trees, leaves, a nest, and birds are easy for young children to relate to and are words they can associate and remember. A downloadable activity sheet with cutouts is available so children can make their own crow friend, adding some fun to the reading experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDE2QMHT909C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0823432971#wasThisHelpful","RDE2QMHT909C5","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I go through a lot of disposable gloves cleaning cages and toys at an animal shelter where I volunteer several times a week. I prefer nitrile gloves for their strength and resistance to tearing, so I was happy to try out the Ammex gloves.These are very nice all-purpose gloves and do a great job protecting my hands. They are strong and tear-resistant. I can often use them more than one time, a definite plus. They have a very light texture which is good for gripping objects when my hands are wet.I wear a medium if I want a tight, close fit. Because I'm cleaning cages and taking the gloves on and off a lot, I went with a size larger and was happy that I did.

"In the spring I tried to fill in some patchy areas in the lawn in my backyard with a sun and shade mix. I have no idea what kind of grass is back there - I think a little bit of everything. Problem is, I now have lots of different patches that don't match!To solve the patchy problem, I had yard aerated a few weeks ago. Then I overseed with the Kentucky Bluegrass. It's a little late in the year and a bit chilly at night so the seed is took a little longer than usual to sprout, but I prefer the slow, cooler germination rather than summer when the lawn dries out and the grass dies.One other thing to note: It is helpful to do a seed germination test if one is concerned that the seeds are not sprouting. Mine are slow because of the cold, but I tested them anyway by placing a layer of seed on a moist paper towel and putting it in a baggie in a warm sunny window. Seeds sprouted within a few days. The window provided ideal conditions but it demonstrates the seeds are healthy.I have the 7-pound bag which is more than enough for my yard . Be aware that the seed comprises approximately half the total weight with the remainder being the water smart coating. Nice to have as I don't have to worry about watering every day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPFQ1TXMLYV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSE9EG4#wasThisHelpful","R3SPFQ1TXMLYV1","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I regularly take fish oil capsules for slightly elevated cholesterol and for relief of joint pain. It works well and helps relieve both of these conditions.I've tried many brands, and while they all work, they do not all contain the same amounts of Omega-3 or the amounts of EPA and DPA in the Omega-3. I want those two fatty acids to make up the bulk of my fish oil. (EPA has anti-inflammatory effects, DHA is for brain health.) Lower amounts means I have to take more capsules. The packaging states these pills provide 880mg EPA and 660mg DHA; however, a serving size is 2 capsules, meaning each capsule only contains 440 EPA and 330 DHA.The capsules are large, similar to most other brands of fish oil. They are ok to swallow as long as I take them one at a time. They are supposed to have a lemon flavor to prevent fish burps, but I do not taste any lemon nor is there a lemon scent. Unfortunately, the only sure way I can prevent fish burps is to take the capsules with a meal. I tried taking these without food and yes, fish burps; with food, no problem, no aftertaste.Zenwise Fish Oil is made in an FDA registered facility, GMP certified, and made in the USA.

"This coffee table style book is a gorgeous volume filled with beautiful full-color photography and text. While primarily aimed at those with an interest in nature and science, this is also a resource that can be enjoyed by anyone, from nature expert to novice.The book begins with a general introduction to butterflies as a species, with further chapters going into more detail on individual butterfly families and their life cycles. Covered are topics such as life history; wing shape, color, and patterns; what butterflies eat; butterfly environments; and effects of climate change to name a few.The text is informative and interesting, but what really shines are the accompanying photos on each page. The text is white on black glossy paper, enhancing the presentation of the photos. This is as much a photography book as a text on butterflies.I am familiar with only the common butterflies such as Swallowtails, Monarchs, and Skippers, and found the wealth of detail presented fascinating.

"Previously we've owned gas powered chainsaws. My husband has never been happy with the lack of power from an electric model. Now that we no longer have large trees, I was looking for something easier to handle for use on small trees and large shrubs. As the gardener (and female) in the family, I wanted something that we could both use and that was easy to maintain.The Black & Decker 16-inch electric chainsaw is compact but still powerful. It's a little heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced, and it's still light enough for me to handle. I prefer the electric because there is no gas to mix and no cord to pull to start it. Plus, on this model the chain tensioning is automatic so I don't have to learn to do that.Like most things we buy today, the saw needed to be assembled. Happily it only took a few minutes and no tools were needed. Just mount the bar and chain, and add oil (oil is not included in the box). There are a few plastic parts but they feel sturdy enough. Time will tell. A chain bar cover is included - I like that as my garage is a bit crowded and I won't have to worry about anything getting snagged on the chain.How well does it cut? Very well, and much better than we were expecting. It's a little slower than our old gas chainsaw, but still easily cut through six inch logs and smaller branches. It's perfect for our needs. For the average homeowner with a few small trees and shrubs, this model would be a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5P4L2DEZ5HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ3FBOY#wasThisHelpful","RI5P4L2DEZ5HQ","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These reusable pods work well with my Keurig 2.0 K250 Brewer. This is a larger size pod than the single-cup version and only fits the machines that work with a carafe. When the carafe is not attached, he pod opens up the extended menu with additional brewing choices: carafe 2-5 cups, travel mug 12 or 14oz, single 8oz cup, and froth.These pods are well-constructed and solid, made of heavy plastic and have a sturdy mesh filter. Using a mesh rather than paper filter does allow some oil and sludge to pass through, but I don't usually mind this unless I'm brewing a very bold blend. Then I will add my own paper filter. It will remove most of the sludge and also makes cleaning easier. I cut down the cheap filters for regular brewers to make them fit.The pods are easy to clean. After emptying the grounds and rinsing, I wash them on the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out sparkling clean.I've been using these pods for a month now and they work almost flawlessly. The only issue I've had is an occasional ""oops error"", Keurig's way of telling you this is the wrong pod. I just reinsert the pod or wiggle it around a little and the error disappears and the pod works fine.The convenience of using my own ground coffee at a much lower price, and having a pod that I can use again and again rather than creating more landfill, makes the time spent washing and refilling the pod a small inconvenience.[I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHJSY7ZQZLY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0136ZB1KI#wasThisHelpful","R3AHJSY7ZQZLY0","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used sunless tanning products on my body for years but this is the first time I've tried one on my face. My skin can be sensitive and I was worried that it might look orange or fake, but after trying the XEN-TAN Dark Lotion on my legs and obtaining excellent results, I decided to give this a try.I applied the tanner in the morning after my shower. Although I have a tanning mitt, I chose to use my fingers instead so I would have more control over the application. (Just be sure to wash right after). The lotion has a creamy feeling, a nice scent, and was easy to apply. It dried quickly and left no greasy feeling. Within a few hours I could see a subtle difference in color.I was being very cautious around my eyes, and once the color developed, I could see where I missed a few spots. Other than that, the tan was even, and lasted a few days before fading. I have fair skin and am looking for a little added glow, not building a dark tan, so every few days works well for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYTE558RNMGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOL1D9I#wasThisHelpful","R1MYTE558RNMGI","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using the retinol cream daily for the past month along with the InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum  and I am pleased with the results. The effect is subtle but the overall tone of my skin has a smoother, cleaner, and tighter look to it. It is gentle, yet effective.I have sensitive, older skin and did experience a little bit of itching and slight flaking for the first week or two as the dead skin cells began to turnover faster and were replaced with younger-looking, fresh skin. When my face feels too itchy, I use the retinol every other day for a few days - usually this is because I have been in the sun. For the most part, this combination of products is gentler than the ones I had been using, but produces the same good results.Unlike other anti-aging products I have tried, InstaNaturals Retinol Moisturizer is unscented.

"This is replacing a rotary triple blade shaver for the man in the house.It took him about a week to get used to the way the Panasonic razor shaves, but once he did, he was very happy with the results. It requires several passes to get a close shave. The old rotary shaver is quicker, but it doesn't produce the smooth, clean feeling that this razor does. This is a man with sensitive skin, and any changes cause a little redness, but after the first few days, there was no more irritated skin.He doesn't like using it wet, but this is a personal preference and probably not the fault of the razor. The sideburn trimmer is excellent and gives a close, straight cut. The shaver itself is lightweight and easy to hold.He doesn't think the cleaning system is necessary, plus it takes up too much precious space on the counter in the bathroom.

"Now that I have numerous wireless devices in my home, some that run on N or AC band, it was time to replace my reliable but aging Linksys wiresless 54G. I wanted the speed and versatility of a multi-band router and greater wireless range.Setup of the new TP-Link was straightforward. Other than accidentally pressing the restart button while I was hooking up the equipment, it went flawlessly. Since I already had a router hooked up to my cable modem, I just unhooked the cables and transferred them to the TP-Link. After waiting a few minutes for the connection to complete, all the blue lights on the front went on, and I was able to configure the router through my web browser.The web interface is clean and simple to understand for even a new user. There is a quick set-up, a basic, and an advanced mode. All but power users should be happy with these choices. [On my previous router I was able to use the excellent, feature-rich DDWRT replacement software. This router does not support that option.]To make things easy, I used the same login/password and wireless security key as with my old router. I was pleased that most of my devices (phones, TV, tablet, laptops) connected to the 2.4G without needing to re-enter the password; I only had to configure the 5G bands for each of them. Something that I find handy is to put a shortcut link to the router interface on your bookmark bar making it easy to access months from now when you need to change something.The router has excellent range. I have a solid connection anywhere in the house, through walls and floors, and all the way to the back of my yard (100+ feet), even in the garden shed.Speed is fantastic and all my devices are connecting at high speeds and I'm consistently getting full internet download speeds.I am using the USB Ports for shared files on a hard drive and media streaming to my TV. Using the 5G band I get a clear, stable picture.Additional features are a guest network; parental, bandwidth, and security controls; and some basic diagnostic tools and statistic reports.Overall, I am happy with the performance of the TP-Link AC3200.

"My aging skin now has occasional breakouts, something I never had in my younger years. My dermatologist prescribed Tretinoin (Retin-A) which worked well to both stop the breakouts and made my skin younger. Currently I using over-the-counter products containing retinol to control breakouts and reduce fine lines.Proactiv+ Clarifying Night Cream contains retinol for aging plus salicylic acid for breakouts. It would be more convenient for me to use a two in one product, so I was eager to try it out, but I was a little concerned that these two ingredients might be too harsh when used together. I tested a small area on my face for two nights. I had no bad reaction so I proceeded to apply the cream to my entire face for the next week.After washing with a gentle, moisturizing cleanser, I applied a thin layer of the Proactive+ cream. It has a light texture, a pleasant scent, and absorbed quickly into my skin. After a few days I did indeed have a small amount of flaking skin, mostly around my nose. After a few more days, the flaking stopped and the overall texture and tone of my skin now has a smoother, cleaner look to it. This is similar to the effect I got when using the Tretinoin.I do like the product and for me it performs well. Depending on your skin type and what products you are accustomed to using, this could be quite drying and cause some initial peeling. I have fair, combination skin and it works well for me - however, my skin is used to these types of products. Also, I apply it only in the oily areas and some nights skip the dry skin - I let my skin be my guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF2EJBUZ8Z53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH05XLY#wasThisHelpful","R3JF2EJBUZ8Z53","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a routine flosser; my husband is not. He finds floss of any kind difficult to use and has given up despite being told it really is necessary for healthy gums. So I jumped at the chance to try the Sonicare Airflosser for him.This is a nice idea that is working ok, but not as well as I had hoped. It is simple enough to use, but the actual implementation is a bit clunky. It takes a little patience but overall he likes the unit.It has a small, compact size so he can conveniently leave it out on the vanity shelf. Unfortunately, because of the small size, it doesn't hold a lot of mouthwash and sometimes runs out of liquid before finishing, especially on the triple pulse setting. One problem he is having is the tip doesn't fit well between teeth  it's just a little too large. Also, the tip is not flexible, which makes it more difficult to maneuver.Perhaps using an airflosser is an acquired skill and takes some time to get better at. On a positive note, he is using it, which means his teeth are getting cleaner; a much better alternative than not flossing at all.

"From outward appearances, nothing about Mike Erikson stands out as unusual. Hes a regular guy teaching at a small town high school, so it seemed odd when he was recruited to investigate the mysterious happenings at a DARPA lab. But Mike has some special abilities; ones that make him uniquely suited to the task, as the scientists at the lab soon discover. His mission: find out what secrets the team is hiding and why the project is taking so long to complete.The story started out strong. It had all the elements I love about a good science fiction novel. The characters were well-developed and geeky  ie the cranky genius, the trekkie; stereotypical but fun. The plot unfolded at a quick but even pace. The scientific device  a teleportation machine  was made easy to understand and, even though fiction, was one of those devices we would all like to have. That and a time machine!About two-thirds of the way through the plot makes an abrupt switch to a horror story. Until that point, this was a resounding 5-star read. I have no objection to horror stories; Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. But this turn of events had a silly B-movie feel to it. I was disappointed, but the first half more than made up for it. And the ending left an opening for a sequel.Even those who don't normally seek out science fiction would enjoy this book  it's more action-packed thriller than scifi.Audio production:I read this in audio and print. The audio was performed by Ray Porter who did a fantastic job with the characters and the segues back and forth as the narrator. At first I thought this might be an ensemble production, it was that good. The pacing was quick and he kept the story moving. It was easy to follow and its not overly scientific. I recommend the audio to listeners of all levels for its engaging qualities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FA5KLUIM791/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W493VBU#wasThisHelpful","R3FA5KLUIM791","A1IDWUYX4QXTUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDWUYX4QXTUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often use the video feature on my phone but always handheld. I had no idea this little gadget existed until I was offered a sample to test.This is actually a set of two adapters.

I liked the one with the screw-on grip a little better because it allowed me to easily see what I was videoing through the opening in the back.

"I have been using sunless tanning products for years, and this is one of the best ones I've tried. My skin tends toward a pasty color which looks awful with skirts and no hose. Most of my experience is with tanning my legs.My experience with XEN-TAN . . .Positives:  - Good color - My legs look tan, not orange  - Easy to apply  - Thick, creamy lotion that began tanning instantly  - No awful chemical smell - In fact, very little scent at all  - No greasy feeling or residue  - Lasts a week and fades like a natural tan.Negatives:  - Pricey - At the higher end of the cost scale of those I've tried.Correct application of a sunless tanner is a little more complicated than the directions on the tube would make it appear. ""Apply to dry skin and blend in"" is a little vague and may not produce the desired results. Here's what worked for me. . .Exfoliate and shave just before applying the lotion. This is important for an even looking tan. Lightly dry skin - a little moisture remaining helps to spread the lotion evenly as it is quite thick. I used the XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mittand applied using a circular motion. It did a nice job keeping my hands clean and was easy to rinse out.

"I bought a large Mueller Fitted Wrist Brace because my left thumb suffers from tendonitis. This brace is well-made, attractive and breathes, which is important since I live in Houston. I appreciate the kinda sporty appearance, though I wish the lime green protective cloth under the Velcro straps was a bit wider and black.I've been wearing it constantly during the day, including when I drive, type or work around the house.

"I discovered wool dryer balls though a Facebook post--I'd never heard of such a thing! I chose the Smart Sheep 6-Pack XL Premium because of the thousands of positive reviews. It sounded like a good way to cut back on chemicals in my environment and save a couple of bucks in the long run.First, these little critters work perfectly. About the size and weight of fat, wool-stuffed tennis ball, you just toss these bad boys into the dryer with your clothes and rock and roll. No lint or wool fibers, no muss or fuss. I know people rave about ""fluffy"" clothes, but my clothes came out about the same as with dryer sheets, which was fine. I could tell no difference in drying time. Maybe a little more static, but I live in Houston where static is rarely an issue.Minor downsides:These balls kinda bounce around in the dryer and make a soft ""thunking"" sound. Not loud, but just a bit more noise than dryer sheets. Also, I always used the old dryer sheet to clean the lint trap, now I use my hand or a paper towel. No biggie, just a heads up. You also need a way to store these things so they don't fall on the floor or get dirty; I just leave them sitting in the dryer for next time.Anyway, five stars. The Smart Sheep 6-Pack XL Premium do what they advertise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYDPFR721NYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA9P5P0#wasThisHelpful","REYDPFR721NYA","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge after I misplaced my beloved old Brookstone dial pressure gauge. This is a real step up.Using this little critter is a joy. The brightly-illuminated dial and nozzle are clearly visible at day, night or in a dim garage. I only lose a whisper of air when pressing it onto a tire valve stem. The readout remains on the screen for 30 seconds; my old dial gauge lost the reading the instant it slipped from the valve stem.Other positives: they delivered it in two days with Amazon Prime. The price is more than reasonable. This gauge has a mufti-function readout some will appreciate (PSI, BAR, KPA, Kg/cm squared). And the jazzy red plastic casing makes it easy to find in a cluttered glove box.Negatives? Just some minor quibbles. You have to unscrew the case to access the batteries, though reviewers say it has a very long battery life. I would like a setting lock so it only displayed PSI. I wouldn't mind a heavier plastic or metal construction, though this looks pretty rugged.At the price, the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge is a solid five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKH4CTZ3543O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037V0EW8#wasThisHelpful","R2UKH4CTZ3543O","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Metro Vacuum ED500 DataVac is awesome! It is smaller and lighter than I expected--about the size and weight of a can of compressed air.  I use it to blast clean my computer, keyboard, monitor vents, and Roomba, but I also find it useful to dust fiddly, difficult-to-clean areas like my CD/DVD collections, books, behind and under furniture and bookshelves, light fixtures and refrigerator coils.I use it like an indoor leaf blower, herding all the dust bunnies into a handy corner, then dust mopping after it settles. I seriously suggest putting on a dust mask first! (O.K., so sue me; I'm not the best housekeeper.)They placed the convenient on/off switch right by the handle, which is handy because the powerful DataVac airstream produces a definite ""kick"" when you turn it on. The blowing power matches or exceeds compressed canned air, but without the danger of running out or spitting propellent onto delicate parts. For storage, I loop the generous 11-foot (not 12-foot as stated in the literature) cord and tuck it into the grip.Cons:One design flaw is that the air intake filter on the bottom is a sponge-like material that looks like it will get damaged pretty easily, and there is no easy way to replace or even clean this critter. And the DataVac is pretty loud; although in all honesty my vacuum cleaner is noisier. Finally, only one of the attachments ""click"" properly onto the nozzle's raised safety button--I had to drill holes in a couple of the other attachments to use this button. But I still call this a solid 4-1/2 star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTT01T4TDNO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J4ZOAW#wasThisHelpful","R3MTT01T4TDNO6","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first self defense tactical pen and overall I'm pretty pleased. The dimensions are about the same as a standard pen but just a bit wider with a diamond crosshatch grip. The pen itself writes smoothly with black ink and opens (a little stiffly) by twisting the front. I was a bit disappointed to find that it does NOT write upside down.It isn't as heavy as I expected, but the tough aircraft aluminum still has a nice heft and terrific grip. I haven't broken any glass with the end or stabbed anyone, but I sure as heck wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of this thing! The tight clip and rough barrel might shred a dress shirt over time unless you use care. But this is a really good deal at the price.UPDATE: I managed to break the fragile plastic ink cartridge the first time I disassembled it. Largely my fault, but the cheap plastic cartridge didn't help.

"I just received the CyberTech 4400mAh Lithium battery replacement for my Roomba 770, so I can't address its longevity. Instead I'll just say that it takes about 60 seconds to swap out the original Roomba battery with this terrific upgrade. All you do is:1. turn off your Roomba (big button on top) and flip it over2. remove two little Phillips screws and open door3. pull out the old battery with the plastic side tabs4. drop in the new lithium battery5. close it up, power it up6. re-enter the day/time information. (All the programming data disappears when you pull the battery--no biggie.)I've used my Roomba 770 almost daily for a year and the original battery was getting a bit anemic, though still useable. But this lithium replacement is far better than Roomba's original Ni-Cd battery. Not a design flaw--it's just that the pricey lithium batteries are inherently superior to Ni-Cd batteries. And the build quality of the new lithium battery is, if anything, even better than the original.I like the extra little side brush CyberTech threw in, so I swapped it out at the same time. If your Roomba is getting a bit feeble and you have a few extra bucks, this is a worthwhile upgrade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDNB4XT7552E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWHC39E#wasThisHelpful","R1LDNB4XT7552E","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eneloops are simply the best. This is my second order for 16 AA Eneloop batteries. Why so many?

"I'm an editorial photographer and recently bought Canon's 11-24 f/4L lens. First, let me state that this unique ultra wide angle lens is not for everybody. It is expensive, but a bargain considering the nature of the lens. It is heavy, but relatively compact. This is NOT a lens that casual photographers should seriously consider. Instead, let me recommend Canon's marvelous 16-35 f/4L IS for general architectural, landscape and environmental portraits.But if you want the finest rectilinear ultra wide angle lens in the world, the Canon 11-24 f/4L is hands-down your best bet. Even wide open it displays virtually no distortion, flare or vignetting and is blazing sharp right to the edges. So far my biggest surprise is just how easily it handles. Unless something is near the edge of the frame there is no way to tell that you aren't using a standard wide angle.This precision 2.6 pound/1180 gram lens is built like a tank. It makes your camera front-heavy (I'm using 5D III bodies with grips), even when hanging from the strap. Not as bad as a 70-200 f/2.8, but you notice the weight. Canon made the built-in lens hood from heavy, high impact polycarbonate. The unusual lens cap wraps around the whole front of the lens hood to protect that massive bulbous front element.Since this lens cannot take a normal or drop-in filter, Canon placed a small 3 cm X 3 cm gel filter slot on the rear. While I dislike fragile gel filters, this appears our only ND filter option. The rear of the lens also sports a rubber weather sealing ring as seen on other high-end Canon ""L"" lenses. But the huge front element moves freely inside the front of the lens barrel when zooming, so I'd avoid situations where water or sand can impact the front.I've covered a fair number of editorial assignments with this lens in a television studio, low light ""Good Friday"" shots, working in crowds, rail car welding and some architectural photography. The Canon 11-24 f/4 handled surprisingly well; I genuinely felt no difficulties working fast, handheld, in tight conditions. Images were blazing sharp right to the edges with little or no flare even when shooting wide open against studio spotlights or daylight blazing though windows or an arc welder. This groundbreaking lens earns a solid five stars.NOTE: Canon only supplies a ridiculous leather carry pouch with this lens. I bought the Tamrac MX5341 M.A.S. Pro 50 Lens Case to carry and store this lens.

"I use this with my Galaxy S5 and find it a terrific value for the money. Here are my impressions after several months:Pros:1. The Pebble has a solid vibration function that alerts you to incoming email, SMS and phone calls. I've found this quite useful in noisy or hectic environments. You can also set it to stop vibrating at night so it doesn't scare the bejabbers out of you.2. It's seriously waterproof!!! I had no idea. I bought it just for fun, but this thing can double as a dive watch.3. It quickly charges though any USB port and lasts almost a week! HUGE drawback for other smart watches. It also charges in minutes, not hours.4. Screen lights up for 1.5-2 seconds by pressing a button or shaking your wrist. It is quite legible in direct sunlight or night.5. I can control my phone's MP3 player right though the watch. I leave the phone in my pocket and control volume, skip or repeat songs, etc.6. It doesn't interfere with my car's Bluetooth phone setup.7. Lots of health tracking apps available. Not my cup of tea, but a big plus for health conscious folks.Cons:1. The e-Paper display is nowhere near as pretty as the glowing display on other smart watches. This is the tradeoff for that spectacular battery life.2. It's a bit awkward to navigate many of the apps with the stiff buttons.3.. Minimal instructions make it difficult to tell what apps are worth loading. Many (most?) of the apps are pretty marginal or difficult to read on the low-rez gray and black e-Paper screen.4.. Plastic appearance. Personally, I like my nerd watch to look nerdy, but some folks object. Option: the Pebble Steel or a fancy metal watchband.  I wish the burnt orange watch was one of the standard colors!5.

"I'm a big guy, 6-foot, 250 pounds, so I had concerns about buying a plastic toilet seat. But the Bemis 200SLOWT000 barely deforms or moves when I sit. The heavy plastic seat has a solid hinge and four supports. The hinges utilize clever catches that let you twist and remove the seat for thorough cleaning in seconds, but it is rock-solid when locked in position.Though I don't much care about it, both the seat and lid s-l-o-w-l-y close when dropped. The appearance is relatively sleek (I mean, it IS a toilet seat--shrug) because the lid sorta wraps around the seat when closed to look like a single unified piece.Installation took about five minutes total. After I removed my old toilet seat, all I did was press this new seat into position, finger-tighten the plastic nuts, then tighten the ends. Bemis has a very clever way of avoiding over-tightening and damaging the toilet--the end of the plastic nut sheers off when it is tight. The only tricky part is that you need to verify if your toilet is elongated (18-1/2"") or round (16-1/2""). I goofed the first time and got the wrong size.I'm not a Bemis fanboy, tho. The paint on my last three Bemis painted wood toilet seats wore and chipped off after a few years, looking horrible. I mean, how hard is it to paint a toilet seat so your butt doesn't destroy it--huh?But this one looks like a winner. I just bought a second Bemis 200SLOWT000 for a small bathroom.

"I replaced my laptop HD with a Crucial SSD a couple of years ago and it was a great upgrade, but when it came time to replace my desktop HD with a SSD, the specs on the 1TB Samsung 850 EVO looked just a bit better.Not only is the 1TB Samsung 850 EVO blazing fast, but my computer runs cooler, quieter and draws less power. I'm a photojournalist using Win 7 Pro, so I work with some pretty hefty visual software. Note that the SSD does NOT speed up Photoshop itself, but opening, closing and the user experience was infinitely better.

"I'm a PC guy and I used the earlier USB 2.0 version of this product to clone and replace a laptop's HD with a Crucial SSD. When it came time to replace my desktop's HD with a Samsung 850 EVO SSD, I bought this Corsair USB 3.0 cloning software. Good thing--I didn't have much luck with the Samsung cloning software, but this Corsair kit was dead easy.All you do is put in the disk (or download the software), attach the SSD to a 3.0 or 2.0 USB port with the included cord, and do a couple of clicks. One hour later, swap out the HD with the SSD and you are good to go. Everything was there and operated perfectly: Windows, hidden files, full-on Photoshop CS6, Photo Mechanic, etc. And, man--that SSD rocks!This might also be a simple solution for truly bulletproof backups.

"I bought the Grace Digital WiFi Music Player to stream internet radio though my stereo system instead of mucking around on my computer or cellphone. Setup was easy and connected through my U-verse WiFi with no problem. Display and presets are clear, bright and easy to navigate. It sounds quite nice through a real sound system, so I put my mp3s on a thumb drive and plugged it into the rear USB port (because sometimes ten thousand internet stations just aren't enough!)It helps if you have at least a nodding familiarity with internet radio. I've messed around a bit, but it is easy to get swamped by the thousands of goodies out there. Also, pay attention to the kps of the streaming music--more is better.Note that Grace has a handy free app for navigating the stations and radio from your cellphone or tablet. Some (O.K., a lot of) folks hate this app, but I like the visual information offered more than the standard remote control.The Grace music player itself has a built-in mono speaker and a big internal space for a battery if you want a standalone setup or bedside clock/radio. Personally, I kinda wish I had bought a smaller unit without the space for the battery or speaker, but after several months I'm quite happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXGGID8VTONY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YI9NTS#wasThisHelpful","RGXGGID8VTONY","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've never attempted a plumbing upgrade, let me first warn you that this is one of the most unpleasant household chores out there. I had to laugh at Pfister's ""how-to"" video with its pristine, perfectly-fitting hardware and roomy, well-lit conditions.In my case, I first had to remove my old faucet and drain. It was a study in slime, rust and corroded parts while almost standing on my head to wrestle with awkward stuck fittings. And the horror that slimed out of the P-trap could give a buzzard the dry heaves! In addition to the tools suggested by the instructions, may I suggest a single-edge razor blade, green 3M or copper scrubbing pad, flashlight, dishpan, several rag towels, aspirin and lots of patience. Suggestion to Pfister: it would be nice to include a dab of plumber's putty for the base seal.The finished project looks truly sleek and elegant, but the water flow is much slower than my previous ""el-cheapo"" aerator faucet.

"My beloved Logitech K740 keyboard finally started failing after 3-1/2 years. After soliciting advice and checking reviews, I choose the CM Storm QuickFire TK with Cherry MX Brown switches. Quite a radical change!BAD/UGLY:Not as sleek and low-profile as the Logitech K740, the tops of the QuickFire keys are pretty high--roughly 1-1/2 inches above the desktop. The overall appearance is square, rugged and looks like they made it from repurposed Soviet tank treads.The arrow keys and navigation keys are incorporated into the number keypad. This saves desk space, but sometimes makes things a bit awkward.GOOD:Bright white keys are sharp and easy to read. All keys and spaces between are illuminated. I keep the key illumination on its lowest setting to avoid dazzling my eyes while editing photos.Clicky! MAN, I've missed using a keyboard with mechanical key action! I bought the model with the Cherry MX Brown switches whose action feels ""just right."" A bit noisy compared to standard keyboards, but it's a joy to use.Reliable. This bad boy is rated for tens of millions of keystrokes! I'm sick of keyboards going bad after a year or two. The solid construction can really take a pounding.Removable USB cord. Not sure if this should be a ""pro"" or ""con"" feature. I've accidentally unplugged the keyboard a couple of times. This keyboard uses a standard USB to connect to the computer, of course, but it also uses a micro-USB that plugs into the keyboard itself for ease of storage and transport. The braided cord attaches to a slot underneath and feeds out a left or right or rear channel.I'm still getting used to this new keyboard, but it earns a solid 4-1/2 stars.

"I bought a couple of these Phillips 10.5-watt LED bulbs to replace two deck lights. The color closely resembles the standard warm white light of incandescent bulbs or warm CFL bulbs.

Even after burning for hours, it feels warm, not hot.I haven't tested the dimming ability of these bulbs, so I'll just skip that feature.

"After over 20 years of reliable use, my old Maglite AA Mini Flashlight was ruined when both AA alkaline batteries leaked, jammed and badly corroded the inside. Well, this gave me an opportunity to replace my standard black Maglite with a jazzy red model. The red color makes it a bit easier to spot in junk drawers and glove compartments. The flashlight projects a powerful, focusing beam. Removing the reflector allows it to act as an electric ""candle.""Maglites are manufactured of tough aircraft aluminum and sealed with rubber ""O"" rings making them ideal for foul weather emergencies.

"I'm a career photojournalist and bought the 16 GB Eye-Fi Mobi to use in my Canon 5D III. In theory, I would love to capture RAW files on the CF card while transmitting lower-rez jpeg images to breathless clients when working in the field. Unfortunately, Eye-Fi Mobi's flawed app and intermittent connectivity issues make it unreliable for professional work.The setup was easy and I successfully transmitted photos 30-40 feet to an Android smart phone and Android tablet in another room. Unfortunately, the app's clunky user interface on the phone/tablet only occasionally feeds and displays properly. I kept having to exit and restart the app to get the current image to display. This is a software issue and could be solved IF the Eye-Fi folks bother to tweak their free app.A more serious issue was that my camera kept losing the connection with the smart phone/tablet if I stopped shooting for a minute--even while the camera remained powered up. Then I had to shut everything down on the camera AND Android device and start them all over again from scratch.This device has tremendous potential for professionals, but right now it is just too darn unreliable. Professionals need a bulletproof, reliable connection that works full time.

"I just bought a bunch of Eneloop batteries and wanted a top-notch charger. The Titanium Smart Fast 16 Bay Charger fits the bill. Key points:1. You can charge 1, 5, 9, 16 or ANY combination of AA or AAA rechargeable batteries. This charger acts like 16 individual chargers; you DON'T have to fill individual bays.2. I'm not a fan of LCD display panels, but the cool blue LED lights do a great job illuminating these displays. And every--single--battery has its own individual readout!3. The 16 Eneloops I bought needed a bit of charging, so I filled all the bays in the charger. The batteries got fairly warm, but once they completed charging, they cooled back down as the Titanium switched to a maintenance trickle charge. I had no misgivings about leaving them charging overnight.4. You also have the option of discharging/recharging batteries simultaneously. You can put batteries you want to discharge/recharge in one bay, while doing standard recharging in the next bay.5. This charger has two USB charger outlets and a car charger plug for emergencies and road warriors.

"Okay, you've heard plenty about this excellent camera already. But if you are getting ready to pull the trigger on the 5D III, keep reading.I'm a photojournalist and missed the recent Black Friday deals and rebates (grump!) Suddenly my work changed and I simply HAD to replace my current 5D II bodies with two 5D III bodies. I saved about $600 by checking out the ""used"" deals. I bought two completely NEW, UNUSED cameras that simply had the 24-105 kit lens removed from the box. Everything else was in there, unopened, and the cameras untouched with the original warranty.I've shot hundreds of assignments with the 5D III cameras and am loving the heck out of them! Compared to the 5D II, the 5D III offers far superior focusing, better low light sensitivity and six frames per second. The ""quiet"" shooting mode works great at concerts, churches and other venues where you need to remain inconspicuous. The single drawback is that Canon crippled the SD card slot rendering SD almost useless for action photography. With that one exception, it is what the 5D II should have been.Update: after a year of professional shooting, I'm more pleased than ever with my two 5D III bodies.

"I'm a career photojournalist and bought two of the Vello BG-C9 battery grips for my Canon 5D III bodies. I'm impressed with the build quality and the exterior finish matches the camera's perfectly. The Vello fits flush against the 5D III with no annoying gap or wiggle, and you stash the camera's battery door safely inside the grip if you want to switch back.I recommend this grip to any serious photographer. Reminiscent of the old-style motor drives, this grip has a vertical shutter release button (plus other controls) that let you securely handle the 5D Mark III even with a big 70-200 f/2.8 or 300 f/2.8 attached. It also helps counterbalance the camera when using a speedlight.The Vello BG-C9 grip adds a second LP-E6 battery slot and gives you the option of shooting with six AA batteries in an emergency, guaranteeing power even on all-day assignments. The 5D MK III battery info display lets you track individual charges, health and shutter counts on both LP-E6 batteries.DOWNSIDES:This sizable grip makes the 5D III quite a bit heavier and bulkier, and I spoke to an aerial photographer who wasn't happy with the extra weight. It helps if you have big hands. Plus I wish Vello had placed a rubber gasket where the battery drawer slides into the grip. But I recently shot an assignment in the blowing rain where I got soggy as a flounder. Although one of my cameras quit twice, the battery grip wasn't a factor; the water leaked into the camera though the lens and top panel.All in all, at the price, this is a solid five star product. If I ever have an issue, I will update this review immediately.------------UPDATE. O.K., I promised to update if any problems arose. After a year of hard service, one of my Vello BG-C9 grips developed a weird problem. It still powers the camera, but the camera's LCD display does not show?!

No chip or communication problems.Though I haven't done a rigorous test, these batteries might not last quite as long as Canon's OM battery, but they are still fine for an all-day photo shoot. At the price, these Wasabi batteries earn a solid five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYO44R8GWPAVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041MY32Y#wasThisHelpful","RYO44R8GWPAVR","A28BX3MM90A6FI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28BX3MM90A6FI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The short summary is:PROS:*best picture quality of any TV ever made*deepest blacks possible*most amazing 3D I've seen (and you can use the ""passive"" glasses from a movie theater instead of battery powered ones)!*4K/UHD*plays HDR content!*thinner than some phones, and bezel-less so all you see is the amazing picture!*cool Wii-like remoteCONS:*very high defect rate (see below)*expensive*very little 4K, HDR content currently available*some gamers didn't like the input delay (I don't notice it)*400 nits of brightness is good, but is one area where future OLEDs may improveFull review:SOME EF9500s are about the most perfect picture you're ever going to see. It's literally the darkest black levels possible (no light output  at all), surpassing even the best plasmas and LED local-dimming sets. At the same time it's as bright as any LED/LCD set, so you get the best picture pop you've ever seen, even at off angles!Unfortunately, the near perfection of the set is marred by a high defect rate on the 65"" (almost all 55"" models are fine) with problems ranging from not turning on, to bad ghosting with 3D imagery, to yellow or pink banding evident in all-white scenes, to reduced brightness near the edges of the screen.If you're lucky enough to get one of the good sets, you won't be disappointed! If, on the other hand, you paid over five grand for set with problems, you might be.However, if you're willing to put up with an exchange or two and you're the type of person willing to pay a mint for the best TV ever made to date, this is your set.This is my second uber-expensive TV set I bought in the past few years (the other was a Sharp Elite), and while I had to go through one exchange to fix a problem, I'm blown away by how much better the picture quality is than even the set I paid five grand for only a few years ago!It's simply amazing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7OQ1QZYSHZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RX0UKY#wasThisHelpful","R1L7OQ1QZYSHZ3","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had cheapo Revgear gloves, cheapo Titles, a couple pair of Venums and now these, my first pair of real-leather gloves.My impression? The leather is great, construction is great, they certainly feel more breathable and supple than the polyurethane gloves I've been using (the breathability is especially nice, because I sweat like a pig).I have average-sized hands and thought the hand compartment was perfect, and the foam in the gloves is exceptional compared to what I'm used to! The gloves actually feel thinner than my 16-ounce Venums, and the foam feels like it distributes impact a little better around your hand, despite the thinness.However, the other thing I noticed (beyond the rather retro styling) is that the foam seems concentrated more towards the knuckles, and not so much near the relatively thin fingertips. For boxing, that's great, but the finger padding may actually be a little thin for Muay Thai, which has a more hands-turned-out blocking style.If, however, a nice, higher-end boxing glove is what you're after and you want something a smidgen cheaper than competitors, you won't go wrong with the Ringside Pro Styles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5VI8KINUXHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YPI6K4#wasThisHelpful","RX5VI8KINUXHJ","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jabra continues in their tradition of excellence with these headphones. I've been a big fan of their Bluetooth headsets in the past (like the Jawbone) and this is another excellent addition to their lineup!Cords are always a big hassle when running and I was delighted to try these out since you can simply recharge these, pop them in, and go about your workout without a cord flapping between you and the phone strapped to your arm or waist.The fit of the earbuds is solid, and it fortunately comes with a variety of earbud sizes to fit your personal size/tastes.The companion app is also nice, and does seem to improve audio quality with its default equalization, but the app is much less usable to me than my phone's native app, so I ditched it pretty quick.The only negative is that it's easy to forget to turn off, which results in the headphones running down their battery and intercepting audio of the YouTube videos I try to watch in bed!

"As a fan, this is probably the best, most high tech we've used.Design and ergonomics are great, air movement is powerful and, importantly to us, there's no open blade to stick things in or whack fingers on when the guard falls off (which has happened to us, with other cheap-o fans we used).It's is a lot bigger than we expected (see a picture next to our tall 7-year old), which really helps it to blow air around even large rooms.However, it is also only the diameter of a small plate, so it's ideal for tight spaces where a traditional, propeller type fans would knock into surrounding objects as it oscillates.It even comes with a remote that fits discretely into a small slot in the back of the fan, so it's ideal for spaces where you want to sit down and get things blowing from across the room.Some of the more exotic blower modes were a little weird for us (it's supposed to simulate a sporadic, natural breeze that changes in intensity randomly), so we just used the constant-blower mode. Even with that, however, it's great that the fan is so energy-efficent!All in all, this is an easy fan to recommend!

"I received one of these pillows to try out and was immediately taken aback by an extremely strong odor that I assume is fire retardant, but smelled similar to the kind of rot when you find a decaying mouse in a trap after it sat out for a month.It is SERIOUSLY bad.We tried to air the pillow out for a few days, but that helped only minimally, and we also tried to see if we could wash it, but apparently you're not supposed to. The instructions in the pillow case say you should only spot clean or machine wash the pillowcase, not the pillow.Apparently this product comes with a 5-year warranty, but when we contacted Classic Brands (whose contact information we had to search for, since it didn't appear to be included anywhere in the package), they said they were only the manufacturer and that we'd have to go through the distributor for a replacement.

"I noticed the driver's side door window's bottom moulding was tearing on my 2007 Prius, so I investigated how easy of a fix it was and how much the part was.A local dealership wanted to charge $70 for this part, but I found it on Amazon for almost half that price!A diagram of how to change the moulding can be found on PriusChat.com if you use your Google Fu, but it basically involves lifting the moulding up near the rear of the door which is a bit hard, because it's sort of attached to the door metal with a little plastic clip. I had to use a flathead screwdriver for leverage.After you get the end off, you lift the moulding out of the door frame then slide it toward the rear of the vehicle an inch or two in order to clear the slot it fits in in front.After that, you slide the new one in and attach it to the door from front to back (where the little plastic clip is).It's a fairly easy self repair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMX6I5SAHF3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWJGLQ6#wasThisHelpful","RXMX6I5SAHF3X","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This enables you to simply set the controllers on the charger, then effortlessly lift off when you're ready to play again.The design is simple, elegant and brilliant.By contrast, the Sony charger not only makes you plug directly into the USB port (which is a relative hassle), but it has parts that pop out when you try to detach the controller and it took my kids about two weeks to lose one and make 1/2 the charger worthless.I digress.THIS is the charger you want for PS4 controllers.

"EDIT: *** Intuit recently announced that they're caving and just offering every returning Deluxe customer a free upgrade, then reintroducing the old included features for next year. However, the deal isn't active as of the date of this edit. H&R Block has also offered to give you their competing software for FREE with proof of TurboTax Deluxe purchase. Google ""SwitchToBlock"" for detail. ***Many people are (understandably) upset that Intuit removed features from Deluxe for certain schedule C and D filers. I agree that was a bad move, but in Intuit's defense, they offer a $25 refund for a $30 upgrade to Premium for Deluxe buyers who used Deluxe last year if you call 800-445-1875 and explain your situation.Also, it's a better deal than people are giving it credit for, plus support is America-based and actually pretty helpful (I'll explain my experience with them below).At present, the Deluxe with Fed + State is $38, BUT you're eligible to receive a 10% bonus on every $100 you apply to an Amazon gift card (up to $10,000 of gift cards). That means that if you shop on Amazon a lot, or want to buy a TV with your refund or something, then all you have to do is use $400 of your refund on Amazon gift cards and this software pays for itself.Many are suggesting switching to H&R Block Tax Cut, but just be aware that they don't have the same deal with Amazon gift cards so there may be a financial trade-off with the decision if you're a frequent Amazon shopper. That said, H&R Block DOES have a 10% gift card bonus program for 40 vendors like Target and Best Buy, so they're still a good alternative to consider if you frequent H&R Block's participating stores.As far as TurboTax support goes, they were great to me!I accidentally bought the version of this without state (big mistake on my part because Intuit will normally charge you $40 to buy the a la carte state download). At first I was frustrated because I didn't realize what I was buying (or that they even made a version without state), but:1. They apparently have a 60-day money back guarantee where they'll send you a refund if you send them your purchase confirmation.-and-2. I thought that would be a pain because of all the bureaucracy, delay and snail-mail involved, so I called support and they were nice enough to let me buy my state for only $9, which was the price difference between what I mistakenly bought and what I meant to buy.In short, I understand many reviewers' frustration, but it seems like Intuit really is trying to take care of their customers, so I thought I'd try to give them a little love in light of all the negative reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NW95ZWJTQ8E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG7JVSQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NW95ZWJTQ8E7","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The recommended age is 3-5, but you might get away with a bit younger, and the higher end of that age range would be pushing it.One of the games, for example, gets kids to pick which of three options is a number versus a letter.

"Before my last set of wiper blades, I used to use bracketed designs, which have straight sections split by hinges at multiple points. The drawback is that when something gets bent a little out of shape or hits a bump mid-wipe, then a whole section's wiping performance is compromised.Bracketless designs, on the other hand, are like big, spring-loaded bananas, where the whole thing tries to curve in on itself. The advantage here is that you have a nice, even wipe with no bare spots.The Insight is a great, bracketless blade that I installed alongside a different, year-old blade. The performance was strong, and immediately noticeable in the Colorado snow.My old wiper (also a Bosch bracketless) has held up great, but is finally starting to decline in performance, leaving slight streaks when trying to use the windshield washer fluid to clean off dirt.I have no doubt the Insight will last just as long!Oh, and I got one of these for free to review, but I liked it so much I bought a second to replace its older cousin.Great wiper blade!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMTR801N1KY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ4LS#wasThisHelpful","RFMTR801N1KY5","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We open our Kevo deadbolt via phone, control our front porch and living room lights via WeMo on our phone, use remote apps to control A/V equipment, etc.It makes sense; phones are extremely powerful tools that are invaluable enough to keep glued to our hips at all times.Thus, when iDevices came out with the phone-enabled thermometer, we were intrigued and excited when we got a chance to try it over Christmas dinner!Fortunately, it performed fantastically!My non-technical wife got it easily up-and-running without my help simply by downloading the app and having it walk her through setup.Once that's done, you can put the dual probes in whatever you're cooking, then walk away to attend to kids, guests, or other cooking tasks while waiting for an alert from the app. It's SO easy and much more convenient than either checking on the thermometer constantly, or keeping a separate device for the purpose.Also, because it's all tied together with a smartphone app, you have bells and whistles like charting and phone based alerts!The only negative we can say about it is that we found it inconvenient to perfectly coil the probe cords (we could never quite get them to fit right), so we just ended up throwing the probes and LCD unit into a freezer bag for storage when not in use.Definitely a great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JP3IAZ7NYVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ1SQV2#wasThisHelpful","R22JP3IAZ7NYVJ","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a big enough house, but we also have a family of seven, so counter space is at a premium in our home and we love that this dish rack is designed to fold relatively flat to be easily tucked away.We found that there was ample space, tines and racks enough to hold everything from glassware to one or two larger pots. Better yet is how various components fold away individually to add to the versatility.The rack seems well constructed and easy to use (as most OXO products are).It's only slightly smaller than others we've used, but we consider it the ""right"" size for our needs and limited space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BD2X69V33HIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X6OKC#wasThisHelpful","R1BD2X69V33HIJ","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have leather car and theater seats and decided to give this set a whirl on both.Having the set was nice, because it let me try out and decide what I liked best (and if I liked it at all).Overall, I did and here's my impression:1. The air freshener: smells like leather, but more the type of leather you smell walking into a cowboy boot store rather than a ""new car"" leather kind of smell.2. The cleaner: works decently. I'm going to use it to spot clean my theater seats.3. The conditioner: a sort of lotion that smells the same way the air freshener does (like a cowboy boot store). I'll probably use it for my car seats since the smell doesn't seem to linger overly long after application and it seems to be a better conditioner than the spray stuff. About enough to cover two car seats.4. The cleaner/conditioner spray: probably my least favorite since it feels a bit liquidy to provide any sort of long-lived protection (though maybe that's just a misimpression).A great sampler kit to decide for yourself!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5ZPBAY6MRVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OB68E84#wasThisHelpful","R3M5ZPBAY6MRVQ","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this for our teenage nephew who likes horror ambiance. I am very pleased with the result!It's genuinely frightening, much more so than the half-scary Monster High-type toys you find at big chain toy stores.One thing to note is that this doll just comes in a clear plastic bag, not the coffin box like some Living Dead Dolls do.

"I love my wife, but she sheds like a dog and every time she showers, we pretty much have to use our fingernails to claw out the nasty hairball that is partway down the drain, clogging the tub.The OXO Drain Protector helps make the process less urgent and a bit less gross: the drain never clogs with this cover over it (though the lower holes can get dammed up and still let the lower tub fill up a bit) and we can let more hair accumulate before we HAVE to take care of the problem.Cleaning is easy, too. The trapped hair and lint usually lift off when you pick up the Drain Protector, so you just move it to the trash and quickly scrape it off.We love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1KL61B2IX38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMFM#wasThisHelpful","R1P1KL61B2IX38","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got a set of four of these delivered and wanted to give some unfiltered insight on the chairs (since some of the online retailers selling the seats pick-and-choose which reviews get published).Here are my initial impressions...The Good*ATTRACTIVE- Like similar models (Lane Matinee, Octane Turbo, etc.) these are seemingly based off of the old Berkline 12003 Reno (which are also beautiful seats).*LARGE- I'm 6'2, 210 lbs. and can easily rest my head against the back of the top of the chair. The back frame of the seat is 36"", the head padding extends to 42"" (not 45"" like some documentation claims) and 30"" from seat bottom to headrest top. The bottom of my butt to the tip of my head is around 37"" tall (give or take) and it feels like there is a little bit of headrest room to spare once I sink into the chair both sitting and reclining.*GROMMET AND TRAY TABLES STANDARD! - It's awesome that the tray is integrated into the chair, since you can be reclined and still eat off of it (unlike having to sit up to place a TV tray in front of the chair).*GOOD RANGE OF OPTIONS (Depending on Retailer) - Brown/black colors. Loveseat/couch options. Power/manual recline. Bonded leather (leather scraps and glue) in the entry level, but some places sell it in more durable top grain leather. Good range of grommet accessories like wine glass caddies, tablet holders, cigar host, reading light, etc.* WALL-HUGGER RECLINE - You can set the upright seat a few inches from the wall and it will recline almost to the point you're lying down without hitting the back of the wall.*USB POWER RECLINE SWITCH - Some vendors offer a lighted two-port USB charger integrated into the power recline switch, which is nice for charging a tablet/phone while sitting. On the downside, the light doesn't turn off.The Bad*LOVESEAT CONFIGURATIONS HAVE AWKWARD POWER RECLINE CONTROLS - You'd think that all power recline controls would be on the armrests, but the recline control for one seat of loveseat configurations is actually a lever on the right side of the chair.*LIGHT ENOUGH TO TIP OVER - While the version of the seat with two armrests is something like 150 lbs., other configurations (esp. the armless version of seat used in loveseat/couch configurations) are much lighter and ALL of them have a tendency to tip forward while leaving/entering the seat if you leave the footrest extended. This could be mitigated if the chairs were connected, but...*THE CHAIRS DON'T ATTACH TO EACH OTHER - If you buy a row of four, what you get is a standalone seat with two armrests and three other standalone seats that only have a right armrest. This isn't a huge deal, but it makes them more prone to tipping, as mentioned. I've been told you can buy connecting brackets separately, however.*LED UNDERLIGHTING IS OBNOXIOUSLY BRIGHT - In fact, if you leave the lights on and have the seatrest up, a blue glow will be projected onto the wall/screen/TV in front of you (extending to about 6' high). Some owners either leave the lights off entirely, or cover them up with electric tape or window tinting.*GROMMETS SCRATCH EASILY - All mine were scratched within the first few days under normal use.*IN-ARM STORAGE REALLY ONLY HOLDS TRAY (at least with straight row configurations) - You'll pretty much be using the in-arm storage for the included tray. It can't fit two, and you'd be at risk of damaging fragile remotes/tablets with the tray if you tried to put them in the same compartment.*I PREFER THICKER FOOTREST PADDING - There's only about an inch of padding between your legs and the board beneath. It would be more comfortable if it were thicker.*LED LIGHTING POWER SUPPLY FAILED ON SECOND DAY - This may be a fluke, but I had one of the LED lighting power supplies go out on me very quickly. The vendor is sending a new one, however.Overall, I'm decently happy with them so far. I got talked out of other seats like the Rialto (which had a seat height that would have left my head hanging over the edge), so I'm satisfied that these are not bargain-basement chairs. However, I suspect that some of the negatives I mentioned wouldn't be characteristic of more expensive chairs from other manufacturers.For me, these hit a sweet spot and I look forward to getting years of use out of them!

The bottom of my butt to the tip of my head is around 37"" tall (give or take) and it feels like there is a little bit of headrest room to spare once I sink into the chair both sitting and reclining.*GROMMET AND TRAY TABLES STANDARD! - It's awesome that the tray is integrated into the chair, since you can be reclined and still eat off of it (unlike having to sit up to place a TV tray in front of the chair).*GOOD RANGE OF OPTIONS (Depending on Retailer) - Brown/black colors.

Good range of grommet accessories like wine glass caddies, tablet holders, cigar host, reading light, etc.* WALL-HUGGER RECLINE - You can set the upright seat a few inches from the wall and it will recline almost to the point you're lying down without hitting the back of the wall.*USB POWER RECLINE SWITCH - Some vendors offer a lighted two-port USB charger integrated into the power recline switch, which is nice for charging a tablet/phone while sitting.

This could be mitigated if the chairs were connected, but...*THE CHAIRS DON'T ATTACH TO EACH OTHER - If you buy a row of four, what you get is a standalone seat with two armrests and three other standalone seats that only have a right armrest. This isn't a huge deal, but it makes them more prone to tipping, as mentioned. I've been told you can buy connecting brackets separately, however.*LED UNDERLIGHTING IS OBNOXIOUSLY BRIGHT - In fact, if you leave the lights on and have the seatrest up, a blue glow will be projected onto the wall/screen/TV in front of you (extending to about 6' high). Some owners either leave the lights off entirely, or cover them up with electric tape or window tinting.*GROMMETS SCRATCH EASILY - All mine were scratched within the first few days under normal use.*IN-ARM STORAGE REALLY ONLY HOLDS TRAY (at least with straight row configurations) - You'll pretty much be using the in-arm storage for the included tray.

"One of the biggest reasons to consider this receiver is if you want the awesome sound quality and easy setup of a Pioneer Elite receiver, but don't want to break the bank on a $1000-3000 receiver (like the other Elites) and also plan on upgrading to a 4K TV now or in the future.For the present, the VSX-80 has the ability to offer 4K upscaling from a 1080p source to make your existing content look even better. For the future, the VSX-80 also offers 4K passthrough, which will become important within about a year's time, as the Blu-ray Disc Association announced 4K discs coming around late 2015.Notably, the VSX-80's 4K support is via HDMI 2.0, which may sound meaningless, but is a vital differentiator between this and older ""4K"" receivers. Case in point, this receiver replaces an Onkyo TX-NR727 for me, and while my old Onkyo receiver claimed 4K support, it did so via dual HDMI outputs, which is an approach the A/V industry is abandoning in favor of HDMI 2.0 (which is basically 4k video at 60fps through a single HDMI cord).Thus, with the VSX-80, you're getting a receiver that the respected review website Audioholics.com describes as ""about as future proof as you're going to get"".Setup is also a breeze, and is one of Pioneer receiver's other big strengths. To calibrate your system you connect all your speakers, then take the included long-corded microphone and place it near your planned listening area. The receiver then runs through a quick series of tests to equalize volume and compensate for speaker distances. Afterwards, the result is pretty incredible!My first exposure to the post-calibration sound quality was streaming music from my iPhone via AirPlay, and it was jaw-droppingly good. I noticed detail in the vocals and instruments that I'd never heard before! It's hard to explain, but the top-notch calibration left me with the sensation that the output of every speaker hit my eardrums at JUST the right time, giving me the sensation that the musicians were right there in the room with me. It was a joy!Movie listening was also enjoyable, and seemed on par with my old Onkyo TX-NR727 in terms of audio quality, but the VSX-80's seemingly superior calibration made the surround effects seem more immersive. I used a few reference scenes from Avatar (like where a helicopter lands and monkey-like animals swung through the forest and howled all around) and it felt 3D enough to bring a smile to my face.Regarding power, I saw another reviewer complain that the output was too weak, but I was able to crank the volume up to the point where it was borderline uncomfortable for my ears and it wasn't even maxed out. It may not be able to power concert-sized speakers, but I think the power output will fit most customer's needs. For reference, I have a standalone subwoofer and a set of in-wall speakers for front and rear surround.The other thing I loved was the dual HDMI outputs that supported both audio AND video! I have a TV and a projector in the same area, so this feature was huge for me! My old receiver only supported audio in the second zone, so I had to buy a (sometimes malfunctioning) $70 HDMI splitter to send a video signal to both pieces of equipment. With the Elite VSX-80, I just plugged both in to the two outputs, set the receiver to output to both zones simultaneously and I am able to turn on either the TV or the projector at any time and get a full experience! Nice!As for the drawbacks, the worst I can say is this:1. Although Harmony remotes support the majority of VSX-80 functions, some of the more advanced ones (like output selection) have to be manually programmed. This is more an issue with Harmony remotes than the receiver itself, but it's worth mentioning.2. Some of the more advanced configuration isn't 100% intuitive. For instance, it took me a bit of research to determine that HDZone has to be disabled on Zone 1 to support outputting to Zone 2 (and even then, certain settings will block output to Zone 2 for some reason).3. I've occasionally noticed a few bugs. For instance, when switching from my projector to my TV, the video looked greenish. I simply turned the receiver on and off and everything was back to normal, however.4. One of the HDMI inputs is on the front of the receiver, which I've always found silly, but isn't a big deal for me since the six inputs on the back more than meet my needs.That's pretty much it! I love the receiver and would highly recommend it if you're looking for 4K compatibility, excellent audio, dual zone output and an excellent feature set, all at a reasonable price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16I350LZQ0RLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIQ3HWS#wasThisHelpful","R16I350LZQ0RLO","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We tried this out and ended up thinking it was pretty neat!The playset comes with three models: a shark, spider and truck, all of which have many pieces that you can add skins to, then manually snap together.The ""Skinz"" are basically like large temporary tattoos; you wrap one around the part (or object) you're trying to skin, wrap the included sponge around the part (after getting it wet), then letting the vacuum suck out all the air until it's more or less form-fitting.Let sit for 10 seconds, peel off backing, straighten a little bit with the included brush (or just your fingers), and you've got yourself a pretty cool looking skin!My kids loved it, and so do I! The only bad part is that the three included models don't last long, and you can't currently buy replacement models as far as I can tell. This means you're either re-skinning the three models or finding something else small to use the skins on.Cool way to talk to your kids about what a vacuum is, too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFXMLFT4QKSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N33N1FM#wasThisHelpful","R2OFXMLFT4QKSE","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When it comes to workout supplements, my rule of thumb is this: if I feel or notice a difference after taking it, I'll use it. Otherwise, I think it's a waste of money.So ultimately, the answer to the question of if I feel a difference after taking this is: yes. My energy levels pick up with this and I feel more awake/alert.I disagree with the vendor that it is ""lasting"" energy, as the effect wears off on me after about an hour of workout time, but that's on par with other pre-workout supplements I've used (for lasting stamina, I'll use diet and cordyceps mushroom-based supplements like Cordygen).However, unlike most other pre-workout supplements I've used (like BSN N.O.-XPLODE), Vega Energizer uses Stevia as a sweetener versus artificial sweeteners like Sucrolose! This is big for me, as I feel more comfortable putting plant extracts into my body vs. a sweetener that was created in a lab.Vega Energizer is also not much more expensive than the N.O. XPLODE product I currently use (at least when you purchase it in a tub form). I crunched the numbers, and at current Amazon prices, it breaks down about like this:N.O. XPLODE  .73c/serving  $9.24/month assuming three workouts per weekVega Energizer  .85c/serving  $10.71/month assuming three workouts per weekSo the question is if it's worth spending an extra buck fifty a month to have a somewhat more natural, but still effective pre-workout supplement. For me, the answer is probably yes, and I anticipate making a permanent switch once my current supply of alternatives is exhausted.I like this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R52LB5M1FHN8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYPMCO0#wasThisHelpful","R52LB5M1FHN8S","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It basically comes in a single piece, unless you count a removable cable management ring.A rubberized clamp slides into and pinches a vent, there's a spring-loaded foam-lined pincher arm to hold your phone, and it clicks into whatever rotational position you care for.On the downside, the holder arm seems big enough to secure a naked iPhone 6 Plus, but it's BARELY too narrow if you have it in a thick case like a Griffen Survivor (as I do).Also, USB cables tend to slip out of the holder ring, but are easily reconnected, so it's not a big deal.In a nutshell, this is a great mount for a normal sized phone and even a phablet minus a case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2FUF8WRIGCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5JARCI#wasThisHelpful","R3H2FUF8WRIGCE","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The big question I have with earbuds like this is, ""How much better are they than the free pair I get with my phone"". The answer is: noticeably; enough that my wife mentioned a difference in clarity versus stock Apple earbuds (and she's usually the type not to pick up on such things). They're more mid-range than high-end (as you'd expect at this price), but are good enough that they are a worthy replacement based on audio quality alone. Details are crisp and music is generally enjoyable.Equally noteworthy, is that the SoundTrue In-Ears are also much more comfortable than run-of-the-mill earbuds, despite having protruding rubber pieces that look like they're going to probe your eardrums. The rubberized earpiece actually distributes pressure throughout the ear quite nicely, which is a big deal for ME since ear buds have a tendency to irritate my ears after a short amount of time.The main caveat is that these earbuds don't have volume controls or any sort of microphone built in to the cord, though there are more expensive versions that do for:iPhone - Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones for iOS Models, BlackAndroid (Galaxy) - Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones for Samsung Galaxy Models, BlackPersonally, I'd recommend going for THOSE if you were going to buy these earbuds, but I'd recommend the Bose SoundTrue either way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28P8YSK39ZQ2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5A7L14#wasThisHelpful","R28P8YSK39ZQ2I","AX7317G153T8W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX7317G153T8W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Weber 6492 in the middle of August 2014 and it has worked well up to this week when, as others have reported, the temperature reading starting jumping around and occasionally settled on a non-reading of ""LL"". I am not hard on my things because I want them to last. I treated this thermometer, in particular, as if it was as fragile as an egg. But four days before Christmas, with baking still to be done, it stopped functioning properly.I didn't have the time or inclination to go out and buy another thermometer so I figured it was worth trying to change the battery, The battery is accessible by twisting the front part of the housing (the part with the buttons and LCD) counterclockwise in relation to the back.As it turned out, the battery was fine but the contacts must have had a little oxidation that prevented the front part from communicating with the sensor. After gently cleaning the contacts with a soft piece of fabric, It works fine now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCX4WTA2OUBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IH0BZ0#wasThisHelpful","RCX4WTA2OUBE","A2HJOAGKQIAABQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HJOAGKQIAABQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When making bread, I've recently replaced a 1/4 cup of the mix with amaranth flour and added 2 additional tablespoons of extra water to give it more of a whole ""wheat"" taste.This product does not come with yeast.

"My 15 y/o daughter has a gluten intolerance and is a picky eater - a bad combination. Consequently, she doesn't eat much and is very thin. She does like pizza, but hasn't been able to eat it. I had planned to try to come up with a recipe for a good gluten free pizza crust (usually I make everything from scratch) but, on a whim, I picked up a box of this at the local Whole Foods and tried it last night. I was amazed.  Initially I was concerned with the gluey consistency, which is nothing like pizza dough. I followed the suggestions offered by ""H. McLaughlin (Oregon)"" and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and an extra half teaspoon of salt. Additionally, I had to coat my hands in oil to get it to spread in the pan without sticking to me or the spatula. I also baked the crust for 10 minutes at the recommended 400 degrees before adding the toppings. My pan is 16"" and it fit perfectly. My daughter ate a third of the pan by herself.

"I have used face steamer when I was in my teens and loved it. But then over the years I stopped using it more out of laziness. I am however glad I have this steamer now.First of all  It is very compact. It does not take up a lot of storage space. There is a water tank at the back of the steamer and can fill enough water for 8-10 minutes of steam session. In my experience, do not use more than 10 minutes at a time and not more than once a week. I, may be wrong about this but this is what I used to do in my teens. Also there is how much of hot steam you can take continuously.After 10 minutes of using this steamer, I felt my skin very soft and clean and very relaxed.I love this facial steamer, definitely recommend it.Product received at discounted rate in exchange of honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RAB7YQRRWLQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142QUD0O#wasThisHelpful","R3RAB7YQRRWLQP","A27TFGK62L22RK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TFGK62L22RK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would recommend checking each setting before using- jet is little powerful so be careful while using it for long time on deck, shower is little powerful too so I use a lower water setting to giving my dog a bath.4.

They can slice thick vegetables such as onions, carrots etc very easily. Cutting softer vegetables is piece of cake. Each knife has its own protective case. The knife handle provides a good grip. This is supposed to be 100% ceramic.I am a big fan for ceramic knives. I love how they stay sharp for years. They also do not rust, however they crack. If you drop them on the floor, there is a chance that they will break. Since it is ceramic, I do not expect them to go dull easily. However, I will only know this after months and months of use.

The front of the bag has additional pockets for easy organization The back straps have padding and very comfortable on shoulder. I did not notice any strain or marks after a day-long hike. The waist straps also have pockets, which I absolutely love. I could keep my phone and keys and small snacks in it.My overall opinion about this bag is definitely a buy. I highly recommend it.Product received at discounted rate in exchange of honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFMPBH471LO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ126GY#wasThisHelpful","R1AFMPBH471LO7","A27TFGK62L22RK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TFGK62L22RK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My biggest advise when you order this size is- Do not order one size larger than what you would normally wear. I did the mistake of ordering large instead of medium and the shirt is very large. There is no problem with the shirt as such and I can still wear it. I am hoping that it will shrink after multiple washes. It is otherwise a good quality polo shirt.

"This is a thick serum that absorbs into the skin quickly.In addition to the retinol, this also contains hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E which has antioxidants that keep your skin healthy. The combination of these three ingredients make a potent formula that will help minimize and reduce signs of aging on your skin. In addition to this serum, I also recommend an eye serum containing vitamin K, a vitamin C serum and a high quality broad spectrum sunscreen. Combined, these will make a complete skin care regimen that will keep your skin looking as young as possible.

"This is such a cute little coin purse! I love the design on the front and the Eiffel Tower Charm on it also! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be though. Sad. But it is made of quality materials however. The actual coin purse is made from what seems to be a canvas type material, with the image printed right on it. The charm is made of thick sturdy metal material. The zipper part and the bottom of a faux leather type material. It has stood up to my teenager using everyday since she received it. Opening and closing all the time. Being thrown in her purse, and having a ton of change in it, does have wear and tear on anything, but this hasn't shown any sign of it as of yet.

Also, I found it helpful to skip a few days here and there (i.e. take for 3 days then take a 2 day break).

"Husband and 18yr old son tested this product - here is the info they gave me:Pros:They both love that it's a wet/dry shaver. Taking it in the shower is the best. It's totally waterproof.It's very light weight and extremely quiet, great for not waking up the sleeping bear.The battery charges quickly, about an hour from dead. But you can plug it in and charge it for 15 minutes and be able to shave your whole face and then some.It has a timer that tells you how long you have it turned on and how much battery you have left, that's awesome.It's very powerful, it shaves better than one plugged into the wall. And has a super close shave, like a blade.Cons:The price.He expected the trimmer to work better than it did.It should have a charger stand for the counter, for how beautiful it is, you should be able to put it on display instead of laying it down.It didn't come with a cleaning brush.In the end - they really do like the shaver but would not pay $$$.

"Love Huggies - not only are they affordable but I have always preferred them over the other name brands.  These Size 1s are tiny but will work perfectly for the newborn in the family.

"Whew it's something to put together so right of the bat I would wish that it were at least partially 'folded' so it takes less effort to assemble.  It's sharp and modern looking but it is, in my opinion, flimsy for the price tag.  If you can get kids to work at the station then it's a good thing but my kids want to curl up in a comfy chair and read, not stand.  Not the best but as long as they're reading and retaining, I won't argue.I realize the benefits from 'standing' and working this is a great concept but it's just not sturdy enough for myself or my employees.  They also told me that it takes more space than they are willing to ""give up"" and they would rather stand to write on the racks than get on and off a seat that isn't an actual seat.All I can say is be sure it's really going to be used and then check all the reviews.

"I was offered the backpack for an honest review.  The construction and the canvas as well as the appearance is definitely a plus...love the look!However, it's small so if you're a college or high school student you'll need to search for a larger one.  Another thing IMO are the padded straps - they are very thick but if you can't carry a lot, then is that really an asset?  Last - the shoulder straps have the metal loops to slide straps for length.  In my previous experience this is a pain because the heavier the pack gets, the more they slide or pull.

"Buy Bulk & Go For It!  If you have the space to store freezer foods, live in the country where buying bulk is a necessity or a game hunter - this one's for you.  We do have venison to butcher once a year but this is particularly useful for bulk purchases from Sam's Club and Costco.  The name 'Game Saver' is not as straight forward as 'Food Saver' - and this is a food saver, you do not have to be a hunter to enjoy the benefits.Anyone that uses a sealer and loves it, this is out of the park.  My favorite benefit is the machine width that handles larger pieces of meat.It pushes through products and sealing like a champ.My least favorite part - it's bulky and big.  BUT you can't get a 15"" width without some type of counter...It's not for the faint of heart.  If you only do minimal sealing then consider a smaller unit.

"This Eureka is fine for quick pickups of lightweight dust and fine debris but it's just that - for quick pickups/spruce-ups.  I find this works fine between regular vacuum cleanings.  It's best for stairs and vehicles and over furniture but if you want a good vacuum for floors you'd be better off spending the money on a 'real' vacuum.What I like - easy to grab and lightweight to run on area carpet under table.  Switch to do tile with ease.What I don't like - it's a short handle at only 44"" extended.  So even at 5'4"", I seem to be bending to reach under the table.Cleaning it - hate it.  Says it has a cup and it does however all the dust and fine dirt sticks to the bag inside and doesn't drop in the cup.  It makes such a mess trying to clean off that bag using a brush or cloth.  VERY messy (so do it outdoors) and maybe this process will get easier with time but my first impression and suggestion to you - do more research before purchasing.  I can deal with the fine debris and hair quick pickups but cleaning that tank...hate it and my allergies dislike it even more.

"This Bissell is well made, light weight and is easy to understand and put together.  The battery charged in a few hours and I was able to test on the carpets stains.  It does wet the carpet so you want to stay off that area until it thoroughly dries.  It's much more convenient to move around than a full size cleaner but you spend a lot of time on your knees or basically standing on your head while you're working on spots.  I'll more likely use for our vehicles, furniture and stairs but not on the carpet.

"Product offered free for a review - I like the dvd and the band idea - however the bands are flimsy.  The light weight bands feel like they'll snap at any time which is concerning when you're pulling them between your arms or legs.  The thicker bands won't budge.

In addition, the sleeves are stitched under the arms but after that inch of stitching the remainder of the seam down to the bottom is open.

And if it were true to size, we could have stitched it ourselves and kept it but we have to return because it's not even close to a 4X.

"At first glance I was a bit overwhelmed as we only use a small Oster for everyday things and a very large grinder for the canning season.  This item replaces almost every like appliance in the kitchen but it takes up the space of a large microwave.  The power is great and it does an incredible job.All removable pieces are dishwasher safe - so we washed everything before use.  One thing that I didn't like is the handle.  There is a black handle encased with a clear, larger one.  When I removed it from dishwasher - the clear handle had condensation (and water droplets) inside which tells me it will grow mold because there's no way to dry it.If you like a food processor (or the idea of one) and have the space, this is a nice unit.  Especially with the caddy that holds all the extra parts so they aren't flying around a cabinet or drawer.  If you've never used a processor - consider the smaller, easy to store and quick use gadgets like a flat grater, 2 cup chopper, mandolin, etc.  I love this processor but I won't be getting it out everyday when I need to slice some cucumbers for dinner or grate cheese for a salad.  So it won't be replacing the gadgets in my kitchen.  The smaller ones are easier to use, no assembly and quick to clean and put away (not to mention lifting!)What I like most - it does everything from dicing to slicing to grinding - potatoes to cabbage slaw.  I like the caddy that holds all the parts for storage and the suction cups on the base are a nice plus too.What I like least - the size. It's huge and not only is the main piece with cup and lid big but it has a 'caddy' that's bigger than the base to hold all the parts.  The other thing that is a disappointment - I thought this would be perfect to make our freezer pepper hash because of the big 4 cup bowl but the gadget that does the hash can only be used inside the 2 cup insert so that's a drawback for us.  This just means that I won't haul this big one out because I can do the same in my smaller 2 cup grinder...so there's no benefit in that area.Keep in mind we're working in a country 'farm' kitchen and we don't put a lot of stock into owning the 'new' gadgets - I suppose, all in all, I prefer the smaller single pieces than this all in one.  They're easier to clean, easier to store, lighter, and not complicated.  So if you can't afford a processor, don't worry about it - I've given you ample reason to stick with the more affordable, smaller tools.With that said - the Black n Decker processor is a perfectly good choice at a reasonable price if you just have to have one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275US41QQNT1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLZM#wasThisHelpful","R275US41QQNT1W","A3M2U2803IED3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M2U2803IED3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous material and print - not a fan of the straps.  I thought they were plain straps but they're like a ruffle hanging from it and that I don't like.  In addition - the bust is small in my opinion.  This made it look tighter on front which is acceptable but it was also tight behind my arms and that 'back fat' thing was a complete turn off.  I think the chest needs more room while the waist is full enough for the size.  Best bet is to order a size larger for the bust and then the fullness in the drape would fall into place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNE6EB3CV40I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF09N6C#wasThisHelpful","R2UNE6EB3CV40I","A3M2U2803IED3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3M2U2803IED3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely love the hammered finishes - I have the hammered black on everything that needed paint!  I've been searching for the hammered white and thankfully found this spray - Rust-Oleum is losing one star because they don't offer this in a can (I don't like to spray items.)Anyway -  if you have old metal furniture, planters, tables that are rusty and pitted - this hammered paint is exactly what you need.  You can paint over the rust (just wire brush the loose debris from item) and the paint looks like it's getting air bubbles in it (and it is!)  Then the bubbles disappear and it appears like dimples in the paint and the finish is incredible.  This paint is amazing for hiding all the flaws on the item and the hammered gunmetal (black) is stunning.My new favorite paint for DIY projects of all kinds.

"The Little Guy, my daughter hasn't named it yet.  is great on all levels.  It is a very versatile toy for a broad range of age groups.

The flashing lights on the belly are very intriguing as well.The Amazon description states it's for 9 to 18 months so I wasn't sure if it would work  for my 2.5 year old - when it arrived, the package states 9 to 36 months - so please keep in mind that there's an error on the page and this item has a longer use span for kids.For my 30month old daughter it is very educational.  It teaches colors, the alphabet, and the freeze dance song is a great energy burner and a great tool to teach them that freeze means stop and they have to wait for the next cue.

"My daughter is into anything coconut these days - sugar, milk and now we tried the syrup.  It's actually more the 'idea' that it's made from coconut than the taste.

"The HP-LINK AC1900 Wi-Fi Dual-Band Range Extender is just what I've been needing. I've tried several other, less expensive solutions, and none of them have worked for us. We live in a two-story condo and our modem is on the ground floor, leaving us with spotty Internet connectivity upstairs. The last extender we tried just made things worse.The TP-LINK set up very quickly and easily (contrary to other reviews which express frustration with the process, and I'm no tech guy) and within minutes was up and running and improving our Internet upstairs. I can now work at my desk top without suffering from high ping, It scarce needs be said that this also improves my online gaming experience. We can also use our smart phones more enjoyably.Upstairs prior to the TP-LINK, I had a ping of 38 ms and a download speed of 25.96 (supposed to be 64) and an upload speed of 3.10. After installing the TP-LINK, my numbers went to 19 ms, 27.12, and 3.15. If I connect directly to the TP-LINK with an ethernet cable plugged into its Gigabit Ethernet port, my numbers go to 11 ms, 35.52 and 3.21. A subsequent firmware update for my Netgear router was just icing on the cake, and I now have respectable Internet throughout the house.I place the TP-LINK outside my bedroom door, making it close to all the rooms upstairs. It sits on its base (as shown) or on its side equally well. I put it there for convenience. I had previously placed it in our bedroom but I did not move it because of what another reviewer called ""blinding status lights"" (I didn't think the lights were at all annoying, and neither did my wife, who normally abhors any lights at night).Highly recommended and well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HIMWB09QMUOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S6RYUY#wasThisHelpful","R3HIMWB09QMUOW","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owned an iHealth Edge and loved it, until the strap opened up and it fell off and was lost. So when I saw the scale, I was more than wiling to try it. I still have the iHealth app on my phone and it seemed therefore a good match.The scale is slim, not overly large (about a foot square) and lightweight (about 5.5 pounds) and attractive to boot. The digital read out is easy to see day or night. It is no problem finding a spot to keep it when not in use. We also have a Weight Watchers scale and testing the Core Body Analysis Scale I found that the iHealth consistently weighs me in at .5 to 1.5 pounds less than the WW scale. It weighs my wife more inconsistently. I don't know why. I don't know which is more accurate.The iHealth scale's instruction manual is pretty slender, as most are these days; they want you to use their online manuals, in this case found at http://www.ihealthlabs.com/files/3614/4425/9451/HS6-OM.pdf, (Quick Start Guide here: http://www.ihealthlabs.com/files/8114/4191/0002/HS6-KSZP01_V2.0.pdf) but you can get it set up easily enough and linked to your iHealth app fairly easily as well.So far so good. The only problems I have had is getting it to actually work like its supposed to. I can't get the scale to measure my body mass index, and register my weight on the app (which is the point after all). You are supposed to be bare-footed and to stand on the sensors. No matter how many times I or my wife try, it fails to register this reading.The instructions offer no help in this regard, nor can I figure out why my weight won't show on the app, even though the app synced with the scale.I appealed to the online owner's manual but it is the same size and uselessness as the manual.No matter how often I try, it won't work. Which renders the Core Body Analysis Scale a basic scale for more money than you should have to pay for a basic scale.I think it would be great if it actually did what it was supposed to do, but it doesn't, and therefore I cannot give it more than 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE951AQQ8UODG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2N86JI#wasThisHelpful","RE951AQQ8UODG","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is difficult to know how to review this product, because unless you experience upset stomach, which I do not, or pump iron, which I do not, it is difficult to know if it is doing anything being giving you a slight energy boost, which I can get much more pleasantly from a V-8 energy drink. Perhaps I simply do not use enough of it to make an appreciable difference.I like to make smoothies and shakes in the morning to get my day going, which is what brought me to try this product. We use a variety of powders  (see below) for this and I put the ingredients in rice milk, when I can get it, though lately I have had to substitute ""rice drink"" thanks to my local grocery stores.Maca powder, the packaging says, is ""high in protein, fiber, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, iron, potassium, copper, manganese and fatty acids."" However, if you look at the Nutrition Facts more closely you see that in fact it has only 2% of your Vitamin C, 2% of your iron, 2% of your calcium, and only 1 single gram of protein (also only 1 gram of fiber).I don't know what this company thinks of as ""high"" but this product is not it. If my blood sugar were crashing and I needed a pick-me-up quick, this would not be the powder on my shelf I would choose. You would have to use a lot of powder to match what I get from my VEGA All-in-One Nutritional Shake powder (which I also reviewed here) - about 10 tsp by my calculations.You might also want to note that if you're allergic to peanuts, this product is packaged in a facility that handles tree nuts.I have read the other reviews, about how the Maca powder smells like yellow cake mix (it does not - it made me gag). I do not recommend taking a breath - the smell once the package was opened permeated the air of my kitchen. I put a teaspoon in a glass of rice drink and stirred it up. There was apparently just enough liquid - I had to top of the glass to get the powder to fully dissolve. I stirred it well and took a sip and though the taste is unpleasant, it is less unpleasant than the smell. I gulped it down to minimize the effect but still have to drink water afterward to wash the taste out of my mouth.I feel as a result that the powder is best mixed with something else to hide the taste, and that is easy enough to do with the addition of fruit or bananas, and with other powders. I do not recommend drinking it alone. I have not tried it in baking simply because I am on Weight Watches and bread is very expensive in points.In the end, I gave it three stars as ""just okay"" because, taking T. Lane's review about the identity of the product and my own experiences, I cannot say anything more positive about it than that. It works if you need more energy; it's just that I can think of more pleasant sources of that energy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEGYWQ97ELFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1WVEF2#wasThisHelpful","R2KEGYWQ97ELFA","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gone are my days of owning big stereo systems. In the digital age, I use small Bluetooth speakers around the house, sync them with my phone and play tunes that way, as often as not. I still have a CD player but I use it less often, and it is downstairs. For my office upstairs, something like this is very useful.I can go upstairs, sit at my desk, open up Amazon Music on my phone and play from my own offline library or from Prime Music. And this is better quality sound than the smaller blue tooth speakers I have. One reviewer was critical of the base but I found it perfectly adequate. That might depend on what kind of music you listen to and your own tastes.Additionally, it gives me the ability to talk on the phone without having to hold it, which would interrupt my work. It features:Bass Reflex Speaker System delivers a powerful, deeper bassWireless music streaming via BluetoothBuilt-in microphone for hands-free phone callsBuilt-in rechargeable battery for music playback anywhereUp to 5 hours music playbackAdditionally, it's reasonably priced and not bad to look at, meaning it won't look out of place on a shelf or window-ledge. It's only a little more than a foot long and half a foot wide, so it doesn't take up a lot of space.I agree with the reviewers that the instructions are a mess. They typically are these days, more like hieroglyphics than intelligible directions. But I got it set up according to what seemed common sense and it didn't take long. I didn't take the sticker off the front so I don't know if that experience is common to all.

"This is a great book, very easy to read, and very informative on a wide variety of topics and historical periods going all the way back to before Europeans trod North American soil.The Longest Trail is a collection of Alvin M. Josephy, Jr.'s writings, each article introduced with a brief commentary by the editors, putting the piece in context. They come to this collection from various sources: A Continent Awakes comes from the book ""500 Nations"" (1994) while Tecumseh: The Greatest Indian was published in 1961 as part of Josephy's book, ""The Patriot Chiefs"" and Cowplanter, Can You Swim? is taken from his 1982 book ""Now That the Buffalo's Gone.""I came of age on books like ""Red, White and Black"" (1974) by Gary B. Nash and ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" (1970) by Dee Brown, books which really introduced me to Native Americans as something other than movie antagonists. If you haven't yet discovered that Native Americans belong in American history, you should pick up a copy of The Longest Trail and find out why it is so important that they become part of our historical landscape. If you are already aware, read The Longest Trail anyway, as it is full of rich detail and insights that will only deepen your understanding.All of the included essays are excellent and display the breadth of Josephy's interests. You can read them in order, as I did, or skip around to the subjects that interest you most. There is something for everybody interested in Native American culture, history, and politics. It is a book that belongs on every historian's (professional or amateur) shelf. Highly recommended and easily 5 stars alone for the obvious love and compassion Josephy shows for his subject matter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WV96POPJPFRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345806913#wasThisHelpful","R2WV96POPJPFRS","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son likes the WWE and he has both the Rumblers, which I no longer see in stores, and the larger 9"" figures, like this one. He is also a big fan of the X-Box 360 versions of the WWE games. One of his favorite things about those games has been creating his own wrestler and outfitting him, so when he saw these new Create a WWE Superstar sets, he was very excited.He sat down right away and began to fashion various forms of Triple H, and played with his figures, which he hadn't done for awhile. There are several other of these sets he said he'd like and I told him to add them to his Christmas list. The various pieces seem to snap on and off fairly easily. He had no problem with any of them, and he showed me how easily Triple H could be transformed by swapping out just a couple of pieces, like boots and helmet.The face is even a reasonable likeness of Triple H and they certainly captured his build.It's a neat idea and I can't imagine other kids not liking it as much as my son. Recommended. Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JF72GO686HC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTRDH5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2JF72GO686HC6","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am unable to give a comprehensive review of this product as I turned out to be one of those people who gets unpleasant gastric side effects.I did do some research and I saw that the strength of these tablets is in the recommended range (70% HCA - recommended was 60%), and I don't know what to make of the potential hazards of taking supplements like this, so I won't address that here. I didn't plan on taking this long term anyway, so wasn't really concerned about that.However, I did take it for two weeks and I did not notice any reduction in appetite between meals. I am on Weight Watchers and already losing weight, but because the meals are smaller and there is less snacking as part of the diet, I wanted something to suppress my appetite in between (and if possible increase my chances of losing weight).One problem with supplements like these is being able to know when you are going to eat, so you can take them sufficiently in advance of your meal. I don't always know when I'm going to be able to eat so my experience might have been affected by this fact.I did not see either of these things during my two weeks using it so either I did not take it long enough, I didn't take enough (as another reviewer pointed out) or it simply didn't work for me. Given my experience, I gave it two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AH8SOQ03NDOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE9B9L0#wasThisHelpful","R2AH8SOQ03NDOS","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a long-time PhotoShop user. Then I switched to PaintShop Pro when X6 came out. It was a learning curve for me, and I still don't feel like I've attained my level of skill from PhotoShop days, but I've become familiar with the program and enjoyed using it. Now that X8 has come out, I've upgraded rather than switching back to PhotoShop.It's not that PhotoShop is easier to use. As another reviewer has said, PaintShop might actually be easier. It's just a matter of familiarity. The software installs quickly and there are some freebies you can download as well. It's a pretty straight-forward proposition getting started (there is also a pdf manual) and it's not a huge departure from X6, so if you are used to the previous versions you can easily step into X8. If you need help, as always, there are a plethora of sites with tutorials and how-to's.There are some obvious improvements, like text wrapping. This is a great feature. You could take an image from the web, for example, select the shape using the ""magic wand tool"" and then begin typing inside it. The text will automatically wrap to fit (make sure the font is neither too large nor too small to do the job). Or you could copy text from somewhere and paste it into the shape. it may take a moment or two depending on the length of the block of text, but it will appear in the selected shape.I don't know if X8 is actually faster than X6, because I am not using the same computer, but it does seem to operate smoothly and without long delays loading. If you liked PaintShop Pro before it is safe to say you will like this latest upgrade. It is certainly a powerful and versatile tool and I cannot imagine lacking anything you might need.It is also a bit less expensive than PhotoShop, which never hurts, and I've yet to find anything I could do on Photoshop that I can't do on PaintShop once I become familiar with how to do it. Like I said, it's just a matter of becoming familiar with the new software and that requires using it. I'm enjoying it immensely and I think you will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B657NVNEE0VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R1B657NVNEE0VQ","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this for my wife, so that she could bring some order to her things that otherwise accumulate on the bathroom counter or under, or which have remained unused since we moved for want to space.It is easy to set up. It is completely assembled. All you have to do is attach the two hooks to the back, which hang it from the door (it also comes with brackets, anchors and screws so you can mount it on the wall). The final step is attached some of that pull-away tape to the bottom of the cabinet so that it does not bounce around on the door when in use. The hooks are adjustable so you can put the unit where it works best for your height.It is quite spacious, which is nice, but the space is somewhat wasted in that you can only put the shelves and storage bins in particular places, or they will come into conflict with the racks on the door. They have little holes, making it look like you can move them around, but you can't. So if you have grand dreams of flexibility with this set, drop them now or face disappointment.This limitation means that you cannot set it up to match the particular items you want to put in there, and some may not fit. This is the problem my wife ran into. So while it does help your organizing, it is not the absolute answer to it, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. On the other hand, the mirrored door was well-received and the little mirror inside at face level is also nice. Finally, the door locks and you receive two keys. Something to keep kids out, if nothing else (or roommates, I suppose).All in all, a decent unit and worth the money, but it's a shame they didn't make the interior more flexibly designed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJGWDRE6WZLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNTJ8YS#wasThisHelpful","R1JJGWDRE6WZLT","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is good lotion. Like some of the other reviewers, I've tried many different lotions. Some are annoying because of the scent, some just don't see to do anything. But this stuff works. I mean, it makes a noticeable difference. My skin doesn't get easily irritated but my wife's skin is sensitive and she has noticed an immediate relief from this even after one use.My son has a mediport and keloids from several surgeries and he is always scratching, which isn't good around a mediport, and we are using this on him as well.I like the fact that it isn't scented and that you don't feel like you have to re-apply it several times a day. Like another reviewer I like that it's thick but I didn't notice the greasy residue thing. I thought it absorbed well and that was one of the things I liked about it.I think its well worth $6 and I certainly plan on keeping this lotion on hand, especially with a hot summer coming up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA4WGHEJGND9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BJJT7W#wasThisHelpful","RUA4WGHEJGND9","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great Viking axe. It is identical to Ragnar's on the television series. It comes with a display rack. You will have to screw the hooks in that hold it, and the plate has an adhesive backing, which you will have to apply to the rack. It also comes with a certificate of authenticity. This was a limited edition so I don't know how long it will be available, but they do make a less expensive version with a less attractive display rack. I don't know if the axes are identical, however.It is about 2.5 pounds and has a nice feel in your hand. The blade is not sharpened and the axe head is a little loose, so if you wanted to make this an actual weapon it would take some work. I plan to slip mine into a frog and wear it to the Renaissance Festival as part of my woodsman's outfit, when it is not hanging on the wall to admire.

"I absolutely love this loveseat. It is not only beautiful, but exquisitely comfortable. We replaced an old sectional we had when we received this, and bought the matching recliners to go along with it because we liked this so much. It is a huge upgrade in our livingroom. It was painful to get up from the old sectional recliner, but this loveseat is firm and comfortable and I don't find myself sinking into it, and having the feeling that I'm climbing uphill to get out.The pillows are also very comfortable, if a bit large for the loveseat, but I don't mind their size as much as I thought I would. The fabric is attractive and comfortable and the leather backs even softer.The loveseat is 66 inches long and the seating area is 44 inches, with the cushions being 21 inches deep. Plenty of room for two people. It is not only comfortable to sit on, but comfortable to lie on as well. My feet dangle over the arm, but the arms are soft. I fell asleep the other night reclining on this loveseat and had no discomfort at all an hour later when I woke up.The loveseat arrived in a large, heavy box. It was protected by a thick plastic wrap. The feet were in a separate bag tied with leather straps over the top. They were easy to screw into place. The pillows were also in a separate bag. This loveseat is heavy and it took two of us, me and the delivery man, to bring it into the house (out of the box).As a side-note, we went to Ashley furniture to look at this while we were waiting for delivery, and Ashley does not sell this exact set. This is apparently made by them specifically for Amazon.com. They do have something similar under another name. But it was cheaper for us (even with them on sale at Ashley) to buy the matching recliners from Amazon thanks to Amazon Prime.Delivery was expensive through Ashley (not to mention a 2-4 week wait) and we would have had to pay extra to have them haul away our old sectional. We gave it instead to a friend to use in her basement for extra seating. Amazon got the loveseat and the recliners to us in a couple of days, again, thanks to Prime.I highly recommend this loveseat. By all means, check it out at Ashley if you want to see how terrific it is, but order from Amazon. It's far less of a hassle and you'll have it much more quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4WRVBU7HQM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QM2KYAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1M4WRVBU7HQM8","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son likes this towel and that is the important thing here. I personally think it is a little thin, but I've not owned a beach towel in many years and haven't seen one in stores yet this spring to compare this too. I do know that even the cheapest of bath towels is thicker than this, and that for $22 I can get a much nicer bath towel than I've ever bought.On the other hand, this is terry cloth and and so it is absorbent, it's light and can be easily folded and rolled to fit into a small bag, it's big enough for a kid and it's got the Avengers on it, and it's not for me. These are things that you must take into account when buying a beach towel for your child. And its meets all those criteria. He needed a towel he could take to school for swim classes and not get teased about, and I can honestly say, purpose accomplished.I can't in good conscience give it 5-stars simply because it is so thin, but that might be just me being unfair, or maybe just a difference in preferences. The point is, that if he saw this in a store and he needed a beach towel, I would not be averse to buying it for him. Most beach towels here at Amazon seem to be between 12 and 20 dollars so the price of this one is not outrageous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IPEOQK1NHEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9QZAZ2#wasThisHelpful","R35IPEOQK1NHEB","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a huge hit in my house. My wife and son compete to see who can eat them. Of course, getting kids to eat things that are good for them is not easy, but if the food tastes good, the problem is solved. And these taste good. My 10-year-old's first comment was, ""There is a lot of fudge ton this!"" And indeed, there is a very thick layer of chocolate on top.My wife likes the fact that they do not have a medicinal aftertaste and that while having a lot of flavor, the taste doesn't overwhelm you - there is a nice blend of peanut butter and chocolate. You definitely get your money's worth where chocolate is concerned. Oh, and they are gluten free as well, and finding good-tasting gluten-free products has not been easy.You get bars not only chock full of tasty goodness, but healthy goodness. We also use Vega's All-in-One Nutritional Shake (which I have also reviewed here) and are very happy with both these products, because they always seem to have more of what's important, and less of what's bad for you.For example, my son has been taking Special K Protein snack bars to school with him. These have 4 g. of protein. The Vega One bars have 13 g. of protein. This is as much as a Totino's pizza. So it is literally as much as you can get from many meals, if you look at various processed foods. The Vega One bar has 3 g. of fiber while Special K has 4 g., but the Vega One bar adds probiotics, Omega-3, and antioxidants in addition to the vitamins.The Special K bars have no Vitamin A but Vega One has 32% DV; Special K has no Vitamin C but Vega One has 33% DV; Special K has 2% Calcium while Vega One has 22%, and so on. Down the line, pitted against every other product we have used, Vega One wins hands down. Even the protein powder my wife brought home from a nutritionist is out-shined by the Vega One product.I highly recommend these bars. We are trying some of their other flavors because we liked this one so much. Highly recommended. Would give it more than 5 stars if possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H0WF5EDXQAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9596WK#wasThisHelpful","R1H0WF5EDXQAE","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No other way to say it: I love this book. I am a fan of dystopian futures (at least in fiction!) and this one does not disappoint. You have elements of sci fi, horror, zombies and even the apparently supernatural (remember that anything technologically advanced enough seems like magic). You have a hardy and determined band of survivors and implacable enemies (not just one alien race, but two), and a quest. It doesn't get better than a combination like this, and McCammons' telling is masterful.The protagonist is a young boy, of about 14 or 15, named Ethan, who does not remember where he came from or how he came to be running, feeling the terrible enemies fighting around him. Though his role is central to the story, he is far from alone, as we meet other survivors along the way. On either side stand warring alien races, the Gorgons and the Cyphers, as the humans have come to know them. There are also the Gray Men, cannibals who resemble zombies but who are far more terrible both in appearance and abilities.The humans must fight through the alien landscape earth has become, and their adventure is not for the faint of heart. This story is graphically violent and the reader is not spared the horrors of war. The story is full of action, free of awkward info-dumps, and long on character development. I thought the dialog excellent and the motivations and reactions of the characters believable, given the circumstances. This is a thrill-a-minute ride and you won't want to put the book down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZJFJ9FXXOHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067039#wasThisHelpful","R2PZJFJ9FXXOHN","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat little Bluetooth speaker. I was attracted to it not only by its size but by being able to use it for a phone speaker. There are times I want to use my cell phone speaker but the sound is not good enough to make for easy conversation, particularly if there is background noise. I have used this, however, and can hear quite clearly.There is a small amount of distortion or echo in the other person's voice but you can hear them. The only downside seems to be that unless you are very close to the speaker, or speak loudly, your voice doesn't carry as well to the person calling you. Then again, some voices carry better than others and I'm not one of those with a booming voice. I'm not sure how do-able a conversation would be if you're any distance from the device. I have not tested it with everybody or under all conditions. I'm sure the other person's phone has an effect on sound quality as well.That aside, the quality of music is great, and that is still its primary use. I use it for listening to music on my phone, or for plugging my mp3 player into it using the jack. The batteries run for a long time on a single charge (10 hours they say) and I've gone pretty close to that without needing to recharge. The music can get quite loud without any noticeable distortion, and in fact, I have not been able to turn it up all the way because it's much too loud.It comes with a handy little draw-string sack that holds the speaker and cords, so you can easily carry it with you wherever you go, and can pack it into a bag or purse or backpack. It works well in a car too if you don't have an older car or lack a jack for your mp3 player. In a saturated Bluetooth speaker market, I'd still say the RND Ripple Wireless speaker is well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGCI7EQH9MHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUEO4BI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGCI7EQH9MHO","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used various nutritional supplements. Because of heart disease I have to watch my weight and what I eat. For example, I've used Muscle Milk, which offers 32 grams of protein in two scoops (I use one, so 16 grams). By comparison, Vega offers 20 g of protein in one scoop. It also tastes better. The calories are about the same, but Vega also gives you a lot less sodium (25 g vs. 80 g).They do not contain the exact same vitamins, but where a comparison can be made, Vega is equivalent to or superior to Muscle Milk, for example, 90% daily value of vitamin A compared to 15%. Vega also has less sugar than Muscle milk, though both contain negligible amounts, and sugar, they are saying now, is the big killer.I like to mix my shakes using rice milk because I am lactose intolerant and we sometimes throw in things like bananas and kale and fruits of various types. I have found that taste-wise, Vega more than holds its own. I am very happy with Vega and will be buying it from now on in place of Muscle Milk.

"This is a decent piece of furniture for a kids room. It's fairly heavy and bottom-heavy at that, so it seems less likely to tip than other pieces I have seen. The bins at the bottom are a nice touch, esp. for a younger child with lots of loose toys you might want to quickly gather up and put someplace. My son's is full of wrestling action figures and a couple of wrestling rings. They are surprisingly spacious. I have to say I was impressed by that.As for the assembly, two of the part which came with mine were damaged, a chip in the bottom piece (barely visible when assembled) and one of the decorative pieces on the bottom, which is a little more visible but not glaringly obvious. I can only assume they were broken before packing because the way these pieces were placed in the box, I don't see how they could have been damaged after.The instructions were so-so but then they usually are. One step seemed to be missing entirely, and when I went back and checked, I still could not find it. There is, as usual, minimal printed instructions, but the illustrations make the steps reasonably clear. It fit well together, all the hardware was there, and all I needed was a hammer and Phillips head screwdriver.I didn't have to work very hard to get pieces aligned. There were some other places where the finish was cracked or scuffed but these are barely noticeable. All in all, as I say, a reasonable piece of children's furniture.The only real downside is that the price is somewhat high, I think. I don't often spend that much on a piece of furniture I have to assemble myself, but I can't deny it looks good against the wall. And the frame at the bottom where you can put photos or other pieces of art is a nifty idea, so your child can personalize it. My son was impressed by that. And now he has a nice looking shelf to hold his movies and books, and I am able to throw out a couple of smaller units I've had for a decade or so that are far less attractive. Despite the price, I do recommend it.The only reason I do not give the unit 5 stars is because of the scuffs, chip and broken piece.[Update 3.20.15] I contacted the manufacturer about the damaged pieces and replacement parts were sent out immediately and arrived on my porch in a matter of days. I am changing my rating from four stars to five as a result.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZ850WQMJ09T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZBBJLU#wasThisHelpful","R1FZ850WQMJ09T","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book. It's a young adult book but I liked the plot outline and I have to say it lived up to its promise. It's a light read. Despite what the back cover says, this is not Steven Erikson or George R.R. Martin, and the political intrigue is mostly second- or third-hand. Though the plot is not overly complex, it holds together well, and the setting is a familiar one - a sort of alternate history/fantasy Tudor England. The story is well-told, the pace is brisk, there is character development, and the actions and dialog more than the descriptions tell the story.Elizabeth Grey is a Witch Hunter, and she is very good at her job. She apprehends not only witches, but revenants (dead people who refuse to be dead, live forever and are extremely powerful), necromances, wizards, and all others who fall under the purview of Tablet XIII of the law. She does her job willingly and efficiently though it leads to the deaths of many, burned at the stake.  One day, she is accused of being a witch herself and thrown in prison to wait her turn to burn.Since the book's jacket gives this away, I'm not offering up a s spoiler when I say the realm's great enemy, the witch Nicholas Perevil, is the one to rescue her, not her best friend and fellow witch-hunter, Caleb. So off she goes to discover that all in the world is not as it had seemed, and that the world is not black and white, but nuanced in ways she could not have imagined. Perevil has a dangerous mission in mind for her, that will help not only him but everyone else - including herself.I like that Boecker wastes no time with lengthy descriptions, though I'd like to know a bit more about the world (France is called Gaul - so what else is different on the Continent?), and she works as briskly with magic, letting you see how it works rather than explaining it. There are both positives and negatives in her approach, but it works because the story does not bog down at all, but moves more at the pace of a Jason Bourne movie.As I said, I really enjoyed it. It's a light and easy read, the characters are likable, the dialog well done, and it met all my expectations. It's a quick one though, so I hope the author gets to work and offers us some more about these characters and their world.

"I ordered these because my son has to spend several hours each week in a clinic. He had worn out his old earbuds and could not rely on the hospital having a pair available. I didn't want to transport the headphones he uses at home because they don't fit well into his tablet bag. I thought these would be cheap but serviceable, but it turned out they are better than the headphones he uses at home.This is not only because they fold up and are small enough to transport without worrying about damage, but because the sound quality is better. His old headphones are Sony MDR-ZX100, which, I think, are actually more expensive (by a dollar or two) than the Pioneer. But he swears by the Pioneer sound quality (he called it ""HD sound"") and uses them exclusively.So definitely worth the money I would say, if you're looking for an affordable set of headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DGNB6AKMZCXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLXI4A#wasThisHelpful","R2DGNB6AKMZCXL","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to start off by saying I did not finish reading this book. I got half way through it and lost interest in the characters and the story line. For me, this always signals the ultimate failure of a book. Sometimes, as in this case, reading something that really was well written - Tigana, by Guy Gavriel Kay - exposed this book's many weaknesses.At the half way point, there was no connection established between the Celtic witch and the ceramic artist. The Ceramic artist Tilda was still mourning her lost husband and had not encountered a ""new love"" although she had just started spending time with a young man from the village, but since he is the only person she is spending time with, there is an assumption at this point, that he is the love interest in the second half of the story.At the half way point, the only animal that is drawn to Tilda is a dog. The only ""power"" that Tilda has encountered is her ability to short out the electrical system of anything she is close to, including her entire house which makes heating and lighting a trick.The level of depression and grief that Tilda is going through makes this book heavy to trudge through and she isn't sympathetic enough to make it worth the effort.Since Tilda is a ceramic artist, and Seren is a Celtic shaman, I don't know at this point who the ""Silver Witch"" in the title is referring to. Perhaps that is revealed in the last half of the book but at this point it is more like two separate stories set in the same location separated by generations, rather than two lives connected in some way across the years.I really think that there is a ""tipping point"" in any book, a point at which something has to happen, where the protagonist has to come to a decision or take some action (for me, this was the failure of Robert Jordan's saga of endlessly whining characters). Paula Brackston still had not arrived at that point when I gave up, and it was long overdue.So all I can say is, if you chose to read this book, do so eyes wide open and at your own risk. It may be a great finish if you can get past the severe depression and lack of interest in the first half. I just couldn't wait for any potential payoff at the end that was by no means guaranteed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36OC4DFNBLN7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028795#wasThisHelpful","R36OC4DFNBLN7X","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tzvetan Todorovs ""The Inner Enemies of Democracy,"" is an interesting book. Todorov, who grew up in Communist Bulgaria, is not interested in the threat of totalitarian regimes, which has disappeared with the collapse of the Soviet Union, or in the threat of Islamic terrorism, which he says is not a credible candidate for the role of enemy that was formerly held by Moscow.He is interested instead in the threats to democracy that exist because of democracy itself. Democracy, he says, cannot be reduced to a single characteristic but is the balance of several principles, arguing that,The people, freedom and progress are constituent elements of democracy, but if one of them breaks free from its relationship with others, thus escaping any attempt to limit it and erecting itself into a single principle, they become distinct dangers: populism, ultraliberalism, and messianism. Those inner enemies of democracy.This is not an exhaustive list, he says, for those who might be looking for mention of theocracy or corporatocracy, but only those he is interested in having spent a third of his life in a totalitarian state.He singles out populism and demagoguery, and what he calls political messianism, which is a lot like religious messianism, only that it lacks a messiah. Its holy focus is not heaven, but a sort of heaven on earth.As examples, he points to the French Revolution, Marxism/Communism, and imposing democracy by bombs, a category made familiar to Americans since the Wilsonian principle of making the world safe for democracy. Here his warning is that justice is highly selective and that there is no justice which can be found through war, asking if it is okay to kill hundreds to save a few.Todorov paraphrases French Revolutionary Saint-Justs spirited activism, saying that Once the good has been attained, it will of course need to be perpetuated. And how it has been perpetuated, by the French Revolution, by the Communists, and, of course, by the United States of America.This brings him to a discussion not only of Afghanistan and Iraq, but what is called neoliberalism and ultraliberalism, which he says, in its devotion to unbridled economic forces, violates the basic principle of liberal thought, which is the limitation of one power by another.Ultraliberalism and totalitarianism are not, he says, as radically opposed as their adherents claim. Ultraliberalism, Todorov tells us pointedly, is not only totalitarianisms enemy, but its brother.What we need is a restoration of that balance, not a revolution driving one principle over all others. The desire for wealth is not the supreme good of the human being, he says, a sharp rebuke to some of the more potent forces at work in America. Ayn Rand, for Todorov, is a propagandist.There is a lot to absorb here, and I cannot do justice to the complexities of Todorovs argument, but this is an important book, a thought-provoking book, and one well worth reading given the state of our democracy and our place in this world we have done so much to shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UEBXPMZUJPOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745685749#wasThisHelpful","R1UEBXPMZUJPOZ","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few things wrong with this object.For one thing it is stomach remedy pink (which was the only color available on the Vine program). It is slightly cylindrical and rounded at the tip. Therefore it looks like a ""comfort device"" my wife or other women would use, rather than pepper spray.This not just my opinion, but having handed it over to my wife, who was, after all, mostly likely to need such a device - she received several comments along those lines from others that have seen it on her key chain and were shocked that she would dare have such a device out in public.I know. I'm still laughing.On the flip side, a quick test revealed that the jet stream does reach about 5 or 6 feet. I have seen other reviewers complain about the limited range but it seems to me a human aggressor would at least be within this range. It came out in a stream, like a wasp knockdown spray, so it would certainly do something if it hit somebody. I haven't tasted the formula for obvious reasons, so I don't know if it is potent or effective (opinions seem to vary by review).One other concern is that there is no lock on the trigger, so accidental discharge is potentially possible. My wife hasn't had that problem yet, but it is something she is on the watch for. It is probably worth having, and the compact design is nice, but please, put some sort of safety on it so the user doe snot suffer an accidental discharge.  And maybe put a hazardous chemical sign on it so people don't think it's something it's not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BIPZCCKD5S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LHBHUG#wasThisHelpful","R27BIPZCCKD5S2","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing device. It plugs right into the micro-USB port on your phone (where you plug it in to recharge it) and presto! You have thermal images. I did have to download the app first, and in fact, if I have one complaint it is that the device did not come with any instructions at all. To use it, you simply open the app and you can start checking things out.As an example of how useful this camera is, this is my front door. I live in Wisconsin. I think you can see the obvious problems. I have cold air coming in all around the door, through the window above the door, and through my switch plates next to the door. I have always known cold air was getting in, because I can feel the draft, but this is awful.According to the website, the following android devices are compatible with the android version I have:Samsung Galaxy S3Samsung Galaxy S4Samsung Galaxy S5Samsung Galaxy Note 2Samsung Galaxy Note 3Samsung Galaxy Note 4Samsung Galaxy Note EdgeMotorola Moto X (1st and 2nd gen)Motorola Moto GThe camera comes with a nice protective case with a metal ring so you can attach it to a lanyard. The case snaps securely shut and the camera fits inside snugly. I am very happy with this thermal camera, and I highly recommend it if heating or cooling costs are an issue for you.

"I love this film, and except for a small bit of romance thrown in, it is all history and action, focusing on the actions of the British pilots and high command, but not ignoring the German pilots and high command. This was filmed back in a day when filmmakers still had access to German aircraft, and the actual planes make a big difference over the modern use of CGI. It doesn't hurt at all that the film has an all-star cast, the likes of which would be too expensive to assemble today.Besides the top-billed Michael Caine, there is Trevor Howard, Harry Andrews, Curd Jrgens, Ian McShane, Christopher Plummer, and Laurence Olivier as Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding.The movie is beautifully filmed, well-paced, the acting above any criticism, and the score is one of the best, and the action sequences are spectacular, even given the improvements in CGI explosions since 1969 (nothing, I am sure, George Lucas couldn't fix). I saw this movie in the theater with my father in 1969, and it has always been one of my favorite films of that decade.

I listen to it as background music when I am writing, because even the music from the action sequences is not jarring, as is so often the case with soundtracks. My one complaint is that I discovered that there is a longer version of the soundtrack available on iTunes, a fact I only discovered a day or two after downloading this version of the soundtrack from Amazon. The iTunes version has an additional 13 tracks. One of these missing tracks is ""Crater Lake,"" which is some of the most beautiful music in the film, where Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) returns to his secret refuge. How this piece could have been excluded from the soundtrack is beyond me.

"Fire and Movement: The British Expeditionary Force and the Campaign of 1914 by Peter Hart is an absolutely splendid book, readable and accessible. And most importantly of all, it challenges many of our long-held assumptions - that is, things we are certain we know - about the First World War. And what better time to examine the first critical year of 1914 than the war's centennial?If you are familiar with Peter Hart's The Great War: A Combat History of the First World War (2013) then you know what to expect.  In The Great War, Hart challenged the idea that nobody came up with any new ideas about how to fight the war, and he continues that thesis in Fire and Movement, though focused now on the British Expeditionary Force, or BEF.Not only that, but he demolishes the belief held by many that the BEF trounced the Germans at the Battle of Mons, in the opening stages of the German advance across Belgium and into Northern France. In fact, Hart tells us, far from being mowed down in droves, German casualties were actually fewer than the British. The truth of the matter is that the British were not prepared to fight the war they in which found themselves, and this is never more true than of the commander of the BEF, Sir John French, who seemed to think he walked upon a Napoleonic battlefield.The account is bolstered by the accounts of those who actually fought in these battles, from Sir John French on down to the lowest private. Most of it is told from the British perspective, but there are episodes as seen from the German ranks as well as the French. These accounts provide clear and compelling evidence that many of those things we have long held to be true, are anything but.Hart carries us through the dust-up at Mons, through the haphazard British retreat to the Battle of the Marne, the Battle of the Aisne, the Race to the Sea, and then on to Ypres and the inevitable stalemate and the Christmas Truce. Hart takes us not only through the battles themselves, but into the trenches, giving us a firsthand look at what life was like for the men condemned to fight this war.He tells us of experiences with new technologies, like the airplane and the wireless, and the halting but determined efforts of visionaries to employ these new technologies as well as the stubborn refusal to employ them by the more conservative and hidebound officers who did not realize that the day of the cavalry was passing before their eyes.Through it all we see that the British were not the heroes of myth (though there was certainly heroism enough) and the Germans were neither the monsters nor the perfect military machine, though they were by far the more skilled of the armies involved. There was good and bad on both sides, atrocities committed by British and German alike. Hart tries to avoid hindsight as he presents his case, providing the evidence in the context of the war itself, though he provides some worthwhile observations in his Epilogue.If you enjoyed The Great War, you will enjoy Fire and Movement, and likewise, if you are interested in the First World War, you will benefit from the clear-headed observations of Peter Hart, as he brings to life the war that in large part is still responsible for the world we find ourselves living in today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUD56TV63ROMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199989273#wasThisHelpful","RUD56TV63ROMX","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not sure what the fuss it about with this dispenser. While it is nice - in both function and appearance - it is not great. It is certainly not worth $12.99.This is what is advertised (my comments in parentheses):Easy, one-handed dispensing of soap or lotion (isn't any dispenser one-handed?)Generous opening for easy refilling (granted, the opening is wide and that's a plus and the lid is easy to screw on and remove)Sized to fit on bathroom or kitchen sinks (it fits comfortably beside my kitchen faucet)Non-skid base prevents slipping (there is no non-skid base. It is simply the same material as the rest of the container)10 oz capacity (10 oz is okay with me. I buy Method in a bag and what remained in my old dispenser about filled this one up)The best thing I can say about this dispenser is that the opening is larger so pouring is easy but honestly, pouring from a bag of Method isn't all that hard in a cheap dispenser. And while the lid attaches easily and is also easy to remove, I never had a hard time with the cheap ones. I suppose if you have arthritis is might be an improvement but I have no way to test that assumption.By the way, I saw another review that said the soap does not always come out. I thought that was going to be a problem for me as well. I ended up pumping about 30 times to get the soap to come out, which seems excessive to me. If I have any problems down the road, I will not them here.Update [12.10.14] I previously stated that ""I certainly would not pay $12.99 to buy more of these.""

"I ordered this keyboard as an alternative to my Belkin, which I use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.3. My thinking was that the Belkin makes my tablet rather heavy to carry around. Sure, it folds around the tablet like a case and can be opened up to support the keyboard while you type or watch videos or a film or whatever, but the weight can be off-putting when you want to hold it. I thought the Mad Catz would provide way to keep the tablet in a lighter protective case while taking no more time to set up for typing. That's essentially what I got. So far so good. It also paired quite easily with both my phone and my tablet.The first thing you will notice is that the new keyboard is very small and weighs almost nothing.If you take it out of its protective sleeve (a neat feature) and set it atop the Belkin, it's about the same length and only about half the width. This means that the keys are small and more closely spaced. There is not a lot of difference, about a half-inch on the Belkin and 1/8"" of an inch less than that on the Mad Catz, but when you're talking small keys, that 1/8 inch can make a big difference, especially if, like me, you have large fingers. It makes for clumsy typing.I am a fairly fast typist, about a hundred wpm, so I know where the keys are and can do a sort of modified ""hunt and peck"" on my Belkin, not really resting my fingers over the keys which are already too small for them. I can't do this as easily on the Mad Catz and I make more mistakes. The back lit keyboard makes up for this to a degree, because now I can type in the dark, but it's a trade-off I can't easily rate. It certainly isn't enough of an argument to discount the Mad Catz for the reasons I shall explain below.One thing that Mad Catz has that the Belkin does not is mouse buttons and a very tiny track (OFN) pad. You can left or right click your imaginary mouse on the keyboard and move the cursor around on the OFN sensor, which is right between them. This is a nice feature and allows you to navigate your touch screen without having to touch it.The Mad Catz also comes with a folding device stand. The battery holds a 30-hour charge, and it comes with a Micro USB charge cable.The device stand is nice. I can put my Samsung Galaxy S4 on it, even while it is in its Otterbox protective case and it stays put. More amazingly, I can put my tablet on the device stand even inside its Belkin keyboard case. That's really something. That also means that I can haul my Mad Catz along with me along with the Belkin and use whichever is most useful at the time (for example, in a dark room I'd choose the Mad Catz). So amazing versatility.Let's face it - no little keyboard is going to be as easy to type on as a full-size keyboard so you have to choose based on various factors that have nothing to do with ease of typing, and the Mad Catz wins handily where these are concerned. Other than size, which as I say, you really have to set aside because they're all going to be small, it really has no negatives. And it's small enough to fit inside my tablet bag, a Solo Storm Collection Universal 10-Inch Tablet Sling.Let's face it, I love it.Just a quick recap below:Positives:SmallLightBack lit keyboardDevice standMouse buttonsOFN sensorAble to pair up to four devices and switch between themNegatives:(Small)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDKT3SKJPTI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LATX6KG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDKT3SKJPTI5","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Turtle Beach ""Heroes of the Storm"" gaming headset is a fine headset for either gaming or just listening to music. It comes with 50mm speakers, a high-sensitivity microphone, and in-line controls. The mic is detachable and you can plug it in and pull it out of the socket as needed. The only disadvantage to this feature lies in the danger of misplacing the mic.Because I previously reviewed the Turtle Beach X12 amplified stereo gaming headset, I will compare the two here. Keep in mind as I do that the X12 is available from Amazon for $40.99 while the Heroes headset, also from Amazon, is $79.99. I suspect quite a bit of the price with the latter is attached to the aesthetics and adaptability of the headset.The X12 is engineered for XBOX 360 but is also compatible with pc gaming. The X12, like the Heroes of the Storm headset, features 50mm speakers and inline controls.  The advantage here is with the X12 controls, which allow you to  control both game and chat volume and bass boost, as well as muting the mic. The Heroes of the Storm controls,on the other hand, allow only the control of volume and muting the mic. I do think it is nice to be able to separate chat from game volume.The X12 mic is not removable but you can just swivel it up out of the way when not in use. I don't see one as superior to the other in this regard; it's really just a matter of preference, though as I say, I don't have to worry about losing the X12's mic.The biggest difference between these two headsets that I can discern (besides price) is that the X12 headset can be used for XBOX 360 but also with the pc, while the Heroes of the Storm headset is for pc/Mac and mobile gaming and lacks the XBOX 360 Talkback cable. Because the X12 is for console gaming, it also has a much longer cable, 16 feet compared to the 8-foot Heroes cable. I have to admit the 16-foot cable, while nice to have depending on how close your TV is to your chair, is often annoyingly in the way while using it with a computer, forcing you to gather it up and bind it with the attached Velcro strap.The Heroes of the Storm headset is also a licensed Blizzard product and can be used with various character ear plate skins available from Turtle Beach for about $25, in case you prefer Spiderman or Thor or another game to Heroes of the Storm. I don't personally care what is on the ear plate but if you do this might be a selling point for you. I'm just interested in ear sets that work.Quality-wise, there seems to be little difference between the two headsets. I do think I detect a little bit of static or background noise with the X12 that is not apparent with the Heroes headset, but the quality of the music/sound effects seems to be about the same. My ear, at any rate, cannot discern any other difference except in the level of bass, which, as I say, cannot be controlled with the Heroes of the Storm headset. As I'm not big on lots of bass, this isn't a big deal to me. Overall, the balance of treble and bass in the Heroes headset seems very good.I do think the X12 headset is more comfortable on top of the head. The headband is broader and feels like it has more padding, or maybe the pressure is just more broadly distributed. I am barely conscious of its presence, while I can always feel the Heroes headset atop my head.The Heroes headset does have deeper ear cups, an inch of padding compared to a half-inch on the X12, which I think blocks out room sounds better, and there the Heroes headset is definitely more comfortable. It's a trade off and you can't have everything, apparently but comfortable ear cups are a must if you game for long periods or listen to music while doing homework or even reading.One big plus is that the ear cups on the Heroes headset rotate far more than those on the X12, which barely wiggle at all, making them more comfortable to wear around your neck when not in use (they won't dig into your neck like the X12's ear cups do). This latter feature is no small thing if you need to pull them off to answer the phone or have a conversation.If you're a gamer these are a very nice pair of headsets to have, and they're not terribly expensive when you consider how much you could end up paying for high-end headsets. These suit all my gaming needs and then some and yes, the X12s are cheaper, but I will probably pass the X12s along to my son and keep these for myself simply because they are more comfortable when everything is taken into account.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSR9LSWFT9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVQQHNM#wasThisHelpful","RZSR9LSWFT9X","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this House of Marley Liberate speaker. I mean, it's awesome, and for so many reasons. The sound is pure and clear, and without the slightest hint of distortion, even when the music is turned up very loud.It took a matter of seconds to make the Blue Tooth connection between my phone and the speaker (and after you turn it off, just pressing the power button hooks them right back up again) and proceeded to listen to some music I had stored on my phone, and then to watch some music videos online. The sound was incredible, just as it was for the movie trailers I watched next.The Liberate is small and light but has a good solid feel to it, and because it's so small you can put it about anywhere, which means I can take it from room to room and always have music with me. It has a rechargeable battery, a USB port hidden in the back on one side (an auxiliary jack for audio devices on the other) and comes with a cable for charging.It's an attractive unit and I don't mind the idea of it sitting on my shelf or desk (or anywhere else) making beautiful music. It is easily worth the asking price.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X01OE0J0J37V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC27UF8#wasThisHelpful","R1X01OE0J0J37V","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is truly old school history. By that, I mean the author, Gordon Corrigan, is English and has clear anti-French biases which he never denies (he writes, for example, that ""I cannot hide my conviction that England's demands on France were lawful and justified""). I'm sure many a French historian would disagree, and it is difficult for a historian to make such claims and hope to have his claims to be impartial in the telling of the story taken seriously. I mean, this is a man who has never quite gotten over the loss of France. A real eye-opener for an American.Also, this is not a modern history from the bottom, a story about individuals, about civilians or private soldiers. It is a history written by a military man of military campaigns told from the top down. It is full of heroes, mostly English (Joan of Arc gets short-shrift from the author). A Great and Glorious Adventure is an unapologetic flag-waver of a history book: Consider his statement that ""the Hundred Years War as a great adventure, and a great and righteous cause."" People don't talk like this anymore. Especially about war.For me, sitting here in the United States, this is like an American author writing about the American Revolution not in a detached way as a straightforward history, but damning our English enemies for their infamy. It was over 200 years ago. I wasn't there. No Englishman alive today was there.For Corrigan, the events he writes about are half a millennium the past. Part of me wants to shout, ""Get over it!"" But I recognize that we in America lack the long history between our country and another, especially a history so bitter. The subject is, after all, a series of wars that went off and on for a century or so.For all that, this book is a splendid read and a rousing good yarn, even for an American like me. This is true not only because of the exciting events he describes but the way in which Corrigan describes them. He writes well and provides a wealth of interesting tidbits along with the accounts of battles and campaigns (like the fact that horses are unable to vomit). So I smile, absorb it, and read along. It is difficult to not become enthused like a schoolboy. It made me want to watch Kenneth Branagh's Henry V again.If I have a complaint at all it is about the maps, which are rudimentary at best and not worthy of a military history. Several of the regional maps are mostly blank and white, with a river or two and some scattered towns thrown in. Yes, the towns marked match references in the text, battles, sieges, and so forth, but could we have more detail? Routes of march? Castles? Deployment of forces? Or even more geographical features? It is difficult, looking at them, to get a sense of how the campaigns played out. The battle maps, at least, are better.In the end, if you are interested in the subject, want a recent analysis that is also a gripping narrative, and are willing to put up with the historian cheering one side on over the other, I dare say you will enjoy this book. I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5SFVBIBKNYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605985791#wasThisHelpful","R1K5SFVBIBKNYF","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Steampunk story filled with mystery and intrigue, not to mention some magic and romance. It is not, however, in your face Steampunk. There is the requisite airship, important to any Steampunk adventure, but magic comes more to the forefront. I am a fan of Steampunk and I will say up front I am not disappointed. Magic is fun too.The main character, Octavia Leander, is a medician, a healer, and a very gifted one at that. She is in the middle of a war between civilization and the wild, less refined parts of their world. Octavia thinks that she is being put on assignment by her mentor at the academy to a city that has fallen to a wide spread plague-like disease. They are desperate for medical assistance there, which calls to her on a personal level. She embarks on a trip in an air vessel and suddenly encounters Clockwork Daggers, or assassins for the crown, who claim they are only trying to protect her against those that would kidnap her for their own reasons.During the journey her roommate is brutally attacked and nearly dies, and she herself is nearly killed as someone pushes her out of the window.  The air ship is taken over by the ""bad guys"" who want her to help their people in the wild areas, rather than proceeding to the town she was assigned.In the end there is attraction and love, friendship, hatred, death, destruction, heroism, secrets, lies, betrayal and truth that is hard to accept. Enough, in other words, for any fan of speculative fiction.The characters are sympathetic and well developed. The story is gripping and engaging and it is difficult to put aside once it is started, and that is, after all the best measure of a book, the inability to set it down and the impossibility of leaving it there once you do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2494JO2NINZE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062313843#wasThisHelpful","R2494JO2NINZE6","A3E7YWI8VV7VCV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E7YWI8VV7VCV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this light. I have night lights throughout my house because I have a two year old and we are just bed training and he wakes up at night sometimes and I don't ever want him to feel scared if he can't see. So I have this light right next to his bed. I have it stuck right to the wall next to his bed, so when he gets up it turns on immediately. It's bright enough to light his whole room. The sensor on it is very sensitive which I like because it picks up the motion from across the room. This way he never has to walk in the dark if he is going back to his bed either. The light is pretty bright and dim at the same time. I like the shape of it to. Izyk calls it his little star. The light comes with a self adhesive sticker that sticks to the light and the wall. It would come off easily without messing up the paint to. All in all we both love this light and I would absolutely recommend it. It could be used in any room of the house.

"Carbon Monoxide detectors are so important to have in every room in your house. Especially if you live in a older house or if you have gas to cook with like I do.. We have one in every room. We started out with those cheap ones that didn't have a screen on it to see what your actual levels are. So once I found these I was happy and had to get one. These are great because like I said it shows you the levels right on the digital screen. I really love this feature. I now have a digital one in every room. About three days after I got this one we had a scare when it went off. I immediately called the fire dept to have them come check it out. We live in a super old house. They came out and said the levels were high because of the stove. So we had to get it fixed. I am so grateful for this detector.

"I purchased this portable bed for my 4 year old granddaughter's visit. It's OK, but nothing I'd want her to sleep on for more than one or two nights. There is no mattress or even padding of any kind on the flat sleep surface. I went out and bought foam padding (another $27!) to put underneath the ""sheet"" that comes with the cot, just to soften it up a bit for her. The bed seems sturdy, but unless the child is laying on it, the legs do not actually ""lock"" into place -- it's the body pressure that keeps them down. And be sure and check the bed's measurements! It's smaller than I anticipated and I don't think anyone over the age of 5 would fit on it. We'll keep it to use for a camping cot for the younger grandchildren, but I certainly wouldn't want to put a child on this for any extended period of time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PV144RBMZBZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H1MRJO#wasThisHelpful","R2PV144RBMZBZ1","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have an 18 foot daysailer, and this cover fits beautifully. Husband has used all kinds of tarps and bungy cords, braced in the middle to prevent sagging, but the don't even compare to how well this HydroPro boat cover fit and protected our boat. Even on the windiest days, the cover stayed tight and the interior of the boat stayed dry. It took two people to put the cover on, but it went on quickly and securely. We haven't had snow yet, so I can't comment on whether the cover sags under the weight of snow, but I will come back and edit if it does.

A very small amount goes a long way, and when you add water it foams beautifully. My skin feels more clean and definitely less dry.

"I picked up this set for my 4 year old granddaughter, and I do think she'll like it, if for no other reason than it comes with so many accessories to add to the walls of the studio you build. The magnetic pieces are easy to put together and stay in place, which was a worry, since 4 year olds get so frustrated with pieces that don't stay put. The set is quite vibrant in colors and quite large overall. It is easy to see how imagination will come into play with this toy, but I would have liked to seen just a few more accessories that can be placed in the ""rooms"" rather than just on the walls - ie some furniture or sinks or a table and chair. But overall its a nice toy for your pet-loving child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKDVYE6GZZ8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SP8KMI#wasThisHelpful","R3RKDVYE6GZZ8K","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The color is a dark smokey gray. Sleeve length is perfect - not so long it hangs over the hands, but long enough to cover the wrists.

"I purchased the new 5th generation Kindle Fire recently. It is so light and so thin that I knew immediately I would need a case to protect it. This NuPro case is very sturdy and provides the protection I was hoping for. It closes with a magnetic/invisible closure. I very much like the fact it has a stylus loop, which so many cases do not. I tend to watch either cable TV or Amazon Prime shows on my Kindle Fire while doing housework, so the horizontal stand is very useful and easy to use. This case has a look of one far more expensive - especially this Navy blue.

"Rosacia seems to be genetic in our family - my grandmother, aunts and mother had it, and now I do. I was looking forward to using this cream as both a daily moisturizer and sunscreen. However, I find this cream to be VERY heavy and dense - more like a pancake make-up than a sunscreen. Yes, it covers the red and pink in my cheeks. But it is SO thick that it also spotlights any wrinkles or indentations anywhere on your face, especially around the eyes and mouth. Not a plus in my book. Does it do what it says? Cover up spotting and discolored areas on your face? Yes it does. And I believe it also acts as a sunscreen.

"This At-a-Glance 2016 Monthly Planner is OK, but not great. The planner cover is a thin coated cardstock, and bends very easily. Will such a flimsy cover used on a daily basis, will the Planner make it through a year? I'm not so sure. Each month is done in an open 2 page format, and allows for a fair amount of space for each day, but these pages are also of a lesser quality paper, and if you bear down with an ink pen or write with a Sharpie, the writing is going to be seen on the next month's page. The ""Contact"" area is very no-frills - simple lined boxes to write names and addresses. Overall, I'm just not that impressed with this product.

The cover is a faux leather-covered thick cardstock. Pleasant in appearance with its white lettering and blue edging.

I needed a surge protector that had an on/off switch so I can turn all the machines off easily. It also offers sliding covers over the outlets, which is perfect for when the smaller grandchildren are in the room with me. And of course, the equipment warranty (up to $100,000) would be much appreciated if necessary! Sewing machines and electronic equipment are not cheap to replace!

"I am absolutely turning into a big fan of Belkin products. I have several and have always been pleased with how easy they are to set up. I am NOT technologically advanced, believe me, so the Belkin's products ease of use is important to me. This little keyboard is no exception. Within minutes of opening the box, with just a short time to plug the keyboard in and charge the battery, I had it up, running and connected to my Galaxy S5. It is important to read the directions (actually, just a few illustrations) and do the set up in the correct order as given.The keyboard is small, but not uncomfortably small. I find it very comfortable to use. It is also lightweight. It is protected by the hard cover that ""snaps"" into place, which is also the way to turn the keyboard OFF and ON. As other reviewers have mentioned, I do wish it came with some kind of case just for storage purposes.This product has given me a whole new way to use my Android smartphone! In the past I would put the phone down and move to my laptop if I wanted to type anything more than a few words in response to an email, or message, etc. No more. I keep the keyboard handy and just pop my phone onto the keyboard, and I'm all set.To me, the keyboard feels quite sturdy, and I'm more than impressed with the battery life (the box says six months between charges!).

"All-Clad is a name I trust, and this extra large kitchen towel does not disappoint. It's truly extra absorbant and extra large. The design has teals, dark browns and light browns with a coffee motif. I've washed the towel and do not notice any fading or shrinking.However - my reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5: The towel came with two of those plastic T-shaped clips on each end, obviously to hold the towel together at the store. I used scissors to clip off these plastic pieces, and lo and behold, they both left a rather obvious hole in the weave of the fabric! After washing, this hold enlarged very slightly, and the white cotton threads of the under fabric now show through the dark design. For the price of this towel, those fabrics should have recovered and the hole closed into the weft of the threads. I am slightly disappointed, though the holes are not noticeable if you don't know they are there. But still... this shouldn't have happened to a quality cotton towel like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H1KIERGBMOMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABS3NU#wasThisHelpful","R2H1KIERGBMOMP","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually my second set of Melissa and Doug PlayDoh stamping set. I bought my first set 7 years ago for my now 9 year old grandson, and we used it several times a week. The best review of all - it was used frequently and we still have the set and it's in as good shape as it was the day I bought it. VERY DURABLE! No cheap parts! Takes the banging and rough play of a 2 year old.I've picked up this second set to send to my granddaughter.

"I'm a vegetable gardener and flower gardener and have long heard of the benefits of using Neem Oil in the garden. Last year I had a terrible problem with aphids -- clouds and clouds of aphids on my potato plants, tomatoes, green peppers and more. This year I started using this Miracle-Grow organic NATURE'S CARE product, and have not had any insect problem at all. I spray my plants once a week and, so far, it seems to keep the insects away. It's still early in the growing season (early June as I write this), and the bugs hit harder as the summer goes along, but I'm hopeful. I am pleased with the ingredients and the fact that you can spray right up to the day of harvest. (Personally, I will have a week between spray and harvest, and wash my vegetables well!) Easy to apply in the spray bottle, but I will be looking to see if I can purchase this product as a concentrate. Overall, so far, I recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YD61HSSN2VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZOBM6#wasThisHelpful","R1YD61HSSN2VH","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used this Artscape Window Film on the two long, narrow windows I have on each side of my front door. We've owned this house for 28 years, and for 28 years I have hated the fact that people at my front door peer inside while they're waiting for me to answer the door. This window film absolutely solved that problem! I'm so happy!A few tips. Use a VERY sharp craft knife or razor blade to cut the film to fit, and expect two to three passes of the knife to get all the way through both the film and the thick backing.Don't ""soak"" your window down with the soap/warm water mixture as instructions lead you to believe. Give just a general overall light coating of spray.Before using the squeegee (or credit card, which I found worked better), use one hand to hold the film in place at the top, as you gently squeegee downwards. Then use a cotton towel to wipe down edges and bottom.Once you're happy with the placement and see no bubbles, let dry for about 30 minutes and check your window from both sides. Those little bubbles hide in the design. Go back over gently with the squeegee if you see any bubbles.The instructions are correct - you need to cut the film about 1/8th an inch smaller than your window measurement. The film needs that small area between edge of film and window to emit the excess water. It's OK. You won't even notice it once the film is up.I will say, the included squeegee is flimsy and fell apart before I'd finished even one window. I used a stiff credit card and it worked fine.I have double pane windows. My one disappointment is that from the outside, you can barely see the pretty design of the film. But no matter - people can't peek in my front door windows anymore, and that was what was important to me.Overall, I highly recommend this product!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZIZEC3KG3X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UALS6QY#wasThisHelpful","RQZIZEC3KG3X4","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 9 year old grandson who has been through a real difficult year. When this Worry Eater arrived in the mail, he opened the package with me and I explained that if ""someone"" had worries, they could write it down on a slip of paper, and put it in the Worry Eater's mouth and the Worry Eater would take care of the worrying from that point on. Since my grandson is all boy and 9, he's not prone to liking stuffed animals anymore. But when I asked him if we should give the Worry Eater to his Mom, or if he'd like to keep it, his little eyes lit right up and he asked if he could keep it. Sometimes kids have stresses they either shouldn't or don't know how to deal with... This Worry Eater is perfect for that situation. He is soft and lovable, but without a ""baby-ish"" look to him. He is well made with what appeared to be quite a sturdy zipper/mouth. If you have a little one that just needs a chance to have a better day, this might just be the ticket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWCAT62VQ83UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZ36JLK#wasThisHelpful","RWCAT62VQ83UY","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this HONEY CITRUS PEPPER sauce was not what I expected, I do like it. I expected a sweet honey pepper flavor. What I got instead was a very soy sauce-based product that is very Asian inspired. In reading the ingredients, I can see why. First, water. Second, third, and fourth ingredients are sugar or a form of sugar. Fifth ingredient is soy sauce. ""Dry Honey"" is next, then a thickener and then orange juice concentrate, lemon concentrate, vinegar and further down the line spices...  So the flavor is a sweet soy sauce flavor. I get NO pepper taste at all and very very limited citrus flavor.That said... I baked skinless chicken thighs in the oven, and when they were about half-way cooked, I basted them in this sauce. I basted again 10 minutes later and again at serving. They were good! I'd planned on having potato salad with the chicken, but because it was SO Asian tasting, I switched over to rice, and I'm glad I did.Despite the misnomer in the name of the product, it's still tasty and would make an excellent dipping sauce for chicken wings. I do wish they'd increase both the honey and citrus flavors, but it is what it is.. and it is still good. I'm looking forward to trying it on pork chops or ribs cooked on the barbeque.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9KM2SNIY0G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFO8JY#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9KM2SNIY0G5","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I waited to review this toy until my 9 year old grandson visited, to get an ""expert's"" opinion.First, the instructions are TERRIBLE. Even for an experienced Lego builder (where instructions are illustrations rather than words), putting this together was difficult at best. It took the two of us about 30 minutes, and I think that's a lot for such a small item with so few pieces. There definitely needs to be more explanation about the warm water/cold water method of getting these cars to change color. We both found it confusing, having never used the color change cars before.Of course, the launcher never works the way you expect it to. The pieces don't release easily to launch the car. That was a disappointment for my grandson. I've actually come to expect it from modern toys that promise a lot -- they rarely deliver.The cars, once we figured out the icy water vs hot water thing, were fun - for about 20 minutes. I left the set out for him to go back and play with on his own, and he  never did.The set is messy. Do yourself a favor and set it up outside. Water gets everywhere no matter how hard you try to contain it.If I had to buy this set, I'd buy only the cars and use some plastic bowls to change the colors back and forth. The ""lab"" seems superfluous to me, and held no interest for my grandson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPWAUOE4AUC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD3MQ6E#wasThisHelpful","R3DPWAUOE4AUC7","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this to my daughter, because she is notorious for NEVER putting her phone down and ALWAYS losing her bank card and/or ID. This is just perfect for her. She doesn't like to carry a purse, so this Wallet Case carriers her bank card, license, and a bit of cash. The fabric of the case has a nice leather-like feel, and the case is sturdy. It fit her Galaxy S6 perfectly. She liked the small slot at the bottom of the credit card pocket that allows you to easily push the cards out without having to pull at the pocket. I would have liked to see either a second pocket or a slightly deeper pocket that would allow her to carry a bit more cash, but she thought it was fine as is. The ""kickstand"" is a tiny disappointment -- you place one of your credit cards in a slot and use that to stand the phone up. Surely a slide-out kickstand would not have been difficult to include.Overall, a great concept, a quality product, and good protection for the Galaxy S6","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21OMZVQH6SOJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNOB7WS#wasThisHelpful","R21OMZVQH6SOJL","A1OA65HXZIINHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OA65HXZIINHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have wanted a security camera for awhile now. I have a grandson who feels he is ready to stay home alone for short periods of time, and I want to be able to check on him if and when I decide to let him do so. This Motorola Home Monitoring camera was unbelievably easy to set up right out of the box. Plug it in, turn it on, download the app on your phone and set up an account, hit the ""pair"" button and poof! You're done and receiving the video directly on your phone or on your computer. It couldn't have been easier. The phone features are great - the app lets you pan left and right, up and down, or lets you speak into your phone to be heard at the camera site. It let's you snap a picture or video, and save the same. The camera's video is clear and easy to see, both on the phone and on the PC. This is exactly what I wanted.

"For starters, I needed something for a quick pick up ever since we got rid of the carpets and changed to wood floors. Our vacuum has rotating brush so I was afraid it would scuff the floors and besides, the pet hair would sometimes float away until I catch them in the corners. I saw this on sale in a popular red dot logo place...so for 10 bucks why not! Here's the run down...Pros:- light weight- easily converts from stick vacuum to hand held- dust filter easy enough to clean and/replace- not terribly loud, not whisper quiet but I heard louder from similar vacsCons:- would like a little more power to it- only cane with I'm the crevice tool but then again what do u really expect for this price and model- cord could be longer but adequate enough- if they put a little rubber sweep on the bottom of the wide floor attachment,  I think it would help with the power but also be a better floor dust or fine particle sweeper/suckeredI would buy it again if I had a coupon or sale price. Then again 20 bucks isn't that bad for this either. U think for an added 5 or 10 bucks the other similar competitors may suit the needs depending on what gives the edge....the major point for me is I would've have love a little more power either from the motor or just that simple rubber strip underneath the floor attachment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNDX885ECPDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KCO96C#wasThisHelpful","RVNDX885ECPDQ","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was upgrading my desktop wireless internet so I began to look around for economical solutions. I originally am upgrading from an old Beklin G usb adapter which served me well and is still functioning. However, with the change in my job and need for faster uploads/downloads of bigger files, I needed to capitalize on the max speed of my internet service. After looking around and comparing, I decided on this. True there are plenty of generics out there for cheaper however I have also read mixed reviews. It looks like if you are lucky, your generic will perform awesome and not fizzle in a coupe months. Then the unlucky ones, had horrible issues. I went the middle ground. I have used and still use TPLink products and I have to say I am happy with their products overall. The brand is solid yet the prices are not inflated because of the ""big name tax"". So let's get to it:Pros:- nano size, barely sticks out of the port when plugged in. I'd say it was just enough to get your fingertips to grip onto to pull out of the port if needed- good signal strength. I was concerned about the signal from such a tiny adapter but surprisingly, this got better (if not the same on bad days - other wifi, vacuum running etc.) signal than my old full sized USB adapter.- gold plated contacts- comes with a mini install disc, easy install and even my older desktop recognized it and ran the wizard for it...no fussCons:- nothing earth shattering...depending on how your USB port is mounted, you may or may not be able to see the ""thinking"" light. I don't know if it bothers you or not but I prefer to since I like to know if it is working or frozen during downloads of massive files. Again, not so much this nano's issue but more of your device's design. If it was me I would've put the light at the top/end so one can see it easily vs the side where it is now.I would buy this again if I ever needed more. My neighbor now had trouble getting around so I actually will be ordering 2 more so I can give them the freedom of access anywhere in their house and not risk falling and breaking his neck to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35H1TKR63B33U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008IFXQFU#wasThisHelpful","R35H1TKR63B33U","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Need to get rid of piles of papers? This is it! The Neatdesk scanners cost 4 times more and essentially do the same thing. I will say that the loading tray angle is better on many of the other full size scanners but when it feeds and scans, this thing keeps up with the rest. How good? It's good enough that I shut my wife up with the constant nagging about ""let's hire a maid"" but it still doesn't resolve the documents and paperwork we need unless we want a stranger sorting through our stuff...DuH. It's about the dimension of a carton of cigarettes and just heavy enough not to tip over yet not fee like lugging a bar of gold.So let's get to the breakdown:Pros:- compact size...the lid flip around to wrap itself in a easy, clean portable form- capable of wireless hook up!! It was easy and quick...I ditched the USB cable and it's as liberating as going commando- touch screen menus- quick and quiet operation- the price in comparison is awesome (range about 150 give or take) vs 400 bucks- feed lid has sensor (magnetic?) so when you flip it closed it can go into sleep mode/standby- overall build feels sturdy enough, I was concerned the lid would be flimsy and break easy but noCons:- The software is ok, not fancy and intuitive as some of the others but certainly not rudimentary or overcomplicated. Not a deal breaker at all- the the 2 little guides on the feed tray, can be tricky when trying to hold a 20 paper load or batch of wrinkled/fluffed papers. I found this out when I had to scan 4 months worth of daily daycare reports which are the carbonless couble copy type, so wrinkled they gave a little trouble feeding- no output tray/adapter - it will literally just spit out the documents just scanned..not a deal breaker but if you draw a face on the front it looks like it's throwing up paperSorry, didn't try the card scanner yet but it feeds from the back slot. Asides from that, I think if they readjusted the feed tray angle and gave it a better set of paper guiders, it'd be perfecto.

"works just as well as the OEM only the fabric is gray vs white. No big deal, it still collects (seemingly) the same amount of dust, pet hair and crumbs as the other did only at a fraction of the price. The seal material fits snugly into the vac with no problems.

"Update: 9/20/15 this thing just stopped working. One day it sputtered but after a few more presses of the button it worked right. By the end of the week, no response when you hit the button. I changed the batteries and all, the music works, the motor makes no noise what so ever. I emailed the company and still no response. It didn't last long did it? The kicker is that I didn't even use it everyday. It was when my son got a cold or runny nose. I changed 3 stars to 1 until I see what the company has to say.Original review:I have my reservations about all the nasal aspirators out there, but this one faired better than I expected. I am in the healthcare field and I can use the blue bulb syringes pretty effectively. However, when the baby is sick (and since daycare, he has been sick believe you me!) sometimes he just gets the never ending thick goo of mucus that only a strong suction can remove. I have tried the babycomfy (looks like an egg) and the ever popular baby Nosefrida and believe it or not, I and my wife have gotten sick from it a couple times each! Well, just look at the ""filter"" element...so I decided to try this. Let's get down to the nitty gritty:Please note: look at the pic, the suction part does separate as a whole ""pre-unit"". It then can be futher broken down into the silicone nozzle, the housing, the waste reservoir and then the o-ring seals if needed. You'll understand why I explained this when you get to the consPros:- plays 4 or 5 tunes- soft yet firm enough silicone tip to create a decent seal without hurting- removable parts for cleaning (but this will also be a con)- 2 AA batteries, no special button cell or whatever- love this: good and quick suction right from the press of the button! I was really worried about this aspect, I thought it maybe weak and needs time to build and by that time you know the baby's going to be unwieldy cranky but no! I'm surprised about this...this is a good procons:- limited waste space. By the time you get some boogie in there then try to flush it for a next pass...even a quick sip of water will already fill the waste container...which leads to...- removable to clean, nice, but you will be doing it often if you plan on more than one pass with a super quick flush to clear the suction way for a good second pass. I suppose you can just keep going for it but depending on the thickness of the boogie, it can clog or really diminish the next go.- the idea is novel, but when you hold the baby it angles the container. the waste (esp with water flushes) easily angles back into base of the 1st part of the aspirator. Again, fine if you just try to go at all attempts without a flush of water in between but as I have a habit of the flush from decades in healthcare, the small reservoir annoys me a little- cannot reposition or swivel to side if need be so if you can't suction baby close to vertical position, then you may not want to flush/clear in between...too meddlesome- kind of loud, can startle the baby...unless he/she is a really good sleeper, he/she will probably wake up if you try this during a napOverall, would I get this again...yes BUT ONLY if I didn't recently invent droplet filters for the babycomfy and nosefridas. With the babycomfy and nosefrida at least I can control the amount of force, duration and minimal noise (no motor rumbling by his face) - and now with my filter inserts I can protect myself from germy microdroplets/aerosols. Hopefully you may have better luck with this.Update: 10/10/15 So the manufacturer read my email, I must've pulled all the right serial numbers and viola! Next thing I knew, there was a tough gray shipping bag on my doorstep that had me wondering what in the world did my wife order. She didn't....Graco sent me a brand new replacement! I am happy to say *knock on wood* I'm back to cleaning his snot out in half the time and more efficiently than the bulbs.

Also comes with 1shovel, 1 rake and water can packed in that compartment- rolls smoothly, note it has ""tread"" pattern wheels of hard plastic so good and bad - I'll state the bad of this in cons- surprisingly articulate claw- steering wheel controls are easy to hit and speakers are louder than I thought - don't play this at 2 am- more sounds than I expected - there's a con see below- back rest so child does roll backwards and hits their head- swing arm clicks when turning- black lever is to raise/lower arm, yellow/metal lever is to activate grabber claw- steering and axle link is actually a think metal U link with a metal rod that you put a screw and bolt through when connecting the steering wheel- there is a tow loop underneath so I imagine you can put a leash on it and tow him/her aroundCons:- minimal assembly - need phillips screwdriver - not a deal breaker, the rest (claw unit and back rest) is click/snap in place.- no batteries included, you need to screw open the compartment under the steering wheel so put in batteries before assembling the wheel 2 AA- seat is thinner than i'd like but ok- raise/lower range is fairly limited since it is so close and adjacent to steering- The manufacturer apparently has no discretion when it comes to sounds categories. One of the backup sounds is an emergency siren...huh? The best one is the fact that one of the songs it plays, is ""frosty the snow man"" - yes...Frosty....the...snow....man....- also 2 buttons play the same songs. I wonder why one had a different icon that meant music tooOverall, considering these features and fun will probably not come close to this price point in your local stores, this is a great deal. Most ride-on toys are 20 bucks more with less features. My son loves this thing, even the accessories that came with it. He tried eating dinner with the hand shovel...yes, I know. It would be perfect if it was free shipping or just 5 or 10 more to offset that charge then the price point would be perfect (all things being fair).Update: he's still playing with this and it survived multiple operators at his 2nd bday party. A couple of ""those"" kids dragged it outside and even began trying to shovel real dirt and rocks with the grabber. Poor thing. I even had to cover the steering wheel, hose it off top to bottom, dry it and lysol it - oh yea, vacuum the inside since they stored dirt inside too YAY....and the thing is still alive. One of my top toy picks so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BTB14DCRCD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORQ9VL2#wasThisHelpful","R28BTB14DCRCD1","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure about the expectations of such a toy but you have to be somewhat realistic about the price and simple fact that it is a child's toy. I got it less than 40 bucks so that's not going to break the bank per say. Also, I would think you would expect such toys to be made of plastic that wasn't like a resin shed from home depot. I'm not sure if some people expect that type of build or what but realistically, it's not ""cheap"" plastic - it's appropriate enough. Yes, it will require a screwdriver but it's not rocket science. Perhaps I'm a handyman about it and some minor imperfections do not bug me as much but my set was delivered just fine, no issues with the assembly and all the parts fit like they should. My son is having a blast with it!  dimensions 25.9 x 13.9 x 9.8Pros:- fun, decent accessories with the set, 1 set of burger buns, a burger (no cheese?!), 1 hot dog bun, 1 hot dog, a spatula, tongs, plate and ketchup- at least for my kid, he's about 34"" tall and this set comes up to mid chest range so he's not stooping or reaching up.- countertop is thicker plastic and is in 3 pieces. The 2 sides get screwed onto the main (burner/grill) piece so it is secure.- cabinet storage is much more than enough room for the accessories and other stuff. Thick about the dimensions of say a small/medium-ish paper shredder or a carry on luggage - a tad less all around.- the sink faucet swivels and the on/off handle does as well- the burner knobs click when turned- stickers are crazy sticky so position them carefully the first time!Cons:- doors are flimsy in thickness of plastic compared to the other components but not a deal breaker. I can see why some people complained about the plastic nubs that are supposed to be the hinges but mine works...they're still in place after a night of opening and closing.- the plastic retaining push clips were slightly larger than the factory holes so I took the screwdriver and just took a few turns to enlarge the hole a tiny bit...guess what - perfect. Not a huge deal- I too had a little bit of looseness on the top grill cover...easy fix, take a hairdryer, warm the plastic and then push the plastic in a little. When the plastic cools, it retains the new ""tighter"" alignment and pop it back on. Snug as a bug in a rug - not a big deal at all- burger and hotdog buns are stiffer plastic so the patty does slip out easily, hot dog can fly out too but my son hasn't exactly tried to keep things on the plate either.I don't get overly critical with kid's toys. I expect that so I won't be overly critical given the price. The toy has got to be over priced and pretty cheesy for me to blast such a thing. That being said, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for this but I will say 30 is about right. Save a coupon or something and get it for about the 30 dollar mark. Otherwise, we find this reasonable and my son enjoys it. He stopped trying to play with the actual kitchen cabinets (for now) so that's good for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCK0NX4RTY5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGS0B7S#wasThisHelpful","RCK0NX4RTY5F","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want a dump truck toy that isn't the size of a real one in his/her room, then this is fine.Pros:- durable, sturdy plastic not flimsy- wheels roll nicely although can make a rumble on hardwood since it is treaded hard plastic wheels - shouldn't stop you from buying though- nice bright yellow colorCons:- maybe a design/dimension flaw but rolls around too easy if you are one hand lifting the bed to dump out (at least indoors on hardwood floors)- no edge to the back of the bed and no incline to the bed so if you are playing with sand or dirt, it will just spill outThose are kind of nit picking cons.

"it's basic and my 20 month old has fun with it.Pros:- no too big and not too small- durable enough- minimal parts to break (just the roof/hinged)- fits more blocks and little people in there than I thought- mega blocks pieces stack onto roof (kids like doing that for some reason) makes no sense to adults but so far my son wasn't the only that felt compelled to start stacking blocks on the roof.Cons:- wheels not as smooth rolling on hardwood esp for engineered wood floors or those with the factory protective coat- odd plastic hitch/piece in the middle under the bus, unsure why but if you have plush carpeting it will impede rolling on mid/high plush carpeting- the grille sticker was already peeling when out the box. Not a deal breaker but my son ate that lifted corner piece that didn't stick, thanks for his extra fiber MattelOverall, it's not bad. I think for the price compared to others found in the store, it isn't bad.

"Do not get this! I am in the field of healthcare and a father myself. This simply put, is just too darn stiff and non-functional. Compared to the ones we use on patients, this bulb is made of such stiff material that it will not easily suction anything out at all. You actually will have a tough time even squeezing the bulb even with the full hand. The bulb is not resilient and actually smaller in diameter than the hospital/ambulance type ones. I am surprised Red Cross would even put their name on this garbage.Honestly, don't even get the baby starter kit they sell. The better kit is the Safety First kit which has better quality tools and not to mention a better bulb. If you have a friend that works in the medical field or find it on ebay, buy the blue bulb syringe (Briggs or othe major medical brand ones). It should be just squishy enough but resilient enough to draw out the thicker strings of mucous.If you really need some suction or then there is also the Freida nose sucker but just mind that the ""filter"" is literally just a cylinder of sponge material. If you think about the micro droplets of moisture you would be sucking out of the baby's nose/sinuses from your own mouth....well, has anyone thought that before? The concept is nice but think about it. If the baby is sick and say has a chest cold, wouldn't you be sucking the germs into your own mouth?

"I've also seen some mixed reviews but this was on black friday special so for about 50 bucks or less, I sure gave it a shot. I need one in case the baby, not so baby anymore, needed to be entertained while in the stroller and maybe some other times where tantrums aren't recommended. Given that I wasn't sure how much use I would get from a portable since we already have the dual Insignias on the truck's headrests. I wasn't prepared to spend 80 or 150 bucks on one. I did a lot of research and here it is:Pros:- Battery is up to 4 hrs it claims, I've gotten a Wall-E and some sesame streets out of it...not bad- comes with charger for the car and home- decent screen, 9"" is a good compromise if you don't want a larger than headrest 10"" or tablet to lug around- lightweight- RCA jacks on the side, power has 3 settings (on/off/standby)- swivels all around to a flat position (however, it swivels only one way so don't break it going the opposite twist!)- simple enough functions, no added bells and whistles for it to break or malfunction. Workhorse...- sound is actually decent - surprisinglyCons:- no remote- screen is matte which the view and viewing angles are fine, I think a nice gloss screen may have enhanced the picture though but for the price, not bad- buttons are basic, cheapish but not deal breaker cheap- loading is a lift lid, thinner than I'd like but I've felt cheaper- case not so insulated: loud, sounds like robocop's coming to get you when loading and playing a discOverall, I can't complain like it was the end of the world for this. I paid a cheaper price on average for a workhorse player. I think if it was more than I paid, then I'd be a bit more sore at it. I think the fact that it has no case for the car/headrest, it may leave you wishing for a remote or a longer movie for convenience sake but again, not a dealbreaker. Don't pay towards the 80 dollar range though. That being said, I am satisfied with this and it has been about 3 months of bouncy car rides and freezing winter nights.

"I bought a RCA portable player 9"" during black friday but needed one of these so I wouldn't have to keep pulling the head mounted ones from the truck all the time. So let's cut to the pros and cons...Pros:- fit the RCA 9"" snugly.- does have multiple elastics all around with a velcro latch on top- openings do not interfere with speakers on most units- made of pleather? or some vinyl type material which is sturdy- strong elastic fastening for the headrest (which is also a con...see below)Cons:- can be a pain if you need to reach the DVD controls if it's on the front face on clam shell units, you have to slide the player out again so put in a 2 hr movie or something- Can be a pain if on/off is not side mounted- pain if power or rca inputs (if needed) is not mounted on the sides of a player- My biggest gripe: The elastic is very strong which mean it is bad for head rests that are elongated (i.e. Honda Pilots) or  if they are about 8 in in height or so. The strap is so strong you will have to give a good tug to lock the velcro. However, at the end of the day, it can crease or leave marks on the head rest because it is so darn tight. If you have a head rest hole, you can slip it through to decrease that pressure which I did with the pilot but my Acura TSX can't do it. I sandwiched it under the rest and lumbar and stuffed a washcloth between the strap to keep it from sliding through. Not the prettiest but it works and the player doesn't fall. I just needed something asap since the change of vehicles going to daycare. If you have a freely sliding head rest,, that idea probably won't work.Overall, for the money it's not bad at all. The design is not far off from the others so you will encounter most of the front panel access problems with them as well, but this is made with better materials in the 20 dollars range. If you have an older car (5yrs +) or simply have short headrests, this will work just fine. If you got funky, trendy ones, then you will have issues with strapping this. Can you find a creative solution? Sure...for me, the hand towel or a cylindrical foam cut to size and placed inside while sandwiching it down works for me. Otherwise, if you have some extra velcro strip or something like that to extend the strap length, that will do even better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2069S6RFTXIJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMCESS0#wasThisHelpful","R2069S6RFTXIJ0","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used many simply because of my job. I have used anyones from the ever popular Omron to  generics. First off, I prefer the arm vs finger or wrist because they tend to be more accurate and less prone to inaccurate readings due to positioning. This s oscillometric method, ranges 0mmHG - 300mmHG, pulse range 30 - 180 beats/min, claims accurate +/- 3mmHG and about 5% of pulse rate. Cuff is 8.6"" to 14.2"". Long story short:Pros:- lightweight, has rubber feet- good length of air hose- large numbered easy to read screen- simple functions, not overly complicated so you know it's a BP machine not a iPad- medium cuff, strong velcro and easy enough to strap with one hand- stores multiple users (up to 4)- FDA CE - claims it can detect irregular beats and WHO Classification indicator- nylon zip up carry caseCons:- no AC adapter included - uses DC 6V, 1000mA positive in, neg outside 2.1mm coaxial joint- 4 AA batteries claims to last about 2 mo at 3 tests per day- battery lid a little thin than I'd like but not a deal breaker- air line connection is just a plastic friction push-in type not like a twist lock or anything more secure but it holds so we'll seeOverall, consider most others charge the avg 20 to 50 bucks more and they do not claim FDA-CE. This is not overly complex and not bottom basic either. I think the complaints of inaccuracies must be taken with a grain of salt. Arm machines are more consistently accurate than wrist or finger but you need to make sure you place the cuff on properly and sit with arm relaxed and about heart height. The brachial artery (inner part of the bicep/arm just underneath the bicep muscle) should be in line or between the indexing lines marked clearly in white on the cuff. Otherwise you would get bad readings. So far it seems good surprisingly from a company that isn't as mainstream as I've known.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVK5AAZ6VL0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF04XFI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVK5AAZ6VL0S","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Best bang for the buck. I use these to backup some my favorite DVD movies and make multiples of my son's favorite DVDs. Thus, you can imagine for all those who have kids - lifesaver! I leave backup copies of his favorite DVDs in each car. These blanks seem to work just fine with all my different DVD players and burners. For example, my older Compaq Desktop burner, 3 yr old Gateway laptop, 6 yr old HP laptop, and HP elite have no issues reading and burning onto them. Reading: my XBox 360, Original Xbox, Insignia DVD/TV combo, Insignia portable DVD player and Pioneer in dash player read them just fine. I think maybe a few times the older xbox sputter a few places here and there but never froze on me. Considering how many Memorex blanks I used and ripped through, those are very low odds. I have been using this media for a while now and this is my 3rd spindle. There is a reason why I couldn't justify the price/performance of Verbatim, the fail read rate of Fuji (greenish hue) and very surprisingly Sony (I think they were too ""blue"" on the recording face and the more basic or older laser lens seem to have trouble reading those).

"After my wonderful cat decided to chew through my trusty nicad/nimh charger, which is kind of ok since it was time for an upgrade, I found this. I searched and compared and this seemed to be the most versatile and reviewed good consistent reviews. I also have purchased a lot of Tenergy nimh LSD batteries and they have been solid so why not give this a shot as well. Here's the low down:Pros:- Big blue status display- shows the battery in each compartment and the levels at present. Blinks each bar while charging and when done it stops blinking- good charge rate, no humming or buzzing- can charge each battery independently! Also of different size!!! Freedom!!!- Did I mention freedom to charge independently and different size in each compartment?? Yes? Good - thought I'd stress that again - Love that!- separate backlight button- separate discharge button for conditioning- will tell you if battery is suitable for charging or notCons:- flip top cover is good but mine seems finicky, it can ""stick"" even though I'm pressing the release button but perhaps it will break in after some more usage- like some of the other users said, USB takes over charging when in use so you can't charge usb and batteries at the same time. No biggie- sometimes when you first put the battery in, you may need to tap or give a little turn to the battery and then it'll seat and start charging. Not a big deal as other chargers of this type do it too, all my prior ones did too- does not charge nicadOverall, I am very happy with this charger! I would most definitely buy it again. Sad to see my old workhorse Radioshack charger go but this is a great upgrade at this price! The overall build is good, yet lightweight but I would try dropping it from a tall dresser too many times though.

The battery tester is included and it slides up and out of a molded in holder....it can be tough when new. Just shimmy otherwise you may grip and slip and break the tester arm.

"My favorite Kenneth Cole watch has a difficult back plate to remove. It is squarish and concaved with the pry point along the top instead of the side...who the hell thought that was a good idea. Of course, they also made the pry point ""sleek"" to match the match's cosmetics which means any case knife or opener barely fit in there. Thanks KC...So every time, I would have to overpay for the watch place to try and open it which sometimes they slipped and scratched the plate too. Enough is enough, I invested in this monster. It is compact enough but darn versatile. The center piston is for the watch itself, it has a nylon or plastic (green) positioner and the piston itself is spring loaded so the working height can adjust with the thickness of the watch. The side delrin/nylon holder has a notch with it does also rotate if needed. What you do is you put the watch in the center, insert the pry insert (which it comes with a few more different size/shape) and start cranking the ""jaws"" closed. As it closes, you make sure the height and the tip of the insert is aligned. Eventually when it's all in place and the insert bites on, a another turn of the knob will dig in and pop up the case plate. Viola!! It's open. Now if this worked on my KC watch then it's good.* note: depending on where the maker put the pry slot you may have to remove the band for an easier open.

"This is cut to size so be aware of that. That isn't a negative though, it gives room to cut however you want. The strip does not have to be siliconed and it fit my EASI glass door snugly (1/4""). The hard plastic base and drip rail can be trimmed easily by a little handheld hack blade or sheet metal snips. I recommend the hack blade, it just cuts cleaner and it really isn't bad - cut through quickly with minimal effort. Do have a blade handy to slice the dual weatherstrips after you cut the hard base. Otherwise, I am very happy with this part!The Pros:- plastic base rail is thick enough that it doesn't flop around and snugly grips to the glass (silicone or not)- The silicone dual strips on the bottom are not flimsy- Drip rail has a good angle to it - not angled too closely or sticking out but enough to keep the water from flowing onto the bottom frame railCons: (nothing I can think of now)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6FULM42BL87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G1A9NU#wasThisHelpful","R2P6FULM42BL87","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want an inexpensive yet versatile saw...this is it. I can't believe I got it for under 20 bucks! It fits most other blade types and I have used the living daylights out of it and it is still chopping away! Life saver for downed trunks/branches and such during Sandy and other super windy days. Actually, I used this to chop out a fallen smaller tree because the city was too damn slow so I took this and did their job for them! DO yourself a favor..go to HFT, sign up for the members news - take the 20% coupon and freebie coupon and get this thing for cheap.PROS:- not any louder than the brand name saws- the handle does rotate (note not 180)- safety switch- rubberized grips- has a twist lock knob for quick blade changes but can be locked down- Mine did come with a multi use blade, it was inside the cardboard wedge for the front. Do yourself a favor..open all the wedges to find those properly packed parts! I got a blade, a hex key and a manual.Cons:- the rubber front grip did shift when going through heavy vibrations which only happened a couple times cutting through some super dense/knotted wood beams - hell it almost shook my fillings loose for god's sake - no big deal, I just smeared a thin layer of rubber cement glue and slide back down the grip piece.

"True I am addicted to Harbor Freight, but that's because if you know what you are checking out, their tools are quality. I had a Porter Cable 2 in 1 nailer and when I saw this CP version in HF for half the price, I decided to try it. I built my friend's daughter's room when their baby was on it way - no problems. So I figured what the hell...worst thing is I have to return it. I bought this guy to help me repair/replace...hell, I not only replaced some of the floor planks but I redesigned and built a sturdier (more up to code) railing all around. My neighbors compliment on my work even though it was my first solo full rail. It worked beautifully. It is true as with some of the other CP nailers that the design is slightly bigger, sometimes it can spark and perhaps a tad heavier...but i think for the deep price difference, it is a minor issue at that. #1 - it nailed fine at an angle as long as you have the point as flushed as possible and slightly more umph #2 sparks are only from the nail fills that are held by a thin metal wire and lacquer - otherwise, the only lacquer held is fine #3 build some muscle...it ain't that much heaver for christ's sake and the dimensions are not far off if anything, they compare with the rest if not a tad slimmer than some. It's metal housing and rubber insert grips with a non-marring nylon or hard plastic/rubber front.PRO:- pretty decent build quality- back vent that rotated so you don't shoot air in your face and fall off the roof or something- price- comes with an allen wrench, oil, manual and tethered cap to keep inlet dirt free- safety feature as all should need to push the front tip on surface to enable the trigger to engage and fireCons:-  after some usage..check the nail reservoir screws as the vibrations after all that usage may loosen it. Simple fix, I dabbed a tiny smear of blue locktite but it took repairing a medium sized front porch, side deck and other misc repairs for them to finally vibrate loose so this is a very nit picky point- non-marring tip can be slippery at angle shots but not a stick point either. I did see some nailer with a knurled tip for grip..maybe an upgrade for this if I can find one but if you really need to I'm sure you can figure something - again - nit pick- loading slide is easy, although the instructions could be better. Loading different gauges and length go in a few possible ways and if you're not familiar, I can see people wondering why it isn't nailing, jamming or closing.- perhaps it's only with HF nails, don't wait until the very last nail in reserve, it can jam. I usually keep a healthy reserve and it's smooth nailing all the way. No biggie.IMHO - my cons were a nit pick list. I really have no complaints so far and I've been rocking away all sorts of projects. Easy maintenance - just one drop of oil in the inlet before airing up. Otherwise, air puff the outside and a quick wipe. One of the best money I spent...I obviously returned the porter cable since.update: 7/30/15 - still firing.

"I have a 4000W Sportsman Propane generator that did not have a wheel kit and I could not find one for it either. I saw other kits but the price range varied greatly and I sure as hell was not paying 100 bucks for a wheel kit! For some reason I really had a hard time trying to find a specific kit for it so I looked into all. This was actually the closest match and the sturdier one. Forget the other universal ones..they were much cheaper in quality and they needed the same amount of modding to fit my generator! So for under 40 bucks and a trip to Homedepot for some parts...it fits nicely.What I needed from HD:4 = 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 length cap screws (widest you can fit into the axle's bracket holes) I think it was 30mm or SAE equiv4 = washers (thicker ones)4 = nuts1 = step drill bit1 = optional, locktite blue or teflon tape (just to keep nuts from shaking loose with the vibration)2 = mending brackets with the same holes spaced out or same functionWhat I did:I found a corner bracket of decent thickness that had the same hole alignment. I used a dremmel to cut it in half. I know I know...why didn't I use a straight plate..the ones that were thick enough would probably have ruined my drill bit if I tried to drill through it 4 times. It was easier to cut through with the dremmel's cutting disc making that 1 L braket into 2 straight pieces with perfect hole alignment. I then simply created a U bolt like setup and wrenched on the axle (which spans the width of the 4000W generator perfectly). Note...I placed the axle on the cross bar that was closer to the rear of the generator....the other bar is about 1/4 in and you don't want to use that point to support the wheels and weight. The support bracket for the front will need a hole tapped in with the step bit, otherwise the other hole will line up nicely! Half the work saved for that! The only gripe is the lift handle, but then again it was designed for a champion gen not a Sportsman. I used a wood shim and black duct tape to create a wedge point to tighten on so even if it rotates a little on lifting, the handle can still provide leverage for me to tote the thing around on the back wheels. For the price, I'll deal with it. It feels sturdy and I can move it without breaking my back now. Certainly more sturdy than the harbor Freight universal or other universal kits and in most cases, plus was the cheaper route. BTW the home depot parts only cost me an extra 6 bucks. I will try to post a pick in a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GX4QNHIZ08F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QVQKJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2GX4QNHIZ08F8","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a craftsman weed wacker/trimmer with the ""easy pull"" start. ""easy pull"" is easy to pull but whether it starts on the first few goes is another story! Just to clarify, ""easy pull"" means that it is a smoother and light tension to the string/handle when tugged at so that is certainly a welcome relief compared to trimmers or even mowers without that. Kudos to Craftsman on that - but again, it doesn't mean it will start on the first cold start. I would imagine as with the other similar trimmers' designs, the plastic housing for the air filter is right in the direction of where you are pulling to start so I can vouch for some scraped knuckles there. Enter this baby: the start chuck! I wish I bought this first out. This design is a one way bearing so it won't screw up your trimmer if operated the wrong way. Also, the red plastic spacer/depth guide has the arrows to point the way. It just inserts into any drill (the red guide also noted drill side or not) and lock in the chuck. Set your drill on hi and insert the key. Squeeze the trigger and in less than 2 seconds it was putting to life and cutting away! This time no scraped knuckles!! It's been fine so far with a handful of times and plenty more to come for the season.PS: I just used either my 12V older black and decker drill or the 12V craftsman LithIon drill set on hi speed. Anything weaker may not do the job so plan on that. Also, yes, I used this on my Craftsman so it is compatible with their easy start system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQL4X5WRD8NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00383C49G#wasThisHelpful","ROQL4X5WRD8NS","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple older can and a newer EPA can. However the spouts from the old ones are taking a beating and not as user friendly and the new can's spout just plain stinks. I tried one of these to see if they are better than the ones I've seen in local stores and I must say, I am glad I got this full kit. It comes with 2 different threaded /sized caps so that was good. The spout is stiff enough and not flimsy so it doesn't flop everywhere when you are using a larger can like 5 gallons at a weird angle (I have sports cars and motorcycles so imagine the odd designs on those things). Also worked great filling mowers and weed wackers on the ground which I couldn't do before without some decent spillage. The replacement vents seems fine, I don't need to replace mine but I did add it to one that did not which is great - it stopped that surge flow of gas when the gas can is gulping for air leading to splashing/spillage. Although I would've liked it as a few bucks cheaper, all things considered, if you are unsure about what fits and maybe what needs replacing etc etc - just get this kit and have it all on hand. Save the trouble. I'm sure you know how it goes, intend to replace the one thing and the replacement does fit or isn't as compatible with pieces that you haven't planned to replace etc etc. Everything you need in one bag plus extra pieces to MacGyver with just in case.Pros:- quality spout - not too flimsy and decent build- seal ring in base cap is included and does a good job to- all parts in one kit plus probably can use spares for other application or improving older cans i.e. the vents- spout cap has latch cord so it doesn't get lost or fall to ground to gather dirt- mesh filter in base (not a fine one but mesh is about 1mm or so grid)Cons:- pricier than most kits but I think can be overlooked considering the completeness of the kit","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B21FX0A6Z0TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXTT232#wasThisHelpful","R2B21FX0A6Z0TW","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 50 ft hose in this and in about a year it broke in an essential place. The connection of the hose to the inside drum is a 90 degree elbow and you screw your hose on to it. I guess after some use, the weight and pulling/dragging of the hose was too much for it and the elbow broke from the base. One day I just turned on the faucet and it gushed out from the hideaway. I had to unroll the whole length and of course the problem would be right where that main connection point is. So needless to say...it's done. Not happy with the price you pay and the less than stellar durability of it. I gave it 2 stars - 1 for each year, the second really should be half of a star. It was ok when it didn't break but I can certainly think of better. I was just waiting for this to be done then buy the others I had my eye on...ironic, now I can do that.

"This is not bad. I was concerned with some reviews stating they could not connect because the power lines needed to be on the same circuit etc etc...however I decided to try. What's the worse, I return it? I needed to run an ethernet line from the Fios modem located (of course) down stairs to a security DVR upstairs in a remote closet in a room other side of the home...double whammy there. There was no way in hell someone would be able to run a line clean from downstairs to upstairs on the other side of the home without the walls gutted or drilling more holes from outside/in. Definitely didn't want more holes/issues so why not try this. Now I can't speak of the same circuit thing but I will say that I have 2 fuse boxes, the 1 is original to the orignal side of the house and the 2nd is more into the newer part of the house. I can't confirm how the wiring is but I am sure that the outlet upstairs is not in the same fuse panels and it is on different switches. So asides from that, I am not an electrician and I cannot make a theory of why this should/shouldn't work. All I know is - different fuse panels, different sides of the house, different floors and different breaker switches. The only common element is that the master switch in panel 1 - shuts power to ALL. Otherwise, the signals works and I have tried hard wiring the laptop to it upstairs to setup the security DVR settings, and then I plugged the DVR into it and all seems working. I think for the price, it's worth a shot over the more expensive ones - if you plan on just non-insane tasks like emails, surfing, searching etc etc. I haven't tried internet gaming like XBOX live or anything so I can't comment on that either. The others, it seems like it loads in good time. For what it's worth, I'm happy. Note: they are the size of a pack of cigarettes give or take but relatively unobtrusive. The ethernet plug is on the bottom so plan on that. Either you will be using the bottom outlet or turning it upside down and plugging it from above.  Either way, you can still gain access to the other unused outlet so that's good. Some of the other more expensive ones can partially block the other outlet making it impractical.

"If you are looking for a fast charger, skip this. This was not meant to be a fast charger (or at least this model). I was looking at similar products because I have cars I just didn't have time to use as much as I wanted to. After the pain of replacing those batteries much earlier than it should, I figured let me maintain and recondition them and keep that are less than 3 yrs old. Why keep the old ones? I use them as battery packs for portable jumps, power failures, and now I will be installing them in line to start my own solar energy farm in case another Sandy comes along. Hence, the reconditioner function to save my older batts(can also be called other names but same process of dephos-ing the plates inside). I still thought it would be faster with charging a car battery if the darn thing wasn't dead or aged out. The manual had a approx time grid for battery types/size vs hours...so for the average size 30-40 type battery, it's 18 to 24 hrs! SO anyways, I thought it took a little longer than it should for my regular type 35 battery off my 350Z but I cut it slack because it was probably ~ 30% or so charged. That took 20 hrs. The motorcycle battery on my CBR600RR which was more than 50% took 1 overnighter - figure 8 hrs. Now the Mas which is a 2012 - I'm sure the battery is above 75% has sat at 2 leds (50%) overnight...it sure doesn't sit in storage that much! It is still on as I type this and this was from last night so it is going on 15 hrs now. It SHOULD be done by the time I get home from work at 5pm today....should...Pros:- lightweight, not too cheap feeling- good about including connectors you usually need- plug/connection points are solid- in line fuses are solid feeling, have resistant covers on them- not a overly complex display - simple, to the point- standby mode, no sparks when plugging in the unitCons:- comparable to others at a cheaper price- can a smart charger be too smart? Sometimes, I think it over analyzes and take much longer than it need for good/newer batteries. It feels like it goes thru the full analysis process if you need to or not....that's what it feels like.I honestly am debating if the long drawn out process is necessary for all batteries it gets hooked up to dead or not. It is for that reason why I am on the fence with returning this product or not. I have a schumacher manual charger anyways for the bulk charging but I guess I really expected different from this one...much like ""it's smart enough to know to skip the conditioning if unnecessary"" and all that - I have to wonder if it really is that smart though. I will update and see if it takes the same time for all regardless of charge - if it does, then you know the ""smart"" is bull and it just puts all batts through all phases regardless of what it needs and how much charging it just needs.Update: 4/28/2014 - So the Mas battery is done that day I came home from work. Still took longer than should've IMO. Another thing I noticed: not sure if that's a good thing, I have 2 older motorcycle batteries so I wanted to try and recondition them and see if I can save them. I clipped them on and within 5 mins, they showed at full LEDS (100%)..WTH! These are older batteries that came off the bike obviously because they were not holding up through a season from age or sitting there so there is no way they are 100% and they should need reconditioning! So does that mean the Noco doesn't know it's old and maybe the capacity is questionable at this point? Shouldn't a ""genius/smart"" charger know that when it supposedly analyzes it? I state the facts of the situation, you guys determine if my questions are valid or not, I'm just trying to stay objective and see if this does what it says and is worth the money since I never dealt with this company before. Feel free to let me know if you agree or your experiences...thanksUpdate: 10/21/2015 - it's still alive. I have been using this to maintain my motorcycle battery and my 12V car batteries but I still find the longer charge times annoying. This will still take an overnight session to charge my weekender's 12V to 100% when it isn't sluggish to start in the first place. That battery is still the newer one of my cars yet takes much longer than my older ones? In theory the older ones would be more of a target for the whole de-phos process and then recharge so they would expect to be clamped on longer. For what it's worth, it still turns on and is charging. I stand behind my 3 stars rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EF79AXV2FHZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LX3AXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EF79AXV2FHZT","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I guess if your TV is by a window then it is ok and just enough ~ 3-4 ft- suction cup mounts...works as expected...will fall but that's suction cups vs mounting other waysTIP:Check this site before you order. This will help you check to see if DTV is really an option to try or will it be more trouble for nothing.[...]","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIFARD4SSHCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIO9VSE#wasThisHelpful","R2PIFARD4SSHCG","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just like OE carts but much cheaper. My main issue with refurbed carts was if there was a chip and/or problems with the printer recognizing the carts like my HP did. Even cartridge world had to replace my Canon cart once and my HPs never worked properly after a month so I stopped going there! I had my hesitations but I decided to try Sophia (I had LD in the past too). Sophia was just as good as LD in the case of my Canon carts. I am happy with that. Although I did notice that it didn't last as long but I'll teach you a trick.Take a dropper and flip the cart upside down. There is the ink pad, use the dropper to drop and let drops of water soak in the pad (which happens fairly quickly) in. I forgot what the weight of a full cart was but I usually put in maybe ~ .5 fl oz max of water. Flip it back up right and let it sit. If the cart doesn't leak out then you're fine (which it should be fine b/c you never messed with the seal, just reverse absorbed the water back into the reservoir). Give it a gentle swish around and then reinstall. Let the printer test print and cycle the newly mixed ink soak in and saturate the cart felt. That's all...still on my 1 replacement cart after 2 more swaps although it is starting to lighten but it sure gave me a bang for the buck!!!!

"Gates as per my mechanic is a good company and has been an OE supplier from some cars makers as well. He is particular about parts he installs for his customers so he knows sometimes cheaper is not better and also he is aware of quality from manufacturing origins. He did note that this was China but we checked over everything (roll/play of bearings, belt consistency etc..) and it seems virtually identical to the OEM Honda parts we took out (of course except in new condition). Bearing were smooth, belt was tough with the same feel - minus the grime, fit and finish were just fine. So they are in and the truck is awesome again at 10 - 2-% cheaper than having a dealer do it. Keep in mind, there are ""technicalities"" when listing as ""made in ------"" . My understanding is that the label can be from the point of final assembly so many parts can be made in China but if final assembly was made in USA or where ever, then it can be labeled as such. Hence, knowing that nowadays almost everything is made in China, we physically checked over all the parts and made sure it felt quality.

"I already reviewed it under the 3 pack. I since have found so many more uses and it is convenient enough that I bought a 6pk for even more stuff. Again, the design is trendy yet functional. The plug only stands out about an inch more so unless it is being squashed behind something that will be close up to the wall...keep that in mind. Otherwise they are great! I use them for a couple of my guest and baby's room where they have the ""auto-sensing"" nightlights but the room maybe slightly darker because of positioning in the house/windows - I no longer have to keep unplugging etc etc..if I need them on auto for a while, then flip the switch. That's all...guest room nitelights - same there...I also use it on  my charger plugs so I don't have to wear and tear on the outlets or the plugs. Did you know that ""standby"" and plugged but not charging - chargers can still use a minute amount of energy? Have any electronics that do not shut off totally but only go on standby? Well - here you go. I have not had one break (knock on wood) yet and the button lights green if on, off if the switch is off so you know.

"I have a 7 mo old and we got this about 4 months ago. We figured he would like the sounds and lights which he did. Lately the pad has been quirky. When i say quirky I mean the lid can sense if open or closed and while opened (it has preset points that hold lid open) the little shake will set it off and it thinks the lid is being opened/closed. Now it just beeps or blips or repeats words/phrases without anybody playing with it. My son liked that one during nap time..I finally put him to sleep after being cranky and scout goes ballistic and woke him up. I think it's safe to say it is broken. We never dropped it, wet it or anything. We were always holding it and pressing the buttons while he sat in our laps or during tummy time. Considering it was never abused and it only lasted 4 months, i'd say that's some horrible quality. Maybe we got the lucky lemon of the group? Too bad, it was fun when it worked and he liked it I tried emailing the company, maybe they'll send me a free replacement..who knows. I'll let you know how their customer service is and re-rate if needed.3/17/2014: Contacted the LeapFrog company via email and they were good about responding. I sent them a description, Item #, Serial #, color and where I bought it from. They said they would be sending a replacement! I am waiting for the mail. Yay! Hopefully this one won't break and flip out in the middle of his sleep like that last one...Yikes.3/20/2014: LeapFrog Customer Service came through! They kept it relatively easy and my baby had a new one to play with. It was properly packed and spotless when I got it. I really appreciate Leap Frog's customer service and although they were pleasant enough, I hope we don't use them again. Nowadays, proper service can be tough to find. It is nice to know they were courteous and helpful when we did need them. Thanks again Leap Frog CS.  - Since the other was broken anyways, I opened to take a peek. It turns out that the trigger switch that tells the electronic if the lid is opened or closed is pressed by a raised portion of the plastic ridge inside the base. The parts look like it does not meet flush hence one half of the seam does not meet the height of the other which barely hits the trigger when at the raised threshold and closed. Thus, any shaking makes it flick the trigger right at the point where it thinks it is opened/closed and it must've fried the board from the constant surges when it does. It seems it's a matter of manufacturing QC issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLLATEGJYBLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATPLPAA#wasThisHelpful","RLLLATEGJYBLO","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have ordered 16"" and other 19"" but different manufacturers. My friends wanted backups so I too to Amazon to find more and it seems the others that I previously bought were not offered anymore. So I came across these and I figured they look ok - no rubberized grip or window smasher on the butt plate but it's still fine as a back up right? I ordered three and if it was my money I think I would've returned it. When compared to the other generic batons, this was certainly ""rough"". The weigh was good considering and it was slimmer than the other rubberized grip models which is fine. The bad part is the craftsmanship when extending and collapsing. If you flick out too hard, the section will get stuck and I mean I did have to give it a few good hard thumps to collapse it. With my others, it was not like that. Even if I flicked it out really hard it would feel like it was out of alignment or ""locked up"". This feels like it needs to be broken in or something. I offered my friends to return it but they said it was the backup to the baseball bat so it should be fine. I personally wouldn't have kept it but then again I would use it more for duty or bumps in the night on a more regular basis. I guess you have to really weigh the cost of under 20 bucks vs level of craftsmanship. I will ask them to break them in and see if the action smooths out. If it gets better I will update but if you don't hear from me on this again, my review stands 100%. The seller was absolutely fine and I've been a return customer, I'm sorry this purchase was not up to par as the past orders.

"I needed a backup tank not only for my BBQ but I have a propane generator that runs off 20lb tanks. Since this winter's been pretty crappy and I have a new baby, I need the extra piece of mind. I went to local places and the prices were crazy - about 20 bucks more for various brands. This was a new tank and it is vacuum purged for you and ready to fill. It feels just as the other tanks do and the edges are not sharp. I was able to hold the base without shredding my hand (when tank is new of course) not like one of the other ones I bought from HD and it wasn't as refined. It has the safety overfill valve that I believe is required now. Otherwise, it's a tank. Check your local garden center/yard store - they may sell it there so figure the tax vs shipping if you buy online and buy accordingly. otherwise, prices local vs online seem close unless someone marks it up more than usual.mine came with a black and red wrap around label - not that that really matters but it was more presentable so I was pleasantly surprised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTGMS1F3V1Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00026L1P0#wasThisHelpful","R3UTGMS1F3V1Y3","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"when compared to the videosecu cables, it is lighter in material. It still transmits fine but remember that it is only wired to the nest room and not near a power line. My only gripe is the power line. It fits lighter (but not loose that it will slide off) or not as tight as the other cables and the plug is slightly longer for my cam's power connection so it does have some metal showing instead of having the plastic base touch with the other plastic base for a ""closed"" connection point. If you have the full 10 ft dangling or will be tucking the connection point in the cutout/hole inside the walls then I would electric tape it or something to keep it from separating and some insulation for the exposed metal but that's probably more from me being extra cautious. I do that anyways for the ones that fit seamlessly. Overall, not bad for the price but it will do fine.

"not sure what to say about this. Still need to go to the range to see what is the issue but both the USP compact and USC carbine are HK and use .45 ACP carts. According to the carbine, this seems spot on with the stock sights. The usp compact shows that it is slightly off to the right and a twinge high but it could be from the tug on the case extractor but last i knew both were shooting straight.I gave it 3 stars b/c the instructions are basic and how is the laser mounted in side from the factory - any possibility of adjustments at all? I think you ""can't"" unless someone figured out how with no adjustment screws and the on/off is just screwing the back cap until it turns off. On the brighter side, it was sent with 4 button batteries which it only needs two even though the instructions says 3...can't see how I won't break it jamming 3 in. Until I hit the range (hopefully soon) and see if my theory is right about the extractor tugging to the right, I can't truly say if it was send misaligned from the factory. I will update and change the rating accordingly so for now, I leave it at a 3 as a warning since there are others online that look the same but have gotten so-so reviews as well.Just out of curiosity, anyone know if they can adjust these somehow? I wish I could find it again but someone on I thin Amazon reviewed a similar if not same sighter with the same common issues.

"it's a pretty comprehensive kit. It seems like it has rod ends and loops that would fit into anything from .22 rimfires to larger calibers like .45 +. I've had Hoppe's kits before and they've always lasted a decent amount of time/abuse. My only gripe with this is that the base T-Handle-rod feels cheaper than in past years. I still have my older T-handle and it feels more comfy and sturdy than this new one's t handle. The kit has enough metal (aluminum?) extension rods so it can clean out most carbines and rifle barrels to the end.  The case is better than plastic but don't expect to smash it with a hammer and survive. The plastic insert tray where it keeps the brushes, rods etc is flimsy though but I don't expect it to break soon since it really just a place holder for the contents. It more than does it's job keeping all the parts in and has 2 latch locks. All in all...good kit for the price. Too bad there wasn't extra room to keep the lube and solvent in there with it but maybe if the flimsy plastic tray breaks, bag the stuff and they'll be room for the 2 bottles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DB4EZLEHME3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HBHNM4#wasThisHelpful","R2DB4EZLEHME3W","A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M3GEH8UY8ZBV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great set. Obviously not really used for ""cutting"" like traditional knives so those who think so really have no business trying to buy such items. Although edgy enough, you won't be chopping veggies for soup with this so don't rate it as being compared to a real metal blade - DUH. These polymer/composite ""letter openers"" or whatever you want to refer to them as is basically a tool for those who understand how and to what capacity they can be used for. The knuckle/punch slips on comfortably and has enough base to the palm even for larger hands. The tip has a tapered tip for more focused impacts (may puncture). The throwing knife design feels closely modeled to it's metal counterpart in dimension but I wouldn't expect to do movie dramatic hits across the room with it but it still carries a little more weight than I anticipated. The triangular and the boot knife are straight forward as well. All solid enough.Overall, a good set for the price.

"I bought this so I can declutter my counter and that means that hideous dishrack needed to go. Still need something unobtrusive for a few things. I hoped this was the solution...yes and no. It was ok for baby bottles and stuff but even that was ""ok"" . Bottle and caps you can jam into the fingers - silicone nipples not so much so if they were one the edge, they'd roll off eventually. Certainly couldn't put regular dishes in a pinch - or not plates - saucers at best. The ""grass"" is actually one whole stiff grid of fingers that you can lift up  and drain/clean the bottom tray easy enough. The grass fingers are surprisingly pointier than I would expect - not that it pierces skin but normally baby anything would have some rounded out or softer tip to it. Not a big deal but somethign else to note. Didn't return it (probably should've) but I found a super replacement that gave a great balance of baby/regular stuff yet unassuming and just as ""trendy"". OXO makes a compact dish rack that has thick but thoughtfully spaced fingers (with a soft tip coating on the tips) that is rectangular in size. The tip coatings gave optional colors (green, red, white and grey that I've seen) and it's overall rectangular shape is just enough for dual function. I can place larger flat dishes, bowls or baby items there no problem! I'd say go for that instead.

"Three things you need to know before buying this bra:1. It's in Asian sizing, so a 32 is a 75. If you're a large 34, buy the 36. It will still be tight though, which is what you want & need for good push-up power. Beauty is pain.2. This is designed for small busted women to have a pushup that works for us, with no gapping. If you're a C cup, this is not the bra for you, go to Victoria's Secret or something. There is so much padding in this bra that your boobs will have nowhere to go and you won't be able to close the bra.3. The shoulder straps are too short for the average American woman. Again, this is for petite Asian chicks, so if your torso is longer than a lilliputians, you'll need to buy separate straps. Even on the longest adjustment the straps are painfully short and restrict movement for me (I'm 5'9"" & 32A, bought a 34A).Keep in mind that this bra is supposed to be tight and it's supposed to pull your boobs up under your chin. The straps are supposed to be tight, that's why it works so well. I have apple/orange sized boobs and I could walk the VS Fashion Show runway in this bra, that's how good it is!

Even the pasta tastes perfect, which shocked me since I hate gluten-free foods. The only way you can tell this isn't ""normal"" pasta is that the water turns opaque white while boiling; otherwise there is no difference. I recommend this, but definitely price shop. My local Kroger has these for a lot cheaper, but I'm happy Amazon is offering it for people in vegan-food-wastelands.Pro tip: Use the cheese sauce packet as emergency nacho sauce. You know, for those nacho emergencies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXRPLOWV566/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WAD5CO#wasThisHelpful","R2BXRPLOWV566","A1W7BLYXHXWUYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7BLYXHXWUYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hanger shopped for literally 2 months before settling on these. I knew I wanted ""huggable"" type hangers, but I wasn't about to pay huggable prices, if you get my drift. I decided on these after reading the Amazon reviews. THANK YOU AMAZON REVIEWERS. I had initially passed these up because I don't like or need the accessory bar and find it cluttered looking, but wound up being totally frustrated with the other hangers I found. My requirements were:1. Sturdy2. Low cost3. Pretty color4. Not too wideAll the ones I found in stores were either super wide suit hangers (17"" and up), flimsy, or ugly. The others I found online had ridiculous hearts in the middle of them, high prices, quality issues, ugly colors, or unknown widths. I'm glad I settled on these ""Cresnel"" ones! (I put Cresnel in quotation marks because the box they came in has no brand listed on it at all, just a plain cardboard box straight from the Chinese factory)I don't mind the minimalist shade of gray, and the felt flocking on them does not come off. I really rubbed the heck out of one on my white duvet when I first got it just to make sure, and nothing came off at all. I bought 100 of these things and so far I've filled up my second clothes rack with all 100 of them: Whitmor 6071-1947 Supreme 36-Inch Clothes Closet, White and Clear. That's 100 hangers in 30"", including some thick sweaters and blazers (the other 6"" have about 10 pairs of pants on pant clip hangers). Not bad.I recommend these to anyone looking for good quality hangers to invest in for wardrobe organization. I only wish they came in more colors, I really would have liked soft pink or ivory!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFDAA50TOIT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWFA93A#wasThisHelpful","RIFDAA50TOIT4","A1W7BLYXHXWUYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7BLYXHXWUYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first I thought it didn't fit my cigarette lighter, but I just had to jam it in harder. It's shaped to not be wobbly and loose in the hole, so you have to just use elbow grease. I like that, actually. It does fast charge as well, just as fast as the Samsung charger that came with my Note 4. Sometimes it even seems like it goes faster than the home one, but that may be because at home I'm not concerned with how long it takes, versus when I'm on-the-go.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a car charger should have a retractable or coiled cord.

"I was tired of paying out the neck for Venus refills so I decided to give a cheaper brand a try. The Quattro feels good in the hand but it does not give as close a shave as Venus. I can go several days without shaving my armpits before it gets out of hand with Venus, but with the Quattro I had to shave every other day. On the plus side, I had MUCH less skin irritation and hyperpigmentation with the Quattro, but that was probably because it wasn't actually getting close to my skin, so that's the trade off. So now I have black armpits but no hair. I may alternate between the Quattro and Venus to spare my skin. One thing I will say, the little suction cup holder actually works!

"I am a light bulb color-temperature snob; I hate orange ""warm"" light with a passion, but also don't like harsh white light anywhere but my kitchen. I bought this bulb to use in my bedroom to replace a bright white LED in a bedside lamp. I loved the brightness of my old LED bulb during the evening & night, but first thing in the morning it felt like I was giving myself LASIK eye surgery. I screwed this Neutral daylight 4250 - 4500k ChinChin bulb in and it's perfect. It's still bright, but not so bright that it's painful. It's warm but not too warm that it looks orange. It really is how the description says it is. It is definitely ""instant on"" as well.I love that it is a normal light bulb shape too. Usually for bright lights you want to go with a corn bulb, but those don't fit in my kitchen ceiling fixture or my stove hood light. These do, so my next purchase will be the ""Pure cool white"" ChinChin bulb. I may get one of those for my fridge as well. I love the price - not too high for a single bulb, but high enough to say that you're getting something with more quality than a 5-for-10 pack of cheapo orange-y light bulbs from costco.I will update after I've had it for a while to review the longevity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLP23U7EJ3EGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU4Q7ES#wasThisHelpful","RLP23U7EJ3EGX","A1W7BLYXHXWUYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7BLYXHXWUYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am 5'8.5"", 135lbs, 34AA and usually wear a medium in shirts. Based on the measurements and some of the other reviews I went with a 10, because Asian sizing is usually way too small for me. The model is wearing a 6 and her thighs don't even touch, so I figured there is no way I could fit that shirt, especially around my large hips! Well, I should not have done that. The tag says L and it definitely is a large! It looks like a nurse's scrub shirt on me. A medium would fit well but still be roomy on me; I could have even gone with a 6 (S). I will be returning it, because unfortunately they don't do exchanges. I would have to just buy a whole 'nother one in the right size. It is a good shirt though! It's long, the front is lined so it's not sheer, the back is super cute and the shade of gray is exactly like the picture. The tag does not say V28 though, it says ""YTOSIZE"".

"Yes, these pillows go squishy after a couple months.... and I love it! I hate hard pillows, and hard pillows are the only pillows that don't go lumpy after a few months. These are still so incredibly soft and squishy; I love them even more than the day I bought them. I plan on going back to Costco and buying 2 more so I can have 2 firmer/puffier ones and 2 flatter/squooshy ones. I love hugging my lumpy soft squishy pillow, and it's still big and puffy enough for me to use as a head pillow too. Even once they deteriorate down to pure lumps, I will still love them because I have that weird thing where I like to scrunch slippery/lumpy pillows; it relaxes me. (In the interest of full disclosure I suppose I should let you know that I am actually a cat.) I love these and can't recommend them enough! If you want invincible pillows that last forever, sleep on a hard brick pillow like the kind Serta makes. I can't stand those things and only use them to prop myself up to watch TV in bed, or sit my plate on while I'm eating in bed. YES I know beds are for sleeping but who are you to judge me? I like to create mountains with pillows on my bed and get all snuggly in them, and these Charismas are perfect for that. So very soft! If you're anything like me, you'll like these pillows.

"I have needed a new mattress for years, I was still sleeping on the one I got when I was 10. I picked the ""ask chuck"" option but it wasn't really necessary because we wound up going with my original firmness guess, #6 (which is the standard one they offer; not sure if it's ""cushion firm"" or ""plush medium"" on here.. probably cushion firm). I don't have back problems or anything like that, but I can say that this mattress is comfy all around, and even if I had gone softer I would be happy. I don't think you can go wrong with this mattress. There wasn't even any off gassing which amazed me because I just knew there would be since there is foam in it. Nope. It was easy for one person to get out of the box, unwrapped, and onto the boxspring. For the price, there is no reason why anyone should procrastinate on buying a new mattress if you need one. Just do it! You won't regret it. I am sleeping like a baby. 3 days after I first got this mattress I took 3 naps in one day. Oh what a beautiful Saturday that was!

"I bought this model because it has a retractable cord, which works great and I love it. The only downside are the clips. They look like breast cancer awareness bows and have fishtail ends that stick way out from your head. I was hoping to be able to put these rollers in, throw a shower cap over them and take a shower/get ready to leave the house. Not happening! No shower cap in the world is big enough to cover the giant clips that come with this. I also don't think the clips hold the roller well enough; they flop around on my head, they're not very tight or secure. Also, Conair gives you a drawstring bag to keep the clips in, which is nice, but then you have to find somewhere to put the bag. I have it hanging on my bathroom doorknob.

"I have super dry skin and Korean face creams are the only kind I use. They leave my face hydrated without looking greasy, unlike American brands I've tried like Aveeno and Olay. I have never tried Nature Republic products but figured I'd give them a try since 1, EXO advertises for them and I'm a sucker for anything they sell, and 2, the price for a jar of this stuff was less than ten bucks (on ebay).I absolutely love it! This is a gel-type cream, if that makes any sense. It's lightweight, smooth, and a beautiful shade of baby pink. It has a TON of ingredients, which would normally turn me off, but around 90% of them are natural plant extracts. It comes with a spatula, but honestly, it spreads so well and you need so little of this product that 80 mLs would literally last me 3 years. I threw the spatula in a drawer and bought an airless pump bottle instead. After transferring 50 mLs of this cream into one large bottle, I find I only need one pump for my whole face. The original jar still sits on my shelf with 30 mLs still inside it. It smells lightly floral and sinks right into my skin.Nature Republic proves yet again that most skin care companies are ripping us off. Biotherm, Elisha Coy, Shiseido, etc. have products similar to this but sell them at over twice the price, and they have less natural ingredients. Many competitor's products even have harmful ingredients like parabens and denatured alcohol. For the price, you absolutely can't go wrong with this Super Aqua Max! Two people can even use one jar and it will still last for months. Give it a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOD2WQJ6NSDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VL84H2#wasThisHelpful","R3BOD2WQJ6NSDG","A1W7BLYXHXWUYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W7BLYXHXWUYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a Jehovah's Witness, so I'm unbiased here, I just want to post a ""review"" to say that the New World Translation is actually a more literal, direct translation than the KJV or NIV. Particularly the Greek scriptures (new testament); all of Peter and Paul's letters are pretty much word for word from the Greek. It might not read as easy as the NIV, but you get more out of it, in my humble opinion as someone who studies the bible. If you're doing a Beth Moore study or any in-depth bible study, I recommend you visit a Kingdom Hall to get one of these for free.To exemplify what I mean:NIV 2 Corinthians 6:14 ""Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?""NWT 2 Corinthians 6:14 ""Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?""Same scripture, more accurate wording. Paul used the greek word ""heterozygountes"" which means ""unevenly"", not just ""together"".

"I have US Women's 10 size feet so I was worried these wouldn't fit. They fit exactly perfectly; maybe a size 11 could stretch in there too because there is a lot of extra material at the top of the bootie bag. If you're size 12+ I would definitely go with the larger size in the blue box. I uploaded a picture with the bootie bags next to a measuring tape so you can see the exact length.Overall, it works exactly as described, the peeling process didn't take forever either. I thought I would have to hide my feet for a month or more but it's 1 day shy of a week since I did it and I'm basically done peeling, except for the tops of my feet & toe crevices. I only spend about 30 minutes picking at them every night since the 3rd night. My feet are so smooth, and it even peeled away some of the thicker parts on my callused areas. It didn't peel the whole callus, but it got several layers off; it feels much better and smoother. I don't have any corns or bunions so I can comment on those.I did not soak my feet every day or even moisturize them after the first day. It was completely low maintenance, I just picked at it in the evening as I watched a video. There was no pain at all during the peeling process, no tender spots where the skin held on. I even peeled my big toe cuticle off with no sensitivity at all.You will probably want a good exfoliating cloth for the tops of your feet to get those peels off, because they don't really peel off in sheets like the bottom of your foot. I recommend the following:Aquasentials Gentle Weave Terry Bath Cloth (2pk)Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel - PinkI will also take a pumice stone to my toes to scrub the skin away, since it's hard to peel in between them.

"This book literally kept be turning the pages until the middle of the night. I would recommend this book to anyone a fan of looking into the darker places of reality. I gave this five stars since I swallowed up the story quickly and felt pulled by the horror. I've read some of the negative reviews and all I can say is that everyone has different taste. I didn't find this story lacking in any way. Easy to read and certainly captivating.

"Reads like a homework assignment from my 11 year old son.I really dont understand how one could sell a brochure as an eBook and make somebody pay so much to read it. Books like these are giving kindle a bad name. Im lucky I wasnt one of the people to fall for this.I read this on my friends kindle, and I must say this is one of the worst if not th worst books Ive read in a very long time.I wont make this into a long review but here are just some of the things that really got to me.-Its only for people residing in the bay area and who are familiar with the area, and some of the reviews are from restaurants I know for a fact dont serve good food.-The illustrations look like something out of a 6th grade culinary class. The pictures of the restaurants on the other hand are well taken.- Badly written descriptions, to drawn out talking about  well, this goes on for pages, like the author is just filling the pages with sweet nothings, here is an example: It might even feel like a bit much, but youll find yourself smiling as theyre so jovial. This restaurant is classically Italian in aura, service, music, and-most especially- the food. Homemade pastas and dough, and the use of completely fresh ingredients make all their dishes as authentic as eating at someones home in the Tuscan hills.-Probably the most disappointing piece for me throughout the book is the drastic omission of facts. No maps just pictures of places and youll have to see for yourself how to get there.-History of the region is just copied and pasted out of a history book, again a history book form the 6th grade.Overall, this book is far from balanced in its approach. Maybe Im just angered by the fact that this was the only new book available at the time. On the other hand I feel its my obligation to give readers an honest review. If you feel like wasting your cash, then this book is for you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZYUZB9VSVZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00765APTI#wasThisHelpful","R2GZYUZB9VSVZX","A5LVEOJ4BSUOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5LVEOJ4BSUOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not since ""Boss"" has a show been equally riveting and cringeworthy.  My husband and I sat transfixed trying to distinguish the good and evil characters under a guise of God given instructions via a young man who while in life support appeared and communicated with his father.  A father racked with guilt and despair over his son's botched suicide attempt.  In his grief the father, who is a prominent judge, turns to a manipulative pseudo-religious minister, who happens to have been an actor on ""Young and the Restless"" apparently in lieu of more formal theology education. Much to the frustration of the judge's wife and long term mistress equally.  The judge's inability to discern full blown visual an auditory hallucinations and reality has a major impact on his business and personal life as you can imagine.  The storyline is well paced with unexpected twists and turns.  Never a dull moment, just when you think you solved  part of the plot it veers into a totally different direction.  Loved that it was so memorizing and unpredictable in the age of retreaded plots. The actors give believable-difficult when one of the major characters appears only as a figment of his father's distorted mind(or is it distorted?), nuanced performances that flesh out the story beautifully.  Special kudos to all even the secondary parts.  Phenomenal job all!  Traditional television should be quaking in its boots.  Netflix and now Amazon have given the viewer a better alternative especially when you consider an entire season is available at once.  We cannot wait for the second season and will peruse Amazon for further fine programming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQWLLYBS3C5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR9UY8A#wasThisHelpful","RSQWLLYBS3C5U","A5A3C6XVDYUND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A3C6XVDYUND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second Shark after a long line of Orecks and Hoovers.  Due to having two cats and asthma (I know my pulmonary MD gives me heck about the cats too) I have to stay on top of the cat fur in my environment.  The Orecks were a step up from the Hoovers in the cat fur pick up, but even with their Hepa Filter I coughed my head off vacuuming and changing the bag.  Enter my first Shark approximately three years ago.  It was as if I entered a new orbit.  I love not having a bag to change and emptying the collection chamber was a snap.  This newest Shark has the same terrific pickup, I may say even better.  The same swivel head makes cornering a breeze.  I think the light on this model is even more brighter than my previous model.  You can easily clean under beds, low furniture and kitchen cabinets.  Dust bunnies and fur balls can no longer hide.  Getting close to baseboards are tricky no longer.  The cat fur on the furniture doesn't have a chance especially with the True Pet portion of this vacuum.  I could not believe that Shark could make a better vacuum cleaner than my original but they have successfully  reinvented the wheel.  This one is a monster!!  My carpets and wood flooring looks new.

"Why Does The Civil War Still Matter?  This Pulitzer Prize winning, well known historian failed to answer the question satisfactorily for me.  I found the description of the growth of Lincoln's military savvy to make this book worth the read.  However, the majority of the material that makes up this book has been previously published.  This always makes me think it is just contractual obligation and not inspired thinking.  There is one essay about the Reconstruction but it did not address the the years to date.  Why is the racial divide so prevalent in today's society so many decades after the Civil War?  Although the nation remains indivisible what have we exactly learned to keep it so?

"This is an excellent hot air curling rod.  Why only four stars?  You need to have longer hair than mine(shoulder length), have thicker hair than my fine frizzy mess, and not be scared to death of burning yourself.  Also be more coordinated than myself, in fact, it may help if you are an octopus so you can wear burn proof gloves while using this, the rollers and curling iron.  I have read the glowing reviews and marvel at their skill.  Cirque du Soleil candidates all.  If you aren't the scaredy cat I am please this a try.

"I am always on the lookout for any food or supplement that will improve my two cats' health.  My cats eat Greenies Hairball and Digestive Health daily with a massive decrease in the horrible regurg cough all cat owners dread.  Prior to Greenies they were crazy for Temptation treats.  They know the rattling of cat snacks and respond excitedly.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing they liked with this supplement.  Turned up their feline noses completely when served this and would eat around them when mixed with Greenies or regular food.  This would be an excellent supplement for my cats if they would just try them.

Reasonably priced, vibrant but not garish colors with traditional design this was what I purchased to put on my hardware floors under my kitchen table.

Becky was at her most exasperating, spendthrift self rationalizing her expenditures as "" work"" purchases in a non existent job as a stylist to the Hollywood stars.  Her best friend, Suze, husband and family make the trek to sunny California for an extended holiday.  I thought it creative to reinvent Suze's husband, Tarkie, into a film mogul and New Age devotee via a spa owned by Becky's nemesis from previous books.  Naturally Becky overdoes it, leaving a tangled mess with husband, Luke.  Thank God for Luke's ability to see beyond Becky's selfishness and immature behavior.

As it have looked on with horror at children left in cars that quickly become ovens throughout this summer, this story made me realize how easily it could be me.

These elements are stirred by Denis Lehane into well paced novel reminiscent of  his earlier Mystic River.  As usual with Lehane's novels they are far from being conventional thrillers but have at their core characters who appear to be created specifically for the screen.Lehane never fails to intrigue, largely because his stories are usually so character driven.  I can only recommend this novel to those unaware of his talents, and am confident that his fans will not be disappointed.Enjoy the read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SMTIR47QF82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","R5SMTIR47QF82","A5A3C6XVDYUND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A3C6XVDYUND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband took over cat box duty four years ago when my asthma worsened and I was a huffing puffing blob tethered to my oxygen.  Forget about the cat box I could not walk across the kitchen floor.  I am happy to say the last year my health has had a dramatic upswing.  My husband was reluctant to let me resume the litter box duty and I  could easily see the reason.  He had been using a crystal ""trackless"" litter in a huge box (for our two cats), did not scoop and lined the box with a giant trash bag that he dumped weekly.  The dust from this operation was tantamount to a storm in the Sahara.  There was no way my lungs would tolerate this plus I hated the mess and expense of the crystal litter.  I knew Amazon reviewers would have the answer.  You did not let me down.  I purchased this box two weeks ago, ditched the crystals for World's Best that is 99 percent dust free and have not regretted my decision.  More importantly my asthma has not raised it's ugly head.  After reading all the reviews I incorporated some important tips that have added to the success of my experience.  1.  The clips that hold the box together are flimsy.  So I duct taped its upper and lower segments together.  You really don't need to take off the top to add clean litter.  2. Rolling the box across the floor hurt my back, but it is light weight enough even with used litter in it for me to lift up on my washer/dryer top.  3. I roll and shake the box all the way onto its top two or three times.  This loosens the clumps and other material which easily fall into the collection drawer.  If the clumps are stubborn I hit the outside of the box or use my scoop and roll it over again.  4.  When the dirty litter has been removed I spray the inside the box with some Febreeze Clean Scent.  Refill with World's best clumping litter for multi cat home.  5.  Yes, Worlds does have some tracking issues but I place an old large towel underneath the box for the cats to exit onto and by the time they leave the laundry room their feet are clean enough not to show on my hardwood floors.  6.  Then I spritz the laundry room with a bit more Febreeze.  My cats are happy and use the box without leaving me any little ""presents"" elsewhere.  My husband gladly relinquished his cat box duty.  Most importantly my lungs and nose are happy.  Thanks to all who review and give tips.  The outcome has made me happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0SNS3V9JZ3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005E2S77C#wasThisHelpful","R2H0SNS3V9JZ3K","A5A3C6XVDYUND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A3C6XVDYUND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The City"" is a shiny jewel of a read based on the oral history of a 57 year old rambling into a tape recorder about his eight year old self.  This character driven plot is rich with details making the young boy, his family, friends and experiences only the more real and interesting.  Hooked in the first few pages of this book I simply could not wait to find out more.  Mr. Koontz wove a multi-layered story that delighted this long time fan.  If you are a fan of his more paranormal fast paced thrill rides this may not be the Koontz for you.  I can only say this read shows Koontz flexing his incredibly talented writing muscle.  He is a true master of his craft.Enjoy the read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LN8RLCPJU4MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545931#wasThisHelpful","R1LN8RLCPJU4MC","A5A3C6XVDYUND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A3C6XVDYUND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this, the second book of a projected series, the relationships between the Brilliants (as the name suggests, these are people with enhanced capabilities) and the normals become evermore strained.  The main characters from the previous book are, once more, the leading figures in this story.  The plot follows the attempts of some to avoid strife between the two sections of society, and is a natural extension of the first book.  One of the more interesting elements concerns the ethical issues associated with the actions of the central character.  What on the face of it appears to be righteous action is, in retrospect, called into question.If you have read and enjoyed the earlier book, then I have no doubt you will enjoy this.

"This novel would appear to be the first of a proposed series of books developing the story begun in ""Wolf"".The head of an international crime syndicate finds the goals of his, and allied organizations, at odds with international terrorism.  His reaction to the effects of terrorist attacks becomes all too personal when his wife and daughter are two of the victims  of a terrorist  bombing attack on a plane.  The plot unwinds as the  Wolf and his allies search for the terrorists who planned and carried out that specific attack.  There is a great deal of action throughout the book, an almost breathless quality pervades each succeeding chapter.  Lorenzo Garcaterra can certainly write about action sequences with a sure hand and the growing complications of the plot do not confuse the reader.I look forward to what I am sure will sequels, and recommend the book to all lovers of action.

"Chevy Steven's debut novel, Still Missing, is one of my all time favorites.  Unfortunately, she has never been able to replicate the phenomenal plot line, lightening fast pacing and 3D characters since.  This book did not capture me in the beginning and was put down several times.  That is not a good sign with a book I really wanted to be great read.  The plot never grabbed me, the teenage scenes read like a poor quality YA book, none of the characters were like able, fleshed out or believable, the conclusion was totally out there.  This book cheated the reader.  The author needs to hone her craft with the help of a good editor prior her next publication or she will risk her reading audience.  And that would be a real waste and shame.  I really wanted to love this book and give it five stars, instead  of only two.  It is worth only one star, the other is a pity star.

"Verdun is an iconic battle.  Lasting for 10 months, with little or no clarity of objectives, and the slaughter of tens of thousands, it almost stands as a classic example of the horrors of WW1.  Quite what the strategic goal might have been is unclear.  In an attempt to justify the slaughter, the German General Falkenhayn, retrospectively labelled the battle as a war of attrition, an attempt to bleed the French army dry.  It is clear from the records of the time that this  was a somewhat self-serving  explanation of a battle that had completely lost its point.  As the author puts it ""prestige filled the void left by strategic enigma.""Somehow, because the very name Verdun, symbolizes the War.  I was slightly surprised to find that I actually knew very little about it.  Perhaps because many of the popular histories of that war are written in English largely for Britons, Verdun, a wholly French and German affair has not had so much of the spotlight for Anglos.  Consequently, I found the book to be extremely informative.  Admittedly given my newly discovered ignorance, that was not a high bar.The battle itself is difficult to describe since it consisted of a whole series of attacks and counter attacks over a ten month period, with ground taken and retaken over and over.  This can lead to certain feeling of dj vu halfway through the book.  Nevertheless, given the constraints on reportage imposed by the very nature of this battle, the author does a good job.I recommend this book to all who think they know about Verdun, but have yet to discover that they really don't!Enjoy the read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR02WAOW0P7X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199316899#wasThisHelpful","RR02WAOW0P7X4","A5A3C6XVDYUND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A3C6XVDYUND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hence, I think my interest in volcanoes, although I must emphasize, a dilettante's interest and not that of a scholar.  Overall, I found the descriptions of the volcanoes and related geology, interesting but not fascinating.

"This book deals not so much with the course of the Normandy invasion itself, but more with the planning , preparation, and politics leading up to it.  As such, I found the details fascinating.  The broad picture is, of course, well known to all who have taken an interest in the course of the Second World War.  However, the details dealt with by Craig Symonds, truly enhance an understanding of the course of events.  Perhaps among the most fascinating elements is the relationship between the UK and the US, essentially between Churchill and Roosevelt.  As with so much about the War the Diaries of Lord Alanbrooke have already shed a lot of light upon this and other things.  However, the recounting in Neptune contains none of the inevitable bias of those diaries.  It is interesting that the author's views of the relationships between the High Commands of the Allies and the prejudices held by both very much complement those of someone (Alan Brooke)who was himself at the centre of events.I recommend this book wholeheartedly for shedding further light on a on the logistical issues that had to be dealt with.

"How can I possibly add anything worthwhile about a book that has been reviewed over 1700 times?  Although loaded with scientific jargon it boils down to a planet held spellbound over the fate of a botanist/mechanical engineer left on Mars after mistakenly assumed dead during an emergency evacuation.  Even the Chinese government chipped in to help with the rescue!  The book could have been dryer than the Martian surface but it is loaded with suspense, plot twists, drama and even some comic relief thanks to the wry observations of our deserted hero.  The story was so successful because it connected us on the human level with fleshed out characters from all aspects of space travel whether the highest level of NASA to a lowly technician.

"This is a really good toslink cable in my opinion.  It screams quality, very good construction and sports a nice look and feel.  It's certainly of a professional grade without the high end price tag commonly associated with such things.  I use this to pipe my TV's audio to my DAC in order to prepare the digital signal for my Hi-Fi/theater audio system.  I really appreciate the braided cable, it really takes things above your typical plastic/rubber coating that you'll find on most inexpensive cables.For a test, I set it up on my true ""hi-fi"" system, for which I typically use a (high end) coaxial connection that ""supposedly"" has better audio production capabilities.  With a fairly high end audio setup, I was barely able to discern a difference from the DAC's optical input and coaxial input...and what difference might exist is probably in my head or more likely, has more to do with my DAC's inputs than anything else.  I would be totally happy using this is a fairly high grade Hi-Fi application, especially considering optical connectivity isn't something that will degrade all that much unless the cable is truly poor quality.  Admittedly, I have nothing to measure the bits across the wire, but perception is most important in audio applications anyway.Overall, high value and reasonable price...what I look for in a purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IMAC5Y2QZXO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CANMCM#wasThisHelpful","R3IMAC5Y2QZXO3","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this table as a computer desk, probably not the intended purpose, but it works well enough for the application.  For the price, it's difficult to find something in the six foot range that can handle a decent sized dual monitor setup, a pair of monitor speakers and all the other items you might want within arm's reach on a computer desk.  I really like the black color, it doesn't scream ""temporary table"" in the office and provides plenty of storage underneath for computers and such.  The working height is comfortable for this application, not too high and not too short...just about perfect.  I can kick my feet up on it without feeling like I'm doing yoga.  The surface has held up to relatively heavy use, seems like it's going to last until I'm in the mood to buy a real desk.I can confirm that the table's top isn't perfectly level on both sides of the fold.  This does cause a minor issue in my application where my two monitors don't line up absolutely level.  No big deal for me, really, eventually I might just cut a nice oak board or something to act as a level plane.  If you're looking for something with absolute flatness on both sides, though, this table might not fit the bill.I liked the unit enough that I purchased a second one for it's intended purpose...a temporary table.  We occasionally get some big cooking projects going on and find it really helpful to add additional food preparation space since our kitchen has limited counter space.  I like that we can just fold up the table and store it, taking up minimal space when it's stowed away.  For this, it's absolutely perfect...plenty of working space and places to put things when you need to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32NOB4TIYDMLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOZTM3O#wasThisHelpful","R32NOB4TIYDMLO","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was apparently an idiot when I decided to purchase this item.  I thought, wow, what a good deal for a decent quality, name brand tape!  The problem isn't the tape, actually...it's a fine tape that did the job I expected it to do.  The problem is that I purchased the 54 yard rolls and was expecting the more substantial, and clearly a better value, 109 yard rolls.Overall, I can say that the Duck brand tape is really good.  On my recent move from Montana to Alaska, I had a number of boxes that failed well before the tape did.  The AlCan is a punishing road for a move, and let me tell you, this tape held up...in at least a couple cases, it was the only thing standing between a full box finding it's contents inadvertently emptied.  I really didn't need a low temperature application, as I see they make specific tape for...but we'll see how this ""sub standard"" version holds up to our punishing -50 degree winters for the stuff still left in outdoor storage.

"I recently moved to Alaska and needed something to transport ammunition via common carrier flights, as our Canadian friends frown upon bringing these items through their country.  It was somewhat difficult to find something reviewed for this particular application and I wasn't quite sure whether this unit would fit the bill or not.  I can happily say that these utility boxes have been safely used without incident to transport 49.5lbs of ammunition from Montana to Alaska.  (50lbs is the maximum you can transport on most carriers, check your carrier's rules before committing to a flight!)  There were no issues from TSA transporting ammo in this box, I've successfully made multiple transports without a single objection.  I did remove the ""Ammo Crate"" sticker, which was easily done, so as to not draw unnecessary attention.These things are very well built, no major concerns about loading them up with 50lbs or more.  The handles are probably a bit underengineered to carry the rated weight comfortably by hand, but at 50lbs, it can be lifted without issue.  Most of the time during transport, you'll want something to assist - a cart, over the shoulder, a hand cart, something - the handles just don't provide much room for grip when manhandling the case about.  Important for me, I was able to secure the box with two padlocks and felt like this was adequate protection for the relatively short period the box would be in other people's hands.50lbs of ammo will easily fit inside the case, I would suspect 70-80lbs would be fine depending on the ammo stored.  I used packing paper to secure the top of the case as 50lbs will not quite fill the entire space and this adequately prevented things from moving about during the flights.  From there, these units make nice storage compartments to keep things relatively secure and organized when stored up.If you're looking for this application, I can heartily recommend them and they should suit you just fine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWJL5Z0J1LVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4XL4HM#wasThisHelpful","R2QWJL5Z0J1LVC","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been into Hi-Fi audio for better than 20 years.  My current main audio system consists of a 1978 pair of Klipsch Lascalas using custom ALK crossovers, a Cary Audio preamplifier, a BelCanto amplifier...connected by relatively high end balanced uplinks and RCA cables.  All of this is driven by Toslink via a media PC I built.  It's about a $11k audio setup and one that will reveal any substandard equipment.My previous high end DAC decided to give up the ghost after 7 years of use, $2 grand down the drain.  :(  These days, I just don't have the carefree budget I used to for audio gear, even though long standing ""wisdom"" in Hi-Fi dictates you should pair reasonably similar caliber equipment together for best results.  I really wanted to see what a ""lower end"" DAC replacement could do for this system as I just didn't have the budget to throw another expensive DAC at my system.  My extensive research brought me to Schiit Audio's line of DAC's, I liked that they seem to focus on connectivity and solid audio instead of trying to be just another expensive alternative.  I was torn between the more expensive Bitfrost and the Modi 2 Uber, ultimately settling on the Modi to really push the ""low end"" concept to its maximum potential.  Considering the Modi 2 Uber is billed as a lower cost, non-upgradable Bitfrost alternative, it seemed worth the shot.Thoughts after burn in?  Just wow.  The Modi 2 Uber literally puts my old $2 thousand dollar DAC to shame...maybe not shame, per se, but it's certainly on par.  I can't even believe that a sub $200 DAC can outpace high end audio gear, musically and with an incredible soundstage!  This DAC is musical, offering a semi analog feel without the lazy, somewhat muddy side effects of analog gear.  The soundstage makes my Lascalas sing like they can, allowing the speakers to resolve clarity and detail like few other drivers can.  I was a bit worried that the DAC might be a bit bright from my research, which can really be a problem on Lascalas...but I'm happy to report clarity without overabundance on the tweeters.  (I will admit my custom crossovers are set to -2db on the tweeters, my preference after extended listening on my old DAC.)  Bass is tight and fast, another problem substandard equipment will reveal on the Klipsch speakers...maybe a little less than my previous high end DAC, but almost better to some degrees.  The midrange, however, are the Lascalas strong point and this DAC makes the horns sing like I expect allowing vocals to come through strong without getting bogged down by anything else.  24/96 recordings really shine with this DAC, something my previous DAC really didn't reveal as much as I had hoped...this was probably my biggest point of happiness.  Compared to my ""not all that old"" DAC, I can hear things now that used to be lost in translation.  I don't know if it's a matter of design, or that audio-centric capacitors and such have significantly improved in the last ten years...but I would say that this DAC is overall maybe 10-20% better than my older one as far as audio quality.  For one tenth the price, that's a sure-fire win for me.Drawbacks?  The supplied power wall wort is a little on the short side...I wish it had a couple more feet of range.  I would have appreciated a slightly higher end power input, but also can't say that the supplied power supply is inadequate for the unit considering its size.  The input selector switch floats a little bit, this isn't an issue to speak of, but some people expect a solid feel on selector switches.  For me, it works and I'm betting it won't be a long term issue.  Other than that, I'd have a hard time coming up with flaws.  I'd prefer a larger footprint, but for a budget DAC designed primarily for headphone use, the smaller footprint makes sense to me and works for the application it's designed for.Overall, I'm totally happy with this DAC and am super pleased I gave Schiit Audio a shot on my system.  Big picture, this DAC will eventually be replaced by a Bitfrost and sent up to my office system...but it solved an immediate need and allowed me to hear Schiit's sonic signature without breaking the bank.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending this DAC for either a headphone setup or Hi-Fi audio scenarios, it's a solid unit for a really fair price and likely better than anything else you can get in a similar price range.  In my opinion, I've thoroughly debunked that price is a considerable factor when it comes to DAC's.  Thank you Jason Stoddard for bringing high end audio at an acceptable price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37WG2Z0ESGVXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUGOAH4#wasThisHelpful","R37WG2Z0ESGVXS","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been working towards getting fully automated watering systems going for our gardens this year.  We use water timers and standard garden hose for our water distribution.  I needed a few hose filters to protect the sprinkler systems as we're on a well and sometimes get a little bit of sediment that makes it through.  I was a little bit dubious as to how well these cheap hose filters would actually work, but I can now confidently state they do an excellent job.Just a couple nights ago, I noticed that one of the hose/sprinkler combos was performing extremely poorly.  I took a look at this filter and found a bunch of organic material that had gotten caught by these filters and was blocking the flow.  I would MUCH rather be able to clean out a filter than I would unclog a sprinkler system from any organic debris that happens to make it into our plumbing!  After a few moments, I was back up to full flow and very happy this cheap investment had protected the rest of the system!I definitely recommend having one or more of these installed on your hoses, especially if you're using well water and don't have a whole house water filter inline with your water supply.

"I've tried several of the alternatives to Nikwax products and every single time I keep coming back.  Although I have probably a half dozen stories to tell about my experience, I only need to relay one fairly recent story to tell you why I trust this (and the other Nixwax products) for most of my waterproof gear.In 2014, we set out for a month long road trip to Alaska in the middle of summer, planning to tent it all the way up and back.  Unbeknownst to us, we made the trek in the wettest summer that pretty much everyone alive could possibly remember, it was wet!  For 30 days straight, it rained 27 of them.  This wasn't your average drip-a-bit then blow over type of rain.  No.  It was torrential downfall followed by a downpour followed by a steady drench thereafter.  It was an unreal bout of rain, like we were living in a rain cloud for a month.All my gear, including my tent, footprint, rain fly and gear's duffel bags were treated with this stuff or other Nikwax products.  It's never a cheap preparation, but in hindsight, it's always worth every penny.  Night after night, my aging camping gear and waterproof clothing were pounded from all sides with unrelenting rain, put away wet only to be brought out into more wet.  What little breaks in the weather we could get usually dried things out just enough to get wet again a few hours later.  We could barely get a break, except for maybe once every 8-10 days or maybe a lucky clearing during setup or teardown of camp.The point?  We stayed mostly dry.  Our clothes, our sleeping gear, our camp gear.  Dry, all of it.  Every night.  Every storm.  It kept one pretty lady awfully happy, and that's no easy feat faced with constant rain!  To be certain, some of it was probably technique as I cut my teeth camping in Oregon where you learn how to deal with rain well before you can afford technical preparations.  But from one rain master to another, the secret to maintaining technical gear for whatever gets thrown at you is Nikwax.  Bottom line, it's proven itself to be my trusted waterproofing material and probably always will be.Is it perfect?  No, it's not going to make Goretex out of nylon no matter how you slice it...but it'll be better than pure nylon, for sure.  Does it help?  Without a doubt.  When your gear is starting to see it's age, will it revive it enough to keep it going?  Yes, and my 20+ year old used and abused Cascade Designs tent that I'd take anywhere, anytime proves it.  Do you need to augment your preparations for rain otherwise?  That's probably a good idea, at a minimum a solid seam seal on all rainfly seams and liberal use of tarps, when needed.I've used this stuff for years and that's only the latest reason I keep coming back for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UZY4MWMCVCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019GLADA#wasThisHelpful","R12UZY4MWMCVCR","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a somewhat experienced home brewer, wine maker and about five years ago, added soda making to the repertoire.  The soda making has been the culmination of years of trying to eliminate high fructose corn syrup from my body completely, preferring natural sweeteners overall.  With the addition of a kegging setup to my brewery, I had a lot more options at my finger tips than my previous ""add yeast and drink before it blows up the bottle"" methods used to provide.  Specifically, I wanted to start looking into syrups that I could add to carbonated water, similar to a ""SodaStream"" but at a ""pro"" level, if you will.I had read a couple recommendations about this book providing syrup recipes, so eventually decided to pick it up.  I was surprised that it didn't only provide syrup recipes, but alternative methods as well such as the traditional yeast/brewing methods for most of the recipes.  This was really nice as it gives you a bit of flexibility in how you want to approach making the soda, particularly making things accessible if you don't have a CO2 setup.This book doesn't disappoint with quantity or variety of the contain recipes...from modern to old, classic to bleeding edge, you're sure to find something you'd enjoy.  I was surprised, compared to other soda books I own, with regard to the diversity of the recipes.  Just a whole lot of options, some of which I would have never thought of and probably make a fine tasting fizzy drink!  It's always a joy to crack open the book when we're planning out a new soda and so far, haven't duplicated a single recipe.  (Not because they're not good...but because there's so much to try!)To be entirely honest, I don't feel I'd be a good judge of the quality of this publication in actually teaching a person how to make home made soda.  Reason being, I'm well versed in transferring liquids, steeping materials and pretty much all the techniques used to bring a batch from material to quality drink.  I skipped over those sections almost entirely, but did note there was some good info on sweeteners and other basic topics.  It might be OK?  I don't honestly know.I can probably say that of the three books I have on the subject, this one is my favorite.  Certainly other books offer some recipes that I wouldn't want to go without, so I appreciate them all, but this one is the most accessible, current and fully featured of them all.  If you're looking to dive into the deep end with home made soda, I wouldn't hesitate recommending this book!

"I purchased this refill kit for the two-pack DampRid containers, also purchased here on Amazon.  I was originally anticipating needing to change out the material every couple months or so, but I'm thrilled to report that I haven't even had to change it once after 6 months.  So, while I haven't technically had to use the bag I purchased as of yet, the original material outperformed my expectations by a long shot.I use the stuff to maintain the moisture levels in a freezer based fermentation chamber.  Prior to it's introduction, I was constantly battling moisture buildup, mold problems and other issues that were directly related to high humidity.  Afterwards, zero problems.  Better yet, I've gotten at least six month's use from the original container, so even on a maintenance schedule and near daily use, one of these bags will easily last me well over a year or more.For the general cost of this stuff, it hardly even makes sense to try and research a DIY alternative...probably wouldn't save you much at all.  I like that...it's not an overpriced chemical that can be bought in bulk for pennies on the dollar, just because you don't know what it is.  (It's calcium chloride, by the way.)  Sure, it costs a bit more than the bulk stuff...but you get a free, identifiable bag and can be relatively sure it hasn't been exposed to the air.It's good stuff.  Their little containers are a pretty good value too.  If you're looking for a way to keep moisture in check, this (or the bulk alternative) will work out just fine for you.  5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHW0PYWXKTG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZZWSVY#wasThisHelpful","RZHW0PYWXKTG3","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After fighting humidity, constant wipe-downs and significant cleaning efforts in the freezer based beer and wine fermentation chamber, I finally decided to look into something that would help control moisture over the long term.  I looked into the electric units but wasn't quite comfortable with their long term reliability and considered this consumable option for a trial run.  Well, I'm into 6 months on my first unit with about 6 10-gallon batches run through the chamber and it's still running well on the original crystals.  The chamber stays dry, whether I'm lagering at just above freezing temps, doing an ale around 62 degrees or even saisons at higher temps.I was most worried that I'd have to constantly be changing out the DampRid material, but so far, that hasn't been a concern.  Even if I went through a 42oz bag twice a year, that would work...but looks like I'm doing much better than that.  At six months, no moisture to report and the stuff looks good, no pooling water or anything.  May just replace once a year or so on a maintenance cycle, certainly economical enough and works out to pennies a day.I did have to reduce my air circulation on the internal fan a fair bit when adding this as it was causing my bubblers to dry up within a day, something that would quickly expose the beer and wine to air.  (At least I know it's working!)  Once I dropped air circulation down to a trickle, I can easily maintain a batch's bubbler for the 2-3 weeks it'll typically stay in the fermentation chamber.  Other than bit of tweaking, they pretty much just sit there and suck the water vapors right out of the air.I don't know how well they'd work in a really humid environment, but these units have saved me a lot of cleaning time and other efforts related to brewing beer...so for that, it gets a win sticker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HX0CYIKKXJPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MPPYU2#wasThisHelpful","R3HX0CYIKKXJPR","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We decided to do our garden starts indoors under artificial light this year to try and get a good jump start on our northern climate.  In years past, we've had to get the timing down just right and after a couple close calls with late winters, it just made sense to bring things into where they can be better controlled.  Amazon, of course, made it easy to get in everything we needed for the right price, too!No indoor system is complete without appropriate ventilation and I was quite relieved to see the old days of squirrel cage fans were largely over.  This inline fan absolutely hit the right price point for me, allowing me to vent the generated heat with ease.  Although we're running a Sun Blade 6 lamp 4' fixture, the heat generated is still someone significant, raising temps to above 90 degrees in no time with no ventilation.  Hooked this up to an STC-1000 temperature controller (cheap temp control, if you're willing to wire it) and was able to evacuate the heat and maintain a specific temperature with just a small bit of work.  I'm currently using passive intake systems, so just the exhaust fan was adequate for my needs.Noise wise, I was hoping for a bit quieter, but it's certainly not anything to be worried about.  If you're going for silent, this might not be up your alley...but for the price, it works and doesn't keep us up at night or cause guests to wonder what's going on in the other room.  Another drawback is there aren't any good mounting points for the fan, so something had to be figured out there...I used bungees and a couple small drilled holes to suspend the fan, further eliminating any noise.  Size-wise, this isn't much larger than the 6"" duct...no dangling protrusions, electrical boxes or anything else to take up space...just a fan in a tube, really.As for longevity, I don't have enough data to report but it's been holding up to regular starts and stops so far.  If anything happens, I'll be sure to update the review...otherwise, expect it's lasted!

"These were on my wish list for a long time, wanted to get away from the bucket and gamma seal storage I was using for brewing grain (primarily base grains) as that method just doesn't scale very well.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely am sold on the gamma seal...but I wanted to avoid using 3 buckets for a single bag of grain.  This system easily tripled my storage capacity in roughly half the overall space, and at the same time improved access, so it was a welcome change to my storage methods!These will fit an entire 50 pound grain bag with much room to spare.  You could probably get away with 1.5 bags if you really pushed it.  I love that they stack on top of one another, I was a bit worried about stability but haven't had any issues to speak of.  It makes storing 150+ pounds of grain in less than 4 square foot quite a reality.  When I get ready for brew day, I just scoop out what I think I'll need, weigh the amount and refine as necessary.  The horizontal access makes getting to the product quite easy and the included scoop was a nice touch, although maybe a little  bit small for my purposes.  I can fairly easily lift an entire unit if needed, but it's not the easiest thing to do.If you're not familiar with the gamma seal, they're a great method of keeping a relatively air-tight system.  This will keep whatever you keep in them fresher for longer, especially when you're working with grains that can have a stable shelf life of a year or two when stored optimally.  Although I can't speak for this particular product, it's the same seal as you can buy for 5 gallon buckets, so I'd expect similar performance.  I've used grain from storage a full year and a half since I bought it without any troubles whatsoever.A couple ownership notes...these are some big containers!  You might want to put some though into where you'll keep these as they're a bit on the large side to have in, say, a hallway.  Also, if you have kids, keeping them in a location where they can't be climbed on or something like that is a good idea...I'd hate to see what would happen if a full container fell on someone.  I wouldn't say that they're inclined to tip over or anything, but they're not super secured either.About the only drawbacks are that they don't have good handles, so moving around a full container can certainly challenge you.  Eventually, I intend to make some polypropelyne straps to help lug the things around when needed.  I also wished the scoop was a bit larger, but I imagine it's just a cost/benefit ratio...if they provided larger scoops, people would want them smaller.  Oh well.

"I've had this battery for over a year now and it's definitely been a worthwhile purchase for me.  The original intent was to charge e-cigs during my smoking cessation process while I was away from a power source, something that happens quite regularly to me.  It worked great for that purpose and kept me topped off at all times.  Well, I've been done with that for quite awhile (yay me!), so it's really just come down to portable cell phone charger and for charging other things that can be powered via USB when access to grid or vehicle power isn't an option.Overall, it's been a really good battery that has held up for a good amount of charge cycles.  I would say that you can't expect the rated mAH values of 15,000 mAH, but that's marketing hype that's used industry wide.  You can expect, though, roughly about 10,000 mAH from this battery and that's a ""real world"" tested result...and to that end, it's still one of the better batteries on the market.  I get about two full cell phone charges from it and I have a big battery that lasts several days on my phone, so that's pretty good.  It takes quite a long time to charge up from empty (~24 hours), but I probably expected that from a relatively low voltage USB charging source.It will likely work with most standard USB devices and I haven't yet found anything that's been incompatible.  Overall, it's been nice to have access to basic USB power when doing things well away from the grid, something I do quite often.  It was really helpful on a month long road trip we took last year and allowed us to top off devices without keeping the truck running to produce a simple 5V charge.  I would say that if 10K mAH is acceptable to you and you see the need for a product like this, I would definitely recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTS75C9XX0WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5T3QK4#wasThisHelpful","R2OTS75C9XX0WS","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never bought under garments online before.  I tried online clothing purchases a couple times with jeans and unfortunately, decided that this was one area where online purchases didn't quite add up for me given that fit is so crucial.  Well, it came time to replace some boxers...and I figured, really, how bad could this get screwed up?Well, turns out you can buy your boxers online.  I think I speak for most guys in that we don't really care about an exact fit about these things...we only care that it doesn't cramp the precious cargo and that they don't hang down to our knees.  We generally know our size, most boxers will fit well enough if you order the right size and it's generally an uneventful purchase that never ends up in a return.  We continue to wear them until they develop holes or the elastic band fails.  Other than that, we don't think about it and we don't want to think about it.I could go into all sorts of detail about how these will make you look good for your honey when you're down to your skiviez, just like the commercial or image on the product's plastic wrap.  But that'd probably be a lie, since if you're the type to focus so much on looking good in your skiviez, you're probably not into your average Hanes mens wear either.  What I can tell you is these work like any other kinds of boxers and maybe even reassure you that buying them online will probably work out as you expect, given you select the right size.  I can maybe save you the agonizing effort of going to the mall to select these things and maybe spare you the completely illogical embarrassment that comes from checking out with your Hanes underwear by some dude (or worse yet, beautiful woman) behind the counter.Nothing further really.  Just a decent set of boxers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9TOWQU6SQ4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACIHDLE#wasThisHelpful","R1C9TOWQU6SQ4C","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I'm on my second one of these.  After a good long while of probably a couple years, the mildew on my older identical Maytex shower curtain had gotten out of control.  I can safely say that this product will not eliminate mildew, but then again, I didn't expect it to either because I realize that would likely be impossible.  Still, it could maybe be considered ""mildew resistant"" and doesn't require a whole lot to keep in maintained for a decent amount of time.  For the price, I'll just choose to replace it when it gets bad...I have no interest in going over a shower current with a brush, bleach water and giving it a thorough cleaning.So, it doesn't live up to the hype...but I didn't believe the hype to begin with, so I'm not really disappointed.  Nonetheless, it's a decent shower curtain, does the job it's intended for and is relatively easy to maintain for a decent amount of time.Fortunately, Amazon still had the same model I had used previously and it was a couple dollars cheaper than when I purchased it previously.  Rather that shop for a different model, wondering if it will fit my shower and risking a potential return, I figured I'd just go with the same exact one so I'd know it fits without incident.  And it does.  I don't really know what else to say about a shower curtain.  It's something you'll use almost every day, barely think about and is only a problem if it fails to keep the water contained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MSY5SJPOZL1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T4ZAX8#wasThisHelpful","R1MSY5SJPOZL1K","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd been wanting to add a drill press to the shop for years, just hadn't wanted to pony up the cash to make it happen.  I'd learned all the little tricks you can use to get precision drilling from a standard handheld drill, so there wasn't any immediate need.  Well, a project came about where there was absolutely no way I was going to do things by hand, the time savings with using a relatively simple and inexpensive drill press would be worthwhile.  I'd had my eye on this unit for at least a couple years...so I knew right where to go.The setup was fairly simple, but also somewhat involved as well.  I felt the procedure was well thought out and the directions were clear enough to follow.  I did experience one mistake (an oversight on my behalf) with assembly which required me to remove the motor assembly again, but it wasn't that big of a deal.  After assembly and checking basic adjustments, I was able to quickly get to work on my project...it came out exactly as I hoped and saved me hours by using the drill press instead of a handheld drill.Why didn't I do this sooner?!?!?!  I've probably used the press more times than I can count in only a few month's ownership.  It's kind of one of those things you can get away without having, but once you have it, it becomes indispensable and I use it all the time.As for the quality, I'd say it's good enough for most basic shop applications.  Run out was OK from the factory, maybe not perfect, but good enough for my needs that include things like setting dowels, bolt holes and the like.  The chuck is of decent quality and I like that there's a place to store an easily lost chuck key.  I find it quite easy to set the height of the support table and the stop setting that controls how far the bit will go into your workpiece.  About the only thing that I find less than desirable is the bevel setting for the support table.  Put simply, to get a precision setting at a particular degree is a bit of a pain...you have to loosen then tighten a support bolt that keeps the support table's bevel.  No big deal except two things - one, the bolt is hard to access with common wrenches I typically have lying around the shop and two, when you tighten the bolt, the support table has a tendency to move to a different angle and requires readjustment.  Nonetheless, I don't do a ton of angled drilling, so it's only a minor inconvenience to me as I have it in the 90 degree position most of the time.The power settings from the factory are good, but it's nice to able to adjust if needed.  I was kind of hoping for a switch or rotary dial to get this adjustment, but turns out you have to reset the belt on different pulleys.  Not a big deal and the area is fairly easily accessed, marked with a nice label that shows you RPM's based on the pulleys you use.  It takes a minute or two, not a big deal.There is a limitation with this press.  The base simply won't go down enough to permit materials sized about maybe 4-6 inches, depending on the drill bit you use and how far you can get it into the chuck.  I used a 4x4 fence post for a project and could barely get it in there, without much wiggle room.  If you're drilling into large pieces, this unit might not work for you...but as a general press, it works well enough.4 stars.  Minus one for the minor run out, the beveled table adjustment issues and a somewhat restrictive work space.  Still, a good press for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BOM1NZ93YQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LSSS0W#wasThisHelpful","R27BOM1NZ93YQE","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tape kit is both a good value and a useful thing to have around.  I use plenty of the black electrical tape, but had a particular application where colored tape would be beneficial for color coding purposes.  I decided to purchase this set of various colors and have been glad I did.  It's easy to identify what I need with the various colors marking both ends so I can quickly and easily tell what goes to what without retracing it every single time.  Ultimately it saves me time and in the end, that will be worth whatever this costs.I was impressed with how much electrical tape you get in this kit for a reasonable price per roll.  Each roll is definitely 60' and the ten varieties give you a bunch of color configuration options.  If you need more identification requirements, it's easy to double wrap things like red-yellow, red-blue, red-white, etc giving you nearly unlimited potential.  The tape is of reasonable quality and operates as you would expect any standard electrical tape to work.Although this kit will probably last me for many years to come, if I need more, I would definitely buy this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYHH9RX9JSB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00563P4KW#wasThisHelpful","R3FYHH9RX9JSB2","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I now own six of these to maintain temperatures in various applications, like brewing, cheese making and even indoor gardening.  I have found them to be inexpensive, reliable and provide an incredible value compared to other commercial solutions.  The devices provide precision temperature control turning a heat source or cooling source on or off to maintain a specific temperature.  It can be used with virtually any 110V device that draws less than 10 amps of power.You probably do need to be aware, if you're not all ready, that this unit requires custom wiring and potentially fitting for your particular application...it is not a ""ready to go"" device.  That said, the circuitry required to get it going is rather simple overall.  The instructions provide the detail needed for someone who's familiar with relay operations (like myself), but if you're not into electronics, you might need to hunt for the various instructions you can find online.  Once you figure it out, though, you'll be able to build a nice temperature controller for a fraction of the price otherwise.  I definitely recommend installing a fuse as this is an important component of any electrical device...especially because the applications we typically use them in involve liquids.The units that I've ordered (via City Digital) were not compatible with the STC-1000+ firmware that's out there, but that hardly affects the operation overall.  It does have the programming pins, so maybe it would work, but it's v1.1 hardware and STC-1000+ is built for v1.0 hardware.  I haven't tried this, but would be interested to see if it works or could be made to work.  Maybe someday...will provide an update if I go there.It's true that the unit will only support Celsius display.  As an American, the Fahrenheit system is firmly implanted into my brain, but it's actually been kind of nice getting familiar with Celsius on a more regular basis.  (I don't struggle with mental conversions any longer since I reference my C-F/F-C chart quite often!)  Also, these are only good to 10 amps, so you need to have a good idea of your electrical load and whether it exceeds that.  For me, using space heaters, fans, fermwraps and freezers have worked without incident, although I have checked the electrical load on all of the devices I've connected to it.If you're looking for an inexpensive temp control solution and you're willing to put a bit of effort into it to save some money, these units will be right up your alley!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEC06SF3EPMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KVCPH2#wasThisHelpful","R2WEC06SF3EPMT","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a high quality PVC hose to be used (for most people) in shop applications, particularly dust control.  It probably has other uses that can be considered, but that's the application for me.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it originally, but have been absolutely pleased with the quality and long term reliability it's provided.I maintain a relatively small and mobile wood shop and use various slip fittings to attach this hose to my 4"" ducts on both my jointer and planer.  On the other end, I reduce it down to 2.5"" to make it compatible with my shop vac based dust collection system that includes a Dust Deputy.

"I have to say that this purchase turned out to be a really good one.  I'd wanted a cast iron set for camping for years, but had always been put off by the price and care required to maintain cast iron.  I eventually got over the latter, and with the price of this kit, who can say no?I've used this set for about a year now...we do a lot of camping and cooking every year, whether it's setting up a tent in the national forests or using forest service cabins all winter long in the relatively harsh Montana winters.  This kit (or parts of it) have gone with on all those trips and has been good to us and our food every step of the way.  We've done cobblers, chili, traditional American breakfasts, enchiladas...dozens and dozens of ethnic and traditional foods and enjoyed using this cast iron kit every time.  Whether setting it up in on a campfire, using a cook stove or even wood fired cooking stoves, it's been a reliable companion to have along the way.  About the only complaint so far is that they're heavy...duh...it's cast iron!  I expect these to last for years and years to come, maybe even a lifetime...who knows?Overall, this kit is a much better value overall than the piece meal approach...but you do need to consider whether the contained items will work well for your purposes.  We did accessorize our units with some of the other Lodge products. This certainly isn't a necessity, but some are nice to have.  In particular, the silicone handles and lid lifter have been essential additional tools we added to the kit.  Other than those, this kit's been pretty much complete and hasn't required any further augmentation.We did re-season the units after it was received and just again recently for the new season.  This is definitely a benefit overall and we would recommend learning about the procedure as it's a necessary component to maintaining cast iron for the long term.  If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive cast iron kit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this kit in particular.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KOXOJCILKYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QM8SLG#wasThisHelpful","R35KOXOJCILKYW","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I probably know better than to write a review when I'm ticked off, but right now...I'm ticked off at this saw.  I've used the 450 for probably close to 16 hours, been a fine saw.  I've had a couple minor issues with it, but nothing like I am now.  I've been able to fell good size trees, recover quite a bit of firewood and generally keep my forested property well maintained.  The saw was plenty powerful for what I needed and felt comfortable for a day's hard work.  I was excited to finally have a Husqvarna...all seemed well.Previously, my biggest issue has been undocumented procedures when it comes to replacing the chain.  It's possible to get the thing where you can't put it back together because there's a critical step missing in the manual.  Before changing the chain, you have to set the brake (missing in the manual, only marginal common sense), otherwise, when you put the thing back together, the clutch won't engage right and you'll spend two or three hours wondering what you did wrong.  No where in the manual is the procedure to fix this...I had to look online for my symptom and only then did I find some forum post about how to resolve this frustrating event.  It's not an intuitive procedure and you'll feel like you're going to break the saw...but it does work and does finally go back together.The other issue I have is that this particular model, the 450, is that it's combined with other models in the manual.  This type of thing normally doesn't present major difficulties, but in this saw's case, the dissimilarities between models could present some challenges.  There are physical differences as well as location differences for major systems, such as the chain adjustment, than what's documented in the manual...more of a pet peeve, but I want my manual to explain the product that I bought, not just a representation of what I bought.This brings us to now and why I'm going on an utter rage against this saw and only give it one star.  The problem is, I just had a goodly little thunderstorm and I have a fairly large tree down right in my driveway and it's blocking access in and out of my house to the point of impassable.  I leave tomorrow for a month long road trip with hardly any extra time, no big deal...I'll just fire up the saw and deal with the remains when I get back.  I spent two hours trying to start the saw to no avail, finally had to say to heck with it and start hauling a ton of heavy gear 1/4 mile to the truck.  Tried again and again.  No dice, no matter the start up procedure I use.  Now, I'm not unfamiliar with this saw...I've started it probably hundreds of times without difficulty, so this is decidedly abnormal. I've replaced the fuel, checked for spark, tried a carb spray start and yanked on it a hundred times...but I can't get the thing to turn over.  Frankly, if a saw fails me when I need it the most (right NOW!), it's getting sold and I'll buy something else that isn't a Husqvarna.  I've looked on the reviews here and found people requiring repairs due to no-start after only a short amount of use...probably the case here as well.  I won't even bother, I'll just let someone else deal with this expensive letdown and get something that won't let me down when I need it the most.My opinion is probably biased 'cause I'm really really mad right now.  It's a good saw when it works, but if your life and livelihood depend on it like I do, then it's a serious flaw when it's not working as expected.Edit:  Cooler heads eventually prevailed and I opted to take this into the shop, because while it was running, it was a fine and enjoyable saw to use.  Something or another was adjusted and voila, the saw starts fine now.  I did end up buying a slightly smaller backup saw to clear the above mentioned tree, and in the event this issue happens again.  Wish I didn't have to do that for a saw with just over 16 hours on it.  (And thus why I won't change my review stars.  Had I been on the other side of the tree, I would have dealt with the saw a lot less humanely!)  Bottom line is I need that level of operational trust with a saw to live where I do, gotta be able to cut your way out if it comes to that!  I probably could have pursued a warranty claim, but it wasn't that much to service it...the point was having to service it after just over a couple full day's work on it.  Seems I'm just waiting for the next day for it to break down again...but if it doesn't for a few years, I might come back and edit my review again.Ultimately, I don't not recommend this saw, it is a pretty good one and certainly gets the job done.  Just maybe something not to stake your livelihood or survival on, without an adequate backup anyway.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VP3TANQBFWH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DO1OMK#wasThisHelpful","R1VP3TANQBFWH3","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can't complain here.  I had to do a little hunting for this item, mainly because it's the single adapters that come up commonly for DVI to HDMI searches here on Amazon.  The single priced units are slightly overpriced, but this two pack got things right around where I wanted the price to be.  (Much more value than buying two separately.)  Overall, this does what I expected it to...convert a DVI signal from a video card into an HDMI input for my two monitors.  I love that I've been able to postpone upgrading my somewhat long DVI extension cables to HDMI with the use of these adapters.  I do wish that these had a way to secure the HDMI side to what you're connecting it to, but I've never seen this as part of the HDMI specifications, so I'd consider that normal I suppose.

You simply load up the rice, load up the water to the recommended fill level..set it to on and a bit later you have perfect rice.  I love having this unit because it lets me focus on other cooking efforts entirely...rice is no longer a process which I have to keep a watchful eye over.

"I've been using this ultrasonic for the better part of six months and have been pleased with it...I've used it probably a hundred times on various items and the results are perfectly acceptable to me.  I originally thought about purchasing a slightly lower end model, but then ultimately decided on this unit.  I'm glad I did.  What I liked about this model over it's less expensive competitors is the ability to run a decently long cycle (480 seconds) and adjust the power levels for what you're trying to clean.  Sensitive items might require a more gentle cleaning, so it's nice to be able to step the power down if needed.  I've found many uses for the unit, much more than I originally anticipated.  The size of the unit is acceptable for my purposes, might be nice to have a little more room (or even a lot more), but it's not likely to find a larger size with an associated budget price.  The included watch/CD holders are a nice little bonus...but I definitely like the included plastic tub thing, makes it nice to remove the washed items for rinsing and such.

"I've been using this stuff for quite a few years for washing technical garments, but mostly use it to keep my tent in clean and working order at least once every year or two.  I know that some people say never to wash a tent in a machine, but I've been doing it ever since I bought my front loader quite awhile ago with excellent results.  What I do is clean out the machine really well with a clean cycle and bleach, run a pure-water load (to clean any residual bleach) and then load up garments or tent with two cap's worth of Nikwax on a delicate cycle.  After it's done and clean to my satisfaction, I then re-waterproof the garment/tent with Nikwax waterproofing that's appropriate, and maybe seam seal again if necessary.  I run my gear all year long, in rain/sun/snow, and don't really have any performance problems with restoring a good deal of water protection to my gear with the above method.  One of the smaller bottles will give you three or so washes, but if you have hard water, you might only be able to pull off two loads.My most recent experience was restoring a tent's rain fly that I inadvertently failed to dry properly after I got home.  There were a few spots that were starting to take hold upon a subsequent inspection...but once I realized my error, I took to the above method and all is back to good condition.  My best testimony, though, is that I was able to take an older Cascade Design tent into hundreds of uses over the course of almost 15 years...thanks to a high quality, delicate technical wash like this.

"I was seeking a relatively inexpensive backup headlamp to bring with on the trail and camping.  This certainly fit the bill price-wise as I was able to find it on a pretty good sale at the time of purchase.  The lamp is fairly powerful, definitely providing adequate light for most things I do in the dark.  I did like the various settings, particularly one that provides a good vertical (up/down) spread of light as this helps when you're doing something that requires a bit of lighting above and below your head at the same time.  The battery life is OK, maybe not the best I've seen, but so far has proven to be adequate powering through multiple nights without replacement.  Comfort wise, no problems there...just like most headlamps, it's a fairly comfortable fit and can be adjusted for a larger head like mine.  I did notice that there's a bit more light bleed that has a tendency to get in your eyes than other headlamps I own, but it hasn't been too problematic for me at all.  Overall, for a budget headlamp who's primary purpose is to backup my primary lamp, I have few if any real complaints to speak of.  I wouldn't have any issues if I had to rely on this as a primary lamp, either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W995XNVK3NVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MFK7H2#wasThisHelpful","R1W995XNVK3NVQ","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly popular burner choice amongst home brewers and that also was my purpose with it.  For me, I integrated these burners into a custom built stand, just simply didn't want the hassle of creating an integrated burner.  I was looking for an option that if some day I wanted to do integrated burners I can, and this fits the bill...the burners can be removed from the rest of the burner assembly.  I have two of them that I use, one for my hot liquor tank and the other for my boil.  I've built a custom propane pipe to distribute propane to both burners with unique flow controls for each burner and can run both just fine on a single regulator.Overall, I haven't noticed the issues that others mentioned about performance.  I'm able to easily get a 12-13 gallon batch boiling in no time, hardly takes much time at all.  I do have to keep things turned up a bit to get there, but it's not really that much of an impact as I do expect to use some fuel to get that much liquid to boiling temps.  I find the stability of the burners supreme using a 15 gallon keg as my kettle, never has there been a concern about it's ability to securely hold my equipment.  Performance with some winds about does get a little challenging, but nothing a quick rip of aluminum foil can't fix...but winds can challenge any burner out there.  Conductivity of heat hasn't been a big problem, I set these on a wooden stand and haven't had any issues with burns or marks on the wood.  I really have come to like these and they've performed admirably for well over a couple years across several dozen batches.When you first turn these things on, expect the paint to burn off.  It's a bit unpleasant, but overall, goes fairly quick and never needs done again.  Other than that, not much to it...fire it up and go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37US588FM82EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B7USOM#wasThisHelpful","R37US588FM82EO","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I drive a 1995 Nissan Pathfinder with 260 thousand miles on it and still going strong with no signs of motor malfunction.  This is the oil I use, the oil I trust and given the mileage I've been able to sustain, it appears to be working pretty well.  I'm not so sure about the idea of using synthetics in an aging vehicle like mine, so I just go with what the manufacturer specifies...and it works just fine.  Yeah, I have to change every 3-5K miles...but it feels good to clean out that engine anyway.  Overall, I run a pretty leak free vehicle...although I have taken the necessary precautions to replace my rear main seal, front oil seals and valve gaskets when it's needed...that's part of the love that's required to take a vehicle into old age like I have.Sometimes, when a good sale comes on, Amazon is actually cheaper than a lot of your local auto shops for this oil.  Other times, not as much.  If you consider actually driving to the store, it might even be cheaper to have FedEx or UPS just deliver it to your house...at least it is for me anyway since I live a ways out in the country.  It's purchases like oil where I consider the value of a Prime membership beneficial...it saves me a few bucks from having to go into town and is super convenient!Quick oil tip?  Don't just assume you need 10W30 or 10W40...or whatever Jiffy Lube recommended at some point...they have no idea what they're doing.  Look it up for your vehicle and use the specified oil!

"When I was looking to add a couple torque wrenches to my tool kit, I was a little concerned about this less-than-reviewed model.  Turns out, there was nothing to be concerned about.  As you're probably aware, shopping for a torque wrench, quality matters.  CDI is kind of an off-shoot of the well recognized SnapOn brand, but at a comparatively less expensive price.  This was the grade I was going for...somewhere in between a cheap tool (better than say, Craftsman) and less the professional mechanic option...and this one has fit the bill.When you start considering where torque wrenches begin and end in their capabilities, it's important to have a good range.  It's also well known that torque wrenches are more accurate in the middle of their specified range, less so at the ends of the rated ranges.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so more than likely, you're looking at least two torque wrenches if you're going to work on a vehicle...the most common application for a torque wrench.  For me, the two torque wrenches I settled on were a CDI 30-250 foot pound 1/2"" drive 2503MFRPH and this CDI 10002MRPH.  This unit gets me from around 12 foot pounds up to about 80 foot pounds, values commonly found on smaller bolts and nuts.  The other wrench gets me upwards of 50 foot pounds up to a good 200 foot pounds, used for larger nuts, lug nuts and bolts.  I've found that they compliment each other quite well and really don't have anything that I haven't been able to torque with the ranges these two wrenches provide.As far as accuracy, I don't have any professional testing equipment or anything...but it feels about right to me.  I've torqued plenty of bolts that hold liquids and haven't had leaks or strips, as well as precision torquing on things like hubs without issue.  So I guess that's what really matters...results, right?  Some people might find it a pain to convert to inch pounds, when most everything is stated in foot pounds...but I convert it once, write it down in my maintenance manual and never have to figure it out again.  My certification sticker was about 6 months old when I purchased, so I imagine it sat on a shelf for awhile...but six months wasn't going to bother me.  It's held up for more than a year with good care and I don't see any problems in the future, aside from maybe a recalibration every once in awhile.Overall, I think this is a good choice for a value priced, low to medium strength torque wrench.  If you're looking to fill out that lower range, don't overlook this model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EM9KG4RVELC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00461347U#wasThisHelpful","R29EM9KG4RVELC","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this miter stand quite a bit now and feel I have a pretty good feeling for it's strengths and shortcomings.  I was doing a bit of a shop re-organization and refresh in 2013 and wanted to do something about my miter station, which was really just a simple shop table I'd built a few years ago.  I was strongly considering building an enhanced miter station, but considered this as a relatively inexpensive option that might work as well.  It just so happened that a pretty good sale came along for this unit and that was the decider right there...my material costs in a custom built stand would exceed the cost of a relatively ready-to-go solution.  So I pulled the trigger.Overall, I'm very pleased with the stand.  Paired up with my DeWalt miter saw, I've cut short and long lengths quite extensively with it and have had few issues.  I really like that it can extend quite a ways out there and will easily handle 12, 16 and even 20 foot lengths with ease.  It's very sturdy and leaves a lot of open space that can be used otherwise, an important feature in my relatively compact wood shop where every cubic foot counts.  The height of the saw is at a very comfortable level for me, so no issues there.  The unit is relatively light weight and therefore easily moved around.  The saw can be easily removed for storage, if needed, and the unit folds up into a nice, compact design.  Although I rarely tear down my miter station, this has come in handy a couple times and far exceeds what I might have been able to achieve with a custom built miter stand.  I don't have any concerns about the craftsmanship, materials or operation of the stand whatsoever.Now, the drawbacks.  As has been stated before in other reviews, the stops are flimsy and don't stop the wood with precision.  This is a bit irritating since you're usually relying on these stops to get repeated cuts with absolute precision.  If you're not careful, you can get a bit of variance when you push the wood up against the stop (up to around 1/8""), which is easily the difference between a cut fitting or not.  I wrenched down on the hardware and it doesn't completely eliminate the play.  I've found ways to work with the issue, so it's not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice if DeWalt had thought this through a bit more.  The other drawback is that there is a space between the saw itself and the stop where you can't get a good cutting stop.  (I don't recall the exact length, but it's somewhere around 12 to 16 inch cuts where you can't get a good stop.)  I've had to solve this with some creative clamping and such, so again not a deal breaker, but I was hoping a commercial solution wouldn't have issues I could likely solve in a self-built solution.Looking back, I am glad I made the purchase and the mobility/storage option definitely makes me glad I purchased this over building my own miter station.  The drawbacks to the design do have solutions, so it's workable...but DeWalt definitely loses a star for the lack of precision stops, a pretty big oversight in my opinion since it fails to perform it's desired function accurately.  Overall, I'd recommend this stand...but see if you can get it on a good sale!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GD0DL03OTHTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RPY3FM#wasThisHelpful","R1GD0DL03OTHTO","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are pretty straight forward, so I'll keep my comments somewhat brief.  You'll obviously need this, usually for a workshop, to clamp down your typical 4"" dust collection ports to a fitting, device or coupler.  As for my experience, it's been overall pretty good and haven't had any issues to report.  I really like the finger nut, it does a good job getting nice and tight and I haven't had any loose fittings...which I suppose is the metric you'd judge a hose clamp on.  I definitely prefer this design, although I will admit I don't often remove the clamp as I've used primarily friction based fittings for moving my hose.  The other good thing is you get quite a few for the money, so it's a pretty good value overall.  I only needed a couple for my purposes, but have a few spares in case they break or I extend my dust collection needs at some point in the future.

"I bought a set of these to outfit my Lodge cast iron.  Although a couple mitts or pot holders work just fine, I thought it might be nice to have a silicone handle to kind of add a bit of character to the pans.  Overall, I suppose I'm pleased and they do the job just fine.  I've had them near sources of direct heat and haven't had any problems, although when I place the pans on the fire I do remove them in the interest of keeping them for the long term.  They work like typical silicone and tend to reduce the heat transfer, but I still find it necessary to use a good hot pad...just not necessarily three layers of hot pads.  My only real issue is they're somewhat a loose fit on my pans and you have to make sure your grip is nice and strong.  I suppose this was done on purpose to allow easy installation and removal...so for that it makes sense.  But, it does tend to create a bit of instability, not what you want when handling hot foods and a hot pan.  That's my only real issue...but it hasn't created too much of a problem so far.

"I have two of these now and haven't had a single problem in over a year's worth of ownership.  I originally bought this to replace a failing Kitchenaid opener that simply failed after somewhat moderate use.  Being satisfied, I bought another EZ-DUZ-IT for my camp kit.  I've easily opened hundreds of cans in that time and it's just as capable as it was the day I got the first one.  It's able to completely remove the lid without leaving ""hangers"" or metal bits behind, so that's a huge plus.  I don't know what else to say...it's an old school design, but it works well and seems to be a bit more reliable (so far) than other modern designs that I've tried.  I don't really care what my can opener looks like, I care that it opens cans...and it does just this.  Reliably, consistently and without incident.  Would highly recommend the EZ-DUZ-IT.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6WPUSB16SFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AWCI8M#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6WPUSB16SFD","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was probably after I'd bent my 100th ground stake that I decided to go searching for an upgraded design.  I don't know why it never occurred to me earlier.  I've had a chance to use these stakes in several conditions, from grassy areas to typical ground to heavy rock/root terrain and so far, no problems.  I'm not one of those silly folks that brings a hammer with to pound in a ground stake...I just find the nearest suitable rock and get it done.  These have held up to the pounding and don't bend when I hit a rock or a tree root.  I've experienced winds up to about 30MPH so far and no problems with the tent uprooting.  That's the point, that's what it does and therefore was worth the (relatively) high price tag associated with them.  About the only drawback I can think of is they didn't come with a nice stuff sack to contain them, but I had one (or 10) that worked just fine.  I'm considering adding another set for staking out my rain fly, since the eight that come was just enough to secure my tent and I still have to use my old (comparatively lame) stakes for that job.

"I own about a dozen of these 9x9 pans and use them heavily for freezer cooking.  Overall, I'm really pleased with both the price and the quality of these pans.  The build quality is decent enough and the non-stick coating has held up to dozens of uses.  I'm not sure about really long-term as I've only had my oldest units for about a year, but so far so good with decent care.  I love the plastic lids, they make tossing them into the freezer a piece of cake and it keeps a relatively good enough seal to prevent freezer burn.  (If I'm super concerned, I'll add a layer of saran wrap.)  I can easily fit a bunch in my chest freezer, although they do take up the space quite quickly.  The best part, though, is that they stack wonderfully for storage...both the lids and the pans themselves.  Even with a dozen of them, they barely take up much space in the cupboard...so that's pure win for me.

"I needed to replace some aging rope and paracord in my outdoor kit and found these on Amazon.  Now, admittedly, I'm not using this cord to decelerate from terminal velocity and suspend my body from a parachute at eight thousand feet...so I don't have any comments in that regard.  I mostly use paracord for rigging tarps and suspending food/packs up in the trees, since I live in bear country.  I haven't been attacked by bears or gotten too wet yet, so it works well in that regard.  I also use it around the house for odd jobs where a decent weight rope is needed.  I heavily use it for making stuff sacks and self closing sacks with a simple cord lock and also practice tying various types of knots here and there.  I originally ordered 100 feet just to check it out, but soon after put in an order for another 300 feet since I was satisfied with the quality.  The lengths were measured accurately and the price was right for me and my needs.  If you need shorter lengths, just order the 100' lengths, cut to your desired length and burn the ends with a lighter...it's more economical that way and you'll have plenty left over.

"I was seeking to replace a couple of older, worn out USB cables for charging and general connectivity.  Overall, these aren't bad cables and do seem to be of reasonably high quality.  Both connectors seem to be well fastened and protected, meaning they should hold up for a good deal of time.  They function for charging and data connectivity without any troubles, so no complaints there.The issue I have with these is that the micro-USB end doesn't fit properly into a couple of my devices.  The issue is that the micro-USB piece is either too short, or more likely, the large plastic connector just doesn't fit into a recessed charging port at all.  Logically so, the USB standards don't really dictate the actual cable or connector's size, it's just the physical port connection type that is standardized.  Compared to other cables I have, the plastic part is noticeably larger than my other compatible cables.  The point is that I want a couple cables to fit all my devices, not one cable for this and another for that.  I ended up having to replace these with an alternate cable just to get cables that would fit all my devices without trouble.I wouldn't say they're bad cables...they're actually very nice and I would recommend them.  It's just the size of the connector and that I had to replace them with cables that did work that makes it a pain point for me.  If you have deep recesses in your devices, you may need to hunt elsewhere.Edit:  The manufacturer was kind enough to respond to my complaint.

"I have an older Coleman grill stove that unfortunately didn't have any model number printed on the unit.  It's probably an early to mid 90's model with a blue top.  I opted to take the chance, assuming that the designs haven't changed significantly over the years.  Sure enough, my stove fits this carry case perfectly with some room to spare for the griddle I added here a few years back.Overall, the quality seems pretty good and should last for years to come.  I inspected the unit for weak seams and possible points of failure and thankfully, didn't find anything outstanding.  Convenience wise, I'm glad to finally have a handle (yes, that's a pun) on my stove's portability...it's always been kind of a large, awkward thing to tote around.  It provides a pretty good degree of protection to the stove, not that the Coleman stoves need it as they're pretty much bullet proof to begin with...it's more about the portability.  The propane holders are probably unnecessary, but I suppose a nice addition and it does make it nice to be mostly all inclusive.  The best part, though, is that the stove can be easily stored where I want it...vertically, horizontally...and I can easily string it up on a tree to practice proper bear safety in areas where that's a concern.  I don't think I'd want to tote this thing for miles on end, but for a reasonable walk-in camp site, it fits the bill just fine.  Overall, it's turned out to be one of my favorite additions to my camp kit in awhile.As some mentioned, there really aren't ""two versions"" of the case.  One is for just a stove, one is for a grill and stove.  If you have the griddle/grill part, you need this.  If you just have a two burner stove, the other one is probably what you need.

"If you're seeking to teach yourself the craft behind fly fishing, this book should be on your radar.  You need to know, though, that this book is not the most thorough of introductory books available on the subject and a true beginner might be better served with others.First, the good.  Peter's work is very accessible.  The visual presentation of the material is by far the best out there.  Each of the patterns is rated for difficulty, the types of fish each pattern will catch, the recipe/materials that are required and a step-by-step how-to for each pattern is provided.  Every pattern provided has a detailed close-up picture of the fly, large process photos for the critical steps and references to other patterns that utilize the same techniques.  There are 14 core techniques shown in depth, all of which are important to know in order to tie a variety of flies.  Peter covers the basics of the tools and materials that are available to the fly tier.  If you also purchase his ""Fly Tying Bible,"" I thought it was great that there is not very much overlap of the patterns in each book, and where there is, it's presented as an alternate pattern.  Overall, it's enough information to get started in fly tying, but there's a lot more to know.Now the bad.  In my opinion, this book will only take a true beginner so far, but will leave them hanging in too many places.  Starting with materials, I had a lot of questions about the various materials out there and in my opinion, the necessary depth isn't in this book.  Frankly, a book that doesn't explain the difference between a cape and a saddle to a beginner is missing the boat.  Also, there is no truly helpful information about hooks, which is probably the most intimidating subject when it comes to fly tying.  Those themes are consistent for all the materials he presents.  While the core techniques are great, I found some of them entirely inaccessible.  For example, when I was trying to learn how to whip finish, this book failed me whereas another helped me get it permanently in about two minutes.  The patterns are not organized in any kind of way that will help you build upon your skills...figuring that out is left up to the reader and that expertise should not be placed on the beginner.  The materials list for each pattern is typically good, but there are some inconsistencies in the hook types.  Some are spelled out (e.g. 1xl dry fly, standard wet), yet others just don't have that detail and appear to have gotten past the editor.There's a critical review up here that he does call for a lot of various materials and that is true.  Very true.  If you follow his instructions, you'll go broke on hooks alone.  What's important to understand about tying flies, and Peter does nothing to tell you this, is that it's a creative outlet and you have a lot of flexibility, as long as you have a more in depth understanding of the various materials out there.  That will only come with research well outside the scope of this book.  For example, the beginner only really needs rabbit fur and micro-fine dubbing, these are your basic wet and dry dubbings...there's no need for ""antron"" or ""hare-tron.""  You don't need 80 different kinds of hooks - dry fly (14 & 16), wet fly/nymph (12 & 14) and 3XL streamer hooks (8 or 10) are typically enough for the beginner, though some patterns will work better with longer versions of those hook types, like bead head patterns.  You don't need to go buy a specific hackle to make a specific tail - use a turkey biot or a pheasant tail instead.What this really is an addendum to Peter's other pattern book, ""The Fly Tying Bible.""  If you look at it as a pattern book, not a beginner's book, then it will serve you well and is worth having on the tying desk.  Pick up the spiral bound version (you'll thank me for it) if you're looking for inspiration and patterns...but look elsewhere if you really want to understand the skills surrounding fly tying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EB3915OTZ32Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764158457#wasThisHelpful","R1EB3915OTZ32Y","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many out there who would recommend this book to beginners.  While it certainly does have the information to help a beginner get on their feet when it comes to fly tying, this is more of a book to pick up when you have the basic skills and knowledge of materials down.  This is more of a book of patterns than it is an introduction that will truly teach you the skills you need to tie flies.  It's important to have a reasonable understanding of materials and methods before you can just jump right in and tie these flies up.  This book, while it tries to go into the basics, just doesn't have the depth to truly help the beginner fly tier.That said, it's an excellent book.  It will give you the recipes for virtually all the most important patterns out there and even some of the lesser known ones.  I love that it classifies them by types of fish each fly is for and provides a reference to this information in the back of the book.  It's broken out into very logical sections - dry flies, nymphs, streamers, hairwings and wet flies.  The information for each fly pattern is easily accessible and quick to scan through for inspiration.  For a serious beginner or even a seasoned tier, this is probably one of the most important books to have on your tying desk.  Do yourself the favor and get the spiral bound version, it's worth it.  Although this book focuses primarily on the freshwater trout flies, you'll find a few for char, sea trout, grayling and salmon.  All of the information is presented beautifully and in a very accessible manner.Aside from the fact that it's not a true beginners book, I do have a few critiques about it.  First, there are some inaccuracies with the difficulty ratings for each fly.  For example, the book presents the wooly bugger and the F-Fly as three and four star rated difficulty.  This can't be right because they're some of the simplest flies to tie.  Second, I wish he would have provided more accurate and consistent details about hook selection.  Although I realize there's a creative aspect to this, some patterns will just say ""10-16 hook"" when it should probably say wet-hook or dry-hook.  I would also agree with some of the critical reviews that he calls for a great variety of materials.  What's important to know, and isn't explained, is that you can easily substitute similar materials.  (You don't HAVE to get yellow antron, you can use nearly any yellow dubbing as long as you understand what's good for dry versus wet.)  For the beginner, the six pictures per fly may not be sufficient to get you from beginning to end, although he does verbally explain each step.Even with all that, it's still probably one of the most important books to have in your arsenal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWE3448MYQKZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764155504#wasThisHelpful","RWE3448MYQKZS","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up fly tying this year and in preparation, picked up several beginner books, including this one.  At first, I think I was a little put off by this book and read the others I had since the others were perhaps a little better illustrated or had more patterns.  As I grew into the craft, however, I found myself constantly seeking this one out to better explain the methods and to discover where I was going awry.  This one quickly became the beginner book that took me from cursory, surface knowledge to actual skill.You won't find a beginner book out there on this topic that goes into the depth that Charlie Craven's ""Basic Fly Tying"" does.  While some may not find this important at first, when you find yourself actually trying to learn how to whip finish, you'll absolutely appreciate the difference between the descriptions and pictorials in this book versus the others.  When you're seeking methods to get control over your thread and materials, none of the other books out there will help you.  This one will give you a half dozen ways to practice thread control.  This is the only book I've read that actually teaches you about hooks.  He doesn't just tell you there's a lot of hooks out there and to figure it out, but rather he goes into the sizing conventions used and why you might choose one over another.  If you're truly looking for a path that will take you from knowing nothing to working with a fly that contains a half dozen materials or more, this is the one that will take you down that road.The book is laid out in a very intelligent way.  It first discusses the tools of the trade, arguably the most important topic to getting started.  He'll not only provide his recommendations, but explains why he recommends what he does.  From there, he discusses some, but not all of the materials and techniques out there.  After that, he jumps into some basic flies.  Start there.  I didn't, struggled with beginner mistakes and realized it was because I didn't have the appropriate foundation of knowledge.  I finally saw the light of Charlie's introductory methods.  After you practice some of the basic flies, he goes into more materials and then finally provides a structured path to fly tying mastery with more patterns, each progressively more difficult.  While he teaches you how to tie specific flies, more importantly, he's teaching you the skills to tie alternate patterns that use the same methods.  He even shows you the pictures and materials needed to tie those alternate patterns.The pictures in this book may not be award winning, but they are certainly the most thorough.  While other books might give you six or so steps in visual form, Charlie's book practically shows you every single step.  While the text is dense, especially in the first few chapters, there are many golden nuggets of information contained within that you will experience depth of knowledge.  This book doesn't just stand as a beginner's book to fly tying, it's practically a reference you could use your entire life.  This book isn't a book of patterns, although it certainly provides that purpose.  It's probably the best introduction to fly tying that a reader could use to teach themselves the skill, beginning to end.I highly recommend this book if you're seeking to teach yourself the craft behind fly fishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M4DR7VOA9YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979346029#wasThisHelpful","R37M4DR7VOA9YF","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying that I'm a Canon fan.  Three out of four of my current digital cameras, including both my DSLR's, are Canon.  When I was looking to upgrade my compact zoom, this unit caught my eye for both its price point and its feature set.  For a sub-$200 compact zoom, this camera definitely leads the pack.Pros:* 12 megapixel image capture* Very good image quality* Full 720P HD video capture* Excellent low light performance for its class* Excellent image stabilization capability* Full manual control, including Av, Tv and full manual modes* Great zoom range, especially at the wide end* Excellent, fast and intuitive performance* Reasonable battery performance with rechargables (a MUST!)* Works with convenient AA batteries* Excellent flash for its class* Excellent color fidelity with no detectable image artifacts* Fast continuous shooting for a compact camera* Perfect size for a compact zoom, fits in a large pocket* Fantastic price/performance ratioCons:* No CCD cleaner that I've found* No flash shoe for an external flash* No external audio inputs for video capture* 10 minute video capture limit* No RAW image support* Terrible support for HD video codec* No optical/digital viewfinder / LCD display only* My unit got a speck of dust inside the lens, creating a spot on images/video for awhileIt's been a couple years since I've purchased a camera and I was a bit surprised to see how far the feature sets have come, especially on the lower-end compacts.  I've now put this camera through the paces in many different situations and overall, I'm very pleased with everything about it so far.My criteria for this camera purchase was fairly simple.  I wanted a compact zoom with decent optical range, AA battery support, excellent color fidelity, reasonable low light performance and a unit that provided full manual control.  I'm an amateur/semi-pro photographer and I expect a lot from my cameras.  After reviewing the options out there, this one was a clear winner.First, I'll speak to the image quality and zoom.  I've been very impressed with both its color fidelity and the overall image quality.  Images are sharp and its ability to provide vivid color and great dynamic range within images is fantastic.  With the unit's lack of RAW support, this was very important to me.  At the low end of the zoom, there is a bit of the wide-angle effect...but I really appreciate how wide this camera is able to go.  At the far end of the zoom, the optical quality is still great and I haven't detected any weak spots within the optical range.  I've never been impressed with digital zoom, and I nearly always avoid it...but as is typical with digital zoom, you'll get artifacts at the furthest end of the spectrum.  For a compact, the macro mode is also quite functional, allowing a very short focus range of less than 1/2"" - and the 2"" focus minimum for normal mode is also quite impressive.Aperture performance was up to my expectations for a camera lens of this quality, if not even a little better than I expected.  The range is from f/3.4 to f/8.0 in aperture priority mode, and I typically would want more on the far end, but as far as I'm concerned, this camera produces f/22 and above quality in landscapes.  You're not going to get beautiful bokeh effects at the low end (f/3.4) but this is typical of compact cameras with inexpensive lenses.  With that said, though, I was surprised to see any bokeh whatsoever...and it is possible to get a little.Low light performance is important to me as this is one of my strongest interests in photography.  Up to ISO800, there is very little noise in the captured images and I've found that my noise filters will clean up what little there is quite well.  ISO1600 starts to introduce a fairly strong noise characteristic, but I expected as much.  There is no ISO3200 support, but personally, I feel like this is a waste in a camera at this price point as there's no way you're going to get good performance at such extremes.  The image stabilization works well, especially when you're right on the edge of needing a tripod.  The camera features an auto focus assist beam, which is a welcome addition within a camera at this price point.  Low-light video performance was quite good, although it does take a performance hit in the noise department...but I was still very impressed that it performs as well as it does by producing very watchable low-light video results.The overall feature set for a relatively inexpensive compact is just staggering to me.  All of the basic features are there for a person who appreciates some creative control, including full Tv, Av and manual modes.  The automatic modes are great for those times when I don't want to put effort in and P-mode (full auto, except for control over ISO) was an absolute necessity for me.  The time-to-live is quick and from an off-state, I can capture an image in less than 3 seconds.  I've tested some of the newer, fancier features and I have to say, they're quite impressive.  The smile detection blew my mind because it actually worked!  The ability to auto-shoot portraits when new people enter the scene is also pretty amazing to me.  Blink detection?  I would have never thought of that, but it's actually worked for me in a couple of cases.  The HD-video is a great addition to my camera lineup and I've started playing with it fairly extensively.  I have noticed a bit of discrepancy between the image stability on the LCD screen and the actual result in the produced video, but then again, if I wanted super-stable video, I'd use a tripod.  There is a 10 minute limit to video capture, which could be a deal breaker for some, but for my purposes it's just fine.  It picks up audio quite well, which was surprising to me - although you're not going to get movie studio quality out of the thing.Physically speaking, the camera is very comfortable to hold and all of the buttons are conveniently placed.  Anyone who's used a Canon camera will feel quite at home with it...and even if you're not, I wouldn't anticipate much difficulty.  I haven't had any notable difficulty with the button placement, but have inadvertently turned off the camera when I was trying to capture a picture in a hurried situation.  It's not exactly a sub-compact, but for a compact zoom, the size is perfect and exceeds my expectations.  (It fits in a large pocket quite easily, but not well in smaller ones, such as most rear pockets.)  The lens retraction is very nice and the lens portion only sticks out about 3/4"" from the body when fully retracted.Battery performance met my expectations, for the most part.  The use of rechargeable batteries is a must for any digital camera - it's no secret that ALL digital cameras suck up a lot of juice.  (This is WHY most of cameras use proprietary NiMH batteries!)  For me, I'm fairly heavily invested into NiMH AA batteries, so it was very important for this purchase to support them.  I don't get the rated performance, but I never trust those values and I can certainly squeak 200+ images out of a set of 2300mAh batteries, without flash usage.  Video use does suck up the juice, but I've still been surprisingly impressed with its performance as I expected a lot less.  I wouldn't really consider using standard alkaline batteries in a digital camera for all but a pinch situation and if you expect good performance on alkaline batteries, you're not going to get it.  I did find the camera did not like a couple of my sets of 2700mAh batteries, and wouldn't even turn on...and while that bugged me, it wasn't a deal breaker as it does work with 90% of my batteries.  A quality battery charger/tester goes a long way, as you won't get good performance if your batteries aren't up to snuff and aren't properly matched according to actual capacity.I really only have a couple of complaints.  Somehow my unit got a fairly large spec of dust inside the lens, and for awhile, all my images/video had a blurry spot on them - particularly in images with fairly strong light/midrange backgrounds.  I'm a little concern about the seal and its ability to prevent dust from entering into the lens.  Eventually, this speck of dust went away and my images are back to normal - but it's frustrating when you can't do anything about something like this.  Additionally, the HD video codec that is used by this camera (H.264/Apple Quicktime MOV) is very frustrating to work with on a computer.  It's just not well supported yet and takes a LONG time to open on my computer, even within Apple's quicktime application.  (My machine is a quad-core 3.2Ghz proc, 4GB RAM...fast, for all intents and purposes - perhaps I have an issue with my computer's video codecs and I am willing to concede that possibility.)  With that said though, I've found it best to convert it to a different format for editing...a step that I would rather avoid.  These two issues prevented me from giving the product a full five-star rating.Overall, though, I'm impressed with this camera and it fit the bill perfectly for me.  I hope you've found this review helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNF4IGX47TZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSHNG8#wasThisHelpful","R3CNF4IGX47TZT","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little reluctant to purchase a memory card from Transcend, mainly because I was concerned about quality control and I typically purchase more well known cards.  Nonetheless, the price was right so I opted to pick up two of them for my point and shoot.  My concerns have been put to rest and I've run them through their paces without any trouble.Some might say that these cards are not quite up to par with a true class 10 card, but for my purposes, that hasn't mattered.  I've been able to capture full HD video with my Canon SX130IS and haven't experienced the slightest bit of trouble.  Image capture seems to be fast enough and the card doesn't keep me waiting.  No unexpected failures or other problems to report so far.  I can get just over 5000 12-megapixel images on one of these cards or about an hour and a half of HD video.  If you're working with HD video, the 32GB cards might be more suitable - but I've always been a fan of using more, smaller density cards than putting all my eggs in one basket with very large density cards.As an amateur photographer with occasional client projects, I probably would opt for a better known brand for some of my critical shoots...but for less critical applications and personal work, I now feel comfortable with using these cards.  Eventually, I'll probably get another 2-3 of these cards since I've been getting into HD video more and the space requirements for that are crazy!Overall, five stars for a good product at a great price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJQBGSJX62B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WE4HE2#wasThisHelpful","R2VJQBGSJX62B7","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always buy cases for my cameras...and it always seems like the most difficult purchase related to a camera.  I purchased this blind for a Canon SX130IS based on one of the previous reviewer's estimated dimensions that it would work with.  I was pleased that this somewhat bulky point and shoot camera fit perfectly inside this case!  It's a tight fit and it works better if the camera is put in the case one way over another, but it's a compatible case for this camera.The padding is decent, but I wouldn't necessarily trust it with a 6 foot fall onto concrete.  I was pleased with the overall construction of the case and expect it to last for years to come.  There's enough space in the front compartment for a few spare batteries and another compartment within this that's great for memory cards.  You're not going to lug around much else with this case, but that's not what it's designed for.  The straps are adjustable enough so you can easily carry it by hand or swing it up over your shoulder or around the neck.  It's not going to win any awards for it's aesthetic appearance...but it does the job it's intended for and it doesn't add much weight.  For the price, it's a great case for the Canon SX130IS!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTPX1ITDRYDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CJTQJC#wasThisHelpful","RUTPX1ITDRYDL","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read the bad reviews on this thing, but it's just worked for me and is a marvelous piece of engineering.  Sure, it's cheaply made, but I don't expect platinum quality for a device that costs less than five bucks.  The lock is a necessary feature to learn and it's not that difficult to use.  I've used this in a half a dozen countries throughout Europe and it worked well.  (I didn't test in the UK, which has been many of the complaints I saw.)  I could see how it might not work on some of the recessed type F connectors, but it worked for me in the places I tried it.  As an added bonus, this has also allowed me to use a European device that I purchased over here in the states, something I wasn't anticipating and was a great bonus!  Just remember, always check your device to make sure it's compatible with the voltage you're plugging into!  This isn't a transformer, just an adapter!  Also, if your device requires and/or is better used with a ground...know this unit doesn't provide for that and your mileage may vary if you try this with such devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDWWIEJR1T6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YN01X4#wasThisHelpful","RGDWWIEJR1T6S","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up one of these in Europe after realizing I forgot to pack one of my chargers from home.  I have always trusted Maha chargers, but couldn't find them overseas.  I hate unplanned purchases that I can't research first, but this little gem has worked out well for me.  Now that I've run it through it's paces in almost a dozen countries, I must say that I'm very pleased with it.Pros:*Tells me a precise battery charge & voltage*Brings low performing batteries back to life*Identifies dead batteries with ease*Inexpensive, high quality charger*Works on 110-230V - great for international travel*Works with every international power adapter I've tried*Works with both NiCd AND NiMH batteriesCons:*A little difficult to learn, but easy once you figure it out*Buttons aren't great quality, but they work*No LCD backlight, no biggie*Terrible manual (mine has four languages, and they all are bad!)*Testing values above 2000 are rounded to the nearest tenth (e.g 2.09 for 2090ish mAh)At first, I struggled with understanding this unit because the instructions weren't exactly clear.  After having used it quite a bit now, it's really simple to understand and operation is second nature.  I usually charge at 200mAh (about 8-12 hours for a charge) to retain long battery life, but I've used the 700mAh a number of times and it usually has me going in about 2-3 hours.  This is totally satisfactory for me as I always keep spares on hand, rather than require near instant charges that endanger the battery with high heat.I ran all my rechargeables (about 36) through this unit in test mode (about 2 days per cycle) and identified the batteries that needed rejuvenation with the refresh function.  After running the poor performing batteries through a refresh cycle (which takes several days), I was able to bring all of them back to nearly new condition!  The refresh function really does work - and well at that.  Additionally, I've also been able to pair batteries according to their performance, which has been great for my electronics...particularly my cameras.  I no longer have a camera die due to one low battery in the pack!  This has been the largest improvement that I've seen from this unit...and was worth the low price just to not have to deal with this frustration!For the price, I don't think you can get any better than this unit.  While the Maha's are great, and I had planned to upgrade my two older MH-204CF's to newer Maha's, I've seen a lot of bang for my buck from the LaCrosse and I'd buy it again.  Personally, I didn't see a lot of extra value in this unit's bigger brother, which has a slightly higher charge ability and some extra batteries.  So unless those batteries are worth the premium, I'd say stick with this unit and you should be pleased!  If you need a decent, relatively compact international-compatible charger...I'd definitely recommend this one as it's tried and true in my book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GRL9YBXC2U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RSOV50#wasThisHelpful","R23GRL9YBXC2U7","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got several books to educate myself on the process of beer brewing and this one was by far my favorite.  It is well laid out and covers pretty much all aspects of brewing for the beginner (extract), intermediate (partial mash) and advanced (all-grain) brewer.  I appreciated the technical detail that I didn't find in other books and while that's not critical for the budding brewer, it's good to have a reference as you expand your knowledge.  This book has been responsible for two successful batches so far and the end to end process is very easy to follow.  I also tried one recipe from it and it turned out rather good.

"Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere - this unit will cause you nothing but absolute frustration and dissapointment.  This unit regularly jams up and causes a mess...it tosses overflow coins inside the unit, making it tremendously difficult to extract the overflow coins.

"Living in Spokane, I find myself doing recreational activities in northern Idaho rather often.  Though I own the USGS maps for northern Ideaho, I needed some portable, high quality, and up-to-date maps of the areas I visit.  Between Delorme and Benchmark providing these types of maps, I found that Benchmark was easier to navigate from and had slightly better features.I find the ""landscape"" style mapping very easy to read and it gives an immediate impression of the landscape - something I find difficult to achieve with standard topographical maps.  Major and minor roads, 4x4 trails, hiking trails, and many other through-ways can be found on these sets of maps.  Combine that with 7'30"" GPS grids, a GPS, and some navigational experience and it's difficult to not know right where you are.  It's also nice to see political map features such as forest and county boundaries.I particularly enjoy the expansive recreation sections that provide additional details about campgrounds, ski locations, hiking trails, fishing spots, local attractions, micro-regional climate data, and many other features.The only drawbacks to these maps are the higher elevations between 8,000' and 14,000' use the same color index, so it's difficult to guage elvation.  The other is that I do wish the scale was slightly smaller as it can be difficult to navigate particularly busy areas - though this is less problematic in Idaho as compared to Washington, Oregon, and other states with denser recreational areas.  Overall I feel this set of maps was an excellent investment and has helped me to find my way many times - it should do the same for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RU6LCTJNZL4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0929591828#wasThisHelpful","R3RU6LCTJNZL4H","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned this dehydrator for awhile and have been pretty pleased with it's perfomance overall.  I found the art of drying to be challenging, fun, and productive.  I make a lot of fruit leathers, jerkies, dried sauces, and dried soups.  My next challenge with this unit is to make ""just add water"" meals for backpacking trips.It has no problems running for several days in a row and can be trusted to run overnight or while at work.  I was happy with the manual that came with it - it has many expected drying times for most common fruits, vegetables, meats - though the time windows are somewhat broad. (i.e. 8-16 hours)  The unit comes with one fruit leather tray and one clean-a-screen sheet - something that's not mentioned on Amazon's description.You will quickly find that more trays are an essential - it doesn't seem powerful enough to dry the full 12 trays it's rated for.  I use 8 and find that suitable for my needs - even with that, occasional tray rotation is a necessity as the lower trays dry much quicker than the higher ones.  (Bulk driers should consider the FD-1010)  You should also definately pickup the ""clean-a-screen"" (super-easy cleanup) and fruit leather trays (leathers, soups, sauces) to go with this.  The accessories are relatively expensive.  I found the more expensive dehydrators have cheaper accessories - but for this unit, 4 additional trays, 8 screens, and 8 trays - I'm still into this one for less than a ""premium"" dehydrator with accessories.Overall, it's a good choice to go with.  Just don't blame me if you find yourself waiting up until 2AM for something to be dried just right.  (Hint...turn the temperature way down and deal with it the next morning.  Don't do this on jerky, BTW.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTO3M4ND47GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004W4V4#wasThisHelpful","R2VTO3M4ND47GE","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the Konica Minolta A200 camera and picked up four spare NP-800 batteries that I use in rotation.  This battery is rated for around 260 images, though I average around 175 - even with minimal flash usage, using only the viewfinder, and the lowest power saving setting on the camera.  I get less with flash and/or LCD usage.  I do feel that the price on these are far beyond reasonable for their performance level and size - but that's what you get with proprietary batteries.  I understand you may be able to use another manufacturer's less expensive battery in this camera, though I didn't want to risk it with a $600+ investment.After dozens of charges, they do seem to keep their charge well and maintain the average battery life mentioned above.  They are easy to put in and take out of the camera - and stay put in the charger that came with the camera.  I do like the size as they fit well into my camera cases.  To mark ""spent"" batteries, I just leave the plastic cap off the battery.Overall, your choices are extremely limited.  Best to just pucker up and buy 'em - you'll need them if you don't want to have a photography outing cut short by a dead battery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OU6FNPV3NBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006TIRXW#wasThisHelpful","R5OU6FNPV3NBS","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I moved to Washington recently and needed to get some good paper maps of the area.  Though I have all the USGS maps of the pacific NW, I find the ""landscape"" style mapping of these types of maps extremely useful and more up-to-date than many USGS quads.  I debated between the well-known Delorme and Benchmark.  Benchmark won with better detail, easier to read maps, better recreation details, and the fact they're a Pacific NW company.This map book has large-format maps for the entire state, US map, a full state map, and a pacific NW map.  Map details are complete including roads, ""off"" roads, trails, mountain elevations, place names, political lines, and others.  It also has great sections for recreation (camping, hiking, fishing, local attractions, and others), climate data, and other nice details about the areas.  Navigation with GPS is made easy by 7'30"" latitude and longitude sections.I do wish the scale was a little smaller - finding trails and off-the-beaten-path roads can be difficult in particularly busy areas.  I also desired more accurate elevation details - the scale seems to clump 8,000' and 14,000' peaks together.  Overall, these are excellent maps and should help any outdoor lover find their way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKCPES9R3H6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0929591836#wasThisHelpful","R1YKCPES9R3H6G","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've hiked dozens of trails out of this same company's trail book for Oregon and found it extremely useful, so upon moving to the Inland NW, I bought this book.  Overall the book is great - it has excellent trail overviews, difficulty levels, elevation profiles, ""landscape"" style maps rather than traditional topographical, and reasonable text describing the trail.  It's perfect for any hiker in the Inland NW wanting to find some well known and not-so well known trails in the area.I would add that having hiked several trails out of this book that there have been times where I've wished the descriptive text was more descriptive.  I've had confusing moments out of every trail ""guide"" book, this is certainly no exception.  A good map of the area, common sense, and experience will help there.  The other thing I don't like about this particular line of trail books is that everyone you meet on the trail has one of these guide books.  I guess I'm not the only one on this island - but I sure love trails with very few people on it or even noone at all!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUEX8PVSKCH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898869080#wasThisHelpful","R1BUEX8PVSKCH3","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book even though I don't have a dog.  I have several hiking books from the Inland NW and have found this one useful for locating good hikes in the region.  Most of the hikes are in the northern part of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana - most at least an hour's drive from Spokane or CDA.This book has very useful overviews that include the elevation gain, length, average hiking time, highest elevation, best hiking season, and the USGS map to go along with the hike.  The text for each hike is good - though as with all guide books, I've found inaccuracies that can have you scratching your head, or worse, lost.  The trail map is a traditional topographical style with thick dotted lines showing the primary trail.  I also liked how non-primary trails were shown in the maps - functional for side excursions.  There are good black and white pictures strewn through the book.  Dog owners should find the ""tips"" section and the hike text useful.Drawbacks include no overall difficulty levels - though this is often found in the text.  I would have also liked to have seen more trails closer to town.  Overall, I would recommend this to Inland NW hikers, both dog owners and not dog owners alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3XVC7GNS9EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0898868580#wasThisHelpful","R2S3XVC7GNS9EM","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this scanner to truly go ""paperless"" with all but my most important documents.  Using this product in conjunction with PaperPort 9.0 Deluxe, I have accomplished that goal quickly in comparison to doing it with a regular scanner.  This has allowed me to scan & shred thousands of documents - a welcome organizational relief.  The model takes up very little room and I can scan my documents in a matter of seconds.  I like that I can scan receipts and smaller pieces of paper - something that would challenge a good sheet fed scanner.  Generally speaking, my documents come out straight and and scan quickly in high quality at 200dpi grayscale.Despite this, I would add that the product driver installation was rather clunky and awkward - somewhat challenging for a user with 15 years PC experience.  The other major gripe I have about the product is that it fails to scan the very last 1/2"" of a scanned page.  This means that I sometimes have to scan a document both ways on documents that have text in the last 1/"" of the page.  The other drawback is the product is rediculously expensive for what it is...I think a price tag of $100 would be more suitable than the $200 retail in goes for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R258NATDE3CT1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006L47P#wasThisHelpful","R258NATDE3CT1Q","A2RX7YZD9PXSHD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX7YZD9PXSHD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lachlan and Magdalene; what a couple......Lachlan aka Smoke to his MC is a man full of power, personality, bravery and yet harbors many years of verbal abuse from a long estranged wife.  Meredith (the wife) is one horrible self-centered creature who long ago ditched her marriage, husband, and very sadly, a daughter.  She didnt ditch their home or her meal-ticket but checked out of being a family member even as her daughter was born so many years prior. This viper of a human being has sucked the joy out of her husband in a way that no human being should be subjected to.  Thankfully; Lachlan retains his humanity and a never-ending love for his daughter Bridget.  It is his daughter that he has dedicated himself to in order that her upbringing is happy; in spite of an absent, cold hearted mother.  Dont get me wrong here; Lachlan is not a weak man and in fact he is strong of character.  It is just a set of circumstances that beset him when Meredith become pregnant all those years before, and it snowballs into a bad marriage that lasts way too long for a man who needs a loving, supportive spouse.  Instead; he got one heck of a bitchy leech stuck to his back and the weight has dragged him down to a level no human being should be subjected to.Enter Magdalene; a woman on the run from feeling too much for anyone because everyone she loved up until about a decade before has been lost to her.  Shes gone so long without caring too much, or feeling deeply, that her very nature has become desensitized to what real life is about.  When shes put into a position where she cannot care for herself and is at the mercy of a caring man and his lovely daughter; Magdalene has no choice but to join the human race that shes run from for so long.  Its not an easy transition; from non-living to living in the present and the internal battles are painful to read, but oh so true to life.Of course; love blooms but the petals of the flower are slow to unfurl and it is a lucky reader that witnesses what was, what is, and the hope of what will be.  For Lachlan and Magdalene the dance to their destiny together is both compelling and torturous; how real it is because not all love affairs hop right into the sack but instead are performed in steps that often falter.  The end; pure joy, because when they reach that place of nirvana it is because they are all in with hearts, bodies, and souls aligned.We get some distinct side characters as well and hopefully well see more of these characters in later books.  Special mention to Thor; dont know if hes redeemable or not but itd take one heck of a wily woman to bring him to his knees and change him from the lout he showed himself to be.  Im looking forward to more Bridget and Cas.oh, I found the Bonez-Gunz relationship very promising.  I have a feeling further books in this series will lead us straight to some other characters that we loved in the MC Chronicles Series.  Well have to wait and see what BINK CUMMINGS has planned for her characters and for us readers.All in all; I knew BINK CUMMINGS was capable of this wonderfully written book.  I read her prior MC Chronicles and found them exceptional reading entertainment.  This book is a total turnaround in that the love story is set from ground zero and builds from there.  We get two damaged people who have so much to overcome and without wanting to, they find a way to heal together.  A story like this tends to rend a persons heart and I can say that it did that to mine, and more.  The writing is full of nuances that will be discovered anew with each rereading of a book written with such feeling and depth.If youre looking for a book of substance and are ready for a journey of hearts; this be your book.  Look no further.  I would recommend it without hesitation.

"It was with much excitement that I anticipated JACKO's story.  Up until this book, what we got about him was the way he acted and that would be ...... rather crazy.  I often wondered if all his time in prison drove his mind into another atmosphere.  Finally, we find out the truth of why he 'acts' the way he does and what drove him to continue to be that rather crazed person.Really; it's very sad.  The story of JACKO and SARAH.....a love that was never meant to last yet in JACKO's mind it was a love as true as any he could feel at the time.  The responsibility JACKO holds for what happens to SARAH takes over his very existence in that he knows those who hurt SARAH and took her away must pay.  It is through a complicated and well thought out process that JACKO gets revenge for SARAH, and her sister AMY who has suffered the fallout for SARAH's association with JACKO.  He knows he wont rid himself of the guilt, but knows he can accomplish his mission for revenge and in doing so prevent further harm to AMY.This story has so much detail and depth in its writing.  The reader will feel what JACKO has felt in his quest for finding pay-back.  He has suffered enormously.  How does a man keep his sanity when he has had to play at being something he clearly is not.....and for so long a period of time?  Has JACKO become what he plays at?  This is what the reader wonders during this book and it is only during those short periods of witnessing JACKO's sanity that we become even more questioning about where JACKO's future can take him.When AMY is thrust back into JACKO's life, he is nearing the end of his quest for vengeance.  Clearly, he isn't happy to have her on the bad guys radar but keeping her safe whilst he continues his plan pretty much becomes his total focus.  It is during this whole horrible period of time that they fall in love and it becomes a love most inconvenient; especially for JACKO.  Remember; he is an MOROAD MC member and in being one it means he may be headed back to prison at any time because MOROAD MC is wholly dedicated to life inside the prison, ahead of life outside the prison walls.  This dedication is their mantra and comes ahead of everything else in their lives, including their women.  Woe be the woman who falls for a MOROAD MC man!Through the ups and downs of their relationship we get a man who is fighting what he feels for the woman who is sister to SARAH (the one stolen away five years prior).  He brings danger to AMY so of course he wants to keep her free of him.  Yet his feelings for her cannot be denied; for long anyway.  Perhaps it is those feelings for AMY that bring some semblance of long forgotten sanity into a mans mind which has been loaned out to insanity?AMY, for her part has been on her own for five long years and is suddenly thrust into a life of danger and instability.  Still grieving over her lost sister and trying to find her footing in a life not of her choosing.  Little does she know the quiet, yet effective manipulations of JACKO who has been working behind the scenes to keep her safe from those who took SARAH from them.The progression into love is believable, slow, steady, and written without hearts and flowers because the MOROAD men are anything but hearts and flowers kind of guys.  We witness a transformation of sorts for JACKO.  He slowly makes his way from what he projects himself to be to what he really is; always battling his sane thoughts in order to retain those of what he wants others to witness.  At the end we understand him and more importantly AMY understands and accepts him for the man he is and the man hell never be.  The twist near the end is both awe inspiring and gut wrenching.......I did not see or feel it coming.NOTE: I feel CAM always knew exactly what JACKO was all about and in fact championed the cause.JOCKO is a story not to be missed, as is the entire MOROAD MC Series.  Each volume has a place in a puzzle that unfurls more with each book in the series.  What I get from this series is that we have a dedicated group of men who establish themselves as criminals in order to sustain themselves in what can be a very dangerous MC life.  They are brothers who dont always act the parts of true brothers but at the end of the day; they are united in their MC.I would highly recommended this series and it is one Im truly enjoying.  One more book to go in the series (JEREMYs book) and I await it with patient anticipation.

"It's funny actually; that I first read MICA (book #1) - didn't quite understand where this series was going but that didn't stop me from reading SLATE (book #2).  I then stopped the series even though I had gotten all the ensuing books but when MASON (book #6) came out I read that one but hadn't read BEAR (book #3), JASE (book #4), or GUNNY (book #5).  For some odd reason even after reading book #2 (SLATE) I didn't 'get it' yet but I still intended to read the whole series......it's just that I put some of the books on a back-burner.  However; when I read MASON's book, I got it.  I completely understood what this series was about because MASON is the driving force behind each MC member.  Once I got his 'focus'; I found my 'focus' in reading this series.  Each book is a fine showpiece of writing.  Each book is part of the puzzle that makes up this series.  I dont recommend reading out of order because each book MUST be read in order to get the full picture.So; now that I've reread the whole series to date and in order (each book is a fantastic story); I'm reading HOSS (book #7).  I completely enjoyed the man himself and his part in the MC group.  I liked him even when he didn't have a clue as to how to have a relationship with our main heroine HOPE and her wonderful son SAM.  It is a beautiful love story between a man, a woman and the growing of what will become a family unit.  There were so many ups and downs and ultimately a good drenching of happenings which wrench the reader's heart.  (BINGO, we loved him.......).The twist towards the end just broke my heart but our dear writer finds the way to mend not only her characters but the reader as well because in typical Wayfarer MC fashion their family pulls together and helps one another through the darkest of times.  I'm hoping we'll hear more about HOSS in later books.....enough said.  Taking us so many years into the future is a tool to show healing.......and it works but I'm hoping that in future books for this series we'll get all those years filled in because this reader does NOT want to miss what happened to the Wayfarer family in those years.  Personally; I want to have more MASON!HOSS is a beautiful addition to the series and this series is simply GREAT.

"I wasn't surprised at the loss of character(s).  I just KNEW it'd happen.  It's like a Susan Fanetti thing to jar our complacency and rip out our hearts.That said; I simply loved this book although it being the end of the Night Horde SoCal Series......really makes me sad.  I knew it was coming but its tough because our dear authoress creates characters that we come to love.  We feel the family.  We feel the loyalty.  We feel the sorrow.Ronin; what a mystery man he's been.  Turns out he has a deep well of feeling and depth.  A man alone, by preference but there is a reason why no other woman has captured his heart and her name is Lorraine.  How unusual is it that he gave his heart but one time and has never gotten it back nor given it to anyone else.  He's a man of honor.  I loved his sense of self and the fact that he knew himself so well.  When he finds out about what's been hidden from him for so long; he feels the loss down to his very soul.  Yet; he's a thinker and finds a way to deal with it and the love he holds for the woman he's always loved.  I admired him.  Hes the man who sits quietly on the side and watches while his mind documents the goings-on.Lorraine; I can't say that I loved her nor did I understand her that well.  Why she did what she did was understandable at that time.  What she chose to hold from her long lost love was cruel.  Was she that self-involved?  Was it pride?  I just didn't agree with her except on one thing and that was once she found her long lost love again; she knew she had to get him back.  I wasn't sure she'd get him back either.  I had to believe that she regretted the choices shed made all those years before.  The ending looked very promising for her and Ronin.  I expect they found their forever.........Now; I'm brokenhearted for Bart and his children.  I'm bereft for Bibi.  This whole thing got me thinking about (sniff) Havoc.  I haven't been able to reread his book......The one hopeful thing for the Night Horde SoCal is that they're finally (FINALLY) back on the path that so many of them preferred to be on and that is the path to living safe.  Safe for everyone.  So much loss led to this conclusion and it was hard won in that so many were lost in the battle.  They paid with their dearest blood.I'm hoping for Nolan's book.....eventually.  I need to know how things turn out for him and how Bart is doing with his brood.  We all need to know that Bart would eventually get through the valley of sorrow he was clearly mired in at the end of this book.  Yes; it looked positive but he still has a far way to go to finding some of his own personal happiness again.  I also need to know about his children, especially Lexie with her injured leg.Time for Susan Fanetti to regroup and develop anew......so I guess it'll be awhile for a new book and I'm hoping she'll tackle another MC Series......someday.  From this reader's standpoint Ms. Fanetti excels in her writing and has a wonderful grasp of the MC world.  These series take a lot out of us readers.......so I'd imagine that they take quite a toll upon our dear authoress.  It cant be easy to write stories like she does.If you want an MC Series written with drama, angst, heartache, joy, happiness, and everything in-between then check out this series and the one that came before it (SIGNAL BEND).  They go together.....one leads into the other.  Just have a kleenix box ready.  I couldn't recommend any MC Series more.  It's the best.This booksimply wonderful.  I enjoyed it so very much.  Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIHD5B76YOTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DZ4T5C#wasThisHelpful","R3GIHD5B76YOTH","A320NYVVIZSZGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A320NYVVIZSZGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using this daily for ten days now.  It's a spot treatment; not an all over lotion or treatment.  I have very fair aging skin and have developed a bit of what is called adult acne.  I didn't have acne when I was a teen......so now, right?  Anyway; my main issue is whiteheads at my chin line.  On day eight of using this finally (FINALLY) a dried out whitehead that wouldn't leave it's nice little nest under my skin; came out.  Likely; it'll come back eventually but at least I know this works for getting it dried up.  The other acne stuff; dries it out slowly and not harshly.Recommended, although using this takes time and repeat applications.  It's not fast but it works.

"The first one I was sent was sadly broken in 3 pieces.  Poor packing on Amazon's part.  However; after contacting Amazon customer service I was sent a replacement - NOT having to send back the broken one.  I got the PERFECT replacement within days and it is so beautiful.  I love it and use a tealight candle in it - using a small votive container to put the tealight in (just as a precaution).  I don't know if salt melts or not.....I don't think so.This is so pretty.

"What a grand-finale this book turned out to be.  We got lots of Merry and Cher; not to mention Ethan who was quite the big man in the making.  Loved the drama, ups and downs, and sheer hotness of all things Garrett Merrick!The road to romance was slow.....and REAL.  The obstacles.....unfortunate though they be, were absolutely necessary in order for this reader to have that FINAL satisfaction that Merry and Cher truly belonged together.  What a fantastic journey.We also got so much EXTRA in having prior characters pop-in and be their ever-loving-selves.  Special mention to RYKER who was totally bad-a$$, and utterly sexy.  Have to admit to a few worrisome moments for him and thankfully.....'tis all good in RYKER-land.  Also: CAL.....he was my favorite of all the 'Burg guys and in this book he was cemented as my absolute favorite 'Burg guy.  Now I have to go back and re-read his and Vi's story.  What a loving and sensitive father he is.What a fitting 'epilogue' for all.  Advancement into the years beyond.....LOVED how everyone thrives, and grows their families (emphasis on GROWTH).  I'm sad that this series is completed and also very pleased that everything is so GREAT in 'Burg-land.A FABULOUS series that I'll read again, and again.  Thank you Kristen Ashley for such fine writing and attention to details.  You are simply......DA BOMB among writers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QLPN745W67MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUR6BUM#wasThisHelpful","R1QLPN745W67MS","A320NYVVIZSZGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A320NYVVIZSZGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have read or listened to this whole series I really have enjoyed them but I do believe so far this one is my favorite. Life is so tough when you lose the things you think are important you may go in a direction that isn't always right. We tend to forget others have it worse than we do and only think of ourselves as Cort does. This author gives you a wonderful amazing read of Cort finding his way back from drinking and a family he thought he would never have. This story is so touching it will break your heart and leaving you smiling with tears in your eyes. Ms. Hatfield gives you a read full of pain, anger, and lost. When you do not think you have more to lose you find you do as a family walks away in hopes of getting their love one to come back to them.KC has had a hard life from childhood to adult she doesn't ask for much just lives one day as it comes. She lost her parents, her husband and part of her child now she faces loosing her ranch. Her marriage wasn't bad but it wasn't good and she vows no man will ever get close to her again. Sometimes life has it's own thoughts as it brings Cort to her door she finds he isn't only a handy man but works wonders with her son and her heart. As they grow close she must decide what is best for her family. It might surprise you the twist this author gives as the fight for love begins.When Cort got hurt and had to give up the rodeo he thinks his life is over. He makes decisions his family isn't happy with. One too many nights out drinking and not facing life puts him in a tail spin when his family hits him with some major facts. Being dropped off at his best friend's door he goes through the motions until his friend sends him to help the widow. This is a day that will change his life as he takes on the run down ranch, the widow and her silent son. Things are about to get heated up with misunderstanding, pointing fingers and the love of one child.Luke Andreen did an outstanding job on this narrations. When it came time for tears to fall you could hear them in his voice. There was a place at the end where Cort got chocked up that you could really hear the tears in his voice. This was a very touching scene for me and almost had me in tears as well. This narrator gives you a very touching listen as he brings to live the many wonderful voice of all the different characters. There are no background noises just a smooth rich audio that reaches in and grabs your heartstrings. There was a time or two where you might be able to tell he took a break as his tone gets a little higher. No way does it take away from the audio and you almost miss it. I totally enjoyed listening to him with his rich deep voice. I am really looking forward to listening to more audios from this narrator.Ms. Hatfield give you a very well written compelling story that will bring tears to your eyes more than once with this wonderful read of heartbreak as these three people find a way to bring Christmas and wishes to the holiday season. One little boy who hasn't spoken a word for years will pull you in and take your heart. He is just a sweetheart that will be a wonderful man. You get to revisit some wonderful characters from the last book and see how their lives have changed. Ms. Hatfield stories just get better and better as she takes you on a wonderful journey of broken hearts and putting them back together again. She brings you tons of smiles in this clean read as she puts these two people in some passionate scenes. I doubt you can read this story without it touching your heart. The only thing I would have liked to have known was what made the little boy never talk after his father was killed.The ending this author gives you will bring even the strongest to their knees as you wipe a tear from your eye. I really loved this story with strong characters that are broken but won't give in. If you haven't read anything from this author you really should give Wrestlin' Christmas a try. This author has become one of my favorite in a short time. I can't wait to read more from her and her touching reads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRZ70TA313MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9L4M56#wasThisHelpful","R1BRZ70TA313MT","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one author that put the twist in to twist with this mind blowing twist you won't see coming. You have never seen a storm like the one Celia is about to lay on one Kash Kressley. Fist fly along with knees as she gives him a taste of his own medicine. Kash doesn't know what hit him as tempters fly with one crazy Redhead.There is no doubt that Celia got Kash attention from the first moment he laid eyes on her. That red hair sure does hide one tempter under it one minute she is hot and the next she is cold. She has him all tied up in knots just what he doesn't need with his world blow up with family issues.Celia only wants to be the top photograph which is hard when you live in a man's world. When Kash horses almost run her down and he saves the day he got her attention. Things seem to be going great the attraction is strong until he man hands her then he gets a taste of her tempter which leaves him reeling. Just when things couldn't get crazier Kash goes and puts his foot in his mouth and Celia is off again with tempter flying.I loved Kash father he is a sweetheart I really hope as some point he gets a happy ever after. With the life he lived raising his sons and his wife walking out on him I sure hope he can find a lady to love. Kash brother well now he is something else. He isn't happy working in the family business and loves to cause trouble. He is one character I would love to read his story I do believe there is one women that is about to set him on his ears.The author gives you a page turner as she brings you history from time long ago. I really enjoyed reading it. You can tell she did her research well. I loved the Christmas decoration that Celia made to fix the house up. If you get a chance you might want to check out Ms. Hatfields pinterest board that snowman is something else. You learn about the Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund which help those cowboys hurt during a rodeo. I had no idea there was such a foundation. She got my attention with the recipe Celia made that had those cowboys hooked on which to my delight she gives the recipe at the end of the book. I can't wait to try the recipe for Nut Goodie Bars I am sure it will be a hit in my home.This author gives you all the above along with a well written story where two people just can't seem to get it together. There are misunderstandings, pain as these two work out issues of love. She gives you a nice clean read that at times toes the link filled with passion. You get to see past characters that you have come to love seeing how their lives have changed. This is just a delightful read with wonderful characters. I loved Celia as shows these men a thing to two. The beginning has me laughing up a storm as she puts one cowboy in his place which will make you laugh. There was a big shocker that has you going OH MY what a mess this is going to be. From the rodeo clown (who I hope gets his own story someday) to the cowboys teasing and all that is in between you are going to fall in love with this story and it wonderful characters. This author had me hooked from page one all the way to the end which leaves you wondering if these two will ever get it together. It does seem as soon as one foot is taken out of the mouth another goes in. What a fun read with so many mishaps and crazy people who will keep you laughing. For me this was another winner Ms. Hatfield sure out did herself on this one.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQI14R2R6IXBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013V9SF3A#wasThisHelpful","RQI14R2R6IXBR","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really torn on this review there were parts in this book that I thought were great other parts I was totally lost. Some of this made sense other parts made none. The book started out really slow for me, around the middle it got my interest and then it went back to being slow. There are to many secretes with no answers which leaves way to many questions. I had an issue with the repeats of saying the same thing over again. There is really no ending you never know if they end things or keep things as they are. The wife threw me as well as Lenny going to OMG I am xxxx to well that is find wife is no big deal.Now that I said what I didn't care for let me tell you what I liked. I really like Vic even though I thought he was weird at times. He was a strong alpha male who I really believed cares and loves Lenny but lies to her to keep her. I thought that lie was a little off it didn't make sense. When it came out he lies now that makes sense. Vic is a protector and protect those around him. He wasn't a character you liked right away he came across stuck on his self but turns out he really is a wonderfully sweet man.Lenny I just do not know what to think of her beside she needs to see a head doctor. She comes across as a normal person and than changes into a head case. You never really know if she really is seeing ghost or if her mind is working overtime. Most of the time she is a really likable person. Your heart does go out to her with the hard life she has lived with parents that need help but never got it. Her mother dies early in her life from hanging herself. Lenny is the one who found her which could be the reason she has so many issues. Her ex Dean was a trip and got what he deserved even though she thought that was a little to much. She ran from Vic for what he did to Dean but gets over that fast and falls for Dean. Lenny is one messed up lady no doubt about it.One reviewer said this was a book all about sex with no story. I do not agree there is no sex until you are well into the book. There is a story just confusing as times of where it is going to go and how it got there. The sex scenes are on the hot side but Vic said they can't and only goes so far. One day they go all the way so no there isn't that much sex in this story.There are parts I really enjoyed when Vic and Lenny meet that butt heads. Lenny's ex coming for her had my heart in my throat. At times I thought it was a great read and other time I thought it was a little over the top. My honest thought is this is a 3.5 Star with some great parts and some not so great. I can't say it is a book I want to read again and I feel some of it could have been cut out to make it a better read but all in all it wasn't a bad story and does have a good plot. You judge for yourself some will love this and others may not. For me I am still on the iffy side. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSKNWSXRH0YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEJ5V46#wasThisHelpful","R3RSKNWSXRH0YV","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love this series Ms. Marton spins another outstanding read of danger, action, thrills, heartbreak, mystery in this fast pace action thriller. She takes us back to the jungle where Clara is ending her assignment only to get a call from a love one with a heartbreaking tale that will break her heart. She takes on this assignment out of love to the two most important people in her life. She isn't happy about it but love makes you do many things you do not want to. To top that off she has to work with the crazy mercenary who has a death wish and has an agenda of his own. These two hit head on as sparks fly leaving Clara wondering if her father is nuts for setting her up with such a fruitcake. There is something to say when a book starts out with a man waking up with a scorpion in his pants next to his most personal parts. I had to laugh as my mouth went into O....as I shook my head thinking this can't be good.Clare always gets her person they might not always come out a live but she always brings them home. American teenager disappears abroad Clare finds herself in more danger trying to put the pieces together to help find a teen. The pieces just do not fit as they go through the pace of finding out just where this teen might be and if she is dead or alive. Clare is a strong willed bullheaded woman that does not give up easy. It seems Light Walker is more interested in sending her back to the USA which she is having nothing to do with. He shows her a wild reckless side she isn't to crazy about. As she finds out more about him and his death wish for revenge she takes on the tacks of keeping him alive if she can only stay alive herself.Light Walker is on a mission of his own and the flighty Clare is not only getting in his way but going to end of dead if she isn't careful. He has enough on his plate with all his plans falling into place. Now he has to keep her alive take care of the issues as hand as he runs with the big boys in drug running plotting gang against each other which is about to come to ahead and most likely will leave him dead. He must make a choice revenge and most likely death or Clare who seems to be growing on him.The surprises Ms. Marton throws in will have your brain twisted trying to work out this mystery. She throws you curves, hot tempters, passion as she brings you to the edge with danger, mystery and lies. You get to meet some very seedy characters who do not know which end is up as Walker runs into one trouble after another with Clara usually in the middle of it. She is worse than a dog with a bone when she is on the hunt. Light Walker drags her to questionable places as he tries to show her the best place for her is at home. She isn't into putting her tail between her legs and running unless of course someone has a gun pointed at her than she is all into running her legs off in the other direction. This is one book full of danger as the author keeps you laughing from one mishap to another. Where ever Walker goes there are usually dead bodies when he leaves, leaving Clara in shock at how easy he can take a life. Yep this is one nutty, crazy mercenary. Clara decides she might be better off on her own but Walker isn't having any of that. You do not want to miss watching the sparks fly between these to wonderful characters in this action pack thrilling read..I love these characters even the drug runners who aren't too smart are pretty cool. I totally enjoyed the action scenes and loved the blowing up parts. Dana paints a picture that you can almost see in your mind. I have been hook on this authors from first book that I picked up. She is my go to author for everything I want in a story. I cannot wait to see the next book she pulls out of that wonderful mind of hers.If you enjoy books by Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Cindy Gerard, or Anne Stuart you will love Ms. Marton's books. I highly recommend any book this author writes she always gives you entertainment at its finest with her action pack reads filled with danger, mystery, love as she worms her way into your heart. She is my go to author for smiles, laughs as she pulls me into a fast pace plot where things usually blow up or lots of gun fire usually with a little heartbreak as she spins a tale and sparks fly as trouble comes knocking on their door.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34QL9EM0GF2RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AQ6I2K#wasThisHelpful","R34QL9EM0GF2RJ","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author always brings a smile to my face as she gives you a wonderfully written story with such passion but is still able to give you a clean read. The Christmas Cowboy isn't just a Christmas time read but a read for anytime you just want a nice read filled with a little mystery, rodeos, cowboys, a hot tempters lady, that toes the line and pushes just a little with passion. I really enjoyed this read of passing in the night trying to make times for each other when they live hours away along with traveling to get in their way. This author shows if there is a will and love you can make it work.Kenzie has been burnt before with cheating cowboys. First her father who she adored and than her ex she has no time for men in cowboy boots who do not know how to keep their hands to themselves. She keeps running into Tate every time she gets on a plane. There is just something about him she can't walk away. With many misunderstanding there just doesn't seem to be a way to make this work. Kenzie is just a lovely kind sweet lady who gives so much of herself to those she loves. Love has not been kind to her she has trust issues and doesn't take time to really think things over as she flies off the hand and runs to save her heart.Tate is just a good old sweet cowboy who never would cheat, he isn't into settling down but with one lady catches his attention it looks more like he just might be hooked. That is if he can get the lady in question to stop jumping to the wrong concussion. He might just have to tie her down to make her listen. The women do seem to love this man as much as I do. He is innocent of all charges. This is a man every woman would be honored to call their own. When he gets hurt it will break your heart he was doing so well but his head isn't in the game. Will he win at love or will he lose all his dreams.I just loved Tate's father he is a sweet heart and gives Tate words of wisdom. Tate doesn't need them as she chases the women across the country to make her his. You will love each character as this author puts a smile on your face. You have stalkers which will bring danger, love like no other which will last a lifetime.I listened to this on audio with Luke E. Andreen as the narrator. He does a wonderful job with his tones and emotions as he brings this story to life. You always know which character is talking by his many different voices. You can hear the hurt, passion, love, anger, laughter in his voice and he gives a compelling voice to this wonderful story. This audio flows easy with no breaks or background noise. He makes you fall in love with each character as your heart breaks for Tate and all the misunderstands that comes his way. Luke as a wonderful voice that is smooth and flows easy to the ears. At times he has a very sexy voice that pulls you in and takes you away. I have enjoyed listening to him very much.This is a well told story with a wonderful plot full of pain, sorrow, loss and love. There will be times you will laugh and others where you are sad. This is one author that knows how to pull on your heartstrings. I love the characters and found this to be a very believable read. At times I forgot it was fiction as the author and narrator took me away to a wonderful ride in the rodeos. If you haven't read the Rodeo Romance this is the one you want to start with. There is still enough time to read both books before the new one comes out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MN9TGIGQ8DD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYAXJXG#wasThisHelpful","R3MN9TGIGQ8DD7","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an audio that pulled me in it is full of danger, mystery and overcoming the lose of the one who walked away. There is nothing like your first and only love walking away breaking your heart that is so strong you vow to never love again. This is the first book I have listen/read of Ms. Woolf's I enjoyed it so much I found a few more at a bargain and bought them as well. I loved the love/hate going on with this couple, along with the plot, the characters are strong, they fight hard and love even harder. The author gives you some pretty heated scenes but stays in the guidelines of the values from that time period. This was a time when a person word meant something, promise were kept and a man stood beside his word. I totally enjoyed this audio.Catherine fell in love with Duncan when she was but a child at age 16 he got on his horse and rode out of her life. She watched him leave with tears in her eyes swearing never to love again. That day changed her she started living only for the ranch her heart grew cold it turned to stone. She began hard as she took on the ranch she had a will of iron no one or nothing would get in her way. She kept this vow until the day Duncan walked by in her life 10 years later when trouble and danger comes to the ranch with one man demanding she marry him who has plans of his own. She is strong, with a will of steal, stubborn, bullhead and ready to take on the world and the man trying to push her off her land. She will not give in nor will she sale and she sure isn't going to get married. Her father has other ideas as he calls Duncan home to help with the trouble. Marry? Duncan? Is her father crazy? This is not going to happen, no way no how.......Duncan left years ago leaving behind the only girl he would ever love. She was to young and he knew if he stayed she would be his. He could not do that to her father the only man who had taken him in and help raise him. He would not repay this kind man by deflowering his daughter so he ran and started a new life. He has changed grow cold, hard with the life he is leading. He has never forgotten the young lady who turned his world upside down. When he gets the summons to return home to help. The ranch is in danger along with Catherine there is no way he can turn his back. He comes home to find all he ever wanted on one little ranch and the women of his dreams could be his. If he can only talk the bullheaded women in agreeing to marry him. Love well he isn't so sure about that. He might just find that as Catherine gives him a run for his money that she is the only women he has or will ever love.Her father I believe has always wanted these two to marry. As danger comes to his ranch he puts his plans into action. He isn't taking any chances as he throws in a few twist of his own that leaves two peoples world spinning. One is all for it and the other say no way in hell. This man shows what a true father should be. Caring. loving and wanting the best for those he loves. He is as strong willed as his daughter guess she got that natural.Lia Frederick did an outstanding job of narration she has a wonderful voices that adds much to this audio. She put a lot of emotion in to each characters voice you had no problem knowing what they were feeling. There was no background noise, no breaks taken that you could tell.  You had no trouble knowing who was talking and what sex they were. She gives life to the landscape around so you can picture it in your mind. You heart breaks at each twist the author gives you with the impact the narrator puts on this audio. The audio flow was smooth and even which made it a wonderful listen.What made this story for me was the strong will and bullheadedness of these who people neither giving in. Feelings that last a lifetime through many changes as two people get to know each other again. Both have grown cold, hard but still have a soft place for the other. The pull is still strong even after all these years. There is mystery and things are not always as you see them. Just as you think you have a handle on the plot the author twists them. I loved the suspense, the danger and the back and forward baiting of Catherine and Duncan. The Indian chief stoled my heart with his wisdom and caring ways. Both Catherine and Duncan are strong willed neither willing to give in. The detail the author and narrator give of things around them is outstanding. The heartbreak you feel all the way to your heart as it breaks for them over their lost and trials.The only thing missing for me would have been a little more detail of the earlier years. I would have loved to have gotten to know them as young teens. Maybe learned a little more about how Duncan and her father came to be with the saving of his life. It does not take away from the story just something I would have liked to know more of. For me this was a well told story that kept me listening. I found things I needed to do around the home so I could listen longer. The author gives you wonderful characters with a well thought out plot. I thought this was well written along with a wonderful narrator which made this a winning story for me. If you love westerns love stories from long ago with all the trails of making a living with the danger it brings this is the author and the book for you. I cannot wait to start another audio by this author and narrator. You cannot go wrong with this being a free read adding the audio for 1.99 it is a win, win all the way around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SWZW4HYLIB2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JFMPYU#wasThisHelpful","R1SWZW4HYLIB2K","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very interesting read and is going to be an outstanding series as the author takes you on the hunt for a serial killer. This is full of twists and turns as the author grabs your attention and doesnt let it go. It is full of mystery not only of who the killer is but why others are dying and who is hiding secrets and for what reason. Someone wants Addie dead she is being hunt down and shot at for the secrets she may hold to what happen many years ago. If these things are found out it could harm people and their careers. As more people end up dead and letters sent is there a copy cat of is the serial killer still out there killing? The chase is on to find the answers before Addie and her unborn child are killed.Addie is a lovely headstrong woman who just found out that her true father is a killer and might be out to kill her. Weston will have his hands full keeping her alive as he tries his best to keep his hand off her. One night is not going to be enough to get this hot blooded women out of his mind. He breaks into her home after months of last being with her only to find out he will be a father soon. Their one nightstand has made a new life. Not only does he have to keep her alive but he will have to win her heart after the way he left her. He has a few secrets of his own that he must clear up which doesnt make him look very well. At every turn there seems to be bullets flying and more people mixed up in the mess than just her father. Weston will also have to not only win over Addie but her family as he tries to keep one step ahead of the killer. I really like Weston he is strong, he has his own reasons for wanting to find this serial killer. Now with Addie expecting just adds more to the list of reasons why this man must be found.Addie isnt having nothing to do with Weston it was a shock to find out he lied about his name. That he used her to get answers she didnt have in return putting her in danger. She finds this is a big mystery with answers she might not want to find out. Not knowing who you are and where you came from with no memory of before you were found in the woods is trying enough. But to find out your true father is a serial killer and wants you dead is just mind blowing. Now with Weston back in her life trying to keep her safe she doesnt know where or who to turn to. As the killer closes in she finds herself in Westons arm trying to find comfort as she finds more questions than answers.This author gives you a wonderful plot with so many twists that will blow your mind. Just as you work out one detail she throws you a curve you do not see coming. This is one story that has lots of action, suspense and thrills along with a few love scenes as she turns up the heat for Addie and Weston. You the read will not be sure who you can trust or which way to turn. At times the story is a little slow but it doesnt take long for the author to get your heart pumping again with new mystery of not only who the serial killer is but who is really after Addie. It is going to be interesting to find out all the secrets as this serial unfolds. I am really looking forward to the next read from this author.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JC5G4OV1TG63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YN1DV9E#wasThisHelpful","R3JC5G4OV1TG63","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 5 part to the series OH MY it sure has some thrills in this one. Just when you think all is well the author gives you a BIG Bam Bang at the end. We only have a few weeks to wait to see how this pans out but it sure doesn't look to good. I can hardly wait to see what this author has in store for us in part 6. As is the normal for this author she throws some surprises in you do not see coming.Each family have to be married within a year of their fathers death. Time is running out and the dating game is on. Not everyone has a kind heart some want to take over as lead of the pack. Every person must be watch as each person could be the enemy. The dating game has been fun and Rayne has narrowed down her choices. Storm who she hates has a very strong pull on her but can he really be trusted when she needs him the most. They have been enemies for so long but there is a fine line between love and hate. Who will win her heart in the end?I love these characters each one you hold dear as the enemy unfolds you have to feel sorry for most of them. Rayne has really started growing up at first I didn't care to much for her but she  is learning, growing, maturing, as she discovers what is important. She has become one of my favorite. I have enjoyed getting to know each man that are in the games and some I really like. My heart will always be with Storm who will always be my alpha. What is there not to like he is strong, powerful and willing to fight for his family. The last book left us up in the air about his feelings for Rayne but this book clearly lays it all out but it might be to late as danger is near. Who will win and will Rayne find her true mate will that be Storm?I have really enjoyed this series and can hardly set to wait for the next and last installment in this series. The author gives you a thrilling read as she takes you on the road to find the mates. The enemy comes out to fight leaving ones hurt and others death as the fight goes on and the author leaves you with one heck of an ending. I have truly come to love this authors writing style as she bends the story to keep you hanging on. I wish it was Nov already and I had the last book in my hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CT3D4SDIRLUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H4VI58#wasThisHelpful","R3CT3D4SDIRLUT","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a charming holiday romance with lots of smiles and laughs and a great addition to this series. The author gives you a wonderful story of misunderstanding where things start flying and tempters rise. This all in the first few pages. I just LOVED it. This is a short quick read that will keep you turning the pages to find out what else these two have up their sleeves as they bait each other.Crispin comes a pond a little girl setting under a tree he is so sweet, caring and loving it really touches your heart. When he places the little girl on his horse a mad lady come and attacks him yelling let my sister go. This is when it hits the fan so to speak and things get very interesting.Crispin has been a little of a rake. He has changed his way but it does seem his rep is still damage. He is a lovely character which any women would be proud to call her own if she could catch him. I love his humor and his baiting to bring a smile to Gwen face. He is just a sweet heart who puts family first.Gwen has been hurt in the past and is will to settle for some sweet, kind there doesn't have to be passion just any old guy would do. She has her sights set one on but with Crispin coming in the picture she finds the other lacking. When she finds out who she attacked she is mortified. There is from batting back and forward between the do as the dance the dance of love. I really like Gwen her heart is in the right place, she is kind and loving. She just protects those around her.I loved the baiting these two did, the humor keeps you smiling. Each are a lot alike and family comes first. Her brother-in-law and sister are so protective of her. This book is all about family and the love they give each other. The wonderful sister who gets into trouble and the baiting they do with each other. This is a pretty clean read with family values. For me this was a win win read from the first page to the last. With it being a short read there isn't a lot you can say without giving the plot away. The ending is wonderful with more misunderstanding Gwen sure does have a tempter. I sure hope that Crispin is prepare to see it for the rest of his life but first he must win the girl.I love this authors writing style the way she brings her stories together giving a well written story of sorrow, pain, love and humor. If you pick up one of her book than you know the reason she has won so many awards. I have come to know when I see this authors name it will be a book full of all the things that makes a wonderful romance. I can't wait to read more in this series. They are so full of life, love and happiness.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3COJ7AE471S1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122S0246#wasThisHelpful","R3COJ7AE471S1K","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A wonderful heartwarming box-set that hooks you from the first page to the last by very wonderful talented authors. There is a little of everything for everyone in this set. I totally love these stories.The Comeback Christmas by Melinda CurtisThis was a very touching story of loss and finding who and what you are. A story of second chances of two people falling in love at a very young age only to find life gets in the way as they break each other heart only to come full circle years late. Do they have what it takes to forgive and love again. I love these characters both are about to loss it all as they find away to help each other and find maybe they need to give love another chance. As all books in this series this was well written. I had trouble putting it down. I have always been a fan of Ms. Curtis. She has done an outstanding job bring this lovely story together.A Home by Christmas by Anna AdamsAnother sweet heartwarming read about second chances and finding out who you are and what you really want. This was a story I could relate to with life being so busy for each of us trying to find time for everyone is hard. So many life lesson these two will have to agree to as they find out the true meaning of love. I just adore the twins each have to over come losing their mother and fear losing their father.

"This was another short listen by this author who has the knack to put a lot into a short time frame. This was a very exciting action adventure full of thrills as the author takes you on a journey of supernatural meeting humans. Aliens have taken over London and are working on taking over the world. They have blocked out the sunlight for the most part leaving nothing but black clouds. As the humans try to find a way to get back their country a lady comes into their lives. Where she came from and how she acts if very much a mystery, they are shocked to see all that she is able to do.It is hard for me to pick a favorite character there are so many that grab you and pull you in. Keely is a wonder and a thrill to picture from the way she dresses to the way she carries herself. Thomas is a sweet nerd who is a delight as he designs weapons to help take down the aliens. Doctor Hunter is a very nice sweet man who does his best to help Keely find her way and learn of the country she is in.  Mattie I just loved her attitude but I think she is more a sweet old lady who is lonely. I loved  Phil Mayes accent he was a delight to listen to. I thought his tones were great, his emotion outstanding. He really made you feel each emotion of all the characters. You had no trouble knowing who was speaking whether it was male or female. You could hear him swallow from time to time but it didn't take away from the listen. There was no background noise and his tones were even throughout. If he took a break you could not tell. I look forward to listening to more audios from this narrator.The author gives you a wonderful exciting, thrilling read/listen that was a delight. There wasn't a character that I didn't like. His story telling is outstanding as he pulls you in and takes you to another place and time. The only thing I would have liked to have known was more about Keely. Where she came from and why London, what does she really expect the human to do. Is she friend or not? I thought the author filled in the rest of the story very well never leaving you guessing. It is so hard to put everything that needs to be told in a short story but I feel this author does a wonderful job of it. I am looking forward to listening to more audio from him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNU268PB046H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EKXPJI#wasThisHelpful","RWNU268PB046H","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book I have read by this author and I have to say it is the best. After reading Blind Love I do not know what I expect but it sure wasn't this. The author gives you adventure with many twist and turns. Things are not always as they seem for sure. This is really an outstanding read of survival, getting even, taking back your life, facing your fears as you face your past which you have lost and learning to start over again when you do not know which way to turn. I can't even image going through what Alisha did. It would be bad enough being taken but to being taken to another country where everything is so strange you wouldn't know which end is up. To live day to day in a country you do not even know their language with no friends to talk to only a doctor and your husband who isn't your husband would be ungodly. Than to be taken and beaten over and over again for little or no reason is just mind blowing. What this author gives you is a well told story with a wonderful plot of one women and how she survived building a new life and a new family that gave her the reason to carry on.Alisha is a sweet wonderful caring lady that gives so much of herself to everyone. She has a wonderful husband who adores her. A loving family that bring a smile to her face with their love. She has the best and everything any women could want until the day she walked outside and someone took her to a new country, killed people in front of her and became her worse nightmare. She prays for someone to come get her and take her home. She prays for the love of her life until the day she sees a picture and knows her life is over. She has nowhere to go, no one to love and no reason to live until the day she built her new family from those around her that are going through the same thing she is. Will this nightmare ever end? Will she ever find a way out and a place to call hers?David remembers it like it was yesterday even through it has been two years since the love of his life came up missing. He has turned over every stone, she is nowhere but in his dreams. Those wonderful dreams at night when he is asleep she comes to him he reaches out and touches her only to wake and find she is gone. After two long painful years he has found someone who can make him smile again. If she could only make him forget.....until the day a man came to him and said your wife is alive and is the second wife of another man. He leaves no stone unturned as he finds away to get to her and bring her home but will it be too late?What makes this such an outstanding read from me is the plot and the writing style of this author. I have said it before and I am saying it again this is one author you want to keep your eyes on. This is a very believable plot with some wonderful caring characters. Some you will love and others you will want to kill yourself. The author gives you all the fact without the terrible scenes of every fact. You know what happen and you know it is terrible but you do not read all the details. You can feel the pain of the victim as she is taken used over and over again by an evil man but it is told in a way that your mind can handle it. There are so many victims here from one man that hates. No one said no to him if they do he kills them or takes them. No one has been able to stop him. Alisha believes she can and will die trying, she has nothing to lose and nothing to live for. He must die, his evil must be stopped. There is many more beside her that have paid his price. She vows no more will die because of him. David isn't walking away he will make this man pay for what he has not only done to him but his wife. He will not leave Pakistani without her. Now it becomes a fight to the death who will live and who will die.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R299T2CKBPZ8O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144W7QEW#wasThisHelpful","R299T2CKBPZ8O7","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author gives you a little bit of everything in this short read. It might be short but you are never left hanging as he goes into details about each scene. I found this to be a delightful adventurous listen as he takes you on a journey in taking down a spy who wants the war to continue. The author brings the past to meet the future in this fun loving read. This is a very fast moving listen with pirates, spies, love interest set in the Civil War time frame as he brings modern technology with explosion of two airships meeting in a fight that is life and death. Anastasia buts her and her child's life on the line as she fights the evil and bring justice to the states. Kat Marlowe did a good job in the narration. I did enjoy the listen as she brought to life the wonderful characters. Her tones were good but at times she really needed to take a breath. It sound at times like she was robotic not all the time just a few places. She did pull me in and take me to another place in time which I truly enjoyed. The characters you had no trouble knowing who was speaking. The male and female were done in great character voices I did not hear any background noise and the audio was very clear. As she takes on more books I am sure she will get it down. I do feel she will become a wonderful narrator and I very much look forward to listening to more from her. It was a really good audio that I would like to listen to again.The author gives you a believable story with wonderful characters as he pulls you in. At times your heart races wondering if they will make it out alive. The author gives you tons of action as he takes you through a very thrilling read. He even throws in a little love interest which will break your heart. There was nothing I didn't like in this read. The authors writing still is outstanding. For a short read there is a lot going on and you are never left behind guessing. I look forward to listening to more audios from this author. I recommend you pick this up of a pleasant nice listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPD3YFJGUHP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGIAR5U#wasThisHelpful","R1VPD3YFJGUHP5","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed listening to this story I thought it was a interesting read with humor, drama and passion. I doubt many people have worse luck than Lady Eleanor it does seem at every turn someone is one step ahead of her make it hard to believe anything she said. She is holding all her cards close to her chest not giving out much information. She has so much to give the right man and all she asks for return is to be respect, cared for and honored. She isn't interested in love just want a man that will not abuse her and trust her. Is that to much to much to ask for? It does seem so when you live in a world where man rule and show no respect to women they are for one thing only and can do with their women as they see fit. They are mean as they use, abuse and beat the women they marry all wanting one thing at this time she has been unable to give. You might say her heart you would be wrong for they have no desire for that they want something much bigger and are willing to fight to take her and keep her. That is until one night when she walks in the snow and finds 3 sisters who want her help to get back at their lord brother. Pranks lead to danger as one man is taken in and weds a lady he does not know why another come to take her away any way he can.Lady Eleanor I thought was sweet but it does seem the whole world as turned against her. She has been abused and will not take give of herself easy until Alexander shows her how a man should treat a women. She still does not take things as face value for she has seen how sweet and kind men can be when they want something. She knows they will turn on you on a dime when things do not go their way. She is scared that he will turn on her if she gives him the truth he seeks. This causing trouble for them and makes her look guilty at every turn. Can she learn to trust and give what he needs before time runs out and all is lost?Alexander is a man of honor who lives for his family. Times are hard and he does the best he can without giving away just how poor they truly are. When he meets Eleanor he is taken in he see that she is not trusting and has been abused. He wants to make her smile give her a little happiness. His sisters have a plan for him which he knows nothing about until the deed is done and he has little choice but to go along with it. On the day of their wedding he learns so much about her and her lies. He cannot abide by lies and goes to annul their marriage. Eleanor sees things differently as she puts a plan into action to keep the marriage intact. Alexander works towards finding the truth but it might be to late for there is evil all around who is willing to die for the hand of Lady Eleanor. Saskia Maarleveld does a wonderful job of narration her many voices are clear and strong. You have no trouble knowing who is talking as she takes you on a wonderful tale the author has wrote. There are no background noises nor any breaks it is all even tone each character is easy to understand and each voice is different. Ms. Maarleveld brings so much to this audio her tones and voice you have no trouble knowing what each characters are feeling. You can hear the sadness and laughter as she uses her voice to bring this story alive. Her tones are even, smooth and her voice is a joy to listen to. This is the first time I have listen to this narrator and I look forward to listening to more from her. I love her accent it brings more to the audio as she takes you back in time to a world you know little about. Outstanding listen.This is the first time I have read/listen to anything by Ms. Delacroix. I found this story to be a delight. She has wonderful characters that you will fall in love with as she gives you a wonderfully captivating listen. There is drama as one women tries to find a safe haven. She gives you sadness that will break your heart and laughter that you will find delightful. The author gives you a compelling store which has adventure, a few thrills and even a chill that you will say OH NO please let this turn out right. She does give you a wonderful HEA but first these characters must fight to stay alive. Here characters you will love as they work their way through trying times. The supporting characters will keep you laughing as each woman are strong and will have their due. The author writes in a style that pulls you in as you feel each emotion of these characters and all they go through. I really enjoyed this book and feel most that like this time in history will enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4XC44JN6UFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PE8SYAG#wasThisHelpful","R2W4XC44JN6UFL","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This books starts off a little slow but when it takes off it takes off with a bang. You have to people who have been hurt and betrayed in the worse way. Both have trust issues as they have build up walls around their heart. As they come together and finally fine happiness working through their issues you would think life would come up roses. In this case you have an ex who will not let go, a father who wants his son, a sister who just wants to get to know her brother. Just as you think you worked out one issue the author throws a twist you do not see coming. Before you know it you are hooked on a page turning read you can't put down.Gracie is a wonderful sweet lady who just wants a normal life. She runs into a man who knocks the breath right out of her. He then more or less stalks her until she gives him her attention. She fights the pull as the attraction is strong, it isn't long before she finds she is fighting a losing battle.Luke is a love them and leave them man who never sleeps with the same women twice. He is bored with life and looking for something more. When he runs into Gracie and almost knocks her down all it took was one look into her eyes and he was hooked. There is no way this woman is getting away from him. He follows her home and makes her give him her attention. One thing leads to another as he rocks her world.This is where things gets interesting as the author puts a little suspense into the read. Things might now be as they seem. People want things and they will take them anyway they can get them. They use people twist things to their way of thinking. Just as the cards look like they might be staked in Luke and Gracie's favor they find the cards are about to fall down all around them. Can love keep them together or will life pull them apart?This is a very interesting read as the author gives you a wonder story of lose, criminals, heartbreak, starting over and learning to love again. She gives you some very steamy heated love scenes that will burn up the pages and make you blush. For me once this book took off I could not put it down and had to read it at one setting. I love this authors writing style as she gets your blood pumping between your love scenes and her wonderful suspenseful plot. This is one story I would enjoy reading again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMO5P1UY99Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8T5XVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BMO5P1UY99Y1","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a standalone read a story filled with a lot of drama and ex's who want the good doctor back. Women who will go to extreme links to get what they want.  Ellie is a wonderful sweet character who wants to learn as much as she can. Her true dream is to help children. When she was offered the job in the states she decided to give it a try. On starting her new job she runs into the head nurse who doesn't like her. When things start to heat up with Dr Julien the head nurse decides to cause trouble. Once the fall out happens she just won't give up. She isn't the only women that comes out of the woodwork that has a past with the good doctor.Julien is a nice sweet character who uses and throws women away like dish water. Somehow the person he is just doesn't work with the character in the book for me. The books starts with him coming off as an womanize but I just do not get this feel from him. For me he just wasn't an alpha male there was no take control. Not much head butting as you get with an alpha.I really didn't feel much chemistry or sexual tension between the two main characters. I do not feel the pull that I have in other books. This is not to say this wasn't a good story or plot because it was. With reading the book description I just didn't get that out of the book. I did enjoy the read it isn't a book I would want to read again but was an interesting read and I am not sorry I read it.The author does give some heated love scenes that are a high heat level. I have to say this was a pretty good read. For me the author just didn't not pull me in and take over my mind. She does give a wonderful HAE which will touch your heart. The characters are sweet, caring and loving. Again this is just my thoughts please pick it up and give it a read. The reviews on this are wonderful which leaves me thinking I must have missed something somewhere along the way.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6G9Q199UGZZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QOO7NK#wasThisHelpful","R6G9Q199UGZZ4","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being from Virgina myself this book caught my attention. The author has an outstanding plot which she keeps interesting as she spins a tell of one man going off to war leaving a wife and daughter behind. Many years later he finds out his wife has died and his daughter is living with her family. On his return the family will not give him his daughter so he goes in the dead of night and takes her away. His wife's family wants her back, men are seen watching the home. To keep his daughter he needs a wife he marries the lady next door who needs his help to keep her land. When things are starting to work out for them a lady from the past comes home and throws their world into a tail spin.Sophie is a sweet and caring lady when her family turns on the states she is left alone to try to make the best of it. She is giving and wants to do best by those around her. It is little wonder why the General falls in love with her. She takes his child as her own and gives his life new meaning. Helps run his home taking care of the staff as they are family. Just as she has it all she is about to lose it when his first wife comes home. I really liked this character she is a truly lady who puts others first and herself last. She is one character I was glad to see a happy ending for.Seamus has been through so much having fought a war being away from home for so long. With the war ending he finds his wife is dead, his daughter doesn't know him and his wife's family will not let him have her. He takes her only to find they are willing to fight to keep her. He does what is best finding a new wife to keep all that is his in return helping Sophie keep what is hers. Just when life is coming up roses his first wife appears wanting him back. He just found a love like no other and is about to lose it all. The General is a man of honor who has lost a lot in this war. He never thought he would find another lady to love now Sophie and his daughter is his world and he is about to lose it all. He is just a strong loving man what is there not to like about this character. Any women should be proud to call him her own.The author gives you a well told story just a little long in places. It wasn't a story that kept me spellbound but one I did enjoy. She does throw in a few twists and turns to keep the story interesting. For me this book moved a little slow and at times I found my mind wondering but I was pulled back in as things came to a head with family issues. It isn't a story I would want to reread but one I enjoyed and was glad I had read. The author throws in a little mystery to keep the book entertaining. If you enjoy historical romance this one is well worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2945MV6DRRX21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGKVS#wasThisHelpful","R2945MV6DRRX21","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I listened to this on audio...love the narrator and this storyI have to say I am so hooked on this series, each book is just as good or better than the last. I love this authors writing style and her imagination. The characters give so much not only to each other but to us the readers as they take us on a wonderful journey into their pack as they go through their every day lives and trials to be the best pack they can be. As you find in this pack not everyone is for the pack and what is best. Rules are broken women are cut to the bone as they are little more than slaves. It takes one man coming to a small town turning it on it's ear to stir things up and hopefully get it back to the way things should have been done to start with. The author gives you a wonderful story which includes heartbreak, death, hurt and pain as she bring the characters to their true meaning and gives them hope for a better life.Come take a step back in time as you read about things you would have seen many hundreds of years ago. It seems that Gold Gulch needs to move up to more modern times. This town is a tourist attraction that keep the Victorian lifestyle alive only they never get out of it even when the tourist go home. These wolvers want to keep their women out of the loop making them believe they cannot think for themselves. Women can't own property and have little or no money. The men of the pack control everything keeping the little women busy cleaning and cooking why the man live it up.Rachel has had enough she will not let any man control her. She doesn't every plan on finding a mate, she likes her life just the way it is. Well not just like it is but the best she can have it that is until the sheriff comes to town and makes her heart beat a little faster. She starts thinking things she shouldn't as her wolf comes out to play.You know whatever Eugene Begley, has his hand into there is going to be some tempters rise and some hearts beating to their own beat. He has a way of matching wolvers up and I do believe he gets a kick out of setting back watching the sparks fly.Challenger is sent to this small town to find out what the problem is. Things just aren't adding up as the birth rate is down and no one seems to every smile. The women are old before their time and the town doesn't seem to be making much money. Challenger has his hands full not only with the town and their people but finding out what is going on and putting it right. Not to mention Rachel who he can't help but make that red hair tempter glow.What the author brings to the table is one well told story full of humor, sparks, passion, danger and lot of tempters flying. Ms. Rhoades gave me a tale of a wonderful story that I have come to expect from her writing. Before you are through you yourself will believe in wolvers, packs and honor as the woman rebel and raise some tempters as they bring the bad wolvers down and get their town back.  I love the characters some are just busy bodies why others just keep you laughing. The author brings the reader passionate love scenes as she keeps you guessing what will happen next. I can't wait for the next one it looks to be as good as this one. You really should give this author a try I am sure you will love her wolvers as much as I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F2LL9XJLZDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFRZ63O#wasThisHelpful","R8F2LL9XJLZDC","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Snow gives you what you come to expect a very emotional outstanding love story. I do not think there are many topics she doesn't hit on in this story with a wonderful outstanding plot spins of action, mystery, love, with many twists and turns I doubt you will be able to guess who the killer is. She gives you a compelling story of best friends, family as they go through so very heart breaking times. She lays the passion on between Scott and Sky about half way through they start burning up the pages. Ms. Snow pulls you in and hooks you with her amazing writing talent.Skye is burned out she has been on tour for a year, her record label are making demands she doesn't want to give.

She turns to Scott as he turns to her they take comfort from the other as they find life is easier when you have the right one by your side. Both wishing this were turn as they find out it takes more than love to keep that right one by your side.The author covers a lot of issues in this book, this is a very emotional read it goes through each characters trying life. She touches on gay and bisexual relationships how that affected the characters. It is not in depth but just touched on as to make the story more interesting. There will be one book in this series that will hit on it hard. I do have to say this isn't my genre but having gotten to know the characters in question I am very much looking forward to their story.The author gives you down to earth characters with real life issues you can relate to. This is the second book I have read of this author which had me hook as much as the first read. I am so looking forward to seeing where she takes each of these characters as this series takes off. With this book being the first of the series I can only image how good the rest of this series will be. Ms. Snow knows how to get into the depth of the story as she reaches for the readers heart pulling you in and keeping you guessing to the outcome. Even with the few hints she gives I would have never have worked out the killer. She gives you a compassionate compelling read that will have you pulled in as she hooks you with the plot throwing in some very steamy love scenes. For anyone who does not care for the gay and bisexual relationships this is not something that is gone into in depth just talked about it shouldn't be a problem. It does add and bring so much to the story as the author throws another twist into the read. If you are looking for a story that keeps you on your toes and keeps you guess this is the one for you.There is humor, tears, love and laughter as the author gives you an outstanding plot of pain, sorrow, love why these families find their way through some very trying times. I found this to be a wonderful read that I plan on reading again. There was nothing I did not like about this story. I adored all the characters, loved the plot and the twist keep me turning the pages. I stayed up late into the night until I could not keep my eyes open. This is one series you are not going to want to miss","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAB5WBIFJZKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WZX096#wasThisHelpful","R1JAB5WBIFJZKK","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was an interesting story with lots to get into. I do feel I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it and not listened to the audio. The author does have a wonderful imagination and the story is believable. I did have a problem with some of the curse words at the beginning and thought this was the way the whole story would be. The author does calm that down which make it a more enjoyable listen. The author gives you a story of a one nightstand where the lady isn't happy with this. Since she is a witch she turns him in to a cat and the story goes on from there with him trying to get his old self back and the lady who doesn't have a clue helps him.As  the audio takes off I found the narrator to be very good but after a while it just seemed every character whined. For me that was a little bit to much whining. If this is how the author mean for the story to be taken than the narrator did an outstanding job of the narration. I did feel she brought life to the characters. I just feel I would have liked this book better if I had read it. Which is usually the other way around. Beside the book being to whining I thought the narrator did a good job. I heard no back ground noise in the audio, there were a few times I could tell she had taken a break and restarted. But all in all not a bad audio if you can get past all the characters whine. I would like to listen to another book from this narrator to see if this is her style of the way the book was written.As for the story it's self I didn't understand why the need for masturbation. I thought that was out of place. The rest of the story was very interesting as Dimitri found his self turned into a cat with the hope of getting nine lives. If the witch has her choice he won't get past one. This is a hard book for me to review as I look back over the story all I can hear is the whining of each character. I may try reading the book and see if that will help my review any. I thought the narration a 3, all over I am going to give it a 4 because I kind of feel the author really wanted the characters to whine. The story I will give a 4 since I thought it was interesting even though I had a few issues which I thought were either not needed or were to much. The author gives a story that most likely could pull you in if you had read it and not listened to it.I do have to say I am sorry but this was not a win win listen for me. I can't say there were not part I didn't enjoy because there was. As an audio it isn't one I would want to listen to again. I really hate to say that but it is true. Give the book and the audio a try do not let my thoughts stop you from picking it up. We all cannot enjoy the same thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAWT9510DGHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8HLU2U#wasThisHelpful","R1CAWT9510DGHS","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has become a very interested series full of action, thrills and the hunt for mates for 2 sisters and their brother. It does seem someone doesn't want this to happen. All three must marry before the year is up or lose everything. Rayne has been having sexy dreams of a man in this installment you find out who that man is. You might be surprised as to the outcome and what this man and really all the men want or expect. Just when you think you know one you find out new things about him. Who will win the hand of the lovely Rayne and who will be sent home as the games being.This was very well written I do have to say I wish I didn't have to wait for the next book to come out and have it all in one book. The wait to see who wins and who is behind all the trouble is killing me. I enjoyed reading about the dates how the men put so much into it as they put their best foot forward. I would have thought Storm would have done better I have to wonder what he is up two. Three of these men have to be sent home. It might surprise you to find out which three it is and why. I thought the author gave a wonderful plot, the story keeps you interested as you quickly turn the pages to find out who and why. I am really looking forward to reading the next book to find out who will win her hand and who will end up with the brother and sister.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6HYAB7OI53F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159A7NH8#wasThisHelpful","R3K6HYAB7OI53F","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is nothing like getting so many different genres in one set you have Cowboys, rock stars, hockey players, shifters, vampires and so much more! At the time of this post it is only 0.99 for 11 books you can't beat that, grab it now on release day it will go to 3.99.Longing for Langston (Mavericks of Meeteetse Prequel) by Renee VincentThis was a wonderful heartbreaking romance about two best friends who loved each other but neither know it. One wants a dream in country music they other would do anything to make that dream come true.Brody is your bad boy in every way, in some way he might need to grow up a little. I just love him and it breaks my heart to see his breaking. He wants what is best for Olivia he just wishes it would include him. The way he is going that just isn't going to happen.Olivia is a sweetie who just wants to break it big in Nashville and if she could have Brody as her one and only that would be wonderful as well. Brody has always looked after her, been there for her and has been the love of her life for as long as she can remember. Things might just be looking up for these two but at what cost.I really liked this story it was a very short touching read which sets this new series off with a bang. After reading this you will want to pre-order the next book in this series to find out what happens to this couple. The author gives a wonderfully written short story of the start of her new series. It is a very touching read that will have you hook as she gives you so very heated hot scenes. I guess you could say it has a cliffhanger but it is a prequel to this authors new series ""Made For McKinely"" This is one read that can't wait for this series to start. There is nothing that gets your heart as someone loving someone they can't have. Each of this series of Ms. Vincent will be a standalone but if you like me you won't be able to stop at just one. I believe I might have found another author I am going to come to love.I was given Longing for Langston (Mavericks of Meeteetse Prequel) by Renee Vincent for an honest review. Thank you so much for letting me read this before it was released.

"The quest continues as Rayne moves on to the next one on the list a very sweet and gentleman who has all the right moves until he puts a twist on it. With no hopes of a mate they go back to the list deciding to get it over with a mating game with every male her father gave her. A few past contenders show up and one wants a second chance. Storm is still not happy and shows his alpha self off throwing his weight around.The author gives you a wonderful short read that grabs your attention with a page turner. She throws in enough passion to keep you interested along with a few twists and turns. The characters you love are back as they move on to find out what the plan is to keep River from being the alpha wolf and taking over this fathers pack. This was well written wonderful read that has me hooked on this series. They have been fighting a battle on finding their mates as their fathers will states they have one year to mate or they lose everything. There are people who do not want to see this happen as you find out in the story when they throw walls up at every turn to stop any of them from reaching their goal. If they can just stop one of them the others have won. It might even come down to a fight to the death before either sides gives in. If one of the three dies the will cannot be completed. I do not put this past the enemy to win the game they are playing.The characters are well liked and believable. Before you know it the author sucks you into this read as she gives you an outstanding plot.  Rayne is growing up and learning so much about herself and her desires. There is a mystery man that comes to her in her dreams we will be meeting soon. Those are some hot little scenes.

"The author grabs you attention with a mystery of Texas Thunder moonshine and they family feuding around it as she gives you a intriguing, complex beginning to the Rebel Moonshine series and the love that never was. Two people who have loved each other for a century to bullhead to see it as their families along with other issues torn them apart. It isnt easy when families cant get along because of a falling out they had before you were born. They had the best moonshine around, the best of buddies until one day it all fall apart they torn the recipe in half along with their friendship. Now with times being hard and the two families are about to lose their homes the only thing that will save them is the lost recipe for Texas Thunder.Brett and Callie had a thing for each other in high school which turned out bad each going their own way. Years later with the home about to be lost they come together in the hunt for the recipe to sell it to keep their homes. The attraction between the two is stronger than ever it is just to late to forgive and forget the past. One night of misunderstandings tore their world apart as each walked away from the other neither being able to forget or forgive. When these two get together sparks fly as tempters rise, can they keep it together until they can find the recipe or will they give into the lust they hold for each other. What will they do when and if they find out that lust just might be more.The author gives you mysteries of who did it and why. Some of the mysteries will be solved others will go into the next book or maybe even the next one. You see a lot of pain and sorrow from these two along with their grandfathers. Each of the sisters has issues as I am sure will come to light as the series goes on. Bretts sister has been betrayed she isnt looking for a love but she just might be getting it or will this new man break her heart as well. The author gives great characters from pappy who will break your heart as he goes through a trying time. I am sure many of you will relate to him and come to love him as you watch his pain. Bretts sister is a sweetheart who I could relate to she is just down to earth wanting to do what is best for her family as she gets over her ex. The three sisters are a trip as each one deals with their fears, they keep you laughing at the things they pull. I found at times this to be a very humorous book as well as a very sad one. The author does give you passionate love scenes which I really did not feel but it doesnt mean it was not a good read. I thought this was a wonderful read, I enjoyed the humor and getting to know these characters. I am very much looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Ms. Raye is a new author to me that I feel will give us readers a wonderful new series to look forward to. If you are looking for a intriguing, complex for love lost and a family feuding this is the book for you. Sometimes you might just get a second chance to get your hearts desire.

"The author shows another side to the mail-order brides that I am sure has happened a few times. It isn't all hearts and roses sometimes things happen out of your control that my leave the bride or groom waiting at the altar with no partner. As is the case for Heather she really has no choice but to be a mail order bride coming from a big family with so many mouths to feed and little money she decided this was the best choice for her since she could not find work. What she finds on coming to Montana is Hayden isn't interested in a bride, his mother wrote the letter which leaves Heather devastated. She came all this way after many lost nights of sleep wondering if this was the right decision for her. Now to have the man stand up and say I do not want a bride is just a little much for her. What does she do, where does this leave her and how will she make her way. Hayden feels bad but there is no way he is going to marry some women he has never met much less one he has. Plus she is one of those city women who doesn't know how to cook or take care of a family. He just doesn't have time to turn the princess into a small town girl. He has to much on his plate with the new mill order, his father hurt and the machine broken down he just cannot deal with more. Sorry sweetie but you are on your own....Heather is a lovely girl who might be from the big city but she isn't any princess. Being the oldest she had to help at home taking care of all the other children. There isn't much this little lady can't do. if she sets her mind to it she will find a way. Hayden is about to be in for the shock of his life when this lady shows him a thing or two as she turns the tables on him. I really loved this character she is full of life, caring, she grabs the bull by the horn as she makes her way to a new life without a husband. Now she just has to tell her friends and family. She holds her head high as she takes the town by storm to show them just what a big city girl can do. Does this mean life is easy for her, no as a women back in this time making a living isn't easy. There will be many trying times as the men learn she is up for grabs and grab they do as she is come to be known as the mail order bride done wrong. You have never seen the likes of men coming out of the woodwork making a play for the lovely Heather. This woman has so much to give that every man in Montana comes running to see if they can make her his bride.Hayden is a sweet man he doesn't like hurting anyone's feeling but dang it mother just should have kept her nose out of it. The whole town is up in arms over how wrong he did this pretty little lady when he had nothing to do with it. How much more can a man take, he has way to much to do to even deal with this beside he doesn't have time for a city women. What he finds on the first morning is this city women isn't anything like he thought. Man does he get his eyes open the more he sees the more he likes. When others make a play for her hand he finds he doesn't care to much for this. He turned her down now how can he turn this around without looking a fool. He has his hands full in more ways than one. There are a few more surprises in store for you that will keep you laughing and smiling all the way.The narration is outstanding as Lara Asmundson takes you on the journey of Y Knots new mail order bride and the trying times that the author writes about. I just love Ms. Asmundson as a narrator she brings life to the story with her many different voices. If you have listened to other books in this series you know each character has its own voice and they keep the same one no matter how many books are written.  Each emotion you can hear and feel as the narrator tells a story that will break your heart and then keep you laughing at the messes these two wonderful characters get into. Her tones are even, her emotions you can feel in her voice. She never leaves you guessing as to who said what or how they feel. There isn't any background noise nor any uneven tones. Just a smooth rich voice that flows easily. This narrator gives me what I come to expect a well told story that has me hook for the first page.Ms. Fyffe brings so much to the mail order bride series as does Debra Holland. I know when I see Ms. Fyffe's name it is going to be a well told story which will make me sad, even shock at times. One thing I always count on no matter what she will have me laughing before long as she spins and twist her story taking her characters from one mess to another through misunderstanding as they work out what they truly feel. I had to laugh at how the town got involved and the men starting coming around from all over the state. I really felt for Heather so many men to trip over you can hardly move. I think I know how a worm feels when you throw him into a pond of a million fish with each one wanting a bite. Ms. Fyffe gives you stories you can relate to with wonderful characters you will love as she takes you back to a time when things in many ways were simpler, when family meant respect, love, honor, hard work but life was good when you had your family working alongside you before life became the fast lane of high tech. If you haven't read any of the mail order brides series I suggest you start with one of Ms. Fyffe's you won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QI9AXNJJ8PY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH0FQNI#wasThisHelpful","R2QI9AXNJJ8PY4","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is hard for me to pick my favorite out of this series, each one I just love as the author takes you through the trying times of a mail-order bride. The author shows us trying times as lady runs for her life going thousands of miles away marrying a person she does not know and has never met. It isnt all flowers and candy as you find out in Darcy case one evil brother who wants it all, who is willing to put Darcys life on the line to get it. Darcy never wanted to get married she was happy living her life in wealth doing what she wanted to. With her brother getting married and her finding out what he had in store for her and her beloved land she has only one choice. Go fall on the mercy of her friend and see if she can get Gideon to marry her. In doing so she will have control over her fortune and her land keeping it from being tore apart. If she can keep one step ahead of her brother before he hunts her down and makes her do his betting.I really loved Darcy she is a strong woman with a mind of her own doing what she wants but has a very caring heart. I could feel her pain as she ways her choices of what is best for her. Loving her half brother and finding what he was willing to do to her to keep his half as well as hers was hard for her. In marrying a man she must find the right one who knows she has a mind, enjoy the things she does and willing to be her partner not her controller. Her friend said I have found the perfect man for you, she hopes this is true but time will tell and she can talk him into marrying her before her time runs out.Gideon is shy and has a troubled life his self, he comes from a well to do family who expected a lot and didnt like the way he was heading. They had plans for him but he had plans for his self. I guess you could say when he was old enough he ran away to the mountains of Montana making a wonderful home for his self with a few good friends. He never came out of those mountains, built a beautiful home for his self doing what he loves to do which is working in wood. He does long for a family, a wife that is caring, likes the same things he does, one who knows how to love their children for who they are, letting them grow to be what they want to be. He has more or less given up hope of ever finding her. It was a shock for him when he first lays eyes on Darcy. Now he must decide what is best for them both as her brother closes in.As usual for Lara Asmundson her narration is outstanding as I have come to expect. I know when I see this authors and narrators name together I know I am in for a treat. It blows my mind how she can remember each and every characters voice with each book. She nails each one as if she never stops taking a break between each book. I love her character voices she hits the tones right on the money. You can feel the characters emotions and hear their smiles and pains. I do believe there was only one place where I picked up that she took a break her tone was a little higher than the part before. There is no background noise and I saw little difference from the home stereo to car or kindle. Her tones are even, smooth and her voice is a joy to listen to. You have no trouble telling who is speaking whether that be male or female.  Ms. Asmundson as always it is a pleasure listening to a book you have done the narration on.The author gives you a compelling store which has adventure, a few thrills and even a chill. This is a clean read about family, love and heartache. Two people coming together that have lost their family and just wants to be their selves doing what they enjoy doing living in peace with nature. My heart really went out to these two wonderful people who had been hurt in so many ways by those they love. The author writes in a style that pulls you in as you feel each emotion of these characters and all they go through. The trying times of deciding what is best knowing there is only one way to make it all right. She gives you wonderful characters you can relate to and you will fall in love with as she takes you on a journey across many miles to find happiness, love and put the past behind you. For Darcy the past is about to hit her head on with a powerful reality. This is one story that will pull at your heart and may bring tears to your eye as your heart beats so fast you think it will beat out of your chest. I think out of all the mail-order bride series this one touched my heart the most with Darcys heart breaking tale. If you enjoy a clean read that is well written with a wonderful plot that will keep you guessing I hope you pick up Darcys story either in an audio (which you will love) or in a book. Give this author a read/listen you wont be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188CGLX4X4674/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISQ8ZZ0#wasThisHelpful","R188CGLX4X4674","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a good read giving you a little action with a few very controlling men one who just wants the best for his sister the other said he wants what is best for the pack. I am not sure I am buying that but we will see as the story continues. It is hard enough when you are on the outs with your family but what do you do when the father you love who you havent seen in years dies leaving a will that said you must marry within a year or you lose everything. He gives you a list of those to choose from some you have never met and others you do not care for. For Rayne she thinks her father has lost it with Storms name being added to the list she is sure of it. She doesnt need the money but the wise father throws in a twist if one does not comply with the rules they all are cut out of the will. The others need the money this first installment in this series is about the fathers will, the trying times for the pack, and Raynes first date.The author gives you lovely characters and tells a little about each in this first installment. Rayne is a strong willed lady who knows her mind not letting herself be pushed around. This does get her into a lot of trouble as you will find as you read this delightful read. This is a very short read which gives you most of the information you will need. I found very little was left out and the author never leaves you hanging. As with most short reads a reviewer cannot give out to much information or there would be no reason for you to read the book.River her brother is now the alpha and leader of their pack. He isnt finding that easy with other packs wanting to take it over. He is strong and a loving man who will have some tough decisions to make some will be about Rayne but he must do what is best for the pack. I really liked him he is an upfront person who cares so much and will make a great leader I am sure if he can just find the right mate.Rhyme is a lovely lady with a few issues she is working through. She and Rayne had a major falling out which tore the family apart. With their fathers dead they have come together and straightened out past mistakes. There isnt a lot about her in this book but more will come as the series takes off.The first date for Rayne was interesting as she works her way through the list of men her father gave her. I am not sure what the date thought he was doing which got him and Rayne in a mess of trouble. With Storm to the rescue things heat up. I will be very surprised when this series is over and these two do not end up together. They have wonderful chemistry as the passion heats up but neither seems to be interested in taking it farther. They do not even seem to like each other but we will seeI thought this was well written with little left out. I understood why the sisters stopped speaking to each other. I could not understand why Rayne did not go home for years why she was away at school. She adores her father I just do not feel the drift between the two sisters would have kept her away from her father. Maybe I missed something but for me this was not explained. That is the only issues I had with this read. I thought the author did an outstanding job of writing a short story and of course this is a cliffhanger but I knew that going in. For a short story that is very interesting the author does hold your attention and gives a well put together story for a reasonable price. She gives you and exciting plot with action and a few thrills that makes this a page turner. If you are into Paranormals and Werewolves I am sure you will enjoy this read as much as I did. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series as well as more from this author. I have found this author does have a reading group if you liked the story you might want to join her FB group.

"I thought this book was very interesting with a different twist. The author gives you some really heartbreaking scenes, betrayal no doubt of the worse kind along with starting over. It is never easy to start over when your love one has been killed. For it to happen why in the military to a almost new bride goes beyond the call of duty. I have always said the spouse serve our country just as the ones at war. This book shows that over again, what do you do when it feels like everyone is against you, his family blames you for his death, your military friends are no longer your friends. You pack up and go where? Home? There isnt anything waiting there for you, with nowhere to go or run to lick her wounds Rachel decides to go to the one place she has never been. The grandmother she has never met left her a big estate. Everything, money, a big house and a note that said I am sorry. The mystery begins as Rachel starts over rebuilding her life. What she finds is life might not be as safe as she goes into the forest, she feel something there she is afraid, then it attacks, something or someone comes along, she passes out and wakes to a voice that said do not be afraid I will not hurt you, you are safe. She sees nothing but feels comfort, the voice keeps her there until morning than tells her how to get home and never come back. She doesnt know what to feel or think. There is a man who is watching her making her feel uneasy, he comforts her which even unsettles her more. What is he talking about, what could this all mean.Danger is near, nearer than she thinks.There are to many secretes that she must uncover to find the true meaning and just what did her grandmothers note mean? She finds not everyone is happy she is there, to many things go wrong, to many people are on the huntbut for what?The narrator Shana Pennington-Baird I thought did a great job of narrating. Her different voices added a lot to the audio. It was easy to tell which was male and female and what emotions she was trying to betray. The only problem I saw in this audio was at the beginning of some chapters her voice was louder than the one she just finished. I am guessing this is when she took a break and came back to start recording again. I cannot say it took away from the audio it was more of wow that is different but it isnt long before you get right back into this story. It was a story I did have trouble setting down and really wanted to continue it. There was no background noise at all just nice smooth listening with just the voice getting louder at the beginning of some chapters.  Would I listen to more by this narrator you can bet the bank I would. She really does have a smooth voice that pulls you in and holds you there, at times with your heart in your throat.The author gives a story with many twists and turns that will keep you interested as she tells you a heartbreaking story of love lost and starting over. She takes you on a journey through the forest of the unnatural and Rachel pieces together her family, their lies, betrayal which will cause her lots of pain. It is heartbreaking to see these half human half animals and all they have had to deal with. Life is dangerous as a bounty hunter is following her wanting information she doesnt have.  He will get his information at all cost whatever it takes.You get to meet some wonderful characters that have their own painful story to tell. They come together to unite as a family keeping all those like them safe. Each are special in their own way but Leonardo stands out as he keeps Rachel safe through the many different issues that happen.  As a reader it is hard for your heart not to go out to these characters when you learn their story. Rachel at times I just wish I could have pulled her out of the book to safety and take her sorrow away. The author gives you characters you do not know if you can trust one minute and the next they are dearing and you just love them. Do not believe everything you see for it might not be. As I listened along thoughts started stirring and I thought this it is how it is. To find out I was correct I was like YES but I never thought it was going to be that way. I would have to say the ending is painful and heartbreaking but at the same time sweet and happy. You are torn between how you think it will go and how you want it to end. This is a series and I am so looking forward to seeing what the author has in store for me. This story can go many different ways and with this authors mind you just never know. If you havent read anything by RM Alexander this would be a great one to start with. The audio is outstanding as the book is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAQZ62UF8Z0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6KS84M#wasThisHelpful","R2QAQZ62UF8Z0U","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book full of hope, love, lost, learning, overcoming, dealing with, support, chasing your dreams and losing love because of your dreams. The author gives you a very heart touching read with two people who love so much one left behind the other could not live with the danger of his job. It seems like yesterday that Zach watched love walk away when she returns it feels so right like there hasnt been years since he last saw her. The sparks fly as they met again each remembering the past and how it was, their love so strong the one thing that tore them apart was he couldnt give up the chase.Zack has been chasing storms almost since he was in diapers, his father was a storm chaser who raised all his kids to the thrill of adventure, the excitement, the rush of danger as they chase storms and gather information to help those around them stay safe. He found the love of his life everything was great until that one day when she looked at him with a suitcase in her hand and said I cant take this anymore and left. It tore his world apart and left him empty as years pass he keeps his heart locked up with one nightstands in hopes someday she might come back. When a reality TV network approaches him with the idea for a show featuring his family chasing storms Zack is thrilled. When he goes in for talks and in walks his past he is floored. The attraction is still as strong as it always was. Can he do this show, keep his heart, and be able to walk away from her or is this his second chance to have the women he loves.Maddi found the love of her life when on the most important day her fianc was out chasing storms. When the tornado hit she was left alone sure she was going to die. When Zack pulled her out of their destroyed home she said I cant take this anymore gets in her car and starts a new life. There isnt a day that goes by she doesnt miss him. No other man can compare to the man or the love she has for Zack. When one call puts her right back in the middle of her past that she is trying to outrun coming face to face with Zack and his family. Is this a second chance at love or will she always take second place to The Chase.The author gives you wonderful characters you can relate with an outstanding plot. As you read you feel you are in the storm and see it played out before your eyes. My heart really did beat faster when they was trying to outrun the tornado. I found I was flipping the pages to see the outcome. This is really a pretty fast pace read that pulls you in at times keeping your heart in your throat as they chase the stormy weather and the storms in their heart. I really like all the characters there isnt one I didnt care for each character adds so much to the story that you want to know more about each one. I would have to agree with Maddi and would have left like she did, being in and outliving a tornado is mind blowing. Knowing the man you love does this as a living is hard to live with. The grandmother tries to show a harder side of herself but she really is just a marshmallow it seem she keeps her cards close to her chest not giving away all that she has planned for her family. She keep me smiling with her sassy ways. Each brother has a story to tell as we will see in the upcoming books. I cant wait to see what Eli deal is and if Hannah gets her hearts desire. I wonder if the brother who walked away if he will come back with his family. I know it must be hard for him to be single parent. The next story is going to be able Quinn and Simon they have been dancing around each other it will be interesting to see what is in store for them. I loved how the author brought Eil around to their way of thinking in return giving Maddi a chance to voice her feeling for Zack. This is really an emotional read in so many ways. The author gives you a well written wonderfully told story of the one who got away, bring them together for a second chance not only with each other but with their family. When you walk away from someone you walk away from the love of their family and friends. The author shows how that affects everyone, it isnt always easy to forgive or forget when your heart is on the line.This is one book I would enjoy reading again it really touched me bring me laughter and smiles. This is somewhat of a normal family (well normal families do not chase tornadoes) with normal issues. People you can relate to as you watch them go through heartbreak, sorrow, reaching out to each other to live another days. If you are looking for a read that will keep your attention, that is fast pace, with action, thrills than pick up Loving The Chase you will not be disappointed.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUA7VAN8QVYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKQD1EC#wasThisHelpful","RPUA7VAN8QVYS","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book more than so of the others in this series. This is a fun loving book with a lot of mystery. Two people so hooked on each other they cannot see straight and the people around them who will make sure they find happiness. You have a set of wild brothers who always have something going on. One aunt who cannot mind her own business who is set on each one of her boys getting a wife.Judah was a trip he with his manly ways. Once he made up his mind to marry he spent his time trying to keep his family safe. He made me laugh with his its all about me ways. I feel he used this to try to show that he wasnt worried when he didnt know how to handle things. Judah is all set to never say I do but who can turn down one hot lady when she is found in her bed with no clothes on. Not him when this is the women of his dreams. One month later said woman is having his baby oh no no way this women will marry anyone but him. It does seem he has his hands full trying to get her to the alter.Darla is planning on helping out a friend but before she said I Do she wants on wild night of passion. One night leads to a mess of who will marry who when it is found out she is expecting. She promised to marry one man in name only but wants another. She wont marry the father of her children just to give her kids a name. Oh what a mess this is with Judah not helping as he pushes her to his way of thinking.I found this to be a very funny read as these two people dance around loving the other and their family who cannot stay out of it. I just do not know what to say about Judah at times I would have loved to bang his head into a few walls.  I related more to him and his brothers since a lot of men think their way. I wonder at times how man can be so dumb when it comes to relationships. Judah takes the cake for sure with his caveman ways. The author gives you mystery of who is trying to kill him or hurt him and why. There is still a mystery of his parents and how they died. This was just a nice clean fun read that I really enjoyed.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSPXX5DHVBAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DB8BES#wasThisHelpful","R1TSPXX5DHVBAX","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This started out with mystery, a little thrill and danger which gave it top marks for me. This was more of a suspenseful read that I come to expect when reading or listening to a book. Taking place in the lovely town of Pride that I have come to love with wonderful characters you can relate to that become your best friends. What do you do at a young age when your father is a thief? You become the best of them as he teaches you the life. For Roberta life was not easy growing up she lived a hard life as her father teaches her the trade and then got drunk and beat her. For every goal or good thing that was done he celebrated, drank and beat up on Roberta. This was her life until her early teens when he died, life got a little better for her when she became part of a gang but then they died. We than move on to her late years and all she has made of her life as she meets Ric who owns the Blue Spot art galleries. As they deal with murder, stole art and soooooooooooo much more. Come take the ride that will keep you guessing as to who did what, why and will love come of this mess.My heart really went out to Roberta aka Rob as she takes you through her childhood to adulthood. Life isnt getting much easier for her as she finds out who she is and how she came to be. She has come far building a wonderful career for herself in the police department who would have guessed she would have went from being a criminal to protecting those around her. Rob is a down to earth woman who gives so much to everyone. She is smart and sassy not taking any crap from anyone, she teaches young children and gives so much back. I doubt you could pick this book up and not have a strong reaction to her. She brings so much to this story as she helps Ric fight the thieves why they try to stay alive.Ric well now he is just one handsome down to earth man who wants Rob from the first minute he sees her. After he puts his foot in his mouth things do not go so easy for him. Rob keeps him on his toes as he pushes the line trying his best to get her into his bed. I have waited a long time to read his story. He is about to find out his life isnt so easy from family drama to women drama. Ric is going to be a character you fall in love with as you wish you could make him yours.It is always a pleasure listening to an audio from Tanya Eby she puts life in the words the author wrote. Her many different voices are outstanding, it always amazes me that she can remember what voices go with which character throughout this series.  If you listened to this series on audio starting with book 1 and not stopping until the last audio she has done all the voices for the different characters keep the same tone, accent etc throughout. If this audio was edited you cannot tell, it flows smooth throughout until the end. There are no background noises, no pauses just very nicely done that will keep you smiling or make you sad as she works her way through the trials each character must go through. I really enjoy her voice as she hits the correct emotion for what is going on in the book. She gives you many different character voices which is easy to tell between the male and females. She really does an outstanding job, I know when I pick up a book in this series she will bring these wonderful characters to life for me. I always enjoy listening to her audios.The only issue I had with this book was you never knew just what happen between Ric parents but my guess is there is a book out there for his sister which will give me the answers I seek. This was a well thought out plot which has the suspense all throughout the book. Unlike the first books in this series from this author where I felt the suspense was pushed or maybe out of place this one is placed just right giving you an outstanding suspenseful love romance from start to finish. The author gives you humor that makes you chuckle and at times she breaks your heart with the life they have lead or the issues they still have to deal with. I have truly enjoyed this series getting to know the characters and the town of Pride. It is truly a town I would love to live in as the characters take care of their own making all new members feel part of their family. I cant wait to see what this author has in store for the rest of this series. If you havent pick up any of Jill Sanders books you really should give her a try. They are all standalone but to get the full impact you really should read them in order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQKG5S72OZVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRDZLKG#wasThisHelpful","R3TQKG5S72OZVM","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a HEA you wont find it here what you will find is normal people trying to work through lives issue. The author gives you characters you can relate to as she takes you on the journey of Mason and Lacey you will smile, cry, laugh and cry some more. The ending will touch you, break your heart but at the same time you will smile as they find new life.Two people have their own fears and demons reach out to each other to overcome their past and hope for a better future. Neither believes in love for good reason both wanting it, someone to care for, hold and be there on their darkest days. Both are holding cards close to their chest and their secretes run deep. Can Lacey get Mason to open his heart to let her in she knows she must before she reveals what she is keeping from him. The biggest issues will have to wait a few months god she prays it will all turn out ok. Mason just knows she has a pull for him something that keeps him coming back. When he is with her she chases the demons away. He knows he has fallin head over heels for you but is he ready to take that last step or will it be to late.This is a story I know few people have had to face the choice is never easy and it always leaves some in pain. For a few it worked out for the better for others it has not. It is a very touching read that I felt the author gave her all as she brings two souls together for them to grow giving them their deepest wish. As we know things in life do not always turn out the way we want. For Mason, Lacey was able to bring him out of his shell and give him the best gift of all Life. He is able to overcome and grow to rebuild as he looks to a future he will be able to handle with his little angel. This is about all I can say without giving this story away. The author reached right into my heart as it went out to each character a tear fell leaving me torn with the ending. I was glad to see Mason grow and be able to turn into the man he was with the caring heart and love to give.The supporting characters are wonderful they are loving and caring. They give both Mason and Lacey the support they need through some trying times. I doubt very much if you can read this story and not have your own heart torn out. With you wanting to take Lacey in your arm and giving her the strength she needs or maybe change places with her. I would have liked to see how things turned out for Mason and Grace. It would have been nice to see how their love grows and how they deal with is lose of love ones. I have to say I really enjoy this book but at times I was really upset with the author. I am a little confused at the title one you read it you will see for me I think it should have been names Saving Him or it could be about GraceI just do not know. We cant all have a HAE as in true life we must live each day as it is our last give love to those you love why we have them. If you are looking for a touching read that does have a sad but happy ending this give this book a read. I am sure you will have strong feelings as I have.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274V940BL2ETT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PT9U9E#wasThisHelpful","R274V940BL2ETT","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the RAE OF HOPE it was a very good book which pulled you into teens finding out they had power. Rae didnt know this and is blindsided when she found out that her father was evil and wanted to take over the world. She was viewed more or less like a freak since they had no idea with both her parents having powers which one she would get or if hers would be more than they had. This one held my attention with all Rae was going through, dealing with as she found out who the truly evil was. I am so looking forward to reading more of this series.SEVENTH MARK I just never connected with it was just a blur where it all kind of ran together and the story did not interest me at all. Nothing grabbed me and the author totally lost me.SHADOW OF DOUBT the same I never connected with it was just a blur where it all kind of ran together and the story did not interest me at all. Nothing grabbed me and the author totally lost me.For the last two books I never knew when I went from one into the other. It was like it was all one story and wow when did it changed.Radium Halos a very interesting listen for no longer than it was. I would be interesting to listen to more of this one as well. They get caught up in a storm in a mine when lighten strikes in the room they are held up in they change. The rest of the book is finding out how they changed and the effects from those changes. Trying to control the powers they have along with helping those that need help.Andrea Emmes did a wonderful job with narrating this audio. Her voice were even that flowed so smooth. The different voices were outstanding. I didnt even know when she changed from one book to another. The issues I have with this book has nothing at all to do with her. If she took a break I could not tell it sounded like she did all the reading at one setting. I totally enjoyed listening to her voice and her narrating this audio.The only problem I had with this audio was with each chapter they said the title of the book which made it hard to tell when one book had end and another one started. With the 2nd and 3rd book I didnt even know until we were way in the 3rd one that it had changed. I feel if the author would have just had the title at the beginning of reach new book it would have been better. I just found the title with each chapter just got on my nerves. I thought the author gave great characters the first and last book I really got into. They were interesting stories where the one on shadows I just never understood and the author totally lost me. The first and last book in this set was well worth the listen. I look forward to reading more of these two book. I enjoyed the first and last one so much I am giving this a 4 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K0CTKTH35BNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IELT9RM#wasThisHelpful","R2K0CTKTH35BNP","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wasn't really sure where one story ended and the other one started.I was so lost....once the author lost me she just didn't get me back.This could have just been me so please give it a try for yourself.

"Heart Of A Bull Rider is about two brothers being separated at birth neither knowing about the other. One is a wealthy billionaire and the other a bull rider, can they find enough in command to build a relationship. They have so many unanswered questions that they will need to answer before they can become a family. This is more than a love story as each have their hearts set on local girls they must work out the past before they can find happiness.This was a cute read that was well written with wonderful characters finding their way. These are characters you can relate to. Who can resist a town where they meddle to bring you your hearts desire.  A unique story about coming home to a place that you never knew you left why finding out who you really are. It did feel a little rushed maybe to man stories in one book.

"This was a very emotional read my heart went out for Rebecca to have to deal with a son being so sick alone is trying. Yes it was her choice but it still would have been hard. Poor Nathan finding out in one breath he had a son and in the next one he might die was just heartbreaking. I thought this was a great story with a wonderful plot. I felt it had wonderful characters with soul who stood up for what they believed in.The characters were great, supportive and went well with the story. There was a few things that throw me in one sentence he said cookie and after that he calls it a biscuit. Nate is holding Danny getting ready to make a call where the author said Jason holds him close to his chest. I reread this a few times and it does say Jason not Nate. This story was base in the US with US military so the Aussie terms just didnt fit or work for me. The suspense with the brother and the kidnapping I did not feel was needed there was enough going on without that. I will say it did add a little to the story but for me it just felt off.I did enjoy the chemistry between Nate and Bec even after all these years they could not forget each other. Their love grew even when they felt let down by the other. Nate did grow and really thought about how he would have dealt with the issues years ago. He came to understand he most likely would not have been what they needed. Once they talked it was easier for them both to see how it was and what they meant to get other. It was easier to forgive. I felt the author dealt with some very touchy issues in class giving the story meaning as well as romance. Giving love a second chance with two people who truly loved each other. Overcoming the past even when it was hurtful and left both lacking.  I thought the book had a few issues but was a good read one I really enjoyed. I am giving it a 3.5 moving it up to a 4 star since the author did hold my interest and kept the book interesting. I do look forward to reading more from this author. This is the first I have read of her workReview copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVB72RQW4R3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZ82DZK#wasThisHelpful","RTVB72RQW4R3F","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was an interesting read I cant say anything really grabbed me and held on. I was expecting more action but feel this was more of a book to setup with D.I.R.E is and does with showing you the basics of the operation. At the end of this audio they author does give you the first chapter or so of book two which starts out with action and a laugh. I am looking forward to listening to it and seeing if it picks up a little more. With that said I did find this to be a good read with some wild passion scenes. The plot is wonderful as Tristan takes on the bad guys and keeping his friends sister from marrying into that family as he keeps her safe. Things never goes as planned as Tristan and his friends find out, things get out of control easy and early finding Tristan in a mess of trouble not only from his friend but the lady he is protecting along with his heart.Tristan as a character is one hot little number who loves them and leaves them. With his job he really cannot do relationships. Besides there isnt a women who can keep his attention for long, that is until Rachel who turns his world upside down walks in his life. He really cannot get involved with this woman for a number of reasons at least that is what he tells his self. What he finds out is he is in way over his head as he makes sure her ex stays an ex which keeps his hands full, lets not even talk about what she does to him. I really liked him because no matter what the job gets done. He will protect with his dying breath, he thinks he really isnt good enough for Rachel beside his job just would not work with a relationship. He tries his best to talk his self out of it, the pull is to strong he gives in to the demand of his body. Oh what a night like no other it really is going to be hard to walk away from this woman. That is if her brother doesnt kill him first..Rachel is doing what she needs to do to help pay off her fathers bills. If she marries her soon to be husband he will pay them all off. She isnt really in love but is willing to do anything to help her family. With showing up at the wedding with no groom in site has her rethinking this. Once the groom shows up pasted out well this is just to much and is not going to happen. Then comes along her brother and his friend he tells her to hold on and not let go. OMG where are they and how did they get there. With her whole world turned upside down not knowing where to turn and what to do has her spinning. It just so happens that Tristan has a few things to say as well as show her. Will one night of hot passion lead to more or when she finds out more than she wants to know will she walk away?I thought Fred Filbrich brought a lot to this audio his voice was clear and smooth, if there was any editing done I could not tell. The audio was clear with no noise of any kind. I thought his voices were great I had no trouble telling who was talking along with being able to tell if it was male or female. His tones were even whether excited or mad he hit them right on the mark. I have not listened to any audios by him and was very pleased with the outcome.The author throws in a lot of twist that you do not see coming. I just am not sure why the mother was pushing her to marry the person she was. I got a little confused there but it might have been I wasnt listening as well as I should have. I was setting in a dentist chair having a tooth pulled I am going with I most likely missed something that the author had written. I will stand by my thoughts of I didnt care to much for her mother. I did like most of the characters each bring so much to the story even those you wont like adds so much to the listen. I would have liked to have seen more action but as again I think this was more of a build up for the series. I really thought this was a wonderful thought out plot with bring Enhancements of Teleportation and Invisibility into a story that is believable. The author throws in some hot romance for your pleasure which will steam up your e reader. The characters are believable and ones you can relate to with normal issues for the most part. This is a book I want to listen to again when I can really listen to it and give it my full attention. There is a lot of drama with many surprises that will keep you on your toes. A few things that are sure to blow your mind with mother dear reveals a few secretes of many years ago. This was well worth the listen and it will be one I will be going back to revisit soon. This is one author to keep your eyes on with well over 100 five and four star reviews I would say she is one to check out and give a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4E3HGRS1HTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCSOLWQ#wasThisHelpful","R1T4E3HGRS1HTB","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a lovely way to show how this wonderful relationship got started. This is a short but wonderfully sweet read. Holly and Dave share so much from the start there was a pull for both of them from these beautiful mountains. Ms. Hatler has a knack for bring the readers a fun loving read that will make them smile.I enjoyed this lovely read as Holly chats with her mother and she warns her of all the bad things that could happen to her. She left me chuckling at a few of her ideas. With Holly being so nervous she lets the cat out of the bag waiting for the next shoe to drop. When they finally kiss it takes your breath away as you expertise the thrill yourself for the two.This was a fun loving delightful light read which I really enjoyed.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGG3WUD58OYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011FFW7PO#wasThisHelpful","RZGG3WUD58OYP","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a delightful prequel to the Montanas series. I fell in love with this series and the mail-order brides series from the first audio I listened to. The early years of our country have always been a time frame I would liked to have visit. Ms. Holland always brings it back to light and gives me a wonderful tale of how it could have been. John has decided he needs help raising his godson with few women in Montana he decides to go to Boston to see if he can find a woman to marry that he might come to love. There are two women that catch his eye but only one really stands out. Pamela might be plain timid, but she is just what he needs to bring his life back in order. Through some misunderstanding it looks like he might be going home alone. With that worked out and a rushed courtship they are on their way to start their new life. Once they get to Montana and Pamela sees the cowboys as they scare the crap out of her she is ready to rush to the train before it takes off. This is when the story gets interesting as they deal with the issues of living together, helping Nick the godson find his way and a lot of unruly cowboys who need a few lesson in manners.Lara Asmundson did a great job with the narration her voice was very clear. It was a delight to hear her many voices you always know who is saying what. She does a great job from going to male to female as she brings this story to life. She made me chuckle and at times laugh. Her cute meow for the kitten put a smile on my face. The only issue I had with this audio was some kind of background hum it wasnt an echo but more of a buzz. I even tried to lower the volume but it didnt make a difference. As the audio went along I didnt notice it not sure if it went away or if I was so much into the story. I did enjoy it so much that I am so looking forward to listening to more of her work.Pamela is a wonderful character someone you can relate to as she goes through the trials of moving to a new place so different than what she is use to. She is strong and sweet takes things as they come and gives her all. Her heart goes out to Nick as she brings him around and helps him get over the loss of his family.  I really had to laugh when she saw the cowboys and grabbed Johns hand trying to pull him back on the train before it took off and left them with these wild cowboys who are showing off. She makes the most of it even bring those wild cowboys into hand getting them to do what she wants without bulling them. She is just a delightful woman that has class.John is a wonderful giving man falls fast and hard for Pamela he is heart broken when he thinks he will have to leave her behind. He does the best he can for everyone on his ranch giving so much. He is so happy with his new bride as she takes over making every ones life on the ranch a better place. He has some things he must overcome but things are working out wonderful for him and his ranch. You have to love a man who is so caring and loving along with so giving. Yep he is a keeper for sure.You know when you see Ms. Holland name it is going to be a wonderful story. She brings so much to the pages giving you a very believable wonderful story. She is an outstanding author that always gives you a compelling read. I forget I am reading a book as I get lost in one of her stories. I love how she bring life to Montana bring the past to the future giving you a story you can get lost in. I am always sad for the book to end. Her audios are outstanding I try very hard never to miss one. Her words flows easy as I listen to the audios I get a lot of things done that I put off. Listening to this story makes things easy to get done you forget you are working as they author and narrator take you away to another place and time. I have to look at all the things I got done and think wow I did all that, doesnt it look good. I could never give enough prays to the pleasure I get out of one of her stories. If you havent read or listen to any of this authors book you really should. I can promise you there is always a few laughs and smiles waiting for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLORTW3HQZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX07OIA#wasThisHelpful","R1MLORTW3HQZK","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not read book 1 in this series I feel it would have made this a more interesting read but in no way does not reading it leave you feeling like you are lost as the author fills in the blanks nicely. I do feel it would give this story with a little more background but I didnt feel like I had to read it only that I do want to. It would be nice to see the effect of Sarahs return had on her family along with reading Livies and Cooper story. The author gives you a story inside of stories which adds to the intrigue, suspense for a few couples. The story is mostly on Bos disappearance and the man who loved her years ago. It is also about her mothers return after being thought dead for 22 years and the effect that has on her and her family along with the town and her fathers run for President. This is a very in-depth and complex novel that keeps you guessing as Ms. Daniels spins her magic keeping her reader hook as she takes you on a ride of suspense, mystery, kidnapping, lost love, danger, hurt and so much more. Once you pick up this book it will not be long before you find you have to see what happens as you turn the pages you know it is going to be a late night.Bo was a delightful character who is still trying to find her way. She feels with six sisters her life has little meaning. She is trying to prove her worth to her family and herself. It does seem the world is against her when money comes up missing from the foundation they made in her dead mothers name. Well good lord isnt that a joke her mother has returned after 22 years which puts her life more out of control. Her mother has no memory of the last 22 years. With Bo taking off into the mountains to think about lifes issues and work out what to do about the money missing she feels like a frailer. As she has found some peace and is returning her life takes another turn when she meets up with a dangerous man that has decided he will make her his. Things are just not looking up for her as she finds herself tape and gagged with no way out. I really like Bo she is strong but knows when to keep her mouth shut as she goes with the flows. She is always working on a plan but thinks things through and doesnt just go with her first thought as she comes up with plan after plan only to find they will not work. Surely someone will be out looking for her with her luck it will be her past love Jace who she is sure will believe she took the money. With everything that life has dealt her she never gives up, as her mind turns to the man she has always loved and their last night together.Jace might be fooling his self into believing the only reason his is hunting down Bo is to make her face the music and keep his sister safe and out of trouble. He is on the hunt for the woman who has funds missing in the foundation his sister works for. There is no way his sister will be hurt she is just getting her life back together.  He is going to track her, find her and bring her back to face the music even if he has to tie her up and carry her all the way back down the dang mountain. As he goes on the hunt things are not adding up. Could she be in this with another man or she is she in danger. He is about to found out when he runs into them and ends up fighting for their life.  I really loved this alpha male who goes off half cocked with his attitude. Many years ago he loved Bo, wanted to marry her for some reason she turned on him. What he finds is he never got over losing her as the hunter turned hunted and lifes are about to be lost. Jace is just a wonderful caring man that always puts his familys needs before his own. He will have to come face to face with his feelings and past issues as he goes on the hunt to find the only women he truly ever loved.This is truly a complex story with so many lives intertwined as the author gives you a wonderful story of suspense, mystery. Each character weavers their way through danger in the hunt for the truth on many topics. The author has done an outstanding job keeping the reader interested as she sets the plot for many books to come. She gives you little hints just do not think you will work out the complex story she will keep you guessing to the outcome. So many lives has been torn apart just as they find away to deal with the past it comes back to smack them in the face. Not only are they dealing with the lost of funds but a returning mother from the grave that has so much mystery has to where she has been and how she got back. Jaces sister seems to have her own mystery going on as someone is watching her. Bos stepmother is a mystery to it makes you wonder if she had something to do with any of this. No one can pull you into a story like Ms. Daniels can giving you answers but leaving you with more questions.This could be a standalone read but I doubt you could stand not knowing what is going on with Sarah. The why and how of her disappearance and her return from the dead, why would a woman fake her death when she has six wonderful little girls with the twins only being a few months old.  As this series unfolds I am sure we will find the answers to this question along with many more. This is a wonderful romantic suspenseful read with a wonderful ending that leaves you wanting more. So many questions answered as she leaves you with many more to be asked. I for one cant wait for the next installment in this wonderful series.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ISLUD7N3OOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFS2BTC#wasThisHelpful","R28ISLUD7N3OOR","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in this series the author had me hook from the first page which intrigued me with a new twist to the Paranormal. It is bad enough losing both of your parents on the say day at the tender age of 6 but to lose them to a fire only to find out many years later that one might have killed the other to keep you safe is mind blowing. To be sent to another country in your middle teens to go to school far away from the only home and family you known to a place that looks like it should have been from another century is just to much for any teenager. Than to find out you will come into some kind of powers that scares the crap out of everyone that you come in contact with is just mind blowing. It does seem there are to many strakes against Rae everywhere she turns someone wants her gone. It does seem the family tree holds lots of secrets as Rae works her way through untangling them. I was expecting this to be more of a romance which it isnt, the author gives you a touch of it with more to come as the series takes off into other books. This is more about Rae finding her way as she finds out who her parents are and what might have happen to them. Not knowing who to trust with what is mind blowing. If she puts her trust in the wrong person not only will she but the rest of the world could be in for a lot of trouble. This is a story of so much more than powers, teens, hate, family it is a powerful read of finding out who you are and what you will become and how to use it for the best or worse.I really liked Rae she is finding her way through some tough times. Being a teenager is hard enough to overcome the normal every day to day issues but to know there is a whole another world out there that you are part of and no one really wants you around because of your parents is the worse feeling. Heck just finding out she isnt a normal teen is blowing her mind. She has to deal with issues most teens would not even dream of and lord help her if she make a wrong turn they are watching.watching very closely... I could relate to her being an outcast not knowing where she fit in my heart really went out to her in so many ways. Than to find they do not believe in two people with powers having a relationship is really hard when you fall for the boy who is the one helping you find your way. She is pulled in so many different ways with little or no answers to the how or why of it all. To find her father was a very evil man and everyone thinks she will take after him is wrong. They just do not see her as her own person but a product of her father. Will the sins of the father be the sins of the daughter? Not if she can help it.  She feels lost just waiting for the next shoe to drop. For me this was a powerful listen so many different ways this story could have gone. Life is just so hard for Rae who will always be her mother Rae of Hope.This is the first time I have had the pleasure of listening to Sarah Ann Masse as a narrator she is outstanding as she pulls you in and you become one with this story. I could not tell when she stopped and started the audio it sounds like she did it all at one setting which I know she could not have done. Her voices are lovely and smooth as she takes you to another place and time. She gives wonderful voices to all the characters you have no trouble knowing who is speaking whether that be male or female. I feel I got more out of this story listening to her than I would have reading it. There are no background noise and I saw no different from one listening device to another. I thought she gave wonderful life to each character as she pulls you in and you get lost in the story. I thought she did an outstanding job and cannot wait to listen to more audios by her.This is the first book I have read/listen to by Ms. May she has a very vivid imagination that comes out in her story where she gives it a different kind of twist. Her characters are very easy to relate to and very believable with normal day to day issues that she puts a twist on to. I could almost believe this was a true story, she really has a knack with pulling you in and giving you a pleasurable read. She gives you twist and turns that you will not see coming as she spins a wonderful story of the pains of growing up feeling lost and alone. Each character is wonderful as they each find out their new power and working on what they mean and how they work. The author gives you humor that will keep you laughing at times she leaves you with your heart in your throat as you race to see what the outcome will be. This could be a standalone but I feel sure you will want to see what the author has in store for these great characters I know I do. I do have to say the author kept me laughing over and over again with Rae sassy attitude that I came to love.You can pick this audio up as a box-set that has other book of different series in it or one with just this audio in it. Me I love the box-sets where you get a taste of all the author has to give you. The next in this set is Seventh Mark Part 1 - The Hidden Secrets Saga it sounds to be as interesting as this one is. I am really not into teen books but I do have to say I loved this one and am really looking forward to reading or listening to other books my this author. I recommend you pick up at least this audio/book if not the box-set I am sure you will enjoy Ms. Mays writing style as much as I have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5IQI7KSV8MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1NNFR0#wasThisHelpful","R2H5IQI7KSV8MW","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say this was a very intriguing story that at times I got lost in. You have children all found unclothes on the same day at the same time that just appeared out of nowhere. Some in locked cars others in top secure places no one knows where they came from or how they got there. The absorb knowledge like a sponge. None saying a word until they hear the first words spoken, after a few words they can speak the language they have never heard. Years later they are grown this is where the story starts with some very intense action of the military trying to find one of The Found who has been kidnapped. When they find her there is nothing pretty about this scene and what these people do to this woman. Sam who is in charge of this military mission is also one of The Found with special gifts that make him the best at his job. Each child of The Found has special abilities that have grown overtime as they excel in their chosen jobs to better the world. They are adults but still do not know all they can do as the work through what coming together as a team means why finding more of their group before those that hunt them can find them, kill them or use them to whatever cause their sick minds wants.Kelly is a delightful character who just feels out of place she feels she has no abilities like the others. She has no idea why they are hunting her or what they want with her. She is a very strong willed person at times very stubborn as Noah will find out. She is on the run for her life with Noah trying to find others that were found that day with no memories before the day they were found. She is a very caring and giving lady who has helped many students become better students bring out their best as she brings children and their families together to better understand what the child needs to grow to become the best they can. As she grows and learns more of what she can do with the help of the other founded children. Once she is rescued she has a hard time and feels she is a danger to those around her. She has some touch and goes as she works through her issues to find maybe things arent as they seem. In walks Noah and her whole world changes from what she knows, they have a past she thought she made up in her mind. What she finds is a passion like no other, the love of her life that has always been there even before she became one of The Found.Noah is a very bright man who has risen in ranks very fast in the military. He has an ability to know danger, feel things and find things as he has saved his units behind more than once. Now he is on the hunt to find Kelly as he feels her pain as if it is his. Knowing they do not have much time she wont last much longer he rushes to her secure. Noah is a very strong character in many ways, he is very alpha and takes control as he leads his team to their common goal to find The Found before others find them. I really liked this character he puts others first as he gives orders and works through their past bring them together and protecting them. His only goal is to protect, help and love Kelly as they bring memories of the life together from before knowing they were made for each other from a time long ago.The author gives you a very intense read as Sam pulls Kelly out trying to bring her back to him. Her last words are Noah as Sam finds they have a past before they had a future. There are a lot of wonderful character each finding their way to out run the evil that is hunting them. Bring together a team who are learning their abilities but find that together they are more than if they are apart. The author gives you some hot passionate scenes as she builds a plot of books yet to come. It will be interesting to see how this group grows as they find out what they can together to make this world a better place. They have much to learn as they work through their past and remember a life from before. There are some grammatical and editing errors nothing that really bothered me. Lord knows I need an editor for my reviews I am the last one to judge on this issue.  At times the author lost me but always brought me back with a very interesting plot with characters I could relate to. The ending will shock you as you say WOW REALLY that is why you did this, I would have to say the ending was so simple but with such an impact that it shocks you. I really love this ending. I am looking forward to seeing how this series unfolds as each learn more about themselves and other of The Found group.Review copy provided by NetGalley/book tour/author/publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBLXJJ580V5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8GY792#wasThisHelpful","RFBLXJJ580V5H","AGBGV16NY06FW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBGV16NY06FW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like this.  Really really.  A read through of the ingredients list means I won't be using it.  Artificial coloring and sucralose are two automatic NO ingredients for me, and I definitely wouldn't want to give it to my children when they are ill.The package I received was boxes of the individual tubes of powder, meant to mix into a water bottle.  THAT is genius.  Easier to store, easier to use, easier to mix up a smaller amount at a time.  Rumor says this is the drink of choice to help with a hangover, and this packaging would be excellent for that.I would love to see a more natural formulation.  We don't need artificial coloring, and something like stevia would work better for a sweetener than sucralose.  Or coconut sugar? Or better yet, crystallized honey.  Abbott Laboratories, you can do better.  We won't be drinking or using this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q6OFF5SL9KB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BM4X8I#wasThisHelpful","R3Q6OFF5SL9KB5","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a comfortable, good-sounding set of headphones, with a removeable, standard cord.  The Removeable boom mic is easy to adjust and sounds great to my friends.The inclusion of a mic adds all sorts of complexity which is addressed by the collection of cords that comes with this set. You've got a PC connector for devices that have separate mic input and sound output connectors, a mic boost and in-line volume control, another cord for devices that use a single TRRS connector (like a iPhone) to handle the mic and sound circuits, and an audio-only cord with a single-button remote.  The mic comes off easily so that you can use these headphones for anything.  These are comfortable enough, and sound good enough that you'll want to.Weaknesses:- They are a little heavy, but (for my head at least) they are comfortable and well-padded enough to be comfortable for several hours.- I would have appreciated a 3-button (iOS) remote cable.- A bag or something to keep all of these cords together is really a requirement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABVX253DVSTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XAVLYW#wasThisHelpful","R3ABVX253DVSTB","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't pay for this case. The company who makes it sent it to me in exchange for a fair review.This is actually pretty good for the money. I like the super-loud yellow & black color combination, it's easy to reach the ports and mute button (the others are molded-in, and work fine).  There is good shock absorption potential and there is a 3-4mm lip that stands proud above the screen.The stand seems fragile, but it comes out when you want, and stays out when you don't.In addition, the box it comes in has some fairly comical translations which gave me a giggle.I was pleasantly suprised by this case.

"I have close to a hundred pairs of headphones, and I review a few dozen per year on Amazon. Most of those (like these) I get for free.These are kind of odd, because the manufacturer has piled in a ton of features for not much money. Nothing is free, however, and trade offs were made.  I'll try to point those out and you can decide whether these are right for you.  My bottom line opinion is that some of the bells & whistles were promoted in favor of the basics, and these aren't for me.The bells & whistles (lights & vibrations) all work as advertised, and are switchable, along with the mic.This is the first USB-only set of cans I've used. They connected immediately to my Win 7,8, and 10 PC's with no interaction required from me. They also connected to my Mac, but I had to go to settings and select these for playback (that's normal).  The bottom line is that the USB cable works great. It's thick and heavy, but not enough to worry about, and may help durability.The mic is a different story. The sensitivity of the mic is off.  It's not unusable, just not nearly as good as my Plantronics set, which costs 3X what this set does. Maybe I'd get used to it for 1/3 of the price.  One nice thing is that it folds completely away when not in use, and won't snag on things in your bag.So on to the downsides. These are wicked inexpensive, so some things had to hit the curb, and in this case, they're biggies.Cut#1: Sound quality - These sound dead and boomy compared to my favorite Plantronics gaming headset, and absolutely awful compared to my favorite Sony headphones for music (but at 1/3 of the price of either of those).  If you only listen to these and nothing else, you could ""get used"" to them, but I wouldn't want to.Cut#2: Comfort & noise isolation - These have a nice, infinitely adjustable, comfortable headband, but there isn't enough tension to seal these to my average-width head, and the ear cups don't swivel at all, so you're going to have air gaps and pressure points around the pads, which negatively affect comfort, sound quality, and noise isolation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9VWMCJVTH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R2F9VWMCJVTH4","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Catalysts last a year for me, but sometimes they conk out at what seems like random times. You can buy them separately. If you're going to count on these for a while away from a store, you should have a couple of spares.6.  The plastic filler is a pain, but it's helpful if you care how much fluid gets into the warmer. If you use a ziplock to shut it off, just soak the cotton straight from a squeeze bottle.7.  The first time you fill one of these, you'll make A MESS.  Do it outside.8.  A red Coleman funnel from the camping aisle anywhere has a nice little integrated filter. It's handy for refilling your lighter fluid bottle with naphtha/Coleman fuel/zippo lighter fluid (all the same stuff).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUE2C3KPGAEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HLGTL2#wasThisHelpful","RPUE2C3KPGAEI","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are lightweight, perfectly molded, and easy to adjust to a reasonable range of head-sizes. The field of view is outstanding.I really appreciate the minimal and mostly reuse able  packaging.  These come in a plastic case that is fitted to a piece of cardboard.  Once you pull off the cardboard and trim away the hang tab from the goggle case, you've got a decent place to store your goggles to that the seal doesn't get mashed in your bag. A really nice, well thought out design.The design favors a low profile, light design over durability, so if you use the case to prevent seal distortion between swims, you should expect to get a season or two of use out of these.Another reviewer mentioned some adjustment difficulty, but these are really easy in my opinion. Pull the strap to tighten, and pull the temple tabs to loosen. The strap adjustments are as fine as anyone should ever need.I think that these are a reasonable to good value at $30, and certainly a better price than you're likely to find at a mom & pop swim shop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OR6B7YP0DCXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTI66UO#wasThisHelpful","R1OR6B7YP0DCXJ","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I give this 2-3 stars, my son gives it 5.One bright point is the packaging. You do not have to open the box to get the toy out. A pair of side-cutting pliers (dikes) to cut the two nylon zip-ties at the body and tail are all that's required to get the dino loose.  Don't forget the tail tip.  It's blister packed at he head end of the package.I was suprised to see that this toy doesn't run on the ground or even across the ground while you hold it's tail.  It's difficult to get the Dino to stand up (but it can be done).  Also, I'm concerned that the gear-train will be short-lived, as it strips, pops, and crunches routinely during play.My son, on the other hand, loves it. He just doesn't care that the advert is deceptive.

"I have more than a hundred headphones, and review a few dozen per year on Amazon, most of which, like these, are sent to me at no cost (free).These are not ""music"" headphones. These are for video gaming, and for $20, they excel at their job.I wore these For 7 hours on Saturday with just a break for lunch, and these over-ear phones are as comfortable as anything I've worn within $50 of this price-point. The pads are big enough to fit over even unfortunately-large ears, and there is enough swivel to accomodate any head shape short of a grey alien. The strap pad is just as nice as the ear cup padding. I was really amazed at the comfort. Good job.The mic isn't as adjustable as I'd like. It swivels down like a jack-knife, so you can't put it right in front of your mouth. Fortunately, that's unnecessary. this mic is perfectly adequate for in-game coms and Skype.  As long as you don't sing or pod-cast into it, you'll be OK.Just in case you're tempted to use these for music... Just don't. These are simply not voiced for that use.

"Lightweight and powerful, this is a much nicer dryer than a cheapie from the big box store.  I have thick curly hair, so I only use the diffuser.  It goes on and off smoothly and stays secure while you use the dryer.  The long cord is a very nice feature, and the velcro strap attached makes it easy to wind it up neatly to stow the dryer.  So far, I am very pleased with it.  Haven't had it long enough yet to talk about durability, but it feels solid.  The only thing I can see to nitpick about is the buttons.  They are small and out of the way on the back of the handle(good thing!) but would probably be difficult to push with long nails.  Not an issue for me, but it could be frustrating.

"I've been buying Brainwavz for a while because they sound GREAT and they typically don't cost much.  Perhaps because of this, their marketing department occasionally sends me a free pair (like these) when they come out with a new product.These are different than what I've seen from this company so far. They still sound GREAT but now they cost at least twice what a great-sounding cheap pair might, but these certainly don't look or feel like cheap headphones and match up with others that I have that go for $80 - $110.I get the sense that Brainwavz is feeling a little timid about this higher pricing idea, because they've thrown in everything but the kitchen sink:-Shirt clip-Double-zippered case-Some kind of next-gen Velcro to bundle them up (This new Velcro is pretty neat. You can't feel the hooks, and the loops are polar fleecy)-Comply foam tips (coated open-cell type)-Really nice quality single, double, AND triple-flange silicone tips.The headphones themselves are really well made (as good or better than you'd expect at this price). The buds themselves have a well polished aluminum body, the printing is very well executed, and there is good strain relief for the flat cords. The 3-button remote isn't up to Apple standards, but nobody else's is either.  I've taken apart several Apple remotes, and they are astounding.If you have trouble with anything, it may be the plastic TRS jack (headphone plug) housing.

"I've purchased several pairs of Brainwavz in-ear phones over the past few years.  They initially got my attention because the Wirecutter (a website) recommended some of their ear buds as a great value.  Since then, the company's marketing arm has occasionally sent me new products (for free) to try out and review (like these). So far, I've been impressed by two things in all cases:1.  The build quality for money is very, very good.2.  The sound quality for money is possibly even better.These particular headphones really are sized for kids.  The package is easy to open, and they are easy to pair. iOS devices don't require an access code, but if your device does, it's 0000.The Bluetooth sound pressure limitation to 85 decibels is a welcome feature, and it seems to work (these don't get loud with a Bluetooth connection).The design and materials appeal to me. They are well padded and use quality materials.There is one design choice that may bother some:One of the end caps says ""Kidwavz"" in large type.  If the recipient is at the stage where they no longer like to be associated with the word ""kid"" then this may be a problem.Any kid would like these.

"The company that makes this offered to send me one for free to test. I agreed because it looks like my Logitech M705 (my favorite mouse).It's not an M705 (it couldn't be at this price) but it is similar, much less expensive, and has Bluetooth which eliminates the USB plug on my thin and light, but USB-poor ultrabooks.This mouse is pretty basic. It's a 3-button scroller with fwd & back thumb buttons.  It tracks well, and is a nice shape if you like the M705 that it copies. The thing is the Bluetooth, and what you lose in trade for a free USB port:1.  Pairing is easy and doesn't require a code.2.  Power management is an irritant. If you don't use your mouse for a minute, you have to push a button to wake it up, and then do whatever it was you wanted to do. That's a deal-breaker for me. I'd be happier with an even shorter battery life and a longer idle period.2.  I wish this had a lithium battery and a micro USB charger like every single other Bluetooth device, but nope. This one uses lots and lots of AA dry cells (but only one at a time).3.  If you don't turn it OFF with the hardware switch, you'll be in dead-battery-ville.

"Have only tried this on our stainless sink so far, but it worked beautifully.  Just wet the sponge, add a small squirt of dish soap, and scrub lightly.  It made an amazing difference.  I hadn't really realized how cruddy the sink was until after giving it a quick scrub.  Plan to try this sponge on our cookie sheets and some other pots next.

"I have an ""I Fix It"" bit and driver kit that I use all of the time, and it's GREAT and I use it all of the time, but it has one big problem; the box. The bits are stuck in these little elastomer sleeves that are fiddley to get out, and fiddley to get in. This kit has just the right box (as long as you don't tip it).The bix has a little mechanism that stands the bits up when you open it, and it's spring loaded so that the lid stays up. Also, the bits are loose in their sleeves so they come out easily.  Just don't tip the box when it's open, or you'll have a bad day. The decorative driver machining on the (free) sample that I got was a little less than I've come to expect, but it isn't a safety hazard, or even something that a non-machinist would be likely to notice. The I Fix It has one thing on this kit, and that's the cross-drilled driver that allows the extension to be used for leverage.My advice is to use the I fix it kit for for field work where dumping the box is more likely, and this kit at the bench where the box design really shines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOTV34C97Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0ZVXBS#wasThisHelpful","RYOTV34C97Q3","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an amazing machine. I brush 2X/day and floss 4-5X/week, but I still ""get the business"" from my hygienist every four months.

My mouth feels dentist's office clean every time that I use it.Some details:This Brush has settings galore, and comes pre-set to what are probably the most sensible ones, which are ""clean"" (runs for two minutes at a reasonable intensity) and a time-minder that helps pace your brushing.  You can easily change the settings if you want but I haven't, and probably won't.On value:  if this is the thing that pushes me over the hump to a bi-annual vs. tri-annual cleaning, then it's easily worth the retail price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JT9CE1EKTKJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R2JT9CE1EKTKJN","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are true completely-over-the-ear headphones, and have remarkably soft head band and ear cup padding.The volume control is a thumb wheel rheostat, with an on-off slider for the mic. The control is low enough on the cord that you can look at it while wearing the headphones (a detail others miss).The sound emphasizes the bass-end, but there is good detail across the range.I like the mic. It has a wind guard, so your friends won't hear you breathing, and it's a plug-in type so you can remove it if you want.Other than the bass emphasis which I don't mind while playing games, the only quibble I have with these is that there is one wire to each can, and I prefer a left-only attachment for comfort and convenience.I'm happy with where Turtle Beach decided to spend their build budget, on nice big drivers, lightweight construction, and comfortable padding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSN7U6NG7N1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UKY#wasThisHelpful","R2FSN7U6NG7N1I","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a major hit at my house. I think every 7-year old I know has a favorite Minecraft video maker, and mine's no exception. This is a well thought-out kit with lots of set pieces, four backgrounds, and a free app to make it all come together. This seems tailor-made for the iPad mini. The angle is just right to match the camera and lens height.  It works well with an iPod touch as well when the camera stand is raised with a few books.Some things to keep in mind:1.  Take care to keep track of the three small pieces (sword, pick axe, and torch).2.  Put the water and lava on postcard paper. You can reuse them if you do.3.  Make a few very short videos first to get walking speeds right.4.  These are ""silent"" films. We had good luck with a desk nameplate holder and strips of paper for dialog.5.

"This is a pretty great (plug-in, no battery) Wifi/Bluetooth/Aux speaker with good sound and outstanding range.  You can stream music over wifi from a (currently) limited selection of apps (Spotify, Pandora, I Heart radio, or Deezer).  There is also a wide selection of internet radio stations (including all of my favorite local Winston-Salem stations) built into the app. Once set up as presets from your phone/tablet or computer, these can be controlled directly from the speaker, the app, or the included remote.  I'm disappointed that I can only control Amazon Music and iTunes over a Bluetooth connection, since these are the music services that I use most.Prerequisite equipment: The sales pitch indicates that you can easily control your music and listen to whatever you want, all over your house, without complicated set-up or expensive gear.  In order for this to work, your wifi network has to cover your house. You can also control stored music from a NAS (Network Attached Storage) drive attached to the same wifi as the player.  You'll also need a phone or other computer (again, on the same network) to get the thing set-up, and to control non-supported music services like iTunes/iMusic over Bluetooth (no AirPlay support).Overall, this is a very cool thing, that works well with minimal hassle.The performance and sound is very good with plenty of power, and a nice, flat signature.  It is well matched to the 20X20' room where I'm using it.I received a pre-release version of this speaker, so I couldn't see a full product description or pricing information.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HFA08M0OEBCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH685E#wasThisHelpful","R3HFA08M0OEBCA","A37U4HM0UG7FQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37U4HM0UG7FQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Circling the Sun, is by the same author (Paula McLain) of  The Paris Wife,  which I really enjoyed.  This tells the story of Beryl Markham, and is another work of historical fiction. I'm not always crazy about the idea of embellishments on a real-life person, but this is so well written I got lost in the story regardless of the ""truth"" of the tale, versus an interesting work of fiction.It begins with Beryl's unconventional childhood and  traverses her life, including some not-very-pleasant details, but realistic all the same. It's a very  engaging story, richly written. Her writing style is such that you feel you are there, dropped into the time period as well as the various settings. The conventions of the times play a big part in her life story and her frustrations are evident. Beryl is a strong-minded and interesting person, and every other ""character"" in the book is also well-developed.  She may have been prone to repeating mistakes, which could be frustrating, but don't we all learn our best lessons that way? This is, after all, about an actual person with flaws, not a character who can neatly wrap things up.  She may have simply been a bit ahead of her time for that.Entertaining and enlightening- worth the read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7OT99N29L0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R1T7OT99N29L0H","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are wanting to have only a brand-name kitchen, including the textiles, you will be happy that All-Clad has come up with a cute ""dish towel"". It's appearance is quite nice, not a stamped on picture, rather dyed in (apparently, that is what the Fiber Reactive is all about?) so it seems it will not fade. It's also a lovely velour-like texture, soft with a nice hand to it.The downside? The softer weaves, including tiny loops on the back side of the towel, are lovely to look at but do not absorb well. When wiping up a water spill it really did not pick up much without a lot of passes. So, pretty it is- effective, not so much.If you are looking for something with a nice picture to decorate the kitchen, it's got a bit of a 50's vibe (the percolator type coffee pot gives it a bit of a retro look). It's also a bit larger than the average kitchen towel (nearly twice as big as the ones in my kitchen) if that is a deciding factor for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPHR1WT259O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABS3NU#wasThisHelpful","R2CPHR1WT259O1","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a terrific idea, but it has one hurdle to overcome. It was not initially obvious to me how the magnetic system works, which was my first mistake. The reality is that you must attach the large magnet to the back of your phone somewhat permanently. You can put your case over it, if your case is thin enough on the back side, and not too snug. The overall system itself is very easily adjusted.The problem is that nobody in my home is willing to put a strong magnet on their phone, no matter how much it might be stated that this will not harm the phone or its function. The idea that you are sticking something to the phone is the one hurdle that can't be fixed.It does appear to be well made and may provide a convenient, and safer alternative to holding the phone or stuffing it in a cup holder.

"I took this  giant box of Ropes into a classroom and gave it out to 20 high schoolers to get their response. About half the group had tried Kazoozles in the past and they felt this new version with a new name was much better.But, they still admitted that they only ""liked"" the Ropes, and couldn't see going out and getting them, versus buying Twizzlers or other plain red licorice. The SweeTarts middle of these hollow red Ropes is probably supposed to be the flavor boost that makes them unique. It's not very strong (sweet or tart) so it didn't make them much more exciting. Overall, the teens said these were only Okay.Myself, and the other adults who tried these, found them a bit too sweet and artificial tasting...which is ironic, since the packaging emphasizes that they are naturally flavored and colored.

"Karma is  what you would get if you crossed something like War, Rummy and Uno. It's best played with a group, as you compete to end the game by getting rid of your cards, and the more the merrier.There are not a lot of directions, as it is a fairly simple game, yet luck certainly comes into play regardless of how well you strategize. For some in our family, this was a bit of a bummer, but overall, we had a lot of fun. While you may be sure you are about to win, Karma cards let another player force an opponent to take the entire discard pile, or make the next player play a card with a value of five or below, which may be impossible. Just as you think you have it made, everything can be turned upside down, much like Uno's Pick Up Four card, etc.Game play takes around 30 minutes and will suit a wide range of ages. You can play until the sole winner is left, or when the first person is forced out if you have limited time.Lots of fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DF5OYIJBYXT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ7FH1M#wasThisHelpful","R2DF5OYIJBYXT4","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cute little toaster packs a punch!We have had a Kitchen Aid toaster for quite a while with very similar features. The B&D version is a bit sleeker and shinier with a nice compact footprint so it takes up about two inches less space (width).The nice part about using it is the speed. It really is faster, yet it doesn't burn the outside without heating up the inside of even frozen items like waffles or bagels. The freezer setting is a nice touch. It has a bagel setting to only toast the inside and a regular setting for your average piece of toast, too. The extra lift bar is great for popping your toasted food up high enough out of the slot to easily grab it without getting your fingers burned.You won't find any real directions in the box, but the buttons were pretty self-explanatory. Clean up requires popping the drop down hatch on the bottom and shaking the whole thing over the trash. I do miss the simpler slide out/off tray of my other toaster since that was a bit easier.Overall, It's a quick and cute little addition to the countertop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352R5UWV80L8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HVAO#wasThisHelpful","R352R5UWV80L8V","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using wipes for nearly 26 years now (since the first baby and well after the last). We keep them in the bathroom for personal use but also for quick cleanups, as they are super-handy and less expensive than pop-up canister wipes.I kept the nicest of the ""decorator"" tubs when they came out a few years ago, and use replacement packages regularly. The average tubs need to be replaced from time to time since they are lightweight plastic and get too much use. The pull through aspect is fairly useless, as it tends to catch or tear the wipes. I needed a better way, so...This system intrigued me, and I am so glad I tried it! The overall tub is much more substantial and a nice weight and sleek look for keeping in plain sight. The rubber pads on the bottom keep it in place on any surface. You simply press the top and it springs open, then closes easily, keeping everything fresh.But, the best part is the weighted top piece that lays on top of the wipes. It sits atop the wipes, making the individual wipe quick and easy to dispense. No more clinging multiple stings of wipes sticking out of the top or falling to the floor when you simply want to pull out one or two.It is also a great, compact size, however....my one disappointment is that it does not hold a full replacement package of my favorite brand of wipes. It will hold about 3/4 of a full 250 pack of wipes, just barely.  If you are buying the small packets of flushables, it probably holds the entire thing, but the wipes that I buy come in larger bags, so I have to stow the remainder under the sink in a ziploc until there is room in the dispenser. If it were just a tad taller it would be absolutely perfect.Once again, OXO has come up with a smart, cute solution. I have never found a product of theirs that disappoints and have them all over the house...now in the BATHROOM, too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGKZMP91409P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X5W9G#wasThisHelpful","RBGKZMP91409P","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not resist the price on a Canon printer compared to other similar brands, knowing the name is well respected. I have always owned HP products (which were generally more expensive, but very long-lived) and decided to try one. The first model that I purchased lasted only about 8 months, before it had so many bugs that we replaced it. We needed another printer and decided to give Canon one more try.First, it does require a download and/or use of a CD for  installation and this was not as simple as it could have been, but doable. If you are going to link it up, you will need to purchase a cable (not included). So far the print quality is good and it  functions just as well as more expensive brands, with one caveat. It goes through ink quite quickly. The idea that having multiple color cartridges saves you money is simply not the case. You may only have to replace a yellow, or magenta, etc. but the small individual cartridges are not inexpensive. I've found that I have spent more money on the replacements than I did with combined color cartridges for my HP printer. Although, I have also found that the warning sign for ink replacement is very premature and you can print at least 50-100 more pages before the color is actually out.Like most similarly priced printers, the paper tray is somewhat limited in capacity, which is a bit of a pain. I would like to be able to load a ream or close to it, and forget about it, but they are simply not large enough to accomate that much paper. I do have to admit I have had less jams with the more limited trays, so perhaps that is a good point.Overall, I would consider this an average printer for limited use. If you are going to be using your printer for a business or with great frequency, the ink replacement cost will be a negative. I haven't had this model long enough to see what the longevity is compared with my other Canon model, but I am hopeful that this one will have a longer lifespan since we are now using two printers in the household and this one does not take on the biggest jobs.I will admit that my HP Officejet Pro 8600 is still my favorite, as it was easier to set up and has an overall sturdier quality to it, is quieter and easier & cheaper to maintain. However, the Pixma is smaller and less obtrusive, and certainly less expensive by about $100 dollars. If you are after a bargain, this might be it, but consider the ink cost as well. Functionally, it's a good choice, plus it has the scanner/copier which can come in handy. Too bad it doesn't go a step further and include a simple Fax.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158IGTAHUGV14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGRDK#wasThisHelpful","R158IGTAHUGV14","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She was impressed with the form and function with one small criticism: the foil cutter is just not super sharp. In her opinion it would work well for quite a while as a personal opener, but for the pro, it would need to be much sharper in order to keep up with heavy duty, continuous use.So, it will remain a classy addition to my kitchen for those bottles of wine between friends,  and it might just become a giftable purchase for my wine loving friends &family as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20POXL9WEMR4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M72R4JO#wasThisHelpful","R20POXL9WEMR4C","A3OIQ3T0OIKY66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIQ3T0OIKY66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lid by Charles Viancin is pretty much as described and pictured and does seem to seal reasonably well on my ceramic and glass dishes. Do be advised however that the product that I received is not 100% pure silicone. When I was looking into purchasing silicone lids I tried to find a brand that labeled their products as ""medical grade"", ""no fillers"" or ""pure silicone"". After much searching I couldn't find any with that description so I considered the good reviews, and asked a few questions of other customers and also the company.I asked customers who purchased this lid as well as other Charles Viancin products to try the pinch test to see if the product/s they received were pure silicone or if they contained fillers. Some came back saying their product appeared to be pure while others found out their product likely contained fillers (this revealed inconsistencies in the silicone quality of Charles Viancin products). When I contacted the manufacturing company the customer service representative did not seem to know anything about the quality or purity of the silicone used in their products and did not bother to track down more information.Despite the discrepancy in quality I placed an order to see the product for myself. Upon receiving my sunflower lid I opened it up and pinched it at which point the yellow color whitened. This is an indicator that the product is not pure but contains fillers. Good quality silicone is 100% silicone with no fillers. Lesser quality silicone may use fillers up to a certain point that is deemed ""acceptable"". The lesser quality pieces may not work as well (heat as evenly or be as non-stick) or hold up as long. More importantly however, the safety of silicone products that contain fillers isn't known.To test if silicone contains fillers, pinch and/or twist a portion of the piece; if you see any white or whitening in the stressed area then it's not pure silicone. If you don't care whether or not your silicone contains fillers these lids are both beautiful and functional. Personally, I will be avoiding purchasing any more Charles Viancin products and will be searching for other companies that use higher quality silicone. I hope this is helpful to you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QPC9E0SP94T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007U5VJ8K#wasThisHelpful","R26QPC9E0SP94T","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this play pot and pan set for our daughter just under six months ago. We wanted to find something that was not plastic and we liked these since they looked realistic. Initially we loved the product except for some annoying product stickers that Kid-Kraft felt the need to stick on almost every piece. To remove the stickers we found cooking oil works best (we used coconut oil).The food that comes in the set is solid wood and finished with oil-based paints. We would have preferred a water-based finish on these pieces since it is found to be a safer alternative but the food is still cute and a nice addition to the set. The pots and pans are made of stainless steel and seem to be pretty sturdy in there overall construction. The problem is that the stainless steel used is a fairly low grade and with gentle play several of the pieces are beginning to show rust spots.  Now the lower grade can be considered both a good and bad thing....the lower grades usually contain less of the heavy metals chromium and nickel but too low a content of these metals and stainless steel rusts easily. Do keep in mind also that we have not used these pans with liquid or for any purpose other than that of which they were intended and my daughter has been fairly gentle with them.If you purchase or already own these pots and find that you have the same problem, small rust spots can be removed if they are caught before they get too bad. To remove rust make a paste out of equal parts baking soda and lemon juice. Rub the mixture on the rust spot and then scrub with a soft sponge or brush. Do not use anything abrasive that might scratch the surface of the pots as this may make matters worse later (NO STEEL WOOL!). Rinse the surface clean and towel dry. If the rust is still there try letting the paste sit on the rust spot for a few minutes. Once the rust is removed be sure to keep an eye out for more spots in the future as more will likely develop with time.If you do decide to go with this cookware set for your child you could also try keeping the rust at bay by ""seasoning"" them as if you would real steel or cast iron cookware. After you have removed all the stickers and adhesive from the product, and have dried them if you washed them, coat the entirety of the metal surfaces in a THIN layer of cooking oil. To help avoid using excess you can apply the oil to a rag or paper towel first and then  wipe the cookware with it. Once they are evenly oiled place all the pieces in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about an hour. This process fills the pores of the cookware's surface with carbonized oil, which blocks the oxidation process and therefore keeps the surface from rusting. Once this is done and they have cooled any excess oil can be wiped off with a paper towel. Do keep in mind however that seasoning can leave a slightly more coppery tone to the metal. Coloration may also be uneven as places where oil pooled will be darker. If you think this look will bother you, don't even try it, just keep an eye out for those rust spots.I hope this is helpful to you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY0L8RDY8N6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BAN3AU#wasThisHelpful","RYY0L8RDY8N6K","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I like this puzzle. It is smaller than most children's puzzles you see in -stores...the wood box that the snail comes displayed in measures 6"" long, 5"" high, and 1"" deep. The box is constructed of solid beechwood, the puzzle pieces are cut from rubber-wood, and the snail is finished with water-based colors. I really love that this puzzle is constructed entirely of solid wood and is void of particle boards and plywood unlike most children's puzzles today. I was however a bit disappointed in the quality of the sanding, hence the loss of one star.Several of the pieces in the puzzle that we received are very rough around the edges. I almost wonder if they sanded the pieces at all. It looks like they just cut the wood out and then proceeded onto the paint. Perhaps we got one that missed the sanding step of the manufacturing process since no one else seems to have had this problem.Other than the rough edges we like the puzzle and so does our two year old daughter. It is a bit tough for her to assemble on her own with out a little help from an adult but I expect that she will master it soon enough. We will probably try and take some sand paper to it in the near future to smooth it out so that she doesn't get any splinters...unfortunately though this will also take off some of the beautiful paint colors.---- UPDATE 2/12/2014 ----When Begin Again toys became aware of the quality puzzle that we received they offered to ship us a replacement puzzle at no charge or hassle to us. The replacement puzzle they sent was much better in terms of quality and sanding. In light of the improved quality of the second puzzle as well as the good customer service I received from the manufacturer I am upping my review rating from four stars to five. I highly recommend this company as I have found them very easy to work with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KM0MLNI3XQDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085SCSL8#wasThisHelpful","R2KM0MLNI3XQDC","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bear stacker is just as adorable as pictured and it's bright colors have captured the attention of my both of my two children (ages 2 yrs and 9 months). My two year old daughter at points finds this stacker a bit frustrating since it is a bit more challenging to correctly line up and stack than her other stacker (you know...the kind that fit together in any order).  I have no doubt though that the challenge is good for her since it teaches her problem solving skills and perseverance.  I expect that she'll master the concept soon since she loves puzzles and it is very much like a puzzle in the way that it assembles.The stacker has ten pieces total, the feet (base), the head, four solid wood shapes, and four colored ""PlanWood"" pieces that in conjunction with the shapes make up the body. ""PlanWood"", as Plan Toys calls it, is high density particle board that is unlike what you have come to expect from typical particle board. It is made by using the wood scraps and shavings that are leftover from producing Plan Toys solid wood toy options and then mixes those scraps with organic water-based pigment powders and 1% of a formaldehyde free glue, called E-zero glue. The material is then molded under high heat and pressure to create a smooth and durable product.  The outcome is not only smooth and nice looking but also highly durable, easy care to care for, and thanks to the lack of formaldehyde content it will not harm the health of your little one like more typical, chemical laden particle boards and plywood.The feet and four colored PlanWood layers are each molded as a one piece design but the bear head on top is molded as two pieces and then pressed together. Since the head is manufactured this way there is a seam running through the middle of his head that is not really noticeable in the pictures. The seam doesn't really bother me but it does give the head piece a less smooth/finished look than the other pieces. I also wonder if it might be a weaker point if the head is ever dropped.Some reviewers I have noticed seem to have the idea that PlanWood is a dishwasher safe material but according to the company it is not approved for this. They recommend cleaning any of their PlanWood items with a wet cloth and soap and then towel drying.If you have any pets in the house do watch out initially that they don't try to eat this toy. For whatever reason one of my family member's dog, who is normally very well behaved (the dog I mean), found the PlanWood material very attractive and tried to steal the pieces away from my son who was playing with the toy on the floor. Just keep an eye out until you are sure you can trust your pet with it lying out and about, I'd hate for any toys to get eaten.Overall, I like this stacker and I highly recommend it. I hope my review is helpful to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB94SBOIT1YEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00737G9WG#wasThisHelpful","RB94SBOIT1YEE","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Natural rubber is a material that I have become very familiar with over the past 3 years since I had my two children but I must say that initially I was a bit nervous about these particular toys.  When they arrived they had a very strong odor unlike any other natural rubber toy we've owned (they didn't smell at all like latex to me). They also had a different texture/density than I expected. They reminded me more of my daughter's EVA foam Crocs shoes. These two things considered I questioned whether or not these toys were indeed composed entirely of natural rubber.  After a few emails back and forth with the company my mind has been put to ease.According to Kim Greenlee and Chris Clemmer of BeginAgain Toys this bath toy set is made entirely of natural rubber except for the addition if their ""organic"" pigment powder. They also stated that all of their natural rubber toys are free of nitrosamines, BPA, Phthalates, and petroleum (except for a petroleum jelly that may be used to free the products from their molds). Due to the possible use of the petroleum jelly I'd recommend a good washing, just in case, before handing them over to your munchkins.They also stated that while their products are indeed manufactured in China that they are independently safety tested for USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand safety standards.The strong smell that I noticed initially has already begun to dissipate after only a week of use. When the toys first arrived I could smell them all the way down the hallway from the bathroom whereas now I have to be within about a foot or two. I'm guessing the smell will continue to decrease with time. Typically I don't buy any bath toys with holes in them to avoid mold and mildew growth but the holes in these toys are large enough that I feel I could clean them out easily enough with soap and water using a small toothbrush.My two children (2 yrs and 9 months) both love their new bath toys. We paid $16.48 for the set (so about $3.30 per piece) and for that price I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADYLQ2Q4F4YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KZPVPW#wasThisHelpful","RADYLQ2Q4F4YV","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This drum rattle measures approximately 3.5"" x 2.75"" and has several components to attract your little ones attention. It has a musical mouthpiece on one end, a dial that clicks on the other, an interior (caged) ball, and 3 beads on one of the cage bars. The musical mouthpiece produces more of a squeaking sound than it does a whistle but the sound can be produced both by blowing air out or by sucking air in. The ""clicking"" dial is the reason that I have withheld one star from my overall rating of this rattle. The dial on ours broke in under a few minutes when Gramma was trying to show baby how it worked. The dial now just spins freely. Despite our disappointment, our son still finds the free spinning dial interesting so in the end it isn't too big a deal. I'm not sure if the problem with our dial is due to a design flaw or if we were just ""unlucky"".Despite the broken piece I feel that these bio-plastic rattles from PlantBaby are an excellent alternative to conventional (petroleum-based) plastic. They are composed of Natureworks plant-based polymer and although they have both the look and feel of conventional plastic they are completely free of petroleum as well as common plastic chemicals. Natureworks makes their polylactide polymer using sugar from corn but other plants such as pine trees, coconuts and soy can be used to produce this material as well. The sugar is converted it into lactic acid, then lactide, and then eventually a polylactide polymer (PLA). According to PlantBaby all the dyes used for coloring their rattles and teethers are plant-based as well (botanical and vegetable). I am guessing this is why the colors tend to be more subdued.The rattle can be easily cleaned with soap and water just like conventional plastic. Do be informed however that bio-plastic has a lower point at which it will melt so it should not be boiled, sterilized, run through the dishwasher, microwaved, or left in a hot car. Natureworks recommends on their website ([...] that their biopolymer be stored at temperatures less than 105F (40C).Both my children (2 yrs and 9 months), as well as me and my husband love this rattle & I highly recommend it. If you have a question about the product feel free to leave me a comment and I will do my best to respond. I hope this review was helpful to you!---UPDATE 4/28/14---Today I am dropping my five star rating of this toy down to two stars since we have been less than impressed by the durability of this particular rattle by PlantBaby. Since the time of my initial review we have had two of these rattle break on us. The original toy was a Christmas gift for my son and less than a month after having received it (mid January) a babysitter gave him the toy while he was in his highchair to keep him happy (not something I would have done) and my son dropped the toy from his highchair and the cage bars of the rattle broke. When this happened the toy broke into multiple pieces, some small enough to pose a choking hazard.Since my son loved the toy so much we decided to replace it and treat the second one  more carefully. The replacement toy took a a while to get to us and we had it roughly the beginning of April. Not even one month later the second rattle suffered a similar fate to the first. My son was carrying the rattle while walking and he tripped....the cage bars on the rattle broke, just as the first, causing the rattle to break into multiple (potentially dangerous) pieces.I love the concept of this rattle and in the brief periods in which it was holding up it was hands-down one of my sons favorite toys. The concept however needs to be backed by a more durable design because a baby toy should be durable enough to hold up to the way a baby plays and babies fall, and chew on, and shake and drop their toys all the time. Seeing as this rattle seems to have a weak point resulting in a very short lifespan of an expensive rattle, and due to the potential risk the broken pieces may pose as a choking or impalement hazard, I can no longer recommend this toy until the company has redesigned it for better safety and durability.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLHG0L57JXGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B73Y57I#wasThisHelpful","R2VLHG0L57JXGG","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Popushi ice pop molds are pretty much as described but be advised that they are not 100% pure silicone. When I was looking into purchasing silicone pop molds I was specifically looking for ones that were labeled either ""medical grade"" or ""100% silicone"". After much searching I couldn't find any with that description so I considered the good reviews and settled on these.Upon receiving I opened them up and twisted them at which point the colors turn to white. This is an indicator that the product is not pure but contains fillers. Good quality silicone is 100% silicone with no fillers, lesser quality silicone may use fillers up to a certain point that is deemed ""acceptable"".  The lesser quality pieces may not work as well or hold up as long but more importantly, the safety of silicone products that contain fillers isnt known. To test if silicone contains fillers, pinch and twist a portion of the piece; if you see any white its not pure silicone.I will probably be keeping these just since sending them back would be a hassle but if I ever re-order I will probably be purchasing from Kinderville instead since other Amazon customers say that they pass the 100% silicone test. I hope this helps you in your decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQ06HPYIAD0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EC9XNM2#wasThisHelpful","R1RQ06HPYIAD0O","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter received this cradle as a Christmas gift this year and overall we are very pleased with it. We went with the unfinished version and it is made entirely of solid pine except for the bottom which is plywood. I would have preferred solid wood throughout but for the price I won't complain.It requires a bit of assembly that is fairly simple but you may wish to have a drill on hand. The particular cradle that we received did not have pre-drilled pilot holes in the cradle sides but my husband was able to quickly remedy that with his drill. Based on the illustration on the instructions it looks like there should have been pre-drilled holes so maybe ours just missed that step in the processing. There were a couple spots that were a bit rough and required a bit of extra sanding but nothing major...we had it all smoothed out in a matter of minutes.The company Little Colorado appears to make nice quality products but good luck contacting them if you need help or have questions. When I was originally looking into purchasing this cradle I had a few questions that I was hoping they could answer for me but I was never able to get a hold of them or even able to leave a message. I initially tried shooting them an email but the message kept bouncing back because their inbox was too full. I then tried to call but never got a live person...just an answering machine that was also full and unable to accept new messages.We paid roughly $25 for this cradle and for that price I think it is an great find. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29D1C7HDN3RMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UJCFKG#wasThisHelpful","R29D1C7HDN3RMJ","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the blue version of this potty and it has been great. The material is composed of about 80% plant fibers from bamboo and rice husks mixed with a resin created from amino acids to bond it all together. The material has the look, feel, and easy care of conventional (petroleum based) plastic but is more environmentally friendly and non-toxic for your little one.When it came time to potty train my daughter I didn't expect to purchase a small potty but thought I could get away with training her to use the big toilet off the bat. We did purchase a small toilet seat to fit on the family toilet but the large toilet was still a bit daunting for her. As soon as we broke down and purchased this ""small potty"" potty training took off and once she got the idea she quickly became more comfortable with the family toilet as well. Having this potty was very helpful to me.While cleaning it was certainly not fun it also wasn't too hard. To clean it I just dumped it out in the toilet, rinsed it with an attached spray nozzle (which I used for cloth diapering) added some soap, washed it out, dried it off with a paper towel and it was set for the next use. After several months of use the potty still looks like new and I am sure that it will hold up well through several more children. The company claims that the potty will biodegrade once composted but I expect that you could get just as much use out of this potty as you would it's plastic counterpart.When it comes time to dispose of the potty the company says that you should place the potty in a compost heap or bury it in the ground.

"I recently purchased the 2.5"" version of this monster ball at a Tractor Supply store for $4.99. The ball is roughly tennis ball sized, measuring almost 9"" around, and is listed for small to medium sized dogs. Some small dogs may have a hard time retrieving this ball due to it's size but I have also seen some very creative and determined little dogs retrieve much larger items. This ball can be used for games of fetch or, for more solo play, you can load it up with small treats for your dog to ""dispense"". For heavy chewers I'm not sure I'd use it as a treat dispenser though since they may just eat the ball to get to the treats.The ball is vanilla scented, which seems odd to me since it is made for dogs. I can only imagine that the scent is to cover the natural rubber smell and make the ball more appealing to the pet owner and not the pet. This seems silly because how often are you really going to put your dog's ball up to your face close enough to be able to smell it? You would think Jolly Pets would pick a scent to make their ball more appealing to a dog....like bacon scented perhaps? The vanilla scent of this ball does absolutely nothing to spark the interest of my two dogs and if it does come close enough for me to smell it I find it just gives me a headache.When I saw this ball in-store, I wasn't particularly drawn to the monster theme but instead to the package that read ""100% Natural Rubber"", a material I've become more familiar with recently in my endeavor to cut back on the amount of plastic (petroleum based products) that I purchase. Natural rubber is a natural latex rubber derived from the Hevea brasiliensis tree. Natural rubber is very resilient, has a fair amount of stretch, and is waterproof (all good qualities in dog toy). This material is also recyclable as well as biodegradable. Since natural rubber is latex though anyone with known latex allergies should probably avoid purchasing this product. Sometimes allergic reactions to natural rubber products can be reduced depending on how the product is processed but since I don't personally have a latex allergy I cannot account for the amount of antigenic proteins found in this ball.The rubber material is reasonably durable but because this ball has a hollow center I have no doubt that any serious chewers could make quick work of this ball. I have two smaller dogs who really aren't chewers. With my dogs playing with this ball I highly expect it to last for years to come...just as long as the lawn mower doesn't get it anyway!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y048DTYWK1IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZJODZK#wasThisHelpful","R2Y048DTYWK1IL","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm always looking for natural alternatives to every product so I was very happy to find these pet collars made of cotton and hemp instead of the more common nylon. The collar is adjustable from 7""-13"" so it will fit well on a small kitty (with plenty of room to grow) as well as on a food hogging Garfield cat. The collar is not a bright red but instead more of a brick red color (kind of a faded red) which I think looks nice.I am discounting one star because the clasp feels pretty flimsy. I'm really hoping it holds up well long term but it is the flimsiest clasp I believe I have ever seen on a cat collar. Perhaps the seller would argue that this is a safety feature, a ""break-away"" clasp, but I have seen breakaway clasps that still felt durable and well made. I guess time will tell how it will weather. I'll update this review if the clasp ever becomes a real problem.Overall, I am still happy with my purchase.

"I placed an order for the small, polished brass pet tag & quality wise it is very nice. It seems a bit big & heavy on my young kitty for the time being but I'm sure he'll grow into it. I like that it's not aluminum like the majority of tags you see in pet stores today.I am discounting one star because the seller engraved my name on the tag as well. I did not include my name in the information I sent them, nor did I want it on the tag. I wished to leave my name off in order for the more important information to have more space and be more easily read. Since I did not provide them with my name I can only guess that they pulled the name off my Amazon account & assumed I was the cat owner. Good thing I wasn't purchasing the tag for someone else.I requested the tag read:PET NAMEADDRESSCITY, STATEPHONE NUMBERInstead it read:PET NAMEMY NAMEADDRESSCITY, STATEPHONE NUMBEROverall, I like the tag and would recommend it. However, if you wish your name left off the inscription you may want to make that very clear in your email to the seller.---- UPDATE 11/13/2013 ----I contacted Lucky Pet Tags regarding the mistake on my tag and they quickly sent a corrected tag free of charge. My young cat found the original tag a bit annoying however and has taken to biting at it occasionally. His sharp teeth have scratched the original tag up quite a bit. For now the tag is still readable but if he keeps it up I doubt it will be very legible in the near future. I plan on holding onto the replacement tag until the first tag is either too scratched up to read or until my cat gets used to wearing it and leaves it alone. Hopefully he'll adjust to it soon, if not I hope that Lucky Pet Tags ""lifetime warranty"" is as good as they make it sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5WW4HOCUTFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IGI9TC#wasThisHelpful","R2P5WW4HOCUTFO","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered five of these combs and of the five that I received three had cracks in the wood and one was also very warped. The two that were in good condition appear to be very nice; they're attractive, well sanded, and the wood has a nice aromatic scent to it. The problem I have is just that the rate of success in receiving a well made comb doesn't appear to be very good, two out of five, that's only a 40% chance of receiving a well made item.The flaws were very easy to spot even before removing the combs from their packaging (they came individually enclosed in clear plastic packages). I'm not sure how the person who shipped them out did not notice the defects. All I can think is that he/she either didn't look at the items being sent or they just didn't care if they were damaged. If you do order this item you may want to send the seller an email with your order number and request that they look the comb over before shipping it out. Hopefully you have better success than I did.----UPDATE 10/30/2013-----A few days ago I contacted Amazon and informed them of the defective combs in my order. They responded and assured me that they would be going through their stock of this item in order to help prevent anyone from having the same misfortune I did.

"The main reason I decided on these particular mice by Kong is because they are made entirely from natural materials, a big selling point for me. The colored fabric exterior is natural cotton, the ears, legs, and tail are leather, and the stuffing is cotton and catnip. I believe the only synthetic material on these little mice are the applique eyes.We received the red and blue set of mice and unlike some of the other reviewer's cats our cat (Henry) doesn't seem to mind the bright and unnaturally colored mice.  Henry is really not a picky customer though....he loves most stuffed toys. He's been enjoying carrying, tossing, and batting his new mice all around the house.The only reason that I am discounting one star is because the mice don't look nearly as nice or well constructed as they do in Kong's product picture.

"I know this is meant to be a dog toy but I actually purchased it for a cat who loves to steal my children's stuffed animals. So far it is a big hit with Henry (the cat). He proudly drags this squirrel all around the house as if it were a trophy. It also seems to help keep Henry from taking the children's toys...at least as long as he hasn't misplaced his squirrel. This squirrel seems like it is made well enough, at least for our purposes. However if your pet is a chewer or likes to play rough it may not last long because the outer material feels kind of thin and not particularly sturdy.I like that this pet toy is made from renewable resources. The exterior fabric is a bamboo rayon (a synthetic derived from a natural source) and the stuffing is all natural cotton.  I try to avoid all synthetic materials when possible, and normally that would include rayon since rayon is derived from wood pulp that must be treated with chemicals like caustic soda, ammonia, acetone and sulfuric acid to make it useable as a cloth material. However, it can be difficult to find totally natural pet toys at a reasonable price. This rayon squirrel seemed like a good compromise and while it is not  ""all-natural"" or ""organic"" it is made from natural, renewable resources, it is free of petrochemicals, and best of all it is affordable as a pet toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCMDT0K8MH2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035H9M2M#wasThisHelpful","R1BCMDT0K8MH2D","A31LV3U27VKB7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31LV3U27VKB7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did a lot of research when it came time to find my children a good multivitamin. Since it is not mainly the amount of a given nutrient listed on the bottle that is important but instead that nutrients form and how much of it is bio-available that counts I was specifically looking for a whole food based supplement. Whole food supplements are, like the name suggests, supplements made from concentrated whole foods so they contain an array of natural vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, enzymes, co-enzymes, trace elements, and activators that naturally work together. Food based supplements allow your body to absorb the concentrated nutrients of whole foods as if they were a normal part of your everyday diet while synthetic supplements are treated by the body as if they were foreign substances. Some of these ""foreign substances"" are merely rejected while others (in order to be effective) absorb additional nutrients from your body, leaving your body's stores depleted. This is because synthetic vitamins have been isolated from the other nutrients that they would normally be paired with in nature, and without the presence of those nutrients they aren't usable to the body.Since I knew that I only wanted whole food vitamins that narrowed my search significantly; I found that there only seemed to be a few whole food options on the market that were child specific. While these vitamins from Bluebonnet may not be the cheapest supplement around I love that they are whole food based so that I can rest assured that my children are actually benefiting from them.

"Well, there's only one reason NOT to buy this bulb over regular lightbulbs or the standard energy-efficient ones, and that's the higher initial investment. I guess if you see the $19.99 price tag for this compared to a couple of dollars for the other ones, you may be tempted to go for the cheaper ones. In the long run, though, these LED bulbs will save you a lot of money (need to be replaced much less often and use less energy) and, for the same reasons, a lot of time. They're also great because they're dimmable, unlike the old-fashioned energy-efficient bulbs (which just flicker on or off without dimming).

"I'll start off by admitting that I am not an audiophile and not an expert when it comes to this type of equipment. I picked this product out of the lineup based on features and based on some of the other reviews here, which are clearly written by people who know more about the different types of receivers and their functions.As for me, as a layman user who hasn't used a receiver since the olden days in which stereo systems came with different components (record player, tape deck, speakers and so on) that had to be hooked up, I found this device both intimidating and, once I started setting it up, surprisingly easy to use thanks to the onscreen Setup Assistant, which more or less walks you through the whole process. Excellent idea for the novice - like me - but probably not necessary for the expert user.You can configure the system as a 7.1 channel system in one room (which, in the course of this process, I learned means 7 speakers and a subwoofer) for full surround sound, or you can configure it as 5.1 in one room with another 2 speakers in a second room. I have not attempted to set up a second ""zone"" yet so can't comment on this feature, but it doesn't look too complicated.The system is able to stream Spotify (my preferred means of music consumption nowadays). It can also be controlled via an iPhone/iPad app (and an Android one) so once you've got everything set up and hooked up, it can really simplify your multimedia experience: one device does it all.As for sound quality: again, I'm not an audiophile so I refer you to the experts for that, but to my layman's ears everything sounds great.In closing: my main concerns were with ease of use and compatibility with AirPlay/Spotify etc. and I can find no fault in those regards. My only suggestions: I'm fairly sure similar functionality can be found in cheaper units, so I'd look around before committing to this (rather pricey) device unless you are confident that you really need everything this Denon AVR-E400 delivers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUZNJYXM88KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7X2OTY#wasThisHelpful","R1BUZNJYXM88KI","A2T04VAIXSKJH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T04VAIXSKJH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful watch. The first thing that'll strike you is the gorgeous, luxurious packaging. This also makes it a great gift. The watch comes with a sturdy black leather band and a replacement brown leather band. I haven't tried to replace the band because I prefer the black band, but replacing it looks easy enough. (One point of warning: the bands are on the thick side, which means they'll be hard to bend initially, making it hard to get the end under the loop until you've worn it a few times.)

"This is actually a fun and fairly well-made game for kids. If your child or children liked the Monsters Inc. Pixar movie, they'll probably be into this. My only recommendation would be hop on YouTube and watch a gameplay video there (just search for the product name) to make sure it's the right age range for your child. Leapfrog bills this as 4-7 years old, which is a HUGE range in terms of development already, and that doesn't take into account the individual child's style and ability. My child is almost 6 and played with it for quite a while, but he has a lot of experience with other educational games and decided this one was too easy and ""boring"" after a short while compared to some of the iPad games he's used to. I've seen parents complain this is way too easy for their 7 year old and others that it was confusing for their 4 year old. It all depends on your child's age and personality, so peek at a video before you commit. If you think it may be too hard now, it's a good way to introduce your child to something that can grow with them, but if you even suspect it might be too easy already, it probably will turn out to be a waste of money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346LPMA1KOW3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRCNAE8#wasThisHelpful","R346LPMA1KOW3I","A2T04VAIXSKJH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T04VAIXSKJH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Starting off with the best feature: you can fill this feeder from the top. If you've ever refilled a hummingbird feeder, you know you usually have to flip them upside down to get to the opening, which means you have a good chance of getting the sticky leftover liquid all over your hands. With this top-fill one, you can just unscrew the top, refill, and done. Awesome idea.Also great: no leaks. I've had several feeders in the past, and they frequently started leaking after a while. I guess the plastic ones expand and contract in the sun, creating tiny gaps that allow the liquid to leak out. If you use hummingbird food rather than just sugar water, that'll create an ugly red stain underneath the feeder. Even if you don't, you can expect lots of ants or other critters to make a bee line for the sugary puddle of free nutrition. So, second plus of this model: no leaks, so far at least.Final plus: the ant moat! This isn't unique to this model, but it's something to look out for. The top has a little ridge, which will prevent lines of ants from wandering along the top of the feeder to get to the food.All in all, this is a very nice hummingbird feeder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LR1YGLCYCHRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UII50W#wasThisHelpful","R1LR1YGLCYCHRG","A2T04VAIXSKJH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T04VAIXSKJH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great device to have in your emergency kit. It plays AM/FM radio as well as NOAA weather alerts. It also works as a flashlight. You can also charge cell phones and USB devices from it. The radio itself can be charged with a handcrank, via USB (plug it into your computer etc) or with sunlight. You can also charge it with an AC adapter, but you have to order the adapter separately, which is a big minus in my book.

"This is such a nice and comfortable sleep mask by OOSilk. If you're buying this as a gift for someone, know that it arrives in a very cute and nice package. I like that this is the largest sleep mask I've ever used, because it blocks out so much light to where I don't have to be bothered when I need to nap during the day.I deal with insomnia due to stress and can't sleep at night and this helps with me catching the rest I need in the day without the sun hurting my eyes or keeping me awake. It also doesn't slide around when I turn over to get more comfortable.The adjustable band is very nice, it fits my husband and I both very well. This is very nice quality and very well made. If you're in need of a sleep mask, I recommend this one! :) I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNS9W9XLY2C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UCY3S2#wasThisHelpful","R3KNS9W9XLY2C6","A23PP59ZKZPB0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23PP59ZKZPB0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I need pillowcases, I always find that OOSilk seems to make my favorites. They're always high quality and feel great. I'm very impressed with this Mulberry silk pillowcase and I love that it has a zipper closure. I haven't experienced any zipper problems, even after washing.My husband and I run the heater when we sleep but this pillowcase always feels cool against my skin, even when the rest of the room is stuffy. I like that this doesn't absorb moisture from my face. I apply night moisturizers at times and sometimes, I'll apply an acne cream and I haven't experienced trouble with either of those coming off onto the case.This case is helpful to my hair too because I bleach and dye my hair and this case doesn't frizz it out or mat it up which is a great bonus for me about this product. You only receive 1 pillowcase with this order, so if you're looking for 2 or more, you'll need to add to the quantity you purchase. I am very impressed with this and highly recommend!

"After a long day of standing or a lot of walking, I experience really bad pain in my heels. I've tried gel insoles but they either aggravated me or began to slide around so I gave up. I am very glad they make something like this that I can wear on my actual foot, instead of something you place into your shoe. This stays in place and I haven't experienced it sliding around at all. It fits so comfortably, that I don't even notice it once it's been on for a minute. I worried something like this would fit me awkwardly or drive me crazy but it hasn't. I've only experienced good things with this heel sock.I like that I can slide my sock over this and it still be comfortable and my shoe fits fine while I have these on. They have helped me not experience the bad pain I was having. I don't find myself stopping to look for a place to sit down and rest my feet as often anymore. I'm not sure how well these will hold up after a lot more wearing but I can update my review at a later date to let you know. Right now, they're great and I recommend them if you suffer from foot pain. For extra pain relief + softening of your skin- you can do what I sometimes do with these- add some lotion and slide them on.

"This review is for the ""Essential Oil Diffuser w/ Music"" This is a very nice diffuser by TurnRaise. Not only is it quite cool looking but it's very well made and extremely easy to use. The instructions are easy to read and understand. Mine works great and I'm even using it now as I write this review. :)You can use this as a regular humidifier if you don't have any essential oils. It will still put out the mist from the water and make the room fresher and easy to breathe in. If you have essential oils- even better, and it's quite simple to add the drops in. Use only 2-3 drops per 100ml water at a time.. If you use more, the oil can clog the system and cause malfunction. Speaking of malfunctions, the instruction manual points out that if you are using essential oils with this diffuser- they must be 100% natural, because anything else can cause this product to malfunction.With the weather turning off colder, I'm usually under some blankets and sometimes have my heater on nearby which can make the room very stuffy but this diffuser has been helping give the room moisture so I can stay warm, yet still be able to breathe well.The timer lasts for 180 minutes, 120 minutes, 60 minutes or 30 minutes. It's very easy to set the time on the diffuser. The ""Music"" is a repeated sound of, in my opinion, what sounds like a waterfall or rain with a bird chirping, and then a seagull and ocean waves. I had first thought the ""Music"" would maybe be a Bluetooth button to sync with your phone where you could listen to your favorite songs on. I think that would be great but I am mentioning this in case you assume what I did. This is more of a sound machine with one track with the birds to listen to when you're relaxing after a long day and want to pretend you're somewhere else, hehe :)If you're not listening to the sound of the birds, it's easy to turn that option off and have this diffuser without the sound effects. This diffuser is quite quiet and if you were to nap with this nearby, I wouldn't think the sound would keep you awake. I'm quite a light sleeper, yet having this nearby relaxes me and keeps me resting.This would make a very nice holiday gift to give to someone you care about. I'm quite pleased and will be using this a lot through the Winter. Highly recommend!

"Aww these are so cute and comfortable. They're not the type of sock I normally buy for myself to wear but lately, I've been experiencing my feet getting colder than usual, so I knew I needed something like this and I wanted them to be stylish. I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and these fit just like I expected them to. They're soft and not itchy and keep my feet warm. I own the ""wave"" style, by the way. They're very well made!I had planned to keep some of these and give a couple to my friends for holiday gifts but I'll admit, I like them far too much now that I'm actually going to keep them all for myself Lol.

"I have only used flat irons prior to coming across this brush so I was quite interested in trying this out but then before it arrived, I began reading some reviews and started getting worried on how well this would or wouldn't work.So, my opinion on this product is that while I'm impressed and like it and will definitely continue using it- I do have a list of cons about it.What I like about the product--It does what it claims on my hair. It straightens it very well and I can turn the brush a certain way and create a nice curl for my layers. But do I think that this would work amazingly well on someone with extra curly hair? I'm honestly not sure. I'd have to see results on a friend before coming to that conclusion. I have wavy hair and it worked great on mine.-It makes my hair look extremely healthy which surprised me, because I have bleached/dyed hair that can look quite fried after using a flat iron but with this brush, my hair came out bouncy and healthy. That's my main reason for my star rating, because I am very impressed with that.-My hair holds the straightening/slight curling very well. By the end of the day, my hair isn't back to looking like it did prior to using this.-I didn't get burned by this product.-Didn't give me any frizzies.-It didn't tangle up my hair and create a mess like some products I own have. It didn't rip any of my hair out.-It's easy to hold, my hand doesn't grow tired of holding it for a while.-The cord is long and nice and doesn't bunch up and tangle like other products I own.What I didn't like about the product--The buttons are in the worst possible area.. While using this, I constantly accidentally press the temperature buttons just because of where they're located when you're holding this. I highly dislike that.-Takes a long time to heat up to the temp I want.-It had a weird smell at first but after it was on for a while, that dissipated.-Even though, it's pretty easy to figure out how to use this, I didn't like the instruction manual because it was badly translated to English and some of it just didn't make any sense at all.So do I recommend this product? If you have hair like mine, I totally would because I am happy with this (except where those buttons are!) but if you have quite curly hair... I'm honestly not sure. I can test this out on a friend when I get a chance and update my review to let you know.

" 0:42 MinsI am loving this headset by Sentey. I have had headsets in the past by other brands but this one is my favorite. I love the look of it, how fancy and professional it looks. It fits my head and ears very well, I don't feel any uncomfortableness. I have had headsets before that have hurt my ears after wearing them for a while but that isn't the case with this product.The wiring looks and feels very durable which is a relief, because an old headset I had from a different brand, the wire cracked and broke after a while of use. The sound quality, in my opinion, is wonderful. I like that I can use this for gaming but also have been using it to watch movies on my computer, while being in the same room with my husband while he watches TV or plays Xbox online with his friends. This headset cancels out a lot of background noise for me so I can enjoy the movie I'm watching. The bass kicks in during the movie and sounds so good, it makes me feel like a theater experience.The only thing I was disappointed in with this product is that the instruction manual doesn't have much English in it so I had to figure out what buttons did what, on my own. I really like the blue lights, they make it look very cool. I love how when the mic isn't in use, you can hide it into the headset. I've used my mic to speak on Google Talk, to friends, while saving my cell phone minutes. The mic quality and how well they hear me has been just fine.I love that the headset has its own volume button. I'm blonde so I will admit, when I first tested out the headset, I turned a movie on and couldn't hear it well and thought oh no, I'm not impressed... and then I noticed the volume button. Lol. Once I turned that up, I was highly impressed. I am loving this and highly recommend!!

"I am really liking this pack of four White Liquid Chalk Markers by CrafyCroc. I like the reversible tip and I tested all of them out and all of mine work great. I love using Liquid Chalk Markers to leave little notes on the mirror for my husband to see before he leaves work. These markers are also great to draw on windows, like Holiday decorations and whatnot. I've added little snowball drawings to the windows beside my front door. :)I will say that I have tried Liquid Chalk Markers by other brands and this, in my opinion, goes on so well that it makes it a little hard to fully wipe off easily. I do find myself breaking out the Windex at times to make sure no residue is left. It's not a problem or con against this product for me, but I would suggest testing this out on certain surfaces and leaving it for a while to see how it works for you, before you draw all over something.

No brush lines and I haven't experienced any shedding which is great!Very high quality brush, I'm really impressed and this will definitely be my go-to from now on when it comes to applying concealer.

"I am pretty impressed with this Dead Sea Magnesium Oil by Magnum Solace. I have a magnesium deficiency and am glad something like this helps instead of always having to take pills. I use it at night to help me sleep. I spray it on the bottom of my feet and once it begins absorbing, I put my socks on and lay down in bed. It's been helping me to calm down before bed so I can fall asleep easier and stay asleep longer.I also use it during the day at times on my lower back because I sometimes have pain there and this helps relieve that. My husband sprays some on his knees to help with his knee pain, before he goes to work.I like how well it sprays and how much you receive.

"This is a very well made and very beautiful waist trainer cincher by Everbellus. I own the black one and I am loving it. I do think I probably could have purchased a size smaller but I went by my measurements and was afraid a smaller one wouldn't fit but after wearing this, I know it's supposed to be really tight so I'm thinking a size down would be better for me.I'm still really loving this though. I'd say.. maybe suck your stomach in the best you can when you take measurements so you know what you're purchasing will be a nice, tight fit. On me, it makes me look smaller yet it lets me breathe without any trouble. I'm not sitting there, eating dinner, while wearing it, thinking any minute, I'm gonna turn into the Hulk and burst out of this Lol. The hooks seem very sturdy and they hook very easily. I'm glad it hooks in the front so I don't need my husband to help me put it on.I love the material and it stays in place on me. I don't have to adjust it when I stand after sitting for a while. I also like that it doesn't pinch out back fat Lol. Some waist slimmers I own are shorter length (from bottom to top) than this and they squeeze my fat up between the slimmer and my bra and it's embarrassing. This one to me, is the perfect size, perfect height, where it doesn't pinch any fat up. It keeps all my extra jiggle ;) in place.I know most people will probably wear this as a waist trainer in order to lose weight and to be honest, I probably should wear it for that reason as well but to me, I want to wear it to feel sexy in and also, to use under my shirts so I will look thinner so I can feel better about myself which will help motivate me to work on losing weight better.I think it would also work to wear over a pirate style shirt to dress up for Halloween at the end of this month! :) I'm very satisfied. It looks just like the seller's photo. The lace is beautiful. This also helps my posture which I was in dire need of fixing... I usually find myself slouching a lot until this product.

"This is a very nice car mount by Apipema that hooks into your air vent in your car. It's very small, doesn't take up much room and serves its purpose. I tested our my two phones and my husband's in this and all fit just fine. No worries of it slipping out and falling, the grip holds tight to the sides of your phone.This would make a great and helpful gift to someone you care about. After testing this out well, I have decided to give it to my best friend who stresses me out every time her phone rings while she's driving. She is always anxious to answer it right away but fumbles around in her purse to try to find it. I'm afraid she's going to take her eyes off of the road sometime without thinking.

"Our backyard backs up to woods and we like to keep up a small trail that we can take walks on and enjoy. My Mom is more OCD about it than I am and I constantly find her out there trying to trim back the limbs. We don't own our own saw, we usually borrow from my brother when he's around or from a nearby neighbor and when we don't have one to borrow, I find my Mom ripping limbs down and stepping on them to break so she can haul them off. Sometimes she hurts her feet by doing this so when I saw this item come up, I knew I needed to get it for her as a holiday gift.I'm so excited to give this because I know how much easier things will be now. To have knowledge on this item to post my review, I opened it when it arrived and my husband and I went to the woods and began testing it out. I admit, I was a bit skeptical on how something small and lightweight could work but immediately, we were both impressed by how well it sliced through the limbs. I don't even have a lot of upper arm strength and yet, I wasn't wearing myself out by using this which is a huge relief.It fits very nicely in my hand and I don't have to worry about it slipping and sliding out. I really like how well this folds up to where it takes up hardly any space at all. This saw is extremely durable, very well made. Something like this is very useful, not just for my family and I wanting to keep our trail nice but I can see this being an excellent item to take with you when you go camping, hiking or even fishing.

"I like the concept of this a lot. I have used curling wands in the past but always found them to be extremely awkward but this, because it auto rotates and clamps onto my hair keeping it in place... I am a fan. It makes things a lot easier and doesn't take too long to do my hair. It does take a while to get used to or at least it did for me.I didn't know if I was going to like it when I first used it but now I'm liking it the more I get used to it and learn how to use it better. I like how well it curls my hair and how I curl left or I can curl right, whichever I prefer to do that day. I have to be careful with it because if I get distracted, I can easily burn my scalp. It hasn't happened yet but my first use- it almost did when I held the button down too long and it began getting close to my head. It's a nice curling iron but just be careful.It looks and feels very nice, it's high quality. I like how fast it heats up and that you can change the temperature setting.

"I have been wanting a Terminus shirt for a while. It was my favorite thing about the show- when I became a bigger fan because the story interested me so much. When I saw this shirt, I knew I had to have it for the upcoming Walking Dead convention I will be attending.I admit, I was worried what the quality would be because I noticed on the tag, it was printed on Jerzees and I don't believe they make ""Officially Licensed Merchandise"" so I worried what I would receive would be a low quality t-shirt transfer that would look like someone had made it at home. What I received though, in my opinion, is really good quality. I was quite impressed. It doesn't look or feel like a t-shirt transfer. My husband, who is very picky about printed images on shirts, looked at it and felt it and told me he was impressed as well. It doesn't look cheaply made at all.I love it and am very happy. I like that the tint of the graphic has a slight blue to it. I saw other Terminus maps just like this one on other sides and those looked to have a tan tint and I was hoping this one would be blue in person like the photo shows and I was right. So I'm very pleased with that as well.I love how the shirt fits. I am female but normally wear a mans/unisex Medium- that was, until I have gained some weight this year, and when I purchase shirts in stores now, I usually settle on a Large. I worried this wouldn't fit right so I went back and forth in my mind about purchasing a Medium or a Large. Sometimes Larges can be a bit too big and the sleeves poke out weird on me, but then sometimes a Medium can be either okay, or it can be tight. It just depends I guess on how the shirt is made, whether or not it will like my figure Lol. I noticed this listing stated Free Returns, so I thought ok, I will order the Large and if it's too big, I'll return it and buy the Medium. I was pleasantly surprised how well it fit me. It isn't too big or too small, it fits great. I marked ""Somewhat small"" on the ""How does the Product fit?"" question, in my review, because it wasn't as big as a Large I try on in stores for most shirts.I'm so glad I made this purchase and can't wait to wear it to the convention I will be going to and have my photo taken with the actor who plays Gareth. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOSH85O8IMSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT089FY#wasThisHelpful","R1NOSH85O8IMSJ","A23PP59ZKZPB0L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23PP59ZKZPB0L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great luggage scale! I've always wanted one and never had one until now. I love that it is made of stainless steel. It looks and feels very nice and fancy.I tested this out around the house and it works great I will be traveling soon and this is going to come in handy to make things easier on my family and I. My friend is already asking to borrow it Lol.I like that it can also double as a scale to weigh packages for mailing. I read in a review it can do that so I'm excited to try that, for that will come in handy when I begin selling again online.If you're looking for a luggage scale for your travels, I highly recommend this one!

"I can't stand the taste of cranberry juice so I'm really glad they make a pill that will help my urinary tract without having to deal with the taste of the juice. You only have to take one a day which is nice and easy to not forget. There isn't an after taste.I take these if I feel a UTI coming on and it helps to stop that but I'm going to start taking these daily.I have taken a lot of cranberry pills through the years and these are some of the best and the most easy to swallow.I like that these can also help with heart health by preventing the buildup of platelets.

"This is quickly and definitely becoming my favorite pillow case I've ever owned. Not only does it look very classy and nice but it feels wonderful. I love how it stays cool during the night.It matches perfectly with my silk sheets. I love how the cotton side keeps my pillow in place so it doesn't slide around on my sheets. I sleep with one main pillow for my head but I have a few travel size pillows I lay around my sides and those slide off the bed onto the floor constantly. Does OOSILK make travel pillowcases? ;) lolThis case is perfect for me because I have bleached/dyed hair and this case is very gentle to sleep on. I don't have to worry that when I turn over, it might cause breakage to my hair. Also, I really like that it is gentle on my face as well and it's not going to wipe away my nightly moisturizer and/or acne cream when I need it.I believe this pillowcase helps me to sleep better too. I don't know about others, but when I stay at a nice hotel, I sometimes get the best sleep if the bed sheets and pillows are nice and fancy. I feel as if I am experiencing that at home with this luxury pillowcase on my memory foam pillow I purchased on here a while back.It arrives neatly in an attractive black box. I was impressed the second I opened it and felt the material. I love that it has a zipper closure. It's all very nicely made, great quality. I highly recommend!

"Oh thank goodness they make these. My computer area has always been such a mess that I have been embarrassed when company is over but there just hasn't been much I could do with all these cords. I have tried bunching them together, being held by garbage bag ties. I clipped some together with hair bows Lol. I even pulled over a small cart and had tried to wrap a lot of the cords around the handle of it but that became a pain when I had a repair man here months ago and he and I had to unwrap it all so he could re-wire some things. My cats don't bother the cords much but a couple of times, they have walked by and gotten stuck in them.With these sleeves, my area is looking 100% better. It's definitely more organized and neater. I'm extremely happy. I'm thinking of getting more of these to use in my TV/Video games area. The only con is that they have a strong odor but it's to be expected due to the material. They're very well made. I fumbled a bit with the zipper a couple of times but then got the hang of it. Really nice quality cable sleeves.

"I am extremely impressed with this Flat Iron. Xtava makes my favorite mascara so I was curious to see how their hair products are as well. High quality of course!I was instantly impressed when it arrived because it came in a nice black box with their logo listed and inside was a heat resistant carrying bag which would be easy to travel with. Inside that was the flat iron.I really love the look and feel of this iron. It doesn't slip out of my hands while using. I have owned quite a number of Flat Irons through the years and this one is the best quality. It heats up the quickest too. I like that you can change the temperature setting if needed.It's very simple to use but I like that it came with an instruction manual. It also has the longest cord of Flat Irons I've used which is extremely nice because on the days my husband and I have to get ready at the same time, I can easily walk with this cord to the other mirror so I can do my hair while he is brushing his teeth. I like that the cord doesn't get tangled either on my cabinet drawer knobs. I usually have an issue with that happening but not with this product.I like how easily this straightens my hair making it still look healthy instead of a fried, straw-like look. This is a very nice and professional looking Flat Iron with storage carrying case. I'm in love. Highly recommend!

"Wow! Now this is a niiiice mud mask! I was impressed right away as I opened the lid and saw the quality of it. It's extremely easy to apply and a little bit goes a long way so this container is going to last a while.My husband's face when he saw me walk out of the bathroom wearing this mask was priceless Lol.I love how this yanks out the toxins so my skin will be clearer from now on. It feels great on the skin and when I wash it off, my skin is instantly soft and smooth.You can use it once a week but I think using it once or twice more than that will be fine but I wouldn't use this every night. I leave mine on for about 15 minutes and then I get into the shower.On my face, it doesn't harden to the point of cracking and tightening too much where it's uncomfortable. It dries but there's no uncomfortableness. I haven't experienced any irritation or breakouts. This is one of my favorite mud masks now. Love it! Highly recommend!

"I always trust Number One Nutrition and this product has not let me down. I don't care too much for taking a lot of sleeping pills on the market because I can't seem to trust a lot of the ingredients put into them but with Melatonin, it's natural and I can feel good about that.Each pill is 3mg of Melatonin. I'm used to taking 5mg so I take two of these before bed. It says you can chew them but I've been swallowing them. Maybe I will chew them soon and see if it puts me to sleep faster but as of now, I usually take two as I turn off the bathroom light and I get into bed and get comfortable and relax. My brain loves to go crazy with thoughts once I'm in bed so for years, I have suffered with insomnia. Within 10 minutes of my mind thinking of every possible thing to annoy me lol, I finally drift off to sleep. If I don't take Melatonin, I lay awake for hours. So I'm really glad this helps me like it does.I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and can get through the day without feeling the need for an afternoon nap. I think I even have more detailed & interesting dreams when I take Melatonin or at least it seems that way.I love the amount you receive in this bottle. It's going to last you for quite a while. Also, the pills are very small- incredibly easy to swallow (or chew.. Hey, I will try that tonight finally) If you're in need of Melatonin, I recommend this. If you've never tried Melatonin but have trouble sleeping especially, drifting off to sleep- then you should try these and see if they help you. I've given some of these to my Mom because she has a lot of trouble falling asleep plus staying asleep. These have been helping her as well.

"This is a wonderful and impressive waist trainer slimming belt made by Familyus. I love how adjustable it is and how easy it is to put on. I like how it goes together in the front instead of some other waist slimmers out there that have to connect together from the back. Usually, I have to get my husband to help with those but with this, I can quickly and easily put it on and I'm ready to go.I like that it is made of velcro instead of being made with the type of hooks you'd find on a bra. I own a waist slimmer with those and every time I sit down, I am afraid of popping those open. With this, I don't have to worry about that because the velcro stays in place. The only thing I could negatively say about this product is that the velcro does make a slight sound when I sit down but that's to be expected with wearing velcro. The waist trainer stays in place and doesn't slide around when I am stand after sitting. I don't have to fiddle with it to fix it back in place so that is a relief. It's made of very good quality material and the velcro is very strong.It's not noticeable under my clothes.. I normally wear a sweater or a logo t-shirt. If you're wearing a skin tight shirt, then yeah, maybe it will show but on me, it's just fine. I like that the fabric is breathable. I live in Georgia and it stays pretty hot, in my opinion, and I don't like the feeling of something sticking to me when I'm sweating and with this waist belt, I haven't experienced that sticky feeling but I have experienced sweating in my stomach area due to this so I know that is going to help me to lose my extra pounds that I've been trying to lose.I feel better about myself when I have this on because I am quite insecure but this product helps me to not only look better but to feel better as well. It makes me have better posture and it also helps with my lower back pain. I wish I could say it looks as good on me as it does in the model in the photo up there Lol.

"I am quite impressed with this bottle of Rhodiola Rosea by the Vitaminery. I have only taken Rhodiola once before, about a year ago, and even though it wasn't a miracle pill to me, it still helped keep me calmer in anxiety situations. It was a much smaller dose than what this bottle by this company contains.. This bottle is just the right amount of a dosage for me because I feel better when I take it.I deal with pretty high anxiety and suffer from panic attacks. I'm a worry-wart so that only adds to my anxiety and with the stress and anxiety I experience, it can put me in quite a depressed state semi often. This has really helped lighten my mood and made me feel not only calmer in situations, but in a happier state where I don't find myself being the normal paranoid, worry-wart I am. It also has helped me become more productive during the day to get a lot taken care of off my to-do lists.I'm really happy with this bottle. That being said, I understand all our bodies are different and what may work for some, may not work for others.

"Loving this foot cream by LeliaSea. I was impressed the minute I began putting it on my feet. My skin instantly began feeling better. I've had issues lately due to having walked way too much at a recent convention I went to that lasted several days- my feet haven't felt the same since. Rough and just an uncomfortable feeling but when I put this lotion on, I was impressed right away so I am definitely continuing to use this.I love how fast it absorbs! Usually, when I apply lotion to my feet, it takes quite a while for it to sink in and then if I need to get up and get something, I end up rubbing the lotion off onto the carpet. With this foot cream, it absorbed so well, that when it was time to get up and go to a different room, I didn't have that slippery feeling on the smooth surface flooring, nor did it rub off onto the carpet I walked over either.I really like the scent. It's not too faint and not too strong, in my opinion. Plus, who doesn't want nice smelling feet? :) I can honestly state that my feet are healing and feeling like they used to. If I could rate this product more than five stars, I would. The only thing I dislike about this product is the small size. I want a huge bottle of this because it's so great hehe :) I highlyyy recommend this!!!

"The lipstick is nice but the shade is a lot darker than I thought it'd be.. I thought it would have more of a pinkish shade but instead, on me anyway, it's quite brown. It washes me out and isn't flattering on me, but overall as a lipstick- it's very smooth and goes on well and feels nice. It doesn't last too long on me, I find myself reapplying quite the number of times during the day. I love the creamy feeling of it..

"My husband's car can become quite the mess if I haven't been in it for a while, cleaning it out. I've tried putting plastic bags from the grocery store, in his floorboard so when he has something to throw away, he can throw it in there... except usually, the bag gets turned over after a while and everything spills out, so when I saw this Car trash can and Organizer, I knew I needed to get it for his car.Ever since I put this in his car, everything has been much nicer and cleaner which makes the neat-freak in me very relieved and pleased.I love that it is waterproof and easy to clean if needed. The material is very high quality and feels very nice. The Velcro used is very tough and nice. I love that it comes with an adjustable buckle so I can attach it in the car and it won't go anywhere, no falling over and spilling anything out.I am really glad it has 3 pockets to fit things in.

And while his barking is typically nothing, it does get super-annoying.This kit came with:1 x Remote Transmitter1 x Collar Receiver1 x Adjustable Nylon Belt1 x USB Charging Cable1 x Charger1 x Test Bulb2 Set of Metal Probes1 x user guide1 x quick guide It was quickly fitted and adjusted for use on my dog right out of the box. The device has 4 modes: static shock, vibration, beep and light. And there are 100 levels of static shock and vibration stimulation, but in my situation, the vibration and beep mode was plenty. My dog is a quick study, I guess; therefore I havent had to literally shock him  yet. I may be able to give this collar up on the dog at some time soon, but right now, hes doing awesomenot misbehaving an staying quiet with he needs to. I would recommend this collar to any dog owner, no matter if the pooch stays in or out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZZCCA0IR3Y4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W7A0SM#wasThisHelpful","R3NZZCCA0IR3Y4","A1DXK2Y4A50O5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DXK2Y4A50O5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Myanmar (or Burma), under a tyrannical dictatorship for five decades, holds its people under fear and complete control. Aung San Suu Kyi is a political prisoner under house arrest for most than 15 of his 21 year-sentence is known as Burmas Mandela, but now has the chance to change the future of her beloved country in the upcoming election in 2015.The freedom fighter and Nobel Peace Prize winner is pushing to lead her country to freedom with her leadership skills. She is quickly swaying many voters to her side, but still there are other who believe she is only a puppet of the west because of her British family ties and democratic views. But there are other players involved, like those who are trying to rig the balloting just as they had done in the 2010 election.Suu Kyi is Burmas final hope for liberation, but is she there for the wests gain? Her enemies are many within the Myanmar government and the possibility that she might be assassinated continues to grow in this fictional-based-on-fact account.I have little knowledge of Burma or its political history or current stance, but the book was engrossing and provided me with some in-depth history of an interesting culture. Well-written, fast-paced, and captivating, I surprised myself by my interest in reading and quickly finishing this book (I typically have little interest in political fiction). Peter Simmen has done a terrific job drawing the history of the troubled country while pairing it with a good piece of fiction. Engaging and I thought the US boasted the most corrupt government in the world!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WK6KJL5PRZLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GSHNLI#wasThisHelpful","R1WK6KJL5PRZLR","A1DXK2Y4A50O5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DXK2Y4A50O5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a dog who loves to bark at night when he goes outany little sound in the yard makes him practically come out of his fur.  I purchased this collar to help control his night-barking, and so far its world great!  On the first bark, the collar sounds a short warning tone. The sound of the tone increases as the doggie continues to bark, all the way up to seven, growing stronger with each level. If your dog stops barking for thirty seconds, the collar then resets itself. In just a couple of nights, my dog figured it out and he stopped all that silly barking.This collar came with the receiver, manual, and replaceable 6V battery. It fits my dog perfectly shes a big girl and this collar is perfect for the low price. Id recommend it to anyone with a bigmouthed doggie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOH1AN6TA5SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOCIHA2#wasThisHelpful","R2YOH1AN6TA5SO","A1DXK2Y4A50O5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DXK2Y4A50O5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been interested in the concept of attraction for a while, but it seems all the books I downloaded were a bit confusing. Alexander Janzers guide is concisely written without a lot of fluff and filler. It focused solely on what you need to know to get started on changing your life for the better. In this short, but informational guide, I learned the three steps of manifesting, and things to avoid. Like most people, I am one who would love to become more financially stable. Janzer provides some important, yet easy, habits to learn that will manifest more money (such as checking accounts regularly, carrying money in your pocket, and simply placing a dollar bill in a position where you can see it at all times. If youre into vision boards, this works in a similar fashion, I assume. I recommend this ebook to anyone who is new to the concept of attraction or who would like a refresher.

"This is a guide to better understanding life and how to act and react on the outside world. Author Tahmid Hussain explains that no matter the amount of formal education one might havethe number of book read and courses taken, nothing can replace real-life experiences. The knowledge taken from books is simply second-hand learning. It provides no real insight on ourselves and what we can learn about ourselves. In addition, Husssain indicates there is a notable lack of people using their own thoughts to make changes in their lives and changes in the environment in which they live. I agree whole-heartedly with this concept. Everywhere I look, I see people who are simply acting on the influence they have received from other people around them and even worse, the media. Where are all the original thinkers nowadays?  This brief booklet serves as an introduction to series on the topic of Logical Life, with contact information in case you wish to discuss (anonymously) some real life issues youd like to see addressed in future volumes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCV5RCE2CMH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017513FGC#wasThisHelpful","RRCV5RCE2CMH6","A1DXK2Y4A50O5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DXK2Y4A50O5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The prolific Robin Fate is back with another huge collection of short, filthy tales that are sure to get your heart revved up. Containing dozens of hot n sexy tales that are sure to get you in the mood, I was able to enjoy the sexiest scenarios imaginable. All of these were insanely naughty, but my favorite one of the collection had to be Amber and Sam. From best friends to first times to naughty billionaires, these are some of most vivid erotica tales Ive read. Some of the situations arent exactly new but Fate provides such an unique twist on them, that you dont know what to expect.  Plus, the characters are relatable yet sexy as hell. Another excellent collection.

"I bought Clarks Nubuck Slip-on Shoes w/ Elastic - HaleyMoon, 8-1/2 Medium along with this Tiger Q. Both fit like a dream and are so so comfy. These shoes have just the right amount of ""heel'. As far as arch support, I don't have bad arches but I can feel the shoe on my arch but the shoe doesn't seem like the arch area is higher.  I like the velcro strap and the closed toe. I could kick myself for tossing a similar closed toe sandal I had for years but now I have the comfortable Clarks(love all their shoes) to replace. Clarks seems to fit my feet.

"When I got this I wasn't sure if it was outdated or supposed to look the way it did, but I tried it anyways. I have been using for a couple weeks and have noticed that my hair above my lip has diminished some. I am hoping over time I will have to use this product less to see the same results. In my opinion this stuff should be used before bed or when you are just hanging out at home not expecting company. I say this because in my experience with this product, once I apply it my skin where applied is darker than where it isn't applied. Enough to make it look like I have a dirty face per say. I have used this on my top/upper lip area and have had the pleasure, or there lack of tasting this product after forgetting it was there. I do not recommend you try it, it's taste is awful. However since this isn't to be tasted or ingested - that factor doesn't matter regarding quality of product, just felt the need to share to beware to be careful when using. I am hoping that using this product will not only continue to help diminish the hair growth as a temporary but also I am in hopes that this helps keep the hair away at a more permanent level. I suppose in time I will know if this stuff has that ability. This comes in a extremely small container and a little goes a long way.

"I have a love for essential oils because they have a great use for a lot of things. Tea tree oil is used for things such as: elimination of toe fungus, assist with cutting down foot odor, soothing sores, to soften dry cuticles, makeup remover, relive athletes foot, and so many more. I like to use my tea tree oil for a few things such as an anti-bacterial to help with acne, be sure to mix no more than 2-3 drops with about 20-40 drops of witch hazel. Also take care when using this method because although it is being used to assist in taking care of acne, or preventing all together it can also cause your skin to dry out and cause your skin to react in a way to produce more acne. So be sure to pay attention to your skin. If it is seeming dry, then lessen your use of this method to 2x a week rather than every day. You'll know how your body works best with any situation, as long as you pay attention. Also be careful when applying to face if you will be exposed to sun, as it can potentially make your skin sensitive to UV rays - so be sure to use a sunscreen! I also like to add it to my shampoo (2-3 drops) to assist with healing dandruff issues.*I purchased this product at a discount for testing and review purposes, in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion based on experience with mentioned product.***NOTE*** My body's reaction may differ from another persons bodily reactions while using product.(The date my reviews are posted on Amazon, may not reflect the actual real-time date that product was reviewed at home)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJAS7IK1QJDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZF80T0I#wasThisHelpful","R1QJAS7IK1QJDV","A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had issues with getting a great nights sleep for almost 2 years now. I find myself waking a couple times in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason, leaving me feel tired and sore during the day following any given sleep cycle. In my experience after using this, I was actually pretty amazed at the sleep I was able to get.This product in my opinion can be taken during the day, and in my experience following the recommended dosing you can take up to 2x a day. On my first day of trying this, I had no responsibilities, no children, etc. So I followed the dosing recommendation. I say that because I was afraid with this being a sleep aid, that I may get drowsy if I took it during the day. I didn't know, it was my first time trying so I wanted to better of safe than sorry. I recommend anyone trying this product do the same process of elimination, due to everyone's body reacting different per product internally taken/ingested.After taking this product, 2x as recommended on the first day/night - I woke up in the morning when I was scheduled to. I didn't wake up in the middle of the night - and the funny thing is - I didn't even realize how great this product actually helped until that next afternoon when I went to take my day time dose. That is when I consciously said to myself ""Oh my, I actually slept through the night"", and then I took a moment to recognize that my body didn't feel as sore and unrested as it had in the past. It's funny how we generally only realize how our body feels when we are uncomfortable, rather than feeling great. Well that is how it is with me, and now when I take this product I am relieved to know I will sleep through the night, and wake feeling rested! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has insomnia issues, or issues with getting a good nights sleep.

"I just recently purchased a Smart LED TV, and noticed that most of the back connections are a lot different than that of an old fashioned TV. The Hdmi spaces were all new to me. I learned a little about it, and I'm always wanting more connector options for those just in case moments. In my experience with this 3 in 1 switch, it has made things easier for me in regards to when I need to connect something with Hdmi capabilities. You simply connect the main Hdmi chord to the OUT, and connect that to the TV, and then you can connect anything you want to send information from and into your TV to one of the 3 IN spots. In my opinion this makes things much less confusing for me and I can simply watch my TV, with these connected devices, without too much complication. This Hdmi switch does NOT come with hdmi chords, they must be purchased separately. I do recommend this item, for it's size which doesn't take up too much room, as well as it's capabilities of making things easier for hdmi, usage and control.***I purchased this product at a discounted price for testing and review purposes, in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion based on my experience with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXOMMGM76N98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHHT5SA#wasThisHelpful","R1NXOMMGM76N98","A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the feel of these tank tops! They are soft, and made of a material that prevents me from overheating on a hot day.They are nice clean, crisp and bright colors, and in my opinion they are one of the most comfortable I've ever worn, with a stretchable feel. In my experience with these, you can wear them either front or back - one side has a v-neck and the other is more u shaped. The tiny tag inside is removable without tearing the tank. In my opinion the only thing I would recommend while wearing is to wear with a sports bra because these tanks form around your curves as well as your bra. So it will show every bump, or line - especially if wearing lace. When I wore my lace bra, it looked as if I had two hydrangeas on my chest under my shirt. If you can picture that.

"This Orion Power Bank/Portable Charger arrived fully charged, which was great because I wanted to immediately put it to use, and my phone was in need of a charge. A few of the features on it that are rather pretty amazing are there are 4 lights to determine the charging capacity - If it is fully charged it will light up all 4 lights, 3 lights would be 3/4 way charged and so on. This is how you can determine when to remove from the usb charging port, and use as a charger. This also helps you determine how much battery life is left in it, while charging your device.The other feature that I find fascinating is you turn it on simply by a light touch and swipe across the arrows, in the direction of the arrows on the top. If it isn't plugged into a device for charging after powered on, it will automatically turn itself off. In my experience with this product, it takes a lot less time to charge my phone, than if it were just using a charger from a wall outlet. This is in my opinion a great feature, because I am not always able to wait too long for my phone to charge. I have tried other portable chargers like this and this is one of the very few that charge my phone up quickly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a portable charger that can charge your device in a snap. It is not too heavy and can be placed in a handbag for convenience. It comes with a usb/micro chord and has detailed instructions included as well.***I purchased this product for testing and review purposes, in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion based on my experience with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEV7H36X7PW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P06KOT6#wasThisHelpful","R3EEV7H36X7PW7","A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These masks are very moist, so be sure not to let any of the product go into your eyes, and in my experience it is definitely best to lay down while using.

"I have recently become a lover of wine and having this collapsible wine bottle in my possession has served as a great product to have. I watched the video explaining on how to fill properly and I believe that helped a lot. It is easy to fill, just simply start pouring a bottle of wine in. As it seems to get full, place the top back on, squeeze it to fill the areas that need filled. Take top back off, fill some more, and repeat previous process until the bottle is empty and your collapsible bottle is full. In my opinion it is easy to clean, and just air dry when done. I like using this when I am outside doing yard work, camping, or hiking.

"These are a great addition to decoration for any event that can be associated with either the purple color, or nature such as fairies, greenery, butterfly and dragonfly themes. In my opinion this product needs to be handled carefully, because the body of the dragonfly is easily bent and can rip off if moved too much. This product is delicate in form, as well as in nature. The light purple color, is very pretty, and it also has a little sparkle to the color. I also think this product could be used for a room for wall decoration, as in a DIY 2D wallpaper effect.

"I was so glad to have this delivered today. The first day of my workout routine, where my diet called for 2 smoothies and one meal. I appreciate the different attachments to this product. There are several options for blending. With 4 different blades to choose from and I've listed the following blades and uses to give a better you a better idea of what you can do with this hand blender.Blending Blade: used for blending batters for cakes, pancakes, muffins and more.Multi-purpose Blade: used for fresh or frozen vegetables, fruits, and shredding meat.Beater Blade: used to beat egg whites, creams, and pudding.Whisk Blade: used to stir milkshakes, salad dressings, soups or sauces.There are so many options and uses while using this slim hand blender as you can see above. I love the bottle too, it's BPA Free, and you can actually use the blender inside the cup, it fits in there with no problem, and can also be used to store the metal blender piece. The cup has measurements on it as well to use as a guide. It has a snap top, and a spring loaded place on the handle giving the option to clasp it to a bag, or something of your choosing to keep it close and visable. The bottle is very easy to clean, and there aren't any nooks and crannies where food or drink can get stuck so  you can't wash it out, and that is relief in itself. It's also nice to feel safe with what I am drinking out of, due to the BPA factor. The instruction guide also gives information on what each blades capacity of use is, i.e. Processing guide for Fruits and Vegetables at a quantity of 100-200g would be a blending time of 40 seconds, at High Speed. It gives a graph and breaks the options down to Food/Quantity/Blending Time/Recommended Speed - as I just gave an example of one above. Another great feature of this blender is there is no need to worry about the product overheating, because it will stop working when and if it becomes overheated. It does state that the on/off button will still stay on - and recommends to unplug and allow 15 or more minutes for the unit to cool down before attempting to you again. In my opinion, one of the many great things about this product is actually the little storage box that was included, it holds the different sized blades. This really makes this product great because in my experience of other products that I've owned that offered the same capacity, I have to admit the ability and extra's included with the others weren't as great as the extra's with this one and having a place to securely store the blades, is a big relief. No need to keep searching in a drawer for this or that blade. They are all secured in a little plastic box. You really should try it out for yourself. I can almost guarantee that you'll be glad you purchased this product. The customer service is also great, so if there is ever concern for interaction with the company - In my experience, I have been treated with respect and responses were rather quick - usually no more wait time than 24hrs. I definitely recommend this slim hand blender for personal use, or be the best gift giver of any occasion.

"5-HTP is a good supplement to assist with raising serotonin levels. A few years back I had a doctor explain to me that this was one of my issues, was that I was lacking serotonin. Serotonin plays an important role in controlling anger, aggression, body temperature, mood, sleep, human sexuality, appetite, and metabolism, as well as stimulating vomiting. In my experience with using this supplement (for over 3 weeks now) I have noticed so many different benefits. I have been so much happier, and more patient. Which is great with the fact that I have a family of 4 with children ranging from a 14 yr old drama queen, a 7 yr old who isn't too bad at this level, and a 4 yr old boy who's not afraid of anything, including pushing my buttons.

"Love, Love, Love this candle! I waited a couple days before using after it arrived because I have this thing that when I burn new candles I have to have the proper atmosphere as well as the time to be able to allow it to burn long enough to melt the top layer into a liquid. It actually is best if you can do this with any style or size candle. It allows for the candle to last longer and burn more evenly. In my experience with this particular Soy Wax Massage candle, I love the way it smells, not too over powering, yet subtle and nice. Using it as a massage wax/lotion is amazing. In my opinion it is hot to touch at first, but not any hotter than you would run your hottest bath water in comparison. Using the wax is on the skin is soothing and relaxing. The heat feels great on sore tired areas and the wax can be easily distributed all over the skin, much like a lotion. It actually leaves the skin very smooth and moisturized.

"This Beetastic Face Paint Kit is so much fun, and my kids loved it. They were so happy to be informed that ""Mommy"" had all the paint we needed to paint our faces. My 7 yr old is always asking me if we can go somewhere and get our face painted, and it's now a convenience and a relief that I don't have to leave home. In my opinion with this face paint, it is simple to use and easy to wash off. I've had some face paint that takes a lot of scrubbing to get off, leaving the face violated and red from pressing so hard when removing. In my experience with this particular paint kit, just using water removes any paint that is pretty fresh and for paint that has been on the skin for some time, mild soap and water using a cloth works well at removing the paint with no problems.  Some colors may be more difficult that others, but in general this paint is a blast to work with and clean up. I had taken pictures but am having issues uploading them from my device so I will post some as soon as I am technically able.Using the paint is pretty simple. Just lightly dip the brush in water, in my opinion - room temperature would be best. Then slide brush across the paint color you want to use and then onto the skin. The colors are bright, not faded, and apply pretty smoothly. The brush tip is small enough to get creative and detailed, but not too small that you can't see what you've painted. I think this would be a great birthday party addition, to include face painting in the mix.

"I have been looking to find a indoor water fountain since my cat caused my ceramic one to fall and break into pieces. It's been a couple years since that has happened. This Peaktop - Outdoor Garden in my opinion is perfect for indoor or outdoor use. I do not have a yard where I live, so I am unable to display it outside as it would not be valuable. I decided to display it inside, as my house needs some extra beauty and fountains are also good for ""Feng Shui"".In my experience with this fountain, I found it very easy to piece together and prep for use. The instructions were well written and understandable. Naming the steps in order and process. There are no extra tools needed when assembling, but I will say that the two suction cups that are mentioned in the instructions for the ""Lily Pad"" part of display, weren't in the package as mentioned. In my opinion this is not a huge problem, as I just very carefully bent the metal pieces underneath the lily pad display in a way that they help stabilize the display on the glass plate that holds the water. The suction cups on the metal stand in my opinion don't suction very well to the underneath of the glass plate because of the indentations from the design, and really work best for cushioning and assisting the plate from slipping/moving out of place. The pump works well and has an adjustment on it to turn the pump up or down depending on preferred water flow.I love the sound of the fountain as I go about my day at home, it's so soothing and relaxing. I have found that if I bend the metal spiral pieces on the underneath of the lily's I can cause the water to flow differently giving a louder water fall experience. I do that when I am alone, or not watching TV. Otherwise, I cannot hear the TV. In my experience thus far with this fountain, it has brought a sense of nature and peace into my home, where there wasn't as much present prior. I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone looking for something to liven up any area with some peaceful, water sounds.The glass decorative plate has beautiful pictures of butterflies. It is very colorful and accents my living space full of fairy items quite well!***I purchased this product at a discount for testing and review purposes, in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion based on experience with mentioned product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TXSDUYT9JF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6KP5CU#wasThisHelpful","R7TXSDUYT9JF2","A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely adore this ring set. I have always preferred Sterling Silver over Gold, and this ring is definitely sterling silver. It is marked on the inside of both rings ""925"", which is standard proofing of sterling silver for those who didn't know. In my opinion this ring is my new favorite piece of jewelry. I actually used to have quite a love for rings, wearing one to two on each finger. Now I just wear my wedding band on my left hand and this wedding band set on my right hand.I think the setting of the stones on the band are perfect and petite, which has always been my preference with rings. I don't like big and gaudy. and this is probably because I have small hands. The sapphire setting is beautiful, and perfect. At first I was a little skeptical of how the two rings matched up. The band lays lower than the ring itself, and looked odd to me. However after wearing it for a couple hours, showing it off, and continuously admiring it, I realized that if it were higher matching up exactly to the ring it wouldn't look right. In my opinion this is a perfect Wedding Band Set, and the price is affordable as well! I would and already have recommended this.

"These socks are perfect for yoga. I wouldn't recommend using as choice for normal sock wear, as they are not the kind to fully cover your foot on the top. In my experience with these socks, they fit comfortably and remain on my feet during my yoga sessions. They are very lightweight and I can hardly notice they are on. I regularly wear toe socks, and am way past the discomfort and weirdness of something in between the toes. So I recommend for those who are not used to the feel and want to break themselves in to toe socks slowly,  the RAE-YOGA Bamboo toe socks would be perfect starter socks for you! They fit well, not too big, not too small. They are soft and thin. The skid proof pattern on the bottom work well, but aren't too thick as to make your feet feel they are uneven when standing on them! I absolutely love the design on the bottom. I would recommend these RAE-YOGA Non Skid Antibacterial Bamboo Toe Socks to any one who needs a comfortable and safe way to practice yoga.

"I have a friend who has explained to me the importance of Organic Green Tea, and I have been trying and testing different kinds to see if they are actually of benefit. My friend and I had a conversation about my issues with energy and fatigue, and she told me that drinking Green Tea everyday should assist me with this energy issue. In my experience with Powder Green Tea, it was a difficult thing to get used to because I preferred the Green Teas you can purchase at the store, already made and mixed for consumption. In my opinion the hardest thing to get used to was the mixing of the powder properly to get the best result. I have practiced and tested, and think that I am now a pro at mixing. What I like about organic green tea powder, is the reality of getting the purest form of green tea for consumption. The taste is much different from the teas you would buy at the store, but in my opinion the taste is something that you can get used to if you can keep in mind the benefits. In my experience with this EatGreen Tea, I prefer to actually prepare it as if I'm preparing a hot cup of tea. This helps breakdown the powder quicker, and easier. I then add honey to it for taste and allow it to cool before drinking. I appreciate the effect it has on my body, and have notice a cleaner feel of energy.A convenient factor with this product is the availability of the recipe e-book provided, allowing me to test out different ways of use.* I received this product at a discounted price for testing and review purposes, offering my honest/unbiased opinion based on experience with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OEKQPU7QXM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN0OOVW#wasThisHelpful","R32OEKQPU7QXM5","A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R1VHQPNCZ9A1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love essential oils, and I have been testing out different types, as well as different brands for some time now. In my opinion this Pure Body Naturals brand is a brand that I am happy with at this time. In my experience with this particular peppermint oil, it has proven to be of good quality. The bottle it has been stored in is of dark color, allowing it to keep its purity longer, and expand the shelf life. I have learned that essential oils are stored best in dark bottles, to keep the light out. Light in a bottle can disrupt the oils properties and lessen it's value.I am satisfied with this because it is very potent, and has a long lasting scent. One must be careful with using this because of it's strong scent.I like to use my peppermint oil to combine with a carrier oil such as coconut oil, or almond oil to massage onto my sore muscles, or my temples for when I have headaches.

"I receieved my Lemon/Lime Squeezer the other day and I was excited to make my handsqueezed lemonade with it. In my opinion this product is made well. It is made of a sturdy, somewhat heavy (but not uncomfortable) form of metal (aluminum), instead of flimsy, easy to break plastic. This factor made an impression on me, because most lemon squeezers I've ever used were made of plastic, and if you had a tough lemon, it would comprimise it's durability after a couple of uses. This lemon squeezer, although I've only used it a couple of times, looks and feels durable and that it can withstand even the toughest of lemons. Another thing I liked about this lemon squeezer was the placement of the rubber cushion inserts. There is one on the top and the underneath of the bottom connecter. In my experience when squeezing, these two places were perfect to cushion my hand. I like this product, and will be enjoying my favorite summer time drink in a more old fashioned way now. Which is truly my most favorite way. Heck I may even carry this tool around on those days that I feel life has handed me lemons, just as a reminder!

"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and am happy to report that I have noticed my skin in the areas I have applied it, to be more firm, and nourished. I choose to apply this in the am after my shower, to allow for a deeper nourishing effect. Following a shower, my skin is still moist and in my opinion helps to distribute the product in a more thorough application. Almost as if my skin is drinking it in through my skin, if that makes sense. I also like to apply this at bedtime, for extra moisturizing and nighttime nourishment as my body goes into rest mode. In my opinion this product goes a long way, and as you apply continue rubbing in a circular motion until it is absorb on the surface. It is of a thick texture, and takes some time for it to be distributed into the skin due to this factor. I feel this may be the component that helps keep it feeling so nourished to begin with.I have the same suggestion for the breast firming creme - as it has helped tighten my skin and lift my breast, and in my opinion it has also assisted with diminishing my stretch marks underneath my breasts, where I lost some of my size after breastfeeding my children.

"I used this the other day in place of my exfoliator wash and I was so surprised with the results. I followed the instructions by spreading a layer of the mud mask onto my face, avoiding the eye and lip area. It suggested that I either wait until the mud dried or 10 minutes, whichever came first. In my opinion this waiting time, began to become slightly uncomfortable, and caused me concern that my face may be having a reaction. However with my experience after rinsing the application of mud off of my face, I believe that what I was experiencing was the effects of the mud pulling the toxins out of my skin. I say this because after rinsing and patting my face dry, and running my fingers across my face - I felt a smooth surface, and it wasn't or didn't feel as dry as it has in the past after an exfoliating treatment. I did however put a moisturizer on following my mud mask session, I am happy to say that I really loved how my skin felt following.

When I was offered to test these out for a discounted price in exchange for my honest/ubiased opinion and review, I knew I wanted to at least try and see if this would help me out in the area the product label suggests. I will be honest, I was skeptical because I am generally driven, and didn't understand how a simple supplement could help change that factor of my libido being low. In my opinion after using for about a month I will admit that I have noticed that my interest level/drive regarding sex has definitely improved.

I jumped at the chance to be one of the first people to receive a complimentary bottle of this supplement and have been thoroughly satisfied. My BF is the once actually taking it since I'm finishing up another brand at the moment. However, being someone who has never taken a Probiotic before, he went from apprehensive to being a believer.DOSAGE:1-2 capsules a day (50 capsules per bottle)INGREDIENTS:Propriety blend of Probiotics 25 Billion CFU (6 Strain Blend)(Vegetarian capsules)BENEFITS:Probiotics have more benefits than taking a multivitamin. 80% of your immune system resides in the walls of your intestine. Its our first line of defense against the external environment. Weight gain and obesity: recent study comparing two groups of women who had recently given birth. One group of women were on probiotics and the others was not. The group of women taking probiotics returned to their pre-pregnant wait much more quickly.

In fact over 90% of serotonin is manufactured in the walls of your intestine. If someone doesnt have a healthy gut, then they dont produce enough serotonin making him/her more predisposed to depression and anxiety.

Outside, underneath the large flap, you will find a medium sized, zippered pocket to put things like your car keys and such in. Inside the main zippered portion, you will find plenty of space to tote around your Tablet or Google Chrome. Additionally, there are two nice pockets for your smart phones as well as a zippered pocket for money, credit card and so on. All in all it's not only fashionable but quite practical.One last thing I would like to mention is that it's very gender neutral.

"First and foremost, I want to first state that I received this product from the company for review. So far, I think it's a really good product especially as a night treatment moisturizer. I like the way my face look when it's applied because it doesn't cause me to look ""oily"" or ""greasy"". That's a good result because I have extremely oily skin and struggle to find products that work with my skin type.PROS:-Smells clean ( nothing offensive or overly perfumed)-White colored cream penetrates into skin easily and leaves no film (dries clear)-Organic ingredients-Does not sting or cause any discomfort despite containing fruit acids-Makes skin extremely soft to the touchCONS:-My only issue so far has been with little whiteheads that appear the next morning after use. This is probably due to a combination of my oily skin and the product going into the pores. This my only reason for not giving this 5 stars.

"Okay, so if you're someone who has any kind of fitness lifestyle, you've most likely heard about this supplement. Typically, it can be found at Health and Fitness stores in both liquid and pill form. However, the problem is finding a pure product without a ton of fillers or sugar.

"This is one of the cleanest, purest and best tasting Hemp powders I've come across. That's a really high praise for this product since I typically stick with brands only purchased at Whole Foods.

Additionally, it's one of the only hemp powders that can be mixed with yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, etc. that doesn't change to taste.

"If you have oily skin and are in need of of good Vitamin C moisturizer that doesn't cause your face to look like an oil slick, this product for you. This serum is one of the only Vitamin C serums that comes out of the bottle basically clear and non greasy. Not only that but it disappears into the skin very quickly and leaves no residue or evidence of being applied.For me the real test came when I spent time running around in the Cali heat last week dreading how greasy I would end up looking. Much to my relief, this product delivered moist skin with no excess oil. In fact my face didn't stimulate excess oil production due to the Ferulic and Hyaluronic Acid. That's a very rare occurrence for me when it comes to serums or moisturizers. Truly, this is a great daytime serum for not only oily skin but other skin types due to the compounds such as Jojoba Oil which mimics the natural oils our bodies produce.

"UPDATE (8/27/15): I've reduced my score of 5 stars to 2 and here's why. When I posted my original review of this product after testing it for 2 1/2 weeks, I was certainly satisfied. However, roughly 3 weeks later, the headphones no longer work. The problem is the device no longer syncs with anything! And let me say, I've tried EVERYTHING!  I've been meticulously trouble shooting for a few days with no luck. Here's some of what I've attempted:1. Deleted it from all my blue-tooth device lists and re-synced2. Let the battery drain all the way and recharged the device and tried to sync to my devices3. Turned it on and off several times (testing it with various makes and models of smart phones, mp4 players, tablets and laptops) only to have sync failure.4. Gave it lots of time to connect. However, the device will state it's trying to sync but the light just blinks on and off for what seems like forever before finally turning itself off.I had to update my review because I don't want to mislead any consumers by keeping this development to myself. I received the product from the company in order to provide my honest feedback and I'm sticking to that promise.ORIGINAL REVIEW:_______________________________________________________________________________________Well, color me thoroughly impressed with this product to my own surprise.

"First and foremost, I've given the product 4 stars only because I haven't totally gotten rid of my slight cellulite on my thigh area yet (they've definitely softened and become less noticeable). Even though I weight train and CrossFit, I still have problem areas like all other women. Exercise greatly reduces problem areas due to muscle building and strengthening and is required in order to really see results. Additionally, exercise helps in reducing fat cell size, stimulate circulation and removing toxins from the body which are the main culprits of cellulite. So, if you don't eat healthy and have a fitness regimen, you can't expect this product or any other to work. There are no magic potions!That being said, this product is fantastic. From first use, I noticed the skin on the areas applied (glutes and thighs) were super soft and really toned in texture. The product comes in a cream texture and white in color which is different than others I've tried which have typically been gels. The active ingredients are Retinol and Caffeine which are known to be great in fighting cellulite.Since it is a cream, it's best to massage your problem area with a cellulite brush/roller after bathing and then applying the cream. You apply it like regular lotion and it does dry very quickly. Not only that, there isn't a strong scent so you can use it anytime of the day or night. Some other products have such a strong smell that I can only use them at bedtime. So far so good.*I received this cellulite cream from the company for review purposes","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FXU9HQRK115/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9DL9SW#wasThisHelpful","R38FXU9HQRK115","A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this product from the company for review.My mom actually took this item from me when my package came because of the ingredient list. So far, she's loved the product and states that she can feel the ""tightening"" or ""toning"" effect from first use. She's been consistently incorporating it in her regimen for 3 weeks now and has developed her own unique way of using it. First of all she doesn't have any wrinkles but there are some areas she was starting to worry about and has said she sees great improvement in said areas.My mom's Day time routine:1. She washed with a vitamin C or other skin firming cleanser.2. Uses her favorite toner with cotton pads.3. Applies Hyaluronic Acid serum and while skin is still damp, applies a nice thin layer of this product on face and neck.4.

"This mask is so moisturizing and is awesome as a once a week pampering treatment. It's a white, thick and creamy texture and a little goes a long way so don't be turned off by the size of the container. I've had 3 treatments so far and I've hardly made a dent in the product in the jar. You need to apply a semi-thick coating on your face (don't overdo it) cause slathering it won't make it work any better. I allow it to sit for 30 minutes in order to really penetrate my skin with all of it's active ingredients. I then wash off with lukewarm water. Once all the product is off, I make the water cold water to close my pores. While my skin is still damp I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum followed by a moisturizer.The results are a brighter, moist face with decreased pore size and the results get better with each additional treatment.Even though I have naturally overly oily skin and this mask has not caused any breakouts, over-dryness or other symptoms.

"I know allot of people have a hard time with this cereal but there are others who are able to eat it without issue. I'm of the latter variety, however, I do have to make sure that I don't exceed 2 servings a day due to the chicory root ingredient. Because it's such a high fiber product, some may find themselves experiencing stomach issues such as bloating, gas and other such side effects. It could be that they're not accustomed to a high-fiber diet or are just allergic to chicory root itself. This cereal is really delicious, filling and crunchy. Plus it alleviates a late night sweet tooth with ease.CHICORY ROOT FACTS: Chicory may provide direct functional support to the digestive reactions in the body. First of all, chicory root increases the flow of bile, which supports digestion. Because extra bile helps break down fats, chicory root may help optimize blood composition and is worth consideration by anyone seeking to achieve optimal liver and gallbladder health.Secondly, organic chicory root contains inulin, a soluble fiber that feeds digestive flora in the intestines. Many plants contain inulin, but chicory root has the highest concentration. Nourishing the healthy flora in the intestines enhances digestion. Furthermore, since inulin content is not digestible, the lack of glucose can help promote optimal blood sugar levels while also increasing stool bulk and consistency to help eliminate toxins efficiently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJGJZWZOMABV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5E08S#wasThisHelpful","RPJGJZWZOMABV","A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using several different brands of Power Line adapters for my rooms located far away from my DSL modem. The performances of these  adapters have been mixed with occasional problems including power line interference and dropped connections. The TRENDnet Power Line 1200 AV2 Adapter gave a pleasant surprise when I tried it out on my existing network. I was able to get it up and running within a few minutes by plugging one near the DSL modem and the another in my remote room. No setup, drivers, or software installation required. And it does not conflict with my other brand of power line adapters on the same electrical network.The next thing I did was to install the Power Packet Utility software which came with the product package. This utility allows us see the status, quality, and speed of the connected network. The quality registered was pretty good . However the speed registered about 120 Mbps, which was a bit lower than I expected. I also ran a speed test through the DSLreports site. The download speed was also a bit slower than my other range extender client router located in the same room. I would be expecting this power line adapter's speed to surpass that of the range extender setup. This could also attribute to the the electrical connection.Overall, I like this Power Line adapter as it is very easy to install, does not conflict with my other power line adapters,  and provides a stable connection to my remote room location.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Q8GCQ2F080B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7NJWOM#wasThisHelpful","R7Q8GCQ2F080B","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a long time user of a variety of dark circle / puffy eye cream products to fight my persistent dark circles. The fact is that there is no perfect cream or lotion that would completely eliminate the problems without proper diet and sleep care.

The eye cream has a smooth texture resembling those eye concealers. It adheres to the skin quite well for an effective application. After 3 weeks of continual use, I notice some slight improvements for my puffy eyes and dark circles.

"I purchased the ROBO 3D R1 Plus printer from a local electronics store. Spent a couple of days including hours of interaction with the Robo 3D support before I was able to get the printer properly calibrated and running. Here is a summary of my experience and impression of this budget 3D printer.Overall appearance and packaging- the printer comes in a nice attractive box packed in heavy foam materials. The package includes a tool box with the necessary tools for doing our own maintenance and lubrication. It also comes with a glue stick for the heatbed and a sample 300g spool of PLA filament. This is nice as this would get us going without having to buy the parts and materials.- what surprised me a bit was that the movable parts (x-axis and z-axis motors assemblies) were not well secured by taping materials to avoid shipping damages. For my other color laser printers which have similar weight and sizes as the Robo 3D printer, they came with all the movable parts secured by tapes with clear instructions on removing and unpacking them. To no surprises, I found that the Z-end stop brackets were popped out. A couple of wiring connectors and a 5-pin motor control connector all came loose probably due to shipping and handling. I had to contact Robo3D support and receive a video instruction on putting the Z-end stop brackets back into its place.Installation and software- The printers comes with a third-party software (MatterControl) on a SD card. Installation was pretty straight-forward. It also comes with a video instructions on assembling the printer.- The software comes with a load of features for controlling the printer quality, materials, and tuning / calibration. It also comes with a library of 26 ready to be printed 3D-models. The software shows the approximate print duration based on the materials, quality and complexity of the model. However, it does not show the remaining print time which could be very useful for monitoring the print status,- Once the print job begins, it would preheat the extruder and bed temperature before the actual printing starts. We can also pause or cancel the job anytime via the control panel.Operation- I started with printing the calibration circle model. To my dismay, the printer head's z-axis position was way high up from the heatbed and the printing turned out a messed up pile of dispensed filament. After searching on the web and support web site, I figured that the problem probably had to do with the Z-axis calibration. I also found that the wire connectors to the motors assemblies were not well secured and came loose quite easily- Fortunately Robo 3D had a nice support structure which allows us to book a 45 minutes appointment with a technician. The support personnel turned out to be quite knowledgeable and walked me through the calibration process over the phone. After the calibration, I was able to print the calibration circle perfectly. The calibration process was a bit tedious which should have been documented in the user manual or on the website.After the proper calibration, I did a couple of test prints which all turned out nice. Finally a happy camper.Overall- the Robo 3D is a nice budget 3D printer which can handle nice print volumes. There are quite a few rooms for improvements in their packaging, wiring assemblies, and calibration procedures. However, the support team is great and knowledgeable.  If you are mechanically inclined and don't mind to work through some tedious process to get the printer properly calibrated, this would be a good product to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WB19ZEL37RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142PHFVU#wasThisHelpful","R24WB19ZEL37RM","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It then moves on to cover the GUI and hardware interfaces. Rather than presenting the typical boring projects like blinking LEDs and spinning some motors, the book provides some interesting and fun projects such as a LED clock and an object avoidance rover robot.

"I have been using the Chamin brand toilet paper for many years. I did a side-by-side comparison of the Charmin Ultra Strong Toilet Paper with the Ultra soft version. The Ultra strong toilet paper is clearly tougher and works great particularly for general cleaning purposes in the kitchen. It also uses less space due to the small roll size and fits well with my toiletry roller.In terms of toiletry usage, I believe it is a matter of preference. The Ultra soft version provides a fluffier and gentler feel but it does use more sheets as compared to the Ultra Strong version.

As other reviewers have also shared, the  main down-side for this chair is the short un-padded arm rest.Overall, for its price, this task chairs is a good choice for home / office use with its nice cushioning and back support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0ZJZ6H7H74I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKE4TY#wasThisHelpful","R1X0ZJZ6H7H74I","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ziploc Space Bag works nicely for providing compact storage for comforters with its XL flat bag. The bags are very easy to use and seals well with an air-tight storage. There are no needs for attaching a pump to suck the air out as we can simply roll and press the bag to squeeze out the air pockets.  It stays in its compacted shape for quite a long time.The Ziploc Space Bag also works very well for packing clothes in a luggage for travelling.

"The National Geographic Walking Prague book comes just in time as I am travelling to Prague this month. I particularly enjoy self-guided tour on my trips as it gives us the flexibility and time to explore interesting places.The Walking Walking Prague book is compact (it measures 7"" x 5.25"") and fits nicely in my messenger bag. It is also categorized based on specific interests such as weekend travels, museum visits, church visits, musical places, and travelling with kids. The book provides a brief description on the place of interests and specific stops with colorful National Geographic's quality and stunning photographs. It also include numerous maps and information on places to eat. The back of the travel guide include travel essentials such as travelling tips, emergency contacts, hotels, and a brief language guide.The font size of this book is a bit small but it is certainly a nice handy tour book which I would consider bringing to the trip to Prague.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RO1MXGY0E42H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214707#wasThisHelpful","R1RO1MXGY0E42H","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own an Instant Pot pressure cooker which is a popular pressure cooker model. The Elite Platinum EPC-678SS MaxiMatic 11-Function pressure cooker provides very similar functionality as the Instant Pot for a lesser price. We can do pressure cooking, saute, steaming, slow cooking, rice cooking, and canning with delay start timer and adjustable cooking time.What I like more about this product is its ease of use with the numerous customized preset cooking buttons on the display panel. All we need is to press one button and the remaining process is pretty much automated. The user manual is well written and easy to follow. It is also packed with pages of well written cooking recipes covering meat, soup, sauce, salsa and jam. I tried the pressure cooker using the pork spareribs (about 3 lb in weight) recipe in the instruction manual. It took about 10 minutes for it to pressurize and 26 minutes to complete the cooking. The spareribs turned out very tender and juicy.There are a couple areas which the design could be enhanced. The top cover does get very hot during the cooking process (the lid includes a warning sticker regarding hot temperature). I believe it is due to the lack of insulation materials. The instant Pot's top cover  is a lot cooler in comparison. Another area is that there is no adjustment on the pressure settings. This might not be a big issue since we can adjust the cooking time to compensate for it.For those who are looking for a full functions pressure cooker for a reasonable price, this would be one to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29QFYWMBW1HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZJOGBO#wasThisHelpful","R29QFYWMBW1HW","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using the Foscam security camera with remote access for checking my indoor activities while away from home. This required quite some technical work to set up including port-forwarding configuration on my AT&T router. The FLIR FX is a lot easier to set up by simply plugging it in and installing the FLIR FX app. I was able to get it up and running within 5 minutes including the registration of the FLIR account for remote viewing.There are quite a few nice features which I like about this product particularly its ability to do a quick video review. This is very useful for visually checking a potential break-in when I received an alert from my remote alarm system. Here is a list of what I like about this product :- nice video quality with two-way voice communication- wide field of view with digital zoom (it does not support panning)- easy access to action and recording from the app- smart zone recording to avoid false motion triggers- various sensitivity adjustment including audio, motion, temperature, and humidity- built-in rechargeable battery for recording outdoor activities  (lasts for about 2 hours)- free cloud basic with limited 3 recap per month and 48 hours of event storage. For those who only wanted to use rapid recap for occasional events, this would be sufficeIt would have been nice if this camera supports remote panning.

"The  Acer Aspire Switch 12 is a nice choice for those looking for a larger sized touch screen notebook which can also be used as a tablet. I particularly like its versatile design with the detachable keyboard and smooth pivoting hinge which allow us to switch easily between the desktop , notebook, and display modes. The entire unit (with both the display and keyboard) weights about 3.1 lb. The tablet display itself weights about 2.5 lb.The Acer Aspire Switch 12 is thin and easy to carry around. It comes with 1 micro-USB 3.0 port, HDMI micro port, web cam, microSD card ready, and a stereo speaker. I would prefer to have more than 1 micro-USB port instead of carrying a USB hub to hook up multiple devices. The keyboard  is light and quite responsive. It also has a pointing stick for controlling the cursor. The touch screen operations are also quite smooth and sensitive. However, the display is not as bright as compared to the other touch screen laptops I am using. This also makes it a bit hard to read under bright sunlight.I installed my frequently used programs including the Microsoft office, video editing and photo editing software. The applications started quite quickly and they ran quite smoothly without glitches. Performance of the Acer Aspire Switch 12 is pretty nice indeed. I ran the full suite of the PCmark 8 home computing tests and get a evaluation score of 1988. This is quite a bit better than my Dell Inspiron 11 touch-screen notebook with the Pentium N3530 processor which scores 1353 on the PCmark. From the individual benchmark tests, the web browsing and video chatting tests also scored quite well and are comparable to the other laptops with higher end processors.Overall, this is a pretty nice versatile unit for multiple purposes with pretty decent processing power.

"The Miracle Gro Ultra Lite Hose is built with nice quality materials. Installation is easy and it fits perfectly to my garden faucet.There are a few features which I particularly like as compared to the other garden hoses I have used. It is noticeably lighter as advertised which makes it easier to maneuver  for watering our garden and washing our cars. The hose also stretches and extends nicely with no annoying kinking effects. And it performs quite well even with full water pressure.If you want a durable and easy to use garden hose, this would be a good selection to consider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338843L86P3HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6N9KI4#wasThisHelpful","R338843L86P3HH","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Linksys N600 PRO Wi-Fi Range Extender was pretty easy to set up for the first time. All we needed was to plug it in an outlet and use a tablet to the set up the extender. I measured roughly 15% gain on the signal strength of my existing Wifi network.The problem was that once we have it set up, there are no instructions on how to add another network or verify that the extender is functioning. I was not able to re-do the setup as the http address for the Linksys Extender set up was apparently no longer accessible. After playing around the unit for a while, I found out there was a small opening on the unit which allow us to do a reset by pressing it with a paper clip's tip. This allows us to re-configure and/or adding new Wifi connection. I also discovered that by using the Wifi Analyzer Android App, I was able the see both the original Wifi signal and the extended Wifi signal which confirms that the extender is working.I hope Linksys can improve the setup guide to reflect these steps and make it easier for the users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9IZWNL2CYD8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSSCAZE#wasThisHelpful","R9IZWNL2CYD8Y","A2WCFDOCS73PNB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WCFDOCS73PNB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Miele Compact C2 Onyx Canister Vacuum is well built and runs very quietly with its 1200 watt low-noise motor. Here is what a I like about this product :- very easy to set up with the parts snapped nicely together- telescoping wand for hard-to-reach areas- adjustable suction power with the rotary dial on the vacuum unit- one-button operated retractable power-cord- 3 replaceable filters system including the FJM HyClean  filter bag, dust compartable filter, and exhaust filter- easy access to the accessory tools with the accessory clip on the top of the telescoping wandI have tried the vacuum on various surfaces including carpet, hard wood floor, and sofa. It works very nicely and easy to maneuver around some tight spaces. There are a couple of slight drawbacks with this unit. The capacity of the FJM filter bag is about 3.7 quarts which would require more frequent replacement if we do a lot of vacuuming. The rollers on floor brush are a bit small which makes it a bit harder to move over heavy carpets.Overall, I like this unit a lot based on its compact size and built quality.

"The Kenwood KMC010 Chef comes in a large box with the mixer, blender, and food processor in separate boxes. The  main contents include :- 750W 4.9 Quarts mixer with whisk, dough hook, and K-beater attachment- glass blender with 1.2 liter capacity for hot ingredients and 1.6 liter capacity for cold ingredients- food processor with six blades for rasping, fine grating, coarse grating, thin slice, thick slice, and julienne.The mixer unit works quite well for making dough and the motor operates quietly. However, it lacks of a timer function as compared to the other mixer I am using. The unit is easy to clean and maintain. The instruction manual is pretty brief with some general guidance on using the K-beater, whisk, and dough hook.  There is no recipes guide / booklet.The glass blender attaches nicely on the top of the unit and works well for both hot ingredients and crushing ice. The stainless steel blade is removable for cleaning. The food processor's blades are well made with good quality materials for the lid and bowl. The parts are also dish-washer safe.This product is quite compact and is great for the kitchen lovers.

"Buddy Reynolds has written an excellent book.This is not an autobiography, but rather a series of chapters about different people in his life (Betty Davis, kids from high school and college).  This allows him to tell his own story in an indirect fashion, Bert through the years with people he admires, or just wants to tell us about.  The writing is smooth, entertaining, pithy, and wise.  He does not shy away from any element of his past, and there is a direct honesty when he tells about people, their foibles, faults, generosity, and brilliance.As a result, this is a very good book!

"The Turtle Beach Earforce 50x headphones have a great build quality and feel nice around the ears. They're a little tight fitting, but that shouldn't be a problem for most consumers.My two main complaints are that of compatibility and audio quality. Because the 50x works through a single 3.5 mm audio cable, I was required to buy an adapter in order for it to work with my gaming PC. Music, Netflix, and games sounded slightly muffled and less clear through the 50x when compared to my older pair of Turtle Beach x12s. The x12's mic was also the cleaner and clearer of the two.In closing, I would highly recommend the Turtle Beach Earforce 50x to console gamers, and would advise PC gamers to look for a better alternative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28MTKGAXQBXLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5U40#wasThisHelpful","R28MTKGAXQBXLY","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The approach, focusing on the normal kids on the sidelines of the superhero fight, lost him.  The style lost him.  The slow start lost him (Dad, the 5 characters they throw at you in the first pages were all limp).Me, who has read tons of YA fiction over the years, to help find him good books to read, liked this quite a bit.  The main characters -- Mikey, etc -- face real problems with their personalities, the limnal edge of leaving high school, all with superhero stuff as a backdrop.

Did Cal Henderson's Mom really kill most of her family?  The two boys, now men, pursue the truth, amidst complications.The narrative is choppy, reads like a series of briefs, is sometimes too explanatory and not enough doing, too much telling not enough showing.  The writer fleshes out the scenes with a completeness that removes the crackle of suspense.  There is not a sense that the author really knows what a psychologist does, and the clich of a beautiful secretary, carried over from detective novels, does not work here.This is a swing and a miss.

"This is not ""The Water Knife"".  This is more ""The Water Collander"" -- a narrative thread that wanders, a story that is not engrossing, characters that are indulgent, writing that is awkward and uneven.We are in the middle of dystopia pornography, a sub-branch of the pornography of death, an era where every aspiring author has to have one novel about the end of times.  Thirty years ago, every author had to have an incest moment (Think ""A Thousand Acres"".)This one by Claire Watkins is set in the Southwest, land of swimming pools, dry in a drought at the end of times.  We have Luz and Ray and a baby and a group of people trying to survive, told in a mildly convoluted and entirely unconvincing style, without verve, without spark, without the kind of writing that crackles.  The result is dis-spiriting.As the relationship develops, the drought and the travel serve as a metaphor... wait, wait, do I need the drought to be a metaphor for a dying relationship between Ray and Luz?

And ending in which the crazed cop argues the skeptical ship's captain into magically thwarting the combined forces of all other plants, hundreds of bombs, all to save the life of an alien-consumed girl who might not exist.  And they pull this off, because that is what the author wrote they did, common sense be damned.Yet, see, I don't have to buy book two if book one ends so stupidly.

"I gave this book to my son.He started by calling this weird.  Then he started reading passages out loud to us, commenting on how brilliant and weird they were.  The book, about a young man on a ship on the way to explore the challenger deep, is a metaphor on stilts, a whirling storm of images, from talking 6 foot tall parrots to a ship that is alive.  The metaphorical storm carries along the descent into self, into depression and anxiety, that the young man suffers.I enjoyed the book, my son now loves the book.

"The science of matching -- from kidney donors to college bowl teams, from residencies for doctors to school selections -- is part art and part design, and the master of this field is Alvin Roth.  This book outlines the cornerstones of making a matching system work, from thickness to safety, aspects of matching systems that keep cheating, unraveling, and relative advantage from eating a matching system alive.Using examples from his work, and that of his students, Roth shows that design is possible, that analysis of broken or unraveled systems can yield fixes.This is pretty exciting stuff, because we all live and choose within matching systems, where price does not create a demand and supply curve, but rather choice sets create a ""game"" that can be ""gamed"" -- and that can be made workable.  This book shows how.The book is written at an undergraduate level, and the author seems to be a bit vague in the initial third, where he sets his terms.  He is also a little light in describing his solutions, lacking some technical detail.  I would suppose that he gets paid for his real analyses, and this is for more popular reading.That said, it is a heartening read, because it shows what good analysis and design can do, to assure both fairness and efficiency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBBU2P7KCYDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544291131#wasThisHelpful","R2UBBU2P7KCYDN","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best fantasy novels of the year.  The story of a telegraph clerk (Thaniel) in London, 1884, during a series of bombings.  He makes friends with a Japanese watch maker.  There is a mystical but very understated connection between the two.  He meets a woman, Grace, a scientist, feminist, brilliant character.  The story weaves magical themes, Victorian England, Japanese culture, watches, bombings, suspense, adventure, real character depth, tantalizing clues and a mystery.The book comes to center on an impromptu, surprising, and yet emotionally complex triangle between the central three... I did not entirely see this coming, but it made great sense and was a bit nerve wracking... good writing!This is a very fun book to read.  The octopus alone is worth the price of the book.

"The islands of Dara are united under a single Emperor.  The Emperor is not universally liked.  His son ascends to the throne in what is a civil war, or a war of dis-unification.  There are airships and air combat, and there are Gods who watch and sometimes intervene.  Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu are two main characters, weaving banditry, rebellion (Garu) and the aristocracy (Zyndu) into an attempt to create a sweeping epic that will take multiple volumes.This book requires an investment that will take far more than the 600 pages of the initial volume.  So, a reader needs patience.  I found the pace and the complexity slowed my enjoyment the more I read.  The problem is that this is sort of a King of Thrones and sort of an Initiate Brother, in scope and in complexity, but the middle passages make me begin to nod off...So I tried to re-kindle my interest, and get into the kingdom of Dara as a setting, and that helped -- island warfare, airships, swords and factions.

"Finally, a well written straight forward biography of one of the most interesting men of the late 20th.Like most who came of age during the Carter-Reagan years, I learned of these men through a filter of hate -- sometimes for Carter, often for Reagan.  Our national media is a disgrace, moving right past the story to the vitriol, President after President.This book tells the man's story, from his youth, to his death.  The writing is clear and informative, and the author shows the man, not the myth.  The result is a good book about a great man.Note I did not say a perfect man, or an icon, or a saint.  Those would be boring books to read.  I have read Morris, and I have read Noonan, and this book betters both by far, and adds a clear eye.

I did not like Reamde, because in the end the scope of the story did not support the length of the novel.  Whether I was right on that, or not, this (Seveneyes) is a big, epic, very cool book.

"Oliver ""Boo"" Dalrymple is a pale kid born with a hole in his heart.  He dies, and awakes in a town populated by other thirteen year olds who have died.  They are in an afterlife, which is a challenge to a kid who is an atheist and a science guy.  A friend arrives -- Johnny Henzel.  It turns out that their deaths involve a mystery.This is a well written, funny, interesting, challenging, and wonderful book.  The lead personality is an interesting character, and the story is both lively and challenging.  Short, funny, a great book for your teen, and suspense filled.  The main mystery -- who shot up the school, killed Boo and his friend -- takes the reader into some very dark places.  We are dealing with murder, suicide, school bullying, a Lord of the Flies atmosphere, teen justice.  The author handles these deep subjects with sensitivity and some depth.I was sad when I finished this book.  Without giving anything away, Boo is both a fascinating character, and a sad character.  What kids do to each other can be very dark, very sad, and what we do to ourselves more so.  But this book is, on balance, a positive story, one that is compelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZSU9FI6NKY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417136X#wasThisHelpful","R2NZSU9FI6NKY6","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fold centers on Mike Erikson, a local every day guy who is also a genius.  Asked by a friend to evaluate a device that a team of ""government scientists"" has developed, that promises teleportation, he uses his mental alacrity, which he describes as ""ants"" that help him analyze, to unfold the problems with the technology, and the hidden secrets that threaten human existence.I thought this book weak.  The book has a lot of dialogue, and the author lacks crackling wit.  Instead, people talk and talk and the conversations are developmental, rather than interesting in their own right.  The metaphor of ants is also lazy, because it is essentially magical -- rather than write a Sherlock, the author has mental ants ""think"".  At one point, the author has the ants working overtime, when instead would it not be more fun to have a main character who actually thinks?  And a writer who can describe logical analysis?The ""ants"" seem to be a simple method of categorization, a mental cross-tabulation of sorts, the most simple form of ""thinking"" any reasoned person can do...  The author describes this process as a rather magical act, the opposite of ratiocination, and thereby removes any grounding for a description of the main character as ""brilliant"".  He is not brilliant.  His ""ants"" are able to somehow lead him to leaps in logic that are magical, ill-described, and insulting to the reader.  Has the author ever figured out a difficult problem, from fixing a car to doing an algebra equation, and if so, why can he not simply describe this process, of thinking?Here is a quote:  ""The ants leaped into overdrive.  They counted and catalogued and quantified.  They gave him more details then he wanted to know.""  At this point, I began to wonder if the author meant that the main character actually had ANTS in his MIND, which is GROSS.  Or if his inability to have a main character think, and do things like organize thoughts, collate data, and make leaps of logic meant that we were all going to have to suffer this lame, gross, disgusting, and lazy substitute for decent writing.The author has problems with dialogue --- ""Sasha let out a string of f---s"".  Nice writing.  Nice mouth on that character. Is this the ""poetic"" writing I was lead to expect?The book is mildly inappropriate, for younger teens, and the shoot em up adventures are wooden.  The broad scope -- multiverses, bug creatures, etc, meant to be an exciting homage to 1950s science fiction, I suppose, actually comes across as wooden, poorly plotted, and sort of dumb.  Not an exciting book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHY17YYEO32F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418297#wasThisHelpful","RHY17YYEO32F7","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Larsen is hoisted by his own petard, reviewed by his own words.  At one early point in this story of Radar Radmanovic, a child born black with strange abilities, to a white family, the author has Charlene, Radar's mother, discuss Dickens.  Interlarded literary comment and pointed literary homage are a tool for this writer - and at this point he has characters note that Dickens himself creates characters like robots, who then go off within the book and do things... each a sort of distanced authorial automaton.That is Radar.  That is Charlene, his mother.  That is a description of all of the characters in this over-written, boring, wordy, precious, and cold book.  A different reviewer referred to the comic aspects of the book.  I did not get it.  Not a laugh.  This is a writing exercise metastasized into a novel of great length, by a writer who seems bent on characterization and inventiveness to the exclusion of pace, or compelling story.A case in point -- the life story of Charlene, through drug addiction to Radar.  This reads like a writing exercise in a junior college writing class... create a backstory for your major characters.  Fine, but did this have to plop down within the book, or could an editor have helped?  And the story -- tergiversations of preciousness!  Leaving the reader to mutter -- who cares, who cares, who cares.I could go chapter by chapter (although skimming did start to happen).This is built to win a book award.

"Some books require that you review the ending, in order to encapsulate what the book is all about.  This is one, so I will warn for spoilers below.First, this is a really good read.  Two alien races are fighting, and the border in their war brings Earth into the battleground.  Both are far superior to humans -- we are ants.  Human beings are nearly extinct, and the war between the Gorgons and Cyphers (our names for them) is showing signs of making humans collateral damage.Into this steps Ethan, a boy, who connects with a surviving band of humans.  What is Ethan?  Are his developing powers rational?  What role is he playing?  This is a mystery, as is the purpose of the war, and much else.  This mystery includes a goal, the ""White Mansion"" which they must find.This is well written, horrifying in detail, and you cannot put the book down.  There are humans working against Ethan, and they are particularly horrifying.Why the 4 stars?SPOILERS:The author loses it in the last 75 pages.  We are gifted with a political exchange between a closed minded chief of staff and a demented President.  We are gifted with a new, extraneous goal, to go to Area 51, and retrieve a mcguffin, a trinket that will save the Earth.  Ethan, who had huge powers, becomes a passive victim.  The author wrote himself into a box canyon, and rather than the huge payoff that the tantalizing mystery invites, we get everything thrown at the wall, in hopes something sticks.This is close to being a really really good book.  Some may find the end less scattered than I do, and less contrived.

The writing is interesting, but your enjoyment will turn on whether the main character wears you out, with his slow relation of what he knows and learns, and his cornpone speaking style.I enjoyed this at first, but the murders never really terrified me, and so I call it just OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZ7WFYU0AI5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544308271#wasThisHelpful","R3DZ7WFYU0AI5Y","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an intelligent book about an intelligent analysis.  Charles Taylor is opaque, at times -- we can be fair.  I am a smart cookie, and I know that there are many many smarter people than I, but to read Mr. Taylor can be heavy, rewarding lifting.This book takes a simple, direct, but learned approach to understanding the Secular Age, the analysis behind it, and the book about it.Understanding, for example, that the transformation from enchanted and transcendent world, triple embedded within what Henri Bergson called a dynamic morality, to a secular world -- understanding that it is a  subtraction story we are told, informs the reader and characterizes what is read in the larger book and theory.  How nature was seen by religious people as an accessible way of worshiping, but combined with nominalism to yield a secular nature that we now worship without God -- this is a zigzag to humanism, not a simple peeling away of God and religion.Yet this book, written directly and fairly, is not itself easy; nominalism/realism debates and Dun Scotus are not 9th grade conceptual tools.  I would say that this is a high hill, from which one can more clearly climb the mountain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGFW0LNLHYWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802867618#wasThisHelpful","RGFW0LNLHYWM","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was intense -- a re-visit of Harry D'Amour, detective of the creepy, and his quest/investigation of the Scarlet Gospels.  Barker is a far better writer than Steven King; this book combines genres, is actually pretty short, and made me constantly look up to see if someone else was in the room.The face-off here between Pinhead and D'Amour is cheesy (high compliment.)  Specifically, most novels with a demon from hell and a detective are, ineluctably, cheesy.  Barker makes it easy to suspend the disbelief and ""get into the story"".  Result: chills.Here is one trick.  An opening scene involved 5 highly corrupted wizards, who have a final face-off with a demon from hell.  (Are you snickering yet?)  Fear is created by having the 5 characters be fearful, terrified, cringing.  Then horrible things happen to the 5.  Icky stuff.  I think that the author combines the fearful and the horrible to create a sensation on the part of the reader...basically, a feeling that this is terrifying, scary, death is imminent.If you like this stuff, here it is, by the bucket, and fairly well done.  If you cannot suspend, you start snickering...","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115WURNJY7NSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055806#wasThisHelpful","R115WURNJY7NSF","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well thought out alternative dystopian war with verve.Water.  Drought.  The western United States has become a war ground over water, with legal rights enforced with armed National Guard troops, and the United States being at best a federal alliance of partners.  California is the big dog, the armed satrapy.  This is the story of the enforcer for the Las Vegas/Nevada power bloc, and the events surrounding the drying up of the west, the rise of California.  This is a dystopia where technology still works, people are still smart, zombies do not run the world -- but the turning of a tap can destroy people, cities....Angel Velasquez is the main character, a combination soldier, private detective, and right hand man for the leader of the arcology.  He is an interesting character, with a kind of pride, compassion, internal violence, and drive.  He is somebody you want to read about.  He intersects with two women, both very well written.And this is a thirsty war.  Water is life.  The fight is for rights, senior rights to Western waters....Google the Ogallala Blue.  Read about that aquifer.  The scarcity of water is going to happen (and not just water, but clean water).  This is a great hook for dramatic fiction, a better dystopia than so many others, because it has elements of reality.Believable?  Sure, but who cares.  What makes this good is the story, the characters, the writing.  I have read too many dystopian fictions this year (everybody has one, or three).  This is a fine novel and a great story... Very violent, but the characters resonate, and that justifies the violence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D4HCJ8QBE53J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352875#wasThisHelpful","R2D4HCJ8QBE53J","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So sad.This is a pretty OK book, but everyone is writing end of the world books, and therefore this is just another, a clog in the huge pipeline of cliche'd jejune end of the world metaphors.  Dog Stars?  Check.  The Road?  Check.  Alas Babylon -- which my kid read for a 7th grade assignment --check.The cleverness here is a post-apocalyptic recreation of the Lewis and Clark journey, this time through post-apocalypse America, with ranting rabid (bitter clingers) trying to hurt our heroes (Lewis and Clark), as they seek a promised land.  Metaphor much?The depiction of the post-apocalyptic society is also cliche'd, with the bubbas in the interior falling prey to the repressive dystopian society that is the fantasy all progressives have about middle America -- that we are will devolve into the beastly persons we essentially are, without elite guidance.  This theme has been done, again and again, and here it is boring.  Some other reviewer mentioned Canticle for Lebowitz.  I mentioned The Road.  Another reviewer dislikes large vampire bats.  See how nuanced we are getting in our comments on dystopian fiction -- could it be that there is too much of it?There was an old Sterling Lanier cheesy novel, Hiero's Journey, and it was a better post-apocalyptic novel than this....As a first start, any author telling these stories has to realize that he/she is an unoriginal writer, at least of this book and this topic.  This example is alarmingly unoriginal.These books have to climb a ladder.  First, are they a good adventure?  This one is so so, with a tone of creepiness... a bit of a horror feel.  Second, are they good metaphors, for America today?  Third, do they have something interesting to say about the human condition?  Finally, after all of that, are they still a fun story?This one is sort of preachy, feels sort of half-smart, half self-satisfied, and the story wears on you.  Bring on the next post-apocalypse novel.  I hear The Border may be good?Tired of vampires, zombies, and magicians?  How about a binge on post-apocalyptism.  These books are all un-original.

"This is the 5th Patrick Lee book I have read, and all 5 have a place on my shelves.He has a knack of writing adventure fiction that includes high tech, and radical plot twists that make sense within his plotting.  This is the 2nd Sam Dryden novel, and I read it entirely late into last night.This one involves a friend who has a technology that gives a brief glimpse into the future, and the ways that this is attractive to a specific, shall we say Germanic element of the military-industrial complex.  Dryden is a fun protagonist, and Lee makes a point in writing within the rules of the situation, which makes the adventure sensible and fun.This story requires Dryden to exercise his particular ability, which is to grasp the reality of the situation quickly, and act, rather than to ponder.... yet to calculate and think, when things slow down.  He is a two speed action guy.As a quibble, I think that a bit more time should be spent on Dryden's life, his personality, just a few pages.These are great fun, if there was a prescription service to purchase every Patrick Lee novel, I would sign up, and so should you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHUCU4NXFMSDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030781#wasThisHelpful","RHUCU4NXFMSDE","AIWDGRTLV7IQF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIWDGRTLV7IQF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on a true story, ""Backcountry"" follows a couple very much acquainted with city life going for a camping trip in the woods. Alex (Jeff Roop) has something very special in mind for his girlfriend Jenn (Missy Peregrym); The Blackfoot Trail is something Alex insists Jenn has to experience. The couple continues towards their destination without a map or a cell phone even though it's the end of the season and getting caught in the area could lead to a hefty fine. Unfortunately for them, Alex accidentally leads himself and Jenn into the clutches of a very angry bear that is also extremely territorial. A romantic getaway becomes a desperate battle of survival.Alex and Jenn are seriously one of the most annoying film couples ever. Alex is a bit of a conceited douche as he constantly harasses his girlfriend and lets his macho demeanor call all of the shots, which he eventually regrets. Meanwhile Jenn is mostly superficial and clueless. She invites a complete stranger to dinner without even considering how awkward it might be. An Irish tour guide named Brad (Eric Balfour) seems to play a character similar to Ralph in the first two ""Friday the 13th"" films; Brad is really creepy, awkward, and weird but his eccentricity never leads to anything and his little introduction is mostly meaningless.The film's big moments are widely predictable as you can clearly see where not having a map, refusing a guide, and not having a means of communication is headed long before it's eventually revealed. Alex seems to frown on any sort of preparation as he groans at the sight of bear mace and a road flare in Jenn's bag. Wanting the trip to be authentic is one thing, but throwing away your first aid kit or purposely leaving your phone in the car is like walking a tightrope without a safety net; there's a chance you won't fall and your moment of grace will be immortalized with the greats, but you'll be thanking the heavens when that net saves you from becoming a chunky puddle on the asphalt.One of the best moments of the film is when the bear is sniffing around the couple's tent undetected while they sleep. Hearing the bear and seeing it press its nose into the fabric of the tent is far more terrifying than the silly bloodied shaky bear head you see later. The other completely satisfying moment is Alex's gruesome encounter with the bear. The camera work is deliberately shaky for ""realism"" and everything becomes so out of focus that it begins to make you nauseous. The dramatic thriller seems to leave itself wide open for riffing, as well; especially after you see where the bear has been sleeping.""Backcountry"" has long stretches of dialogue that highlights arguing between Alex and Jenn, which results in writer/director Adam MacDonald feeling like he attempted to go for a ""Wolf Creek"" kind of formula for the film with three fourths of the film being devoted to character development and the horror mostly taking place in the last half hour. This method backfires and immediately makes the film feel tiresome. Monotonous and foreseeable with spastic choreography, ""Backcountry"" is horrific for all of the wrong reasons.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GSOPCTRHK6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYKXY54#wasThisHelpful","R30GSOPCTRHK6J","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""White Haired Witch"" is a title that is seriously misleading. The film is loosely based on a novel by Liang Yusheng, which was serialized in the late 1950s. This is more of a romantic journey with fantasy elements and a miniscule amount of action than a martial arts spectacle. Visually, the film sometimes features impressive special effects that are both optically pleasing and engaging like the opening credits which contain colored dye in water thats almost smoke-like and goldfish composed completely of CGI that swirl together to form a yin yang. However these moments almost feel like they're accidentally stumbled upon. Most of the time, green screen effects are extremely noticeable and hokey since the terrain is obviously quite fake or backgrounds are obviously painted on some sort of canvas to substitute a beautiful mountain top. The computer generated effects are so polished and extravagant that they look even more out of place than they should in comparison to everything else around them.The wire work in the film is done to a ridiculous extent and is what usually gives wuxia a bad name. People pull off standing backflips without any momentum whatsoever, go head over heels up to six times, and land on horseback like they actually planned such an absurd maneuver. The ""white hair"" part of the title doesn't even come into play until the last ten minutes of the film. All of the best action is in the last half hour, as well. These action sequences are also the best moments of the film in general. The martial arts choreography is just very old school in execution and presentation with dynamic angles and dramatic stare downs. It's just a shame that first time director Jacob Cheung Chi-Leung decided not to feature more of what made ""White Haired Witch"" semi-enjoyable for a very short period of time.The storyline is massively convoluted and has four or five side plots that legitimately don't go anywhere. The romantic relationship between Lian Nishang and Zhuo Yihang seemingly comes out of nowhere. Lian's solitude lies within Fort Luna and when all of Fort Luna falls ill with a plague, Zhuo steps in claiming to know medicine, risks his health for three days, and the next thing you know Zhuo and Lian are having shirtless picnics together. Lian was also raised by wolves and ""speaks their language,"" but that never proves to be useful whatsoever.Jin Duyi (Zhao Wenzhuo) is the cause of corruption in the film yet his only desire is to be a warrior like his brother who makes his family proud. A man investigating whether or not Zhuo Yihang should be brought into custody or not protects a little girl throughout the film only to leave her alone and then regrets his decision moments later. What makes ""White Haired Witch"" so unbearable is that the relationship between Zhuo and Lian is milked out so much. The point is slammed into your face over and over again that the two love each other, but nothing ever really comes from their longing for one another.Love conquering everything seems to be what they're aiming for with ""White Haired Witch,"" but apparently that means overthrowing the laws of physics and logic as well. The last scene of the film sees Zhuo and Lian falling off of a cliff together. They embrace and float off into space. The credits roll after that and fighting the urge to throw your television remote through the wall will ignite you with more passion and desire than anything actually featured in the film. It's bad enough that the White Haired Witch basically plows through stone walls like the Juggernaut and that the entire memory wipe sequence is a complete waste of time, but it's as if the film itself doesn't take itself seriously when it ends on such a ludicrous note.""White Haired Witch"" is a tale of romance and corruption, but it's one that's been told better and more efficiently dozens of times before. The performances are stiff and uninspired, the storyline is complete trite, the awkward special effects stand out like a sore thumb, and everything is just so elongated and redundant that a couple of decent action scenes won't save an hour and a half of complete boredom","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRI3A3NIYCLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QLM5KPG#wasThisHelpful","RPRI3A3NIYCLV","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg has completely shifted gears from the sci-fi, horror, genre-hopping, practical effects utilizing director we've all come to grow and love in the 80s and 90s. That peculiar and unpredictable quality is still there, but the horror is gone; at least in the traditional and prosthetic sense. Cronenberg is much more interested in being behind the camera for a film showing how scary the average human being can be. The human psyche can be so warped, twisted, and demented over the span of an adult (and sometimes teenage) lifetime that little needs to be done in the form of special effects. All that is required to showcase such horrific individuals is the proper spotlight and David Cronenberg is the man willing to give it to them. After nearly 50 years in the director's chair, this is what Cronenberg has evolved into and these are the monsters he wishes to showcase.""Maps to the Stars"" follows a wide variety of eccentric characters that could be considered monsters by anyone's standards. At the center of it all is Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), a troubled individual who started a fire when she was much younger. She moved to Florida to get help and has come back to Los Angeles now that she's in the rehabilitation process to make amends with her family. Agatha's 13-year-old brother Benjie (Evan Bird) is currently attempting to stay sober and is the childhood star of the ""Bad Babysitter"" films. Their father Stafford (John Cusack) is a novelist and therapist and their mother Christina (Olivia Williams) is Benjie's agent. However the Weiss parents seem to be hiding something big they don't want anyone else to know.Meanwhile, Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore) is an actress having a difficult time finding work. She's dead set on getting a part in a remake of a film her mother was in even though the part has already been cast. Havana is frequently taunted by her mother, Clarice Taggart (Sarah Gadon), despite Clarice passing away in a fire years ago. Havana, who has the same agent as Benjie and goes to Stafford for therapy, hires Agatha as her assistant. A limo driver named Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson) is an aspiring writer and actor that Agatha attaches herself to.There seems to be this convoluted message that never fully materializes in ""Maps to the Stars"" that involves fame and popularity. Famous people obsess over what they think will better themselves like their next part, their contract, how much they'll get paid, or throwing a better party than someone they know. The average working individual is infatuated with celebrities in absolutely every way. ""Maps to the Stars"" claims that those are the only two types of people in this world or those are the only ones that stand out in a sea of regularity.Both sides of this spectrum are heavily dependent on medication or some sort of multi-level program. This seems to signify that everyone needs something to keep them sane and/or functional. There is also this really ugly side to stardom that involves brutally gossiping about your competition whether they're a friend of yours or not. It's as if the mindset is that there isn't enough room for everyone at the top, so you might as well step on, kick the face of, and stomp through all of them before somebody else beats you to it.The unsettling and disturbing factor resides in Agatha's worshiping behavior towards movie stars and Havana's weak-willed demeanor which is needed just to cope with her popular status. Havana's therapy with Stafford is weirdly sexual without the two of them ever being naked. There's a sex scene involving a threesome where you get to admire or be sickened by Moore's extremely long nipples and Jonathan Watton's uncircumcised member. These people who are supposed to be beautiful for film are partaking in this sexual act that is neither sensual or attractive in the slightest. ""Maps to the Stars"" revolves around characters who are attempting to rediscover whatever made them human to begin with because they feel empty inside and have possibly never felt empathy.The film soon spirals out of control as this world implodes since every player is even more heartless and egotistical than the next. In an unusual way, ""Maps to the Stars"" feels like a pseudo or indirect sequel to ""Cosmopolis."" The two films feel like they take place in the same world despite Robert Pattinson switching seats in the limo between the two films. Human desires are typically very selfish and that's the combustible fuel that powers this film.The unfortunate aspect is that certain things don't add up on a first viewing. There's some sort of connection between Havana's deceased mother, Agatha, and Christina but it's difficult to piece together. The dream Agatha has and her relationship with Benjie are obviously very significant and yet the ending feels a bit too anticlimactic. Something extremely taboo is also a focal point of the Weiss family, but it just comes across as bizarre and weird. Maybe the film will make more sense with repeat viewings. On one hand, it feels like we have another ""Southland Tales"" on our hands but one viewing of the film leaves you with so many unanswered questions.""Maps to the Stars"" is a very complex piece of work. David Cronenberg has successfully created more challenging cinema for people to attempt to wrap their heads around. The film certainly makes you think as your brain tries to unravel everything this violent and bizarre film has introduced. The characters are intriguing, complicated, and completely tainted in the eyes of society, but this eccentric group is each fighting and clamoring over each other for their fifteen minutes of fame. ""Maps to the Stars"" may just be a brilliant film that is trying to tackle too much. Its tangled narrative is more convoluted than it should be, but there's just enough there to entice and worship in your own way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POXC0CY0RRNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5DYSHE#wasThisHelpful","R1POXC0CY0RRNK","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What this comedy lacks in budget is more than made up for with its ingenious writing. This is a group of characters consisting of individuals who are completely different from one another. Viago is old fashioned and meticulous, Deacon is rebellious and spontaneous, Vladislav is perverted and out of his element, Petyr is like this prehistoric fossil of the evolution of vampires over the years, and Nick is so overcome with the thrill of becoming a vampire that he lets that shout over reasoning and logic. Everyone is drawn to Stu because he's soft spoken, mild mannered, and easy to get along with. There's also Jackie (Jackie van Beek), Deacon's servant who is persistent about Deacon finally making her immortal.The film juggles the documentary aspect, vampire humor, horror homage, and clever comedy quite well. Playing with selecting a victim, draining their blood, hypnotism, and not having reflections is something the film has fine-tuned to perfection. It's even able to take soft jabs at werewolves and zombies in legitimately humorous fashion. The humor is more of a tribute to the source material than a flat out mockery, which is one of the reasons the film is so enjoyable. The ""dark bidding"" bit may be the crown jewel of ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" but accidentally biting the main artery, a bat fight, and attempting to eat human food are also quite hysterical.According to most folklore relating to vampires, they cannot be photographed. ""What We Do in the Shadows"" completely ignores this little detail and allows snapshots of these eccentric characters to be taken at every turn. It doesn't really tie into how entertaining the film is, but it's just an odd detail to alter since so much time is given to absent reflections and how to get ready for a night on the town without one.The only flaw ""What We Do in the Shadows"" could possibly have is that it ends prematurely. The characters are so much fun to be around that you could easily spend more than three hours soaking in their wild antics, which saddens you greatly when the film ends after a mere 86 minutes. Superbly written with sharp, on the cuff humor, fantastic characters, and a well-polished story completely in tune with its source material, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is an uproarious horror comedy that's every bit as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil,"" and ""Zombieland.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEDQFCFOY9H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY823YW#wasThisHelpful","RKEDQFCFOY9H3","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The animated short ""Feast"" that plays before ""Big Hero 6"" is like an extra helping of dessert before the main course arrives. Directed by Patrick Osborne (animation supervisor on ""Paperman"" and animator on other Disney films like ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Bolt""), ""Feast"" is the story of a young Boston Terrier puppy who is discovered on the street by a man. The man feeds the canine dog food, which snowballs into the man just giving this dog the most unhealthy food imaginable like bacon and eggs, spaghetti, and pizza to this dog; usually piled on top of its kibble. Over the years, the dog develops a taste for its master's bad eating habits but the man eventually meets a woman and falls in love.As their relationship blossoms, the dog's special treats become nonexistent. The dog gets upset and turns its nose up at normal food. The man and woman eventually go their separate ways, which triggers a new era of incredibly unhealthy junk food once again. But the dog realizes how unhappy its master is so it takes matters into its own hands to fix things. ""Feast"" is adorable and amusing and is one of those genius animated shorts that uses nearly no dialogue.The hereditary brilliance both Hiro and Tadashi share is almost unbelievable. Why would anyone need to go to college if they were already that intelligent? Their peers are quite the characters, especially Fred who seems to run on nothing but whimsical dreams of becoming a comic book monster. Maybe it's a way to hone a skill they already possess or because it's just something that seems fun and Hiro has all that cash from bot fighting he needs to blow through anyway.The animated sci-fi adventure has the typical superhero film formula: you're introduced to their family and supporting characters, something tragic happens to somebody close to the protagonist, the hero falls into a funk and relies on his friends to snap him out of it, they discover a masked super villain using the hero's technology, and they must form a superhero team to save the day. ""Big Hero 6"" embraces those superhero roots and just rolls with it in the best of ways. The film is extremely funny when it needs to be (the fist bump will never be the same), heartbreaking when it's crucial to the storyline, and exciting throughout.Baymax is the heart and soul of the film. The method in which Hiro is able to teach the robot certain things without it ever questioning its main objective is reminiscent of John Connor teaching The Terminator 90s slang in ""Terminator 2."" Baymax's drunken-like antics when its battery gets low is sure to get a lot of laughs. The perspectives used while Hiro is riding Baymax as they rocket through the sky is very similar to what was used in ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" as Hiccup rode Toothless into battle. These really dynamic camera angles are able to put the audience directly into the action to make them feel like they're riding on the back of a superhero.""Big Hero 6"" seems to combine a ton of elements from some of the greatest sci-fi, action, and superhero films out there into one incredibly fun film suitable for the entire family. Besides ""The Terminator,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers"" come to mind and the villain has this Doctor Octopus aura about him. ""Big Hero 6"" is sensational and imaginative animation that will cater to any age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DG4ITCWKRDT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4ZC57I#wasThisHelpful","R1DG4ITCWKRDT5","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"South Korean filmmaker Lee Jeong-beom is capable of creating gripping and intense action thrillers featuring absolutely breathtaking violence and noteworthy performances. His previous film ""The Man From Nowhere"" is exceptional for these reasons alone. Maybe it was the four year gap between directorial features or that ""No Tears for the Dead"" has an absolutely horrendous English language dub, but it seems like Jeong-beom has lost the ability to stand firmly as a competent writer and director of South Korean cinema. It's as if filmmaking is represented by a ship that never slows down and is constantly catching momentum. Jeong-beom no longer has the sea legs to ride said ship and flounders about as he attempts to fight back the urge to leap overboard every chance that he has.In addition to a dub track that rides on your last nerve, the dialogue is also atrocious. Gon is very cold and dislikes every person he comes into contact with solely because he has mommy issues stemming back to his childhood. He tells someone to ""get the f--- out of his face"" because they smell like garlic. Mo-gyeong relies on alcohol and prescription drugs to dull her grief and her doctor compares dealing with so many patient's pain to menopause. When asked why Gon is siding with his target he replies that he's just tired. It becomes painfully obvious that the screenplay is just lacking genuine dialogue.It isn't like ""No Tears for the Dead"" is this brilliant foreign film that suffers from a poor English dub. The dub track certainly doesn't help matters, but the overused conspiracy storyline is too convoluted for its own good. There is a double cross in the film that makes no impact because the audience never has the chance to care about anything going on. You're too distracted by Mo-gyeong's daughter's awful voice that sounds like a 35-year-old woman trying to be cute and a ""touching"" scene being utterly annoying because of the irritating way that Mo-gyeong cries. It doesn't help that Gon decides to be the creepiest hitman ever by just lurking around for days and watches Mo-gyeong sob herself into a puddle of momentary comfort.Besides a rather bloody sequence that opens the film, it takes over an hour for more violence to actually kick in. A glorious 3-minute sequence featuring messy action with exploding heads, severed fingers, sliced Achilles heels, and an endless array of bullets rolls out a blood red carpet and welcomes you to the second hour of the film. The concluding half of the film is pretty much all of the action you could ever want in a film like this. The action itself can be compared to Hong Kong cinema at its best, especially from the 80s and John Woo films in particular. There are moments where the film allows you to catch your breath as a viewer, but then decides that making you wait an hour for the main course is long enough and finishes in brutal fashion. The final scene of the film is a little confusing since that last scene in the elevator seems rather decisive over the fate of a certain character. It's as if this last segment was added just to show that Jang Dong-gun is capable of crying and showing emotion.The excellence of ""The Man From Nowhere"" will easily trigger interest in Lee Jeong-beom's follow-up feature. What's interesting is that ""The Man From Nowhere"" is about protecting a little girl and ""No Tears for the Dead"" is finding retribution for a little girl that was killed. Lee Jeong-beom is more than capable of crafting exquisitely violent action sequences that are completely breathtaking, but all of the bloody violence in the world can't save a muddled story, horrid dubbing, and horrendous dialogue. South Korean actor Jang Dong-gun seems to be doing the best with what he's given, but his awful haircut can't help but help but give the impression that he looks like a South Korean version of Paul Reubens. ""No Tears for the Dead"" has some of the most satisfying and jaw-dropping action any film could ask for, but the other factors of the film are so weak that they fail to make as much of an impact or any sort of impact at all other than severe irritation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZK9GXV0TS1C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STZ65VQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZK9GXV0TS1C1","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" has done something revolutionary. This is a film that introduces a clothing line to cater toward all of the gentlemen out there, but it does so simultaneously with the film's release. It doesn't have a wave of successful momentum to fall back on. This is banking on financial success and famous faces to sell expensive menswear. It was very unusual seeing a screening kick off with a sponsor for a clothing line for the film we were about to see, but it's likely something we'll see more of in the future.The opening credits are also a bit different. Everything that pops up on-screen before the ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" logo appears is the result of an explosion. The rubble from that explosion bounces off the ground and onto the screen to form the credits. It's a little detail that makes something extremely simple very eye-catching.The villain of the film is Richmond Valentine, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson. What distinguishes this role from the other memorable characters Jackson has played throughout his career is that not only is he physically repulsed by violence, but Jackson portrays Valentine with this incredible lisp. Valentine is essentially a sociopath with genocide on his mind for his own personal gain and the character is given this ridiculous and amusing twist because of his lisp.The film itself has the same bite as ""Kick-Ass,"" which was another collaboration between director Matthew Vaughn and comic book writer Mark Millar. At its core, ""Kingsman"" is about gentlemen stepping up and becoming spies so there's this element of proper behavior, spectacular hygiene, and looking one's absolute best at all times. But then there's that Mark Millar twist to the writing that throws a plethora of vulgarity and raunchy humor to not only make the film hilarious but more human and relatable, as well.What's interesting is that if you just look at the action sequences without really thinking about it they seem really dynamic and spectacular. They speed up and slow down in a way that allows you to process everything that's occurring much like the action in ""300,"" but it flows in a unique way. If you dig a little deeper, the action sequences seem like a homage to the action in the Timur Bekmambetov directed action film ""Wanted,"" which is also based on a comic Mark Millar wrote. But the ""Freebird"" church sequence is just exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. Colin Firth reportedly did 80% if his own stunts and his work looks to have really paid off. This is really violent stuff that capitalizes on jaw-dropping moments to stroll from one victim to the next.This is the feature film debut of Welsh actor Taron Egerton and he handles the role brilliantly. Egerton slides into the role of a punk kid with ease yet makes his uphill struggle sympathetic and interesting. His ability to do parkour results in a pretty great scene in the film, as well. Colin Firth is also just the definition of a gentleman who reels you in with all of the knowledge he's gained as a spy over the years. Even when Firth curses, he seems to do it in a polite way that is laugh out loud funny. Firth is practically a bonafide action star by the end of the film and would give John Wick a run for his money.""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" politely and eloquently clobbers you with undeniable wit, frantic yet unflinching action, and extremely adult but uproarious humor. Experiencing this film is like putting an R-rated spin on your favorite James Bond film or obscenely asking for Grey Poupon while you bash someone's face in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BY4X93MEBZCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJYY42S#wasThisHelpful","R3BY4X93MEBZCH","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The moral of ""Brotherhood of Blades"" seems to be that money is unable to buy happiness. Those powerful and hungry enough to achieve luxurious wealth are the crooked, tainted, and evil individuals who make it impossible for the average working person to climb the corporate ladder. But this film deals with three men who are so desperate to reach that one big goal most would spend their entire life attempting to attain that they'll literally do whatever they possibly can to come to it this instant and that's one of the reasons the film plays out the way that it does.Shen is in love with Zhou Miaotong (Liu Shishi), a young woman bound to a brothel and her paying customers. Shen is determined to buy Miaotong her freedom. Lu has been trying to get a promotion to help out his ailing parents yet is told that he doesn't make enough money to bribe the right individuals to get his name in the running. Finally, there's Yichuan, who coughs up blood in his phlegm the entire film. In between falling in love with Zhang Yan (Ye Qing), Yichuan is constantly stalked and mocked by Ding Xiu (Zhou Yiwei), a swordsman who studied under the same master as Yichuan and blackmails him around every turn while claiming to know his terrible secret. Once confronted by the three destitute assassins, Wei offers 400 taels of gold as a means to keep him alive. A desperate situation becomes life threatening after that proposition.The camera is expertly positioned throughout director Lu Yang's wuxia action film. Not only does the camera seem to capture all of the action taking place, but it makes you feel like you're tagging along with a group of assassins on a dangerous mission or leading the way and looking back at who you're traveling with depending on where the camera is placed. The film's use of slow-motion is rather unnecessary. Everything involving horses or water is shown in slowed down to a crawl without much of a payoff.The special effects are also completely fruitless. Most of the blood in the film has been digitally added in post production and is very obviously noticeable. The first big action sequence uses this effect so poorly that it almost looks 8-bit and somehow added in with a Nintendo Entertainment System. It gets more tolerable as the film progresses, but it's not a good sign when you find yourself rejoicing when actual red liquid is splattering on the wall an hour and a half in instead of disappearing in mid-air.If you can get past that, the action is rather fast paced and enjoyable. The wuxia utilized in the film is subtle and similar to how it was used in ""Ip Man."" You can identify when wires are being used, but people aren't flying around all crazy like an old school Jet Li flick. The storyline gets a bit baffling in the final act and the actions of certain characters are too perplexing for their own good. Miaotong is so unstable and while the film tries to explain why she behaves the way that she does it just doesn't seem very logical. The Ding Xiu character is also kind of bizarre. He begins as this supporting character that seems to be channeling Toshiro Mifune and is very much a villain, but almost completely evolves into the exact opposite by the time we reach the end of his character arc.The ending almost feels like it's purposely trying to frustrate the viewer. It's cryptic in the sense that everything is completely straightforward one minute and for nearly the entire film and then it just switches gears during the last two minutes. Heaven is either riding horses with your brothers in slow-motion in a field full of flowers or the fate of a certain character is just left entirely up in the air. Shen, Lu, and Yichuan give off this Rain, Thunder, and Lighting from ""Big Trouble in Little China"" kind of vibe. Whether that's worth rejoicing or not resides solely on how much you enjoyed John Carpenter's cult classic action film from 1986.""Brotherhood of Blades"" shows promise early on. A good conspiracy can always ignite a stagnant story and the action in the film is swift, intense, and impressive. But the feeble special effects really take you out of the action at times and the conclusion is a bloated misfire. Films are so much more simple when they start off good or bad and either escalate or deteriorate from there. They always seem to be more disappointing when they start off promising and snowball to lackluster mediocrity.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQRQGI4LO09D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUXTO90#wasThisHelpful","R3VQRQGI4LO09D","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's this foreign factor of late 80s/early 90s cheesiness heavily sprinkled throughout ""Jupiter Ascending"" and it's as awkward as it is impressive. Maybe it's the presence of spasmic and overly colorful visuals, the way Channing Tatum roller blades in the air, or Balem's dragon/dinosaur henchmen that gives the film this ""Super Mario Bros."" meets ""The Last Starfighter"" kind of tone, but the Wachowskis delayed sci-fi actioner slips on its visuals like a barrel full of banana peels more often than not.The action sequences suffer from a similar issue. As soon as the film triggers interest with something exciting the scenes immediately become too busy and have too much going on to process properly. Everything is so flashy yet unimpressive because of it. Imagine if George Lucas remastered and made a special edition of the ""G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero"" animated series from the late 80s like he did with the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and you can visualize just how disappointing this is given the Wachowskis back catalog. One chase sequence in particular lasts around seven minutes and took seven months to shoot, but feels like it tries to cram too much into a short time period and ends up being extremely messy visually.The acting is completely inconsistent, as well. Channing Tatum is even more one-dimensional than expected and seems like he's just there to be eye candy. On the other end of the spectrum is Eddie Redmayne who either barely speaks above a whisper or screams at the top of his lungs without warning or reason for doing so. In between the two is Mila Kunis who is nothing more than a sarcastic twit who makes bad decisions over and over again. Lastly, there's Sean Bean whose performance isn't exactly memorable but is noteworthy for the fact that it seems to break a long gestating curse regarding the fate of the characters he usually chooses to play.""Jupiter Ascending"" can be visually engaging at times and bends and warps the boundaries of space quite efficiently, but its storyline is very familiar, its special effects are more cluttered than Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" films, and is massively inconsistent as far as performances go. The film is so overloaded with ""holy crap,"" glow in the dark regenerative goo, flying lizard henchmen, an out of place ""Wayne's World 2"" wedding, and a female who chooses to clean toilets over everything else that you hardly have the chance to enjoy the little things this sloppy sci-fi film has to offer; like Terry Gilliam's brief cameo. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is more of a motivational video for janitors and housemaids everywhere than a satisfying piece of entertainment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q20FT86CPGZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEQOGCG#wasThisHelpful","R1Q20FT86CPGZI","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Two Days, One Night"" is a very fascinating and genuine drama. It allows the audience to take a neutral standpoint and see the big picture from both the point of view of a mother who will face financial hardship without a job and the other employees who are relying on a new bonus to support their families. As Sandra makes her route door to door, the viewer gets to feel the compassion, the anger, the utter confusion, and whatever other emotions boil to the surface solely because Sandra is standing on their doorstep and asking for another chance.You gain access into Sandra's life and see how this experience is beginning to eat at her existence. The entire incident makes Sandra weak and fragile as she slowly swan dives back into her sickness. Her time of need has her relying on medication more than the average person and it comes to a head at a pivotal scene later on in the film. Even though a good portion of the individuals need the bonus just to make ends meet, Sandra's journey is somewhat enlightening as it reveals just who her friends really are.This film has a story that revolves around how actions not only affect you but everyone else around you. While it seems completely inhuman for a company to force employees to choose between such things, the truth is that this is what the world has evolved into as far as keeping your job is concerned for some people. Facing economic hardship is something that affects everyone; no matter what part of the world you live in.Seeing how it affects Sandra and hearing how her relationship with Manu is struggling makes the entire experience all the more relatable. Depression is something just about everyone can sympathize with and as you witness Sandra continue to climb out of the cynical pit her life has thrown her into you also observe the obstacles in life that knock her back down, she even slips on occasion, and loses the desire to keep trying. But the important thing is she continues to get back up even when the odds are stacked against her.""Two Days, One Night"" is an incredibly powerful film. Jean-Dardenne and Luc Dardenne have birthed this overwhelming hour and a half overflowing with raw, human emotion. Marion Cotillard has taken on one of the most challenging roles of her career and has delivered a performance that is extremely rewarding. Sometimes it's not about conquering that unsurpassable mountain of depression and cynicism. Sometimes discovering who you can count on to help push you to that next goal you need in life is enough to overcome such hardships. That mindset of uncertainty yet continuing to endure is captured beautifully in ""Two Days, One Night.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLS2RLBSXPQD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJN8SZG#wasThisHelpful","RLS2RLBSXPQD5","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You need to see the Gareth Edwards directed version of ""Godzilla"" not only on the big screen but in IMAX. It is absolutely mandatory to enjoy this film to its full extent. Hearing that roar for the first time in an IMAX theater gives you a wave of goosebumps that pulses from your feet to the back of your neck in an instant and leaves you craving destructive monster mayhem in glorious high definition.The science fiction monster film is absolutely gargantuan in scope. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was able to achieve quite a bit with perspective and making Spider-Man look tiny compared to the utter gigantism of New York City. ""Godzilla"" takes the opposite approach in taking what are giant cities and making the monsters in the film even larger in comparison.M.U.T.O. is awesome enough, but the ongoing tease leading up to seeing Godzilla in his entirety is extraordinary. You see his torso after the firing of some flares and a glimpse or two of his tail as it slithers behind a building or a brief shot of the spikes on his back seen through clouds of smoke. As M.U.T.O. destroys an airport, you see Godzilla's feet for the first time which take up the entire runway; finally leading to the slow rising shot of his full reveal capping off with the first official ground shaking Godzilla roar of the film.The performances are remarkably compelling. Bryan Cranston proves once again that he is an absolutely fantastic supporting actor, but it makes you wonder if he'll ever take a larger role in a big budget film. Ken Watanabe is also extraordinary as the one scientist who is essentially the voice behind Godzilla's rampage. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's talent wasn't bothersome in the ""Kick-Ass"" films, but his voice seems extremely nasally amongst all the chaos. More individuals will focus on the fact that Johnson and Olsen will portray brother and sister in next year's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" while portraying lovers in ""Godzilla.""The giant monster sequences are utterly jaw dropping and awe inspiring. They will satisfy on absolutely every level, but pay attention to how influentially great the sound of the film is as well. Not only is Godzilla's roaring superb, but everything is done big whether it's an explosion or a covert operation. Keep an eye out for the M.U.T.O. scene by the train tracks as it seems to ride the same set of tension tracks established by ""Jurassic Park"" during the velociraptors in the kitchen sequence. The ""Predator""-like clicking done by M.U.T.O. is also fun to hear in theaters.Gareth Edwards has not just rebooted a franchise here; he's introduced what will hopefully be a terrifyingly destructive franchise that will leave Godzilla fans clamoring for more. Surprisingly intelligent with first-rate acting and exhilarating special effects, ""Godzilla"" is dangerously amazing, humanity endangering, city-destroying perfection. Chisel this in stone and write it down in the record books that the king has finally returned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQ3IP4DAWUF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPEJXYY#wasThisHelpful","R2OQ3IP4DAWUF8","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Locke"" is Tom Hardy in a car sifting through his Rolodex of contacts and being on the phone for 80-minutes straight. It's the type of concept similar to what Rodrigo Cortes was going for in ""Buried."" ""Locke"" may be a low-budget film that's simple in execution, but it allows its audience to rely on the actor's performance to get them through the film.Hardy's on-screen presence in Steven Knight's dramatic thriller is riveting. Ivan Locke is ridiculously calm and composed with the life altering decisions he's made at the beginning of the film, but the events that transpire over the phone on Ivan's strange but determined journey not only pluck at his emotions but his sanity as well. Locke's arguments with his reflection in the rear-view mirror as he targets his neglectful father are disturbingly outstanding. Those powerful sequences show that Hardy needs nothing but a working camera pointed squarely at him in order to showcase his exquisite talent as a leading man.The resolution of ""Locke"" leaves a lot to be desired even with Hardy's strong performance. The drama that unfolds is very realistic and believable. It seems like it could happen to anyone. While the plot is intricate, the plot points remain within the realm of reality and nothing stands in the way of the film's energetic pace. But you expect more when the ending rolls around. While certain things are wrapped up, the film feels a little short as it could have allowed another 10 or 20 minutes to be fully satisfying.Witnessing a man being pushed to his breaking point is the best part of ""Locke."" Tom Hardy delivers an emotionally exhausting and attention demanding performance that's one of the best of the English actor's career. However the film fizzles out in its final moments as it offers dissatisfying closure. ""Locke"" wastes little time accelerating into exceptional territory, but it slows down and makes a sharp turn onto an under construction detour that slows the film down bringing it to an abrupt halt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P9FIUU1LA1SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJ3EH6C#wasThisHelpful","R3P9FIUU1LA1SK","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Neighbors"" is a typical Seth Rogen movie. It's Rogen getting high with his friends and getting into ridiculous antics because of it. Depending on whether or not you've enjoyed Rogen's previous films will likely weigh in on how much you enjoy ""Neighbors."" It's also from director Nicholas Stoller; the man who brought us films like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Get Him to the Greek."" So strap yourselves in for another R-rated stoner comedy because ""Neighbors"" isn't much more than that.The humor in the film tends to vary between flat out silliness, absurd conversations while being high, and crude behavior that usually involves graphic nudity. The film opens with Mac and Kelly trying to break in their new living room by having sex in it yet can't because their baby keeps staring at them. Other hysterical moments include Mac and Kelly falling asleep while trying to bring their baby to a rave, the Batman conversation between Mac and Teddy, Pete's secret ability, and the importance of shaving downstairs.Much of the film is devoted to the couple trying to one-up the fraternity and vice versa. Mac and Kelly are always shown trying to hype themselves up before attempting to do anything. Their long, drawn out conversations are often more humorous than the event itself. There's also an emphasis on certain phrases being repeated over and over again in order for the designated side to move on with their next retaliation; ""bro's before ho's"" is the best example.What's interesting is that the comedy at least attempts to show the human side of things from both the frat and family perspectives. Neither side ever really has the advantage, so the resolution feels like it could go either way at any time. Both sides start to crumble internally as the brotherhood mentality begins to falter within the fraternity while the married couple starts to have marital issues.""Neighbors"" is an amusing pissing contest between obnoxious people who live next to one another that lasts for an hour and a half. It's almost like if ""Old School"" was told from the perspective of Vince Vaughn's character. Nevertheless, ""Neighbors"" is incredibly entertaining and even uproarious at times. It's the type of comedy that makes your lungs ache and your cheeks sore from laughing so much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVEEQW629XO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTD6WW#wasThisHelpful","R1KVEEQW629XO0","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to process Lars von Trier's ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" and it's not because it's impossible to comprehend. It mostly lies within the way the film is written, separated into two parts, and its tendency to focus on some of the vilest human beings on the entire planet.Before the knowledgeable yet naive Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers the beaten and unconscious Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in the alleyway behind his home, ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" has a very slow opening that shows the beauty of falling snow and the innocence of trickling rainfall. The film then jumps into its first misuse of music as Rammstein suddenly explodes onto the film's soundtrack. Aside from the more orchestrated pieces, the music in both parts of ""Nymphomaniac"" is way too loud and nearly destroys whatever atmosphere the film had attempted to establish up to that point.Joe has been very sexual her entire life. In a nutshell, the ""Nymphomaniac"" films are a retelling of Joe's life as she narrates her story to Seligman; a man who has parallels to every nasty sexual act Joe partakes in yet never gets excited or mentions sex himself. The film is labeled as a drama and you really can't digest it as anything else since there's nothing comedic or horrific about it. It may be fairly adventurous but only as far as exposed genitalia or sexual acts are concerned.""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" isn't rated by the MPAA, but pushes the boundaries of what would otherwise be an NC-17 rating and is practically pornographic at times. The film shows a plethora of full frontal nudity of both sexes, plenty of graphic sex scenes, and oral sex on a train that is incredibly realistic and doesn't shy away from any explicit content. More complex visuals are shown at times involving mathematical equations, diagrams, and even a jigsaw puzzle.Joe brings up her father's (Christian Slater) influence that culminates with him deteriorating in a hospital bed while filling his surroundings with feces as Joe watches and has sex with every man in the hospital. She speaks of Jerome (Shia LaBeouf), which is the closest she's ever been to actually being in love and yet Jerome is verbally and physically abusive between egotistical spurts of self-worth. Joe even mentions Mrs. H (Uma Thurman), a scorned wife who berates Joe in front of her three children for Joe's sexual choices and has an emotional breakdown right there on the spot.The film is mostly Joe trying to come to terms with who she is. She claims she isn't a good person and is just trying to fill a void that is incapable of ever getting enough. ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" is a fascinating spin on the perspective of an addict who has never gotten the proper treatment. Joe bitterly reflects back on her life with no remorse while Seligman's parallels about fishing add bizarre yet meaningful commentary. ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" strips sex of its romance and its intimacy and overloads the act with nothing but pure lust.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BV175M0ASUUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITKS65Y#wasThisHelpful","R2BV175M0ASUUS","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the events in ""Blue Ruin"" are fairly unpredictable, you don't find yourself attached to any of the characters and don't have any investment over the consequences of anyone's actions in the film. Dwight's journey is filled with uncertainty and his mumbling ways are justified, but him saying so little and being so emotionally withdrawn only makes his character seem about as interesting as a dingy wash cloth.Dwight's encounter in the restroom near the beginning of the film is violently intense and similar to something straight out of ""No Country for Old Men."" And while it's somewhat expected, there's a rather gruesome headshot in the second half of the film that pushes things in Dwight's favor when he needs it the most. Dwight's leg wound struggle is almost comedic at times in between the grisly moments when you feel yourself cringing harder than you have at anything released in theaters so far this year.The thriller has a gritty and grungy atmosphere that matches Dwight's disheveled physical appearance. It's something that the film fully embraces as this grimy world is still living and breathing during the very last frame. ""White trash"" seems too harsh of a phrase to describe it, but these are greasy individuals who are always down on their luck and living in the filthy underbelly of what would otherwise be considered ""scary"" neighborhoods.Much like Scott Cooper's ""Out of the Furnace,"" ""Blue Ruin"" has a lot of potential but fails to follow up on it. Jeremy Saulnier constructs a stimulating tale of revenge with beautiful cinematography, but the climax falls short of living up to the film's slow burn storytelling and regretfully none of the performances are very noteworthy. ""Blue Ruin"" is an extremely polished revenge thriller, but it's been buffed so much that it begins to dull in the areas that should be more striking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZ5K9ARJR3PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXD2UJO#wasThisHelpful","R2XZ5K9ARJR3PO","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The comic book fan in you will rejoice when it sees Spider-Man web sling in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Spider-Man finally moves the way you've always imagined. The perspectives used while he's swinging through the air are astounding as you see and hear the fabric of his costume blow in the wind while the gargantuan scope of the city is captured whenever the camera zooms out to show how small Spider-Man really is in comparison. It's almost as if the film is trying to show you that Spider-Man really is like a spider compared to the size of New York.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is extremely overzealous when it comes to how many stories it tries to juggle in its 142-minute duration. It was confirmed as of late that Sony plans to expand the Spider-Man universe by doing spinoff films such as ""The Sinister Six"" and ""Venom."" The proper seeds would begin being planted in this sequel and the next one before the release of the two spinoffs and finally culminating with ""The Amazing Spider-Man 4."" The concept sounds harmless and intriguing, but it just seems to be executed in a similarly disastrous way that you've already seen before.Between Peter's ongoing drama with Gwen, Electro's desire to be worshiped, Harry's rise in Oscorp, and Peter's ongoing road to discovering the truth about his father, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has a lot of side stories to intertwine, coexist, and somehow deliver a film that's cohesively sound for audiences to enjoy. Sprinkle in these little Easter eggs to future films and villains along with whatever other shout outs the creators deem necessary (B.J. Novak portrays Alistair Smythe, the creator of the Spider-Slayers) and the superhero film becomes more than a little unbalanced.The dialogue is laughably atrocious at times. Spider-Man's quick wit and motor mouth do sneak through the cracks, but Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci should be ashamed of what is said in this film. Electro's ""It's my birthday and it's time for me to light my candles,"" line has you waving the white flag early on but throw in little nuggets like Spidey's, ""Come to daddy,"" line Harry's ""Fairy Godmother"" speech, and Electro's, ""Right as rain,"" phrase and you have a bunch of out of date phrases that even the most antiquated of gentlemen would stroke their mustache and shake their head at.Grazing over the numerous times you're forced to see Andrew Garfield take his shirt off, the massive amount of lens flares that take a nod from J.J. Abrams, and ignoring the fact that Electro mostly looks like a dog turd with an electrical current coursing through it, the other big issue is how fast the film speeds through the Harry Osborn storyline. Harry was brought in for one specific purpose that is very obvious if you're at all familiar with the comic books. Harry's evolution to super villain status is almost as rushed as Sinestro's in ""The Green Lantern.""Even though the film is almost two and a half hours long, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" scrambles through half a dozen storylines and easily draws comparisons to the sloppy ""Spider-Man 3."" Andrew Garfield is as strong as ever as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker and the on-screen chemistry between the main cast is mesmerizing. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" suffers from trying to cram too much fanfare into one pudgy film, which can't be saved by its overflowing surge of spectacular special effects.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWJ4WRJAB62N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKPHUE0#wasThisHelpful","R1RWJ4WRJAB62N","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Proxy"" makes the mistake of making very specific connections amongst its characters and in its storyline yet sprinkles the world its created within its frames of celluloid with plot holes like some sort of crater-loving Johnny Appleseed. The common thread in the film only seems to be insane behavior with little to no explanation.After Esther loses her baby, you're introduced to her lesbian lover Anika (Kristina Klebe) who is basically a complete knockoff of Lisbeth Salander from ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Anika is covered in tattoos and a complete freak in the bedroom. This is something the film points out on more than one occasion. Anika is incredibly vindictive through and through. She enjoys Esther's company because of her craziness.Meanwhile Melanie's husband Patrick (Joe Swanberg) is not a good father. He's more infatuated with trying to come off as the ""cool dad"" than anything else. The Patrick character goes through some really funky stuff in the film. Something tragic happens to him and Melanie that affects them both. Melanie begins edging back into society while Patrick kind of retreats internally and resorts to brooding. The character begins having delusions that mostly revolve around torture. The way they haphazardly leave a shotgun lying around makes you wonder why tragedy didn't strike them sooner.If you dig a little and stretch what little substance is there, ""Proxy"" attempts to say something about people dealing with the grief of losing someone close to them, how the loss affects them, and overcoming what seems like crippling depression. But the film seems to illustrate that everyone under those conditions gives in to wrath and revenge especially when it comes to the Patrick and Anika characters.But none of the characters feel genuine. None of their actions seem like logical, real-life conclusions. The film is very slow-moving and bogged down from uneventful and long strings of dialogue. While ""Proxy"" is listed as a horror, it's not scary. The scariest part is getting through the entire thing. The film's highlight is a slow-motion shotgun blast sequence in a bathroom, but even that is laughably bad thanks to how thick and jelly-like the blood appears. ""Proxy"" only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3EXQ75VG1X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRU8QGO#wasThisHelpful","R3R3EXQ75VG1X7","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Last Passenger"" makes sure to show the awkward behavior of certain passengers, particularly Jan (Iddo Goldberg), and the bizarre discoveries Lewis makes each times he observes his surroundings. Jan is blatantly shown to come off as a delinquent, but his menacing cigarette magic trick is more pointless than anything. Max is supposed to represent the innocence of being a young child stuck in a bad situation, but the stupid decisions he makes along with a certain emotional scene he has with Lewis has the boy grinding every last shred of patience you may have.The train is very obviously hijacked at a certain point in ""Last Passenger,"" so you're constantly wondering who or why would do such a thing. There's very little explanation given or any type of reasonable motive. Getting their face into the newspaper is all any of the characters care about. If that wasn't nonsensical enough, nobody thinks straight when they have the opportunity to act on a possible escape. The tunnel sequence is mostly just a loud squawking match between everyone who's still alive rather than an actual attempt at freedom.Films don't have to have explanations for every little thing to be enjoyable, but ""Last Passenger"" doesn't describe enough of anything to be entertaining. The characters go through this thinking process of thinking somewhat rationally to a more direct approach to thinking outside the box and finally considering sacrifices for the greater good. While the film is in the same vein as films such as ""Unstoppable,"" ""Speed,"" ""Joy Ride,"" and ""Premium Rush,"" it lacks a proper resolution and its empty thrills don't make up for its inadequate amount of substance.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134IMXLZB5UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK19VA0#wasThisHelpful","R134IMXLZB5UD","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Confession of Murder"" has a fantastically gripping opening. We see Choi sitting at a restaurant while it pours down rain as he remembers his pursuit of the killer. The camera does some pretty incredible stuff perspective-wise during this foot chase. Like the camera work in ""The Raid 2,"" the camera seems to contort itself to allow full use of dynamic angles while following these two characters. The camera slides underneath a car at one point and even seems to smash through a window as the killer jumps out of one to escape the clutches of a determined Lieutenant Choi.But the excellent beginning only strengthens the South Korean action thriller's slow but steady building decline. The main storyline of the film is riveting, but there's this entire secondary storyline that nearly ruins everything the film has going for it. Comedy and goofy behavior has no place in a film like this, but writer/director Jung Byung-gil forcefully stuffs as much unwanted absurdity as he can into the film.A group of the killer's victim's relatives and loved ones gather and pursue a fresh-out-of-prison private investigator to gain revenge on Lee Doo-suk, but unfortunately this ragtag faction of over trained nincompoops only muck up Detective Choi's investigation. Look no further than the unrealistic car chase in the middle of the film which features balancing on the roofs and hoods of multiple cars and hospital gurneys all while barreling down a highway. The blatant green screen shots are beyond preposterous as are the ludicrous actions of a certain knife wielding private dick.""Confession of Murder"" has a captivating primary storyline with superb performances from the short-tempered Jung Jae-young and the overconfident Park Si-hoo. However the film seems to run about 30-40 minutes too long while the side plot is overly goofy when it has no reason to be. With dark, compelling components similar to that of ""The Chaser"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" ""Confession of Murder"" feels like a great film wrapped inside of a dreadful one that suffers from disastrous editing and shoddy writing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2CYKEGO375A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRYH52I#wasThisHelpful","R1A2CYKEGO375A","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Short Peace"" is an anthology of four extraordinary animated films directed by Shuhei Morita, Katsuhiro Otomo (""Akira""), Hiroaki Ando, and Hajime Katoki. The film follows in the footsteps of Otomo's ""Memories"" from nearly a decade ago and incorporates different animation styles and film genres into one unique experience.The opening of the film features a young girl playing hide-and-seek with a boy who is never shown on screen. She keeps asking if the boy is ready for her to come and find him. When he's finally ready, her surroundings completely change. She sees and begins chasing a white rabbit through various environments that are consistently modified. The opening ends with a glowing red ball that flies up her shirt, lifts her into the air, and sifts through a variety of different appearances for the young girl before the ""Short Peace"" title is shown on screen.""Possessions"" begins with text that tells the story of Tsukumogami; every century souls occupy various inanimate objects and play tricks on people. The short opens with a lone samurai trudging through a forest during a thunderstorm. Seeking shelter, he finds an abandoned shrine to rest in. But the shrine turns out to be haunted as it transports our protagonist to a room infested with umbrellas, an intertwining fabric room, and a smelly garbage demon.""Combustible"" is a story of honor. It's presented in this traditional Japanese style with soft intricate colors which leaves the short feeling simple yet completely elegant. Matsukichi is disowned by his father after his tattoos are discovered, but this allows him to follow his one true passion of becoming a fireman. Waka becomes depressed with Matsukichi's absence as an uncontrollable flame suddenly engulfs their homes.""Gambo"" is the most gripping of the four shorts. A polar bear that can understand human speech is asked by the last remaining daughter of a small village to save them from the red demon. Featuring a field of red flowers that are realistically rendered and a nasty brawl featuring not only the bear and the demon but a samurai and an entire army, ""Gambo"" begins and ends in one of the messiest bloodbaths imaginable.The anthology's finale is ""A Farewell to Arms,"" a sci-fi short revolving around a group of scavengers with heightened physical attributes thanks to protective suits who are confronted by an automated artillery drone known as GONK.""Possessions"" is the most satisfying short. Its animation is this wonderful blend of traditional and 3D animation. While the short is somewhat strange at first, it's actually very lighthearted and a joy to watch. The little dancing umbrella frog is freaking adorable. ""A Farewell to Arms"" is a visual ecstasy thanks to how well its futuristic technology is animated and its dynamic sense of perspective.""Short Peace"" lives up to its title as its brief 68-minute duration results in a film that is extremely easy to digest. The animation in each short is breathtaking in its own way and its short length contributes to the fact that each story is quite engaging. With its beautiful animation and exquisite storytelling, Short Peace is a rare animated film that taps into reflective and sentimental territory.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAZ9DT00BM5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F92268S#wasThisHelpful","R1DAZ9DT00BM5A","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wally Pfister, a Chicago-born cinematographer with over 20 years of experience and a frequent collaborator with Christopher Nolan, slides into the director's chair for the first time with ""Transcendence."" The most exciting aspect of ""Transcendence"" was that it seemed like it was just physically demanding enough to spark whatever creative juices Johnny Depp has been lacking the past decade or so he's seemingly just been drifting through the motions to cash a paycheck. However, ""Transcendence"" manages to keep that redundant trend alive and turns what could have been an interesting concept into run of the mill fluff.You'd think that approaching a character that goes through what seems like a complex story arc of being this extremely intelligent mind who becomes sick, faces death, and then finds new life as this computer generated consciousness would result in this really exceptional and vastly emotional performance. Somehow Johnny Depp makes the Will Caster role incredibly boring. Depp shows little to no emotion the entire film and despite getting top billing feels like he gets less screen time than Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany. Depp lacks whatever passion he once had that made him eccentric and captivating in the past.Once Will is online, he convinces Evelyn to purchase the small town of Brightwood where they begin to rebuild. After a short two years, nanotechnology becomes the company's policy to fix everything. They begin healing people off the street whether they're blind or stuck in a wheelchair; their ailments are all miraculously cured. Damaged cells are repaired and can even regenerate, but in reality it's as if Will is building a hybrid army. In the grand scheme of things, quantum processors and a field full of solar panels doesn't seem like that much of an advancement from where we are now.Will is stuck in this constant loop of evolving while Evelyn suddenly begins to feel betrayed and violated. Then there's Max's side of the equation with the mindset that this technology has gone too far and it needs to meet its end. It's a copy and paste command taken to the absolute extreme.""Transcendence"" is able to boast some extraordinary cinematography, but it lacks a heartfelt performance from anyone in the cast. This science fiction thriller is like a really unpolished, chunky puree that combines ""The Lawnmower Man,"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" and the ending to ""The World's End.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXS93M8DHYRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEQOCC0#wasThisHelpful","R1LXS93M8DHYRU","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first five minutes of ""Dom Hemingway"" are devoted to Jude Law going on a narcissistic tangent about how magnificent his genitalia is. The brief moments leading up to Dom's release from prison are stylized unusually; red screen, voice overs, and an image of Dom with a washed out contrast used for the title sequence. Dom's slow-motion strut signifying his status as a free man with dozens of cellmates chanting his name and throwing rolls of toilet paper in celebration informs you that this man has one hell of a story to tell.The humor in this British black comedy is fairly dark and twisted. Dom tracks down the man who his wife married after he went to prison, confronts him, and beats him within an inch of his life the very first thing after being let out. While Dom is sitting there catching his breath, he recognizes an old friend and catches up with him a bit before threatening the other man's life again. The majority of the comedy comes from Dom's explosive tirades and his inability to use any sort of filter whenever he speaks.At its core, ""Dom Hemingway"" is more than a crude film about a corrupt man convinced he's owed this massive debt. Dom missed his daughter's childhood and wants more than anything to be a part of her life again. In her early 20s, Evelyn (Emilia Clarke) is married with a child of her own yet wants nothing from the man who stepped out of her life over a decade ago. Dom meets a woman named Melody (Kerry Condon) along his adventures, who serves as a reminder that lady luck is never too far away from any situation.Despite Dom showing signs that he might slowly be drifting from the destructive path he finds himself barreling down the arc the character goes through is a sloppy one. Everything seems to rely on whether luck is on your side or not. Over the course of the film Dom realizes that everything comes full circle without him putting any sort of effort into really changing his ways. Everything ends up fixing itself when Dom is at his worst solely because luck is destined to help him out when he needs it the most.Jude Law gives an extremely passionate performance fueled by explosive fits of rage in ""Dom Hemingway."" Law is in rare form here and is undeniably mesmerizing as the venom spewing, short fused, alcohol dependent titular character. Vulgar on the surface, ""Dom Hemingway"" is actually the story of a man short on his luck who desperately wants to reconnect with his daughter. Unfortunately the story finds itself running in circles and nothing feels resolved. ""Dom Hemingway"" feels like a Guy Ritchie film the English director would never admit to writing or directing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECXZE2A20B84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDEZPGG#wasThisHelpful","R3ECXZE2A20B84","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cheap Thrills"" seems like the type of film that makes an excuse to show the most gruesome and horrific sequences that come to mind and attempts to pass it off as entertainment, but it's actually a very well crafted black comedy thriller that sheds lights on human nature and what one individual will do when he or she faces desperation.The film is an unexpected surprise from act one, especially when it comes to the level of acting from everyone involved. Besides ""Piranha 3DD,"" this is probably the closest thing to horror David Koechner has ever done in his nearly two decade acting career. While on the surface, Colin (Koechner) just seems to be looking for a good time and a party worthy enough to satisfy his wife's birthday but there's a dark twist to Colin's behavior; a twist that isn't necessarily unforeseeable but is rather ballsy nevertheless. Meanwhile Pat Healy, who is no stranger to the characters he portrays being described as the creepy comedic relief (""The Innkeepers"") or smarmy and treacherous (""Compliance""), does a bit of a 180 in ""Cheap Thrills."" Craig seems to be a guy who had a troubled past, but now focuses on being the husband and father that he needs to be. Scared of what awaits in an incomeless future, Craig sees a way to make ends meet until an opportunity presents himself with Colin's challenges.Ethan Embry's take on the Vince character is absorbing. Vince is basically the muscle and debt collector for some shady investor (loan shark? drug dealer?). In his own words, he's still one step away from finding himself back in prison. While he makes enough money to support himself, he needs the amount of money Colin is offering to eventually step away. Violet (Sara Paxton) is very withdrawn, but reasonably so. She's the beautiful woman who has already gotten everything she's ever wanted. So what could possibly satisfy her?When these four actors get together on-screen, something special happens. Conversations between Craig and Vince fluctuate between pure determination, utter desperation, and frightening intensity while Colin is the puppet master pulling the strings with his lovely assistant Violet doing everything she possibly can from behind the curtain.What makes ""Cheap Thrills"" so fascinating is its dissection of the human spirit. What lengths would one person go through for expendable income? Would it be any different for a large enough amount of money that could change your lifestyle? Friendships dissolve and morals are thrown out the window. All that matters is walking away with that prize money even if you find yourself doing the most humiliating or disgusting thing imaginable. Greed is certainly a factor, but providing for those you love is absolutely a part of that as well.""Cheap Thrills"" has this dark atmosphere that is undeniably reminiscent of a horrific film like ""Saw,"" but there's more meaning behind ""Cheap Thrills."" It's about pushing the limits of how ugly human nature can really get when it's taken to its limits. This is more like a deranged version of ""Fear Factor"" where you get rewarded for disfigurement and bloodshed yet questions how far one individual is willing to go for expendable currency. Preying on the desperate results in molding one's actions into anything anyone desires and in this case it's something sadistically meaningful. ""Cheap Thrills"" takes pride in being the devil's advocate to human desires and playing its pawns like the sweet antique ivory keys of a piano.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2N0N1PFK2OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY5QQY2#wasThisHelpful","R3L2N0N1PFK2OM","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""In Fear"" immediately introduces its audience to the fact that Tom and Lucy are about to be screwed no matter what they do. They lose their GPS signal, they decide to stay in the middle of nowhere, they're practically lead down their own downward spiral, and the finishing blow is losing their cell phone reception. You can see and feel the common threads of similar films in ""In Fear"" and yet it's still able to make its mark as far as atmosphere goes. The woods are a creepy place, especially at night, and ""In Fear"" capitalizes on that. The majority of the film takes place in Tom's car much like most of ""Saw"" took place in that one bathroom more than anything else. Not knowing what's out there is what causes the most tension; the rustling of leaves right before darkness hits, Lucy's hair being pulled, and Tom's car alarm going off for seemingly no reason. Tom and Lucy find themselves weaving down these winding and disorienting country roads while there is this impending sense of unknown perfectly established in the first half hour of the film, but naturally the film falls apart when it attempts to reveal its secluded horror.The film begins to wobble around the time tree branches begin scratching the car as Tom takes one too many swigs of alcohol while driving. A tree almost falls on them and a scarecrow spooks Lucy before someone in a mask lurks in the shadows while watching Tom urinate. You expect to get some answers by the time Max (Allen Leech) is introduced, but the character only makes things more confusing. It's very obvious where the Max character is going but his actions are just baffling, especially the entire fumbling around in the mud scene. You're given a face to who is causing everything, but nothing is ever really explained. It's as if it all comes back to the spilled drink at the pub at the beginning of the film. Did the other guy spill it? Did Tom spill it? Who bought who a round of drinks to keep the peace? The point of the matter is you don't really care.There are traces of films such as ""The Hitcher,"" ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" ""Joy Ride,"" and ""Hush"" wrapped up in the DNA of ""In Fear,"" but unfortunately that DNA is more of a clone than its own identity. There's no story and no purpose, so naturally it doesn't feel very gratifying. The ending leaves you on the verge of being infuriated since it's basically a one-sided game of cat and mouse with the cat obviously having the upper hand and the mouse not having any sort of chance whatsoever. ""In Fear"" is a promising thriller early on, but buckles under the tension it creates and leaves the viewer in a haze.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TYC3LKD5G9IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEM9PY4#wasThisHelpful","R2TYC3LKD5G9IW","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most impressive aspect of the fantasy action sequel directed by Israeli director Noam Murro is that all of the water in the film was digitally added in post-production. There are moments when the water looks halfway decent, but even as the strongest element in the film it's still fairly weak overall since you can still tell that everything you're looking at is computer generated. There's also one really fantastic sense of perspective that utilizes the 3D element incredibly well when Xerxes is standing over the masses at the beginning of the film.You can expect to pack your bags and head back home after that since ""300: Rise of an Empire"" offers nothing you haven't already seen before. The action scenes are swift at times, but also incorporate those weird moments of slow-motion to highlight the film's gore with blood as thick as mud. The extremely filtered and sharp use of colors such as browns, reds, and blacks also return along with drastic lighting and heavy shadows. Extended fight sequences seem somewhat impressive at first until you realize that it's all computer generated and you're basically watching a glorified video game on the big screen. Every action sequence is the same series of movements and events repeated over and over again for nearly two hours; shields clang together, blades slice, men grunt loudly, and blood splatters everywhere in slow-motion. Wash, rinse, and repeat.It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the unrealistic amounts of blood that tend to explode and geyser out of mere slices of flesh. It's to the extent of squirting blood all over the wall from a paper cut; it's that ridiculous. Queen Gorgo repeats the same, ""This is Sparta,"" line while Themistocles offers up the same kick Leonidas gave to Xerxes' messenger in the first film. That overflowing sense of stubborn Greek and Spartan pride is also still quite apparent as no one seems to listen to reason. Not only is there a lot of yelling, but there are nearly half a dozen motivational speeches to get the troops prepared to die horribly in battle. Why in the world would you go into battle wearing nothing but briefs and a pectoral buckle anyway? Is showcasing your beefcake manliness really that important? Do you really want to end up wearing your chiseled six pack of greatness as a hat by the end of the day?The acting is very rigid since everyone in the film is portraying that determined warrior hellbent on glory for their people and they all say their lines very dramatically while screaming certain words to make a point like, ""FOR SPARTA!"" and ""EEEYAAAAHHHHRRRNNNGGHHH!!!"" But Eva Green seems to take it to this entirely different area of atrociousness. Her voice is very crusty as if she smoked seven packs of cigarettes a day to prepare for her role. Then she has the nastiest and most disturbing sex scene of 2014 that involves choking, hair pulling, slapping, squawking and grunting noises a hippopotamus might make when it's trying to defecate, and distorted facial expressions that look to be caused by pain or constipation. Not to mention Artemesia has some of the worst technicians any war could possibly ask for.All of Greece seems to either be dusty or on fire since particles are constantly floating around in ""300: Rise of an Empire."" You get so sick of dismembered limbs, severed heads, and thick blood spouting out of the screen to try to stir up excitement. Abs jiggle, computerized gore is overdone, speeches lifted straight out of ""Braveheart"" nearly put you to sleep and push the definition of redundancy, and the acting makes you cringe in a contender for one of the worst films of the year. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is so bad it nearly destroys what little hope ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" had of actually being worthwhile.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3JWW3V7XOR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEJL6Q8#wasThisHelpful","RN3JWW3V7XOR9","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saying Bill Marks is a grizzled man is a bit of an understatement. The blurry opening of ""Non-Stop"" reveals a scraggly Liam Neeson with sloppy hair and a scruffy beard. Bill looks like he's pulled six all-nighters in a row as he takes another swig of liquid courage from a coffee mug in his attempt to drown out the world around him. You also notice him admiring couples and seemingly hating technology; cell phones in particular. He glares at cell phones with such discontent that you can't help but think that about the character. After retrieving the bear of a little girl flying solo for the first time and revealing his fear of flying to the peculiar woman sitting next to him named Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), Bill makes his way to the restroom, slaps duct tape over the smoke detector, lays his weapon and everything in his pockets neatly on the table, and calms his nerves with some nicotine. It's at this point where it's revealed Bill is actually an air marshal. You have to plow through the film to hear the rest of Bill's story, but in actuality it's all a gigantic waste of time.Things don't really get too ridiculous until Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll), a passenger who is also an NYPD officer, opens his mouth. Not only is he the epitome of New York stereotypes, but he also shares the key scene in which the action thriller takes a turn for the worst. Reilly says something along the lines of, ""What are you gonna do?"" Bill, with his gun crammed in Reilly's neck, replies, ""From one cop to another, you know."" What's disappointing is that even the action scenes aren't impressive. There's a fist fight in the bathroom that is the closest thing to anything remotely rewarding in the film, but you honestly just find yourself trying to choke back jokes regarding Liam Neeson joining the mile high club. On a slight upside, the way the film utilizes a broken phone into the texts that are shown on-screen is slightly amusing.The rest of the time is just devoted to Liam Neeson defying logic and saving the day solely because he's Liam Neeson. He leaves a trail of dead bodies on an airplane and none of the other passengers ever find any of the victims or stumble onto them. A good portion of the passengers left alive are beaten to a pulp thanks to Bill as he slams them around the plane and resorts to beating a teacher and a lawyer before suspecting the few people left who still trust him. He shoves Tom Bowen (Scott McNairy) around the plane with his arm pinned to his back and seems to use the poor guy as a ventriloquist dummy. The climax takes ludricousness to an entirely new level. It culminates with Neeson firing his weapon and hitting its mark in zero gravity in slow-motion with a plane missing half of its exterior as it dives to 8,000 feet.""Non-Stop"" is unbelievably bad, which is really unfortunate since Liam Neeson is perfectly capable of delivering the goods. When crashing the plane is the only answer to a hijacked plane, when piling all of your luggage onto a bomb is the only solution, and when a heart condition is used to explain why someone likes the window seat, then ""Non-Stop"" is the answer. Now if the theme song to ""Team America: World Police"" had just played over the end credits, then this might have been somewhat worthwhile. What you're left with is a film that is reminiscent of ""Transporter 2,"" which is an action film everyone is very satisfied forgetting it actually exists.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVNW6W49R6IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTD49C#wasThisHelpful","R1CVNW6W49R6IH","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Almost Human"" is shorter than ""Cloverfield"" and has around an 8-minute end credit sequence solely to be long enough to be entered into the festival circuit. This may make it seem like the sci-fi horror film is rushed along, but its fast pace is actually fairly comfortable and it fits the film very well. The film draws influences from some of the most respectable cult classics. The opening credits and the film mostly taking place in the middle of the woods gives it a ""Friday the 13th"" atmosphere while the music seems like the forgotten score John Carpenter never released. As the film progresses, you're immediately reminded of ""The Thing"" and ""Halloween"" during the final act. The violent, murderous rampage also has some better than decent yet not quite great gore thanks to its practical makeup effects.It's difficult to root for Seth though because he's so twitchy. While Jen seems to have forgotten everything that happened the night Mark disappeared, Seth just wants to wake her up to the nightmarish sights and sounds he does remember. He isn't heroic and he doesn't want to save anyone. He just wants his life to go back to normal after Jen told the media that he was behind everything and it ruined his life. In other words, Seth only cares about himself.There's this entire sequence where Seth doesn't seem to understand anything anyone is telling him. He mutters the phrase, ""What's that supposed to mean,"" several times in less than five minutes. Mark always seems to ask questions without giving anyone a chance to actually answer. He asks a man cutting firewood why he's living in his house before blasting him with a shotgun and thrusting a hatchet into the back of his skull before the poor guy can give an actual answer. Seth is trying to load a rifle while Jen is in trouble. Hes rushed and in a panic, but cant seem to get any of the shells into the actual gun. So he just throws the entire supply on the floor. While the film has several positive influences, the other influences aren't so great. ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is passable since the acting in that sequel is some of the best in the ""Friday the 13th"" series, but ""Almost Human"" is a lot like ""Dreamcatcher"" at the end of the day and that's something no film should try to ride the coattails of.""Almost Human"" would be a decent first film for anyone, but its abrupt ending and familiarities hurt it more than anything else. Nothing is really explained by the end of the film and you're left wondering why aliens have a thing about turning our televisions on, making prank calls, turning the lights on and off, and possess impregnating elongated mouth funnels. While ""Almost Human"" pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YBZ1MHT6YZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKG21F8#wasThisHelpful","R17YBZ1MHT6YZC","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The opening to ""Adult World"" is enough to let you know what you're in for as you witness Amy attempt to commit suicide by sticking her head in the oven and putting a plastic bag over her head. After getting a job at Adult World, Amy's boss is a very down to earth guy named Alex (Evan Peters) who may work at an adult video store, but has no issue with that whatsoever and he doesn't let that affect his other interests. It's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia (Armando Riesco) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack. Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet. She makes childish mistakes, but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child. She's irritating, has a nerve-grating voice, is naive, and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her. Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment, but the most interesting character is Rubia. The character really doesn't do much other than smoke pot, ride a stolen bicycle, and give other women makeovers, but Rubia never pretends to be anything that she isn't. Amy asks Rubia in one scene if she has ever felt invisible. Rubia's face distorts as she says, ""Not really."" It's as if Rubia has all the attention she's ever wanted while Amy continues to search for the big break she's always craved.If you can persevere through Amy's temper tantrums and John Cusack acting like he has no interest in being in ""Adult World,"" then there actually is something really positive and inspirational lying under layers within the film. Like ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" ""Adult World"" seems to speak to you if you've ever felt like a struggling artist. Along the way, Amy learns that it's not just about making a name for yourself, getting rich, or becoming famous. You can't make a carbon copy of the path your idol took or follow in anyone else's footsteps. Sometimes you have to take your own path and create your art just for you.""Adult World"" has this really exceptional message wrapped up in this unbelievably obnoxious package that almost makes the entire experience unbearable. It's like a really disgusting bag of garbage filled with rotting produce and decomposing meats; the type of garbage that creates that dirty, brown trash juice you always find bleeding out of dumpsters. Yet in the middle of that bag is something worthwhile like a forgotten treasure map or one of your favorite comic books magically still in mint condition. ""Adult World"" may have meaning, but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered, prepubescent, overdramatic whimpering just to get to it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24P2RWBLZ35R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG1AL8Q#wasThisHelpful","R24P2RWBLZ35R1","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aside from ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns,"" director Stephen Sommers directed and contributed to the writing for films like ""Van Helsing"" and ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" The issue is that ""Odd Thomas"" feels extremely outdated like if ""The Mummy"" from 1999 was released today. Financial woes seemed to plague the film not only during production but while trying to get a potential release, as well. So depending on how long the film sat on the shelf (for example ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was on the shelf for three years before release and yet was still awesome), it very well could be more dated than it seems.It should be apparent that Sommers is directing early on with the Arnold Vosloo cameo, nearly unbearable humor, and cheesy special effects. It isn't so much a bad thing that Sommers is still making films today, but it seems like the Indianapolis born director is completely blind to what audiences want these days and keeps making the types of films that may have been successful 15 years ago.""Odd Thomas"" suffers from a rambling narrative that adores the sound of its own voice. Odd narrates his own story, which is fine, but it honestly just seems like an excuse to hear the character that much more. Odd is constantly talking. He's very quirky and weird and he lives up to his name, but his speeches get on your nerves and just when you think you'll have a moment of peace and quiet he chimes in with a voiceover that lasts another three minutes to drive you insane. His relationship with Stormy is so lovey-dovey that it'll make you sick. The special effects look like something that would be found on a movie made specifically for SyFy. The Bodachs alone would be fine, but what is the purpose of computer generating a cucumber that Odd is slicing at work?If Dean Koontz isn't ashamed of the film adaptation of his ""Odd Thomas"" series, then he either really doesn't care about the characters he creates or the books are just as awful as the film if not more so. ""Odd Thomas"" is a sloppy mixture of what could otherwise be a fun thriller. It's like a really lazy rip off of Peter Jackson's ""The Frighteners"" if it was made 18 years too late. With atrocious attempts at humor, force-fed romantic drivel shoved in your face whenever Odd and Stormy are on screen together, a main character who never knows when to shut up, and an ending you can see coming long before the climax hits, it's no wonder the film had financial problems. Now if we could just figure out how in the world the film landed respectable talent like Willem Dafoe and Patton Oswalt, then our faith in humanity might be restored.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q96N8SCPEO9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHYF570#wasThisHelpful","R2Q96N8SCPEO9M","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Mr. Nobody"" began its run on the festival circuit back in 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada in late 2010. The film was finally released in theaters in the United States in November of 2013; although obviously it had a limited run. It had been nearly four years since this critics first viewing of the film, so it was in dire need of a revisit to see if it had held up over that inevitable passing of time that the film brings into question at every turn. For the most part, ""Mr. Nobody"" is still the fantastic yet abstract and surreal experience it was when it was first released.It's quite incredible looking back at Jared Leto's acting career. The Louisiana-born actor is mostly known for his roles in ""American Psycho,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and ""Lord of War"" and Leto has currently been getting a ton of awards for his performance as the AIDS-stricken drag queen Rayon in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Leto's performance in ""Mr. Nobody"" has shades of the impeccable talent Leto puts on full display in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Leto not only plays different versions of himself in ""Mr. Nobody,"" but the older version of himself is quite believable thanks not only to spectacular makeup effects but also because Leto is surprisingly convincing as an old man. With his trembling movements and the way his raspy vocals seem to quaver uncontrollably from just simply speaking of his extraordinary past, Leto illustrates that he's one of the most talented actors working today.The science fiction drama by Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael has a way of making you question your existence quite literally. The film often brings in the movement of time; why does it always have to move forward? Can it be manipulated? ""Mr. Nobody"" looks at every possible decision a specific individual can make in their lifetime and how those lives are affected by every decision he or she has made. It's a lot to take in and it's even more to find yourself contemplating, but the film stays with you for that reason alone. It's practically guaranteed you'll reflect on what you've done in your lifetime once ""Mr. Nobody"" ends and what could have been if you had just taken a different path. No matter how drastic or minuscule those changes might be, your life would be forever altered because of them.However, there are a few setbacks that stick out after seeing the film a second time; the main issue being that the duration is a bit too long. Sitting at nearly 160 minutes, ""Mr. Nobody"" does tend to drag quite a bit at times especially when such a large portion of the film is devoted to a teenage Nemo (portrayed by Toby Regbo) and his crush Anna (Juno Temple) rolling around under sheets in their underwear and chasing each other's genitals when they are practically brother and sister. Sarah Polley will also infuriate you. The Elise character cries at absolutely everything and is crippled by depression, but her griping of wondering what the problem is and being a bad parent could probably be solved by getting up and not drowning in a violent tantrum puddle of her own epiphora every time she's on screen.Pondering your existence and realizing that not making a decision is the only decision are a few of the things ""Mr. Nobody"" touches on. You're where you are right now because of certain decisions you made in your life. But where would you be if you had lived with your dad instead of your mom growing up? Or if you married someone else? The possibilities are endless and ""Mr. Nobody"" portrays those what if scenarios flawlessly.Complex, visually stunning, and pleasantly convoluted in an enjoyable sense, ""Mr. Nobody"" is a film that seems like it can't be confined to one genre and while time flows in one continuous direction ""Mr. Nobody"" makes it a point to constantly pedal in the opposite direction. Let your mind wander and drift into the bowels of yourself while viewing the bizarre, dreamlike, and intricate sequences of ""Mr. Nobody.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26D7D698UH65D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3JHGBC#wasThisHelpful","R26D7D698UH65D","A3TYC8T6W81DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TYC8T6W81DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed this installment of this adventure! A lot happened in this episode, and I really thought the action was well-developed. Sarah was certainly put through the wringer, and it was a good opportunity for the men (yes, plural!) in her life to rise to the occasion and finally figure out their true feelings for her. It was neat to see different friendships emerge through these crises as well.While the adventure/story really developed well in this episode, I still felt like I didn't get to know the people as well as I wanted to. Perhaps some of that will come in the next three installments, but I wanted to know more about the whys/hows of what was going on than I got. Perhaps that's just the nature of this episodic type story?Overall, I did enjoy this installment.

"A Love Like Ours combines some of my favorite plot elements in a novelreuniting childhood friends, all things cowboy/horses, siblings, a military hero, and some sort of trauma or difficulty that keeps resurfacing. It's like Becky Wade KNOWS me or something! [wink] But seriously, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent with this story.I'm really loving this Porter family. While each book focuses on one specific sibling, the others pop up from time to time. When Jake needs a ""kick in the pants,"" his siblings are right there ready to encourage him (or shove him) out of his comfort zone. And Jake really is an amazing guy. Of course, the trauma he's experienced affects just about everything in his life, but throughout the story, he's struggling and working to move past it.And Lyndie is great. She's passionate and fun and such a great friend. I loved her interactions with Jake (of course!), but it was also fun to see her friendship with Amber and her son blossom. Amber's dating challenge was also a funny, light-hearted element that I appreciated since much of the book is a little more serious. I could give them a run for their money on some of those dating stories!I loved this book! Great characters, strong faith elements, and a plot that provided more than just a simple romance story.

"I honestly think that every one of Colleen Coble's books is better than the last. She's gifted us with books in several genres, but my favorites are her suspense novels. And The Inn at Ocean's Edge is a definite winner!From the very first chapter, the book is chock full of suspenseful happeningsmissing people, murder, kidnapping, assault, and more. When you add in the more personal elements of the story, it really does feel like a double episode of your favorite TV drama, and somehow it all works together.It's hard to identify a favorite element of the story, but for me, it's probably a tie between characters and setting. Luke and Claire seem as different as any two protagonists, but they keep bumping into each other and find they have more in common than they initially thought. He's so considerate and compassionatedespite his own personal drama throughout the booktoward Claire, and it really adds to his charm. Claire comes on as this strong, confident character that is quickly shaken to the core as one thing after the other strips away everything she knew to be true of her life. They really balance each other out.And then the setting . . . Maine! I've been dreaming of a trip to Maine for the last year, so it was interesting to read about this place I've been researching and dreaming about. Coble works in a few traditional Maine experiences (lobster rolls, anyone?!), which gives readers a bit of a vacation via novel experience.I pretty much loved everything about this book. I found myself reading LATE into the night and rising early to get in a few more pages before work. You know it's a good book when even sleep is trumped!

"After reading the first four books in Dani Pettrey's Alaskan Courage series, I was a little conflicted about the release of Sabotaged, which is the fifth and final book in the series. I mean, of course, I was excited for another Dani Pettrey novel (who wouldn't be?!) but I hate saying farewell to characters I've come to know and love (the McKennas, y'all!).Sabotaged is a slight departure from the rest of the series. It doesn't feel quite as adventurous because much of the story takes place away from the race. And the overall pace feels much slower. However, as the story progresses and the clues begin to fit together, I felt the urgency fueling the characters' actions and got swept up in the mystery.It was also interesting to see Reef and Kirra finally be thrown together after getting hints that there could be a romance between the two of them earlier in the series. They've known each other since Kindergarten, so a lot of the ""get to know you"" stuff is out of the way. In Sabotaged, we get to see them get to know each other as adults, work through baggage from past relationships, and figure out their feelings for each other. Although it happened pretty quickly, the relationship felt natural. I really enjoyed digging into Kirra's pastbetween a tragedy in college and family secrets, there's a lot to explore there. I wish we could have gotten in on more of Reef's past and the change that's come about.As always, one of my favorite aspects of a family series is getting to connect with other characters/siblings from previous books. Two of the other couples played significant roles in Sabotaged, and a wonderful epilogue at the end tied the series together quite nicely.If you've somehow missed out on this series, I highly recommend it! While each book can be read as a stand alone novel, I think you should read them in order for maximum enjoyment.

"Liz Tolsma is a relatively new author. I have read her previous two novelsSnow on the Tulips and Daisies Are Foreverand greatly enjoyed them. It seems that lots of WWII novels are coming out these days, but Tolsma puts a bit of a different twist on her stories. Her stories are inspired by family members and family friends who lived through it.As with the previous two books, I found Remember the Lilies to be very unique. I don't believe I've ever read a book set primarily within the walls of an internment camp. However, what could have been a very dark book turned out to be very hope-filled, with a strong gospel message. It's definitely not an easy read, but I was never left ""down"" for long.I really enjoyed the two main characters. It was hard to imagine a romance blossoming under such dire circumstances, but the author pulled it off well. The character development was strong throughout, and I grew to like them both more and more as the story went on.As several other reviewers have mentioned, I did wish that there was a bit more description of the camp. Unfortunately, I don't have much knowledge at all of this particular aspect of the war, so it was difficult for me to grasp. (I recently found a three-part interview with an internment camp survivor on the author's blog that shed some light on the true living conditions they experienced. Reading it would definitely be helpful in understanding the book better.) Additionally, I felt like the book was a tad slow in a few places.Overall, I truly enjoyed this story. It's not often that you read a wonderful story with such rich, historical detail. Fans of historical fiction are sure to enjoy Remember the Lilies.

"I think it's safe to say that The Dandelion Field is unlike any other book I've read recently, maybe ever. There are essentially two main stories running concurrently. One focuses on Raine and Cody and their unintended teenage pregnancy. The other focuses on Gin and Dan as adults who care about these teenagers in trouble, struggling with their own baggage, and possibly falling in love. There's a lot packed into these 350 pages, but Kathryn Springer pulls it off easily.The characters are fascinating. With four main characters and a decent-sized supporting cast, it would be easy to assume that they would be fairly simple or one-dimensional. Fortunately for us, the author does a phenomenal job of creating a full cast of characters that are real. They each have traits that made me love them, as well as flaws that made them human and baggage that made the story more interesting.From the very first page until well after I finished the book, I could not stop thinking about this story. It's beautiful, and I loved that the author faced some really difficult topics head on. Additionally, faith is central to the story and is a perfect complement to every aspect of the book.The Dandelion Field is a compelling story that tackles tough issues with humor, romance, and faith. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. In my opinion, it's a must read!

"As I've come to expect from Susan May Warren, Always On My Mind is equal parts romantic, poignant, and can't-put-this-down. The Christiansens are one of my favorite families right now in Christian fiction, so I was excited to dive into another story that would allow me to catch up with them againespecially after the cliff-hanger nature of the ending for the sibling stories of When I Fall in Love (the third book in the series).Casper and Raina were both featured as secondary characters in When I Fall in Love. Casper was so sweet and an all-around good guy. I was really rooting for him and sad at how things seemed to be working out for him with all the conflict between him and his brother. Raina, too, was a girl I instantly liked. Sure, she had a ton of issues and a history of making bad choices, but there was something about her that still made her likeable. To see them get their own story was a treat!Casper and Raina have both faced challenges since we've seen them. Casper seems to be falling apart a bit, but his return home greets him with one huge, unfortunate surprise as well as support from his family. It was nice to see how he worked so hard to prove himself as trustworthy and not just an adventure-seeker.Raina is determined to face her new life independently of everyone else, which drove me crazy. So many people wanted to help her and she just wasn't having it. But I sort of understood why she wanted to make it on her own. Her biggest issue was that she didn't believe she deserved anything good. Of course, Casper is determined to show her otherwise!As far as secondary stories go, Dare is featured in the book. He's starting to fold under the stress of trying to reopen the resort. I think this is one thing that I both like and dislike about this series. It's more realistic to see that characters aren't just left to lead perfect lives once they fall in love, but I hate seeing bad things happen to characters I've come to love! I felt like this story arc added depth and richness to the story, so for all my angst over Dare and Ivy, it was worth it. :)So many issues are addressed in this book, and I loved the focus on valuing every life. Raina's difficult decision about whether to raise her baby or find an adoptive family is gut-wrenching, but I loved that this was part of the story. I felt like this theme played out with just about every characterour identity and worth is in Christ alone.Overall, this was a wonderful book. I highly recommend Always On My Mind for readers who enjoy emotional romance stories. Just a suggestion, though, start at the beginning of the series. It will definitely be worth it to catch up!

"I was really impressed with Under the Lawman's Protection. Let's be honest, 224 pages isn't a lot of time to develop a suspenseful plot without leaving a bunch of loose ends or giving readers a too-basic plot. Scott does neither. The book was packed with action. The characters were compelling. The mystery was intriguing and ""twisty"" enough to keep my interest. I enjoyed reconnecting with Isaac's friends who were featured in previous books in the series as well. If you're looking for a quick, suspenseful read with a nice romantic thread, you're sure to enjoy Under the Lawman's Protection by Laura Scott.

"I REALLY wanted to like this book. The premise was interesting, and knowing that this is Jamie Carie's first venture into self-publishing made me anxious to support her. Unfortunately, Rush to the Altar was a big disappointment for me.The story was intriguing and started off strong. However, as the book went on, it became a bit much. It was just too much for me to really believe what was going on. (Yes, it's fiction, and sometimes suspending belief is important, but this was more than that.)Character development was lacking. And I believe that the book would greatly benefit from a round or two of editing. Grammatical errors abound, and there are quite a few plot errors that made it difficult to understand what was happening. (For instance, the characters enter a restaurant, then are in a hotel room, and then are in a cab on the way to the restaurant. Yes, the same restaurant they were just in a few paragraphs prior.)One last thing to point out. Jamie Carie has written Christian fiction in the past. I didn't really feel like this book was written in that same vein. It's a clean book, but not one I would classify as Christian.Would I recommend this book? Not really.Would I read another book by Jamie Carie in the future? Possibly. Her track record is strong, which makes me hope she has another awesome story in her.

"I saw this one on Net Galley and grabbed it up because the premise sounded interesting because it's a bit different. Unfortunately, this wasn't a good fit for me. The story was a bit blah and depressing. It felt like a ""coming of age"" story but the main character was almost 40. And there are a few ""scenes"" that were just crass (not even romantic). I didn't see the point in adding those bits in except to be racy.

"I'm a huge fan of Rachel Hauck, and she pulled off a great novella with A Brush with Love. It's hard to truly develop a full story with interesting characters in so few pages, but Hauck manages to do just that. I truly enjoyed every aspect of this story and was sad to see it end.How many romance stories have you read where the girl isn't the most beautiful girl in the world? Not many. Well, in this story, Ginger is beautiful, but because of a past tragedy which has left her covered with scars, she believes she is ugly. I loved this aspect of the book. The way Tom befriended her and helped her learn to see herself the same way he does.

"The release of Star Wars: Aftermath marks the official relaunch of the Star Wars Expanded Universe into post-Return of the Jedi territory. It is also a release that has been greeted with a rather rabid divisiveness among the Star Wars fandom community. When it released on Force Friday (Sept. 4, 2015 to the rest of the world), it was assailed almost immediately with one star reviews, with online groups devoted to the original Expanded Universe -- titles now marketed under the Star Wars: Legends banner -- encouraging fans to buy the Legends titles in an effort to outsell Aftermath. That doesn't seem to have worked as, at the time of this writing, Aftermath is now sitting in fourth place on the USA Today and NY Times Bestseller lists. The more vocal and ferociously devoted fans of the previous Expanded Universe have also taken umbrage at the inclusion of gay characters, strong female leads, the lack of the film's heroes, and apparently any and all non-one-star reviews posted at Amazon.Given the intense backlash meeting this new entry to the brand-new Star Wars canon, the immediate question is, is Aftermath any good?The answer is, thankfully, yes. We're off to a pretty strong start with the relaunch, with a few enticing teases during this book's resolution that promises to only get better.Opening with the immortal words, ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" and giving us a brief ""crawl"" through recent events to establish this story, you'd be hard pressed to not hear the infamous opening notes of John Williams' score.As noted, this book is free of Luke Skywalker, while Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia pop up ever-so briefly in cameo appearances (the Han Solo cameo in particular is pretty tantalizing and opens up the door for what should be a pretty solid adventure in its own right).Our characters here are Norra Wexley, an ace Rebel Alliance pilot, her son Temmin, an ex-Imperial Loyalty Officer Sinjir Rath Velus (whose motivations are explained wonderfully and with a gracious bit of depth and truth for a man in his position late in the book), and a bounty hunter, Jas. Temmin has some robot-building mojo and has updated one of those ridiculous, monotonous, and childishly awful battle droids from The Phantom Menace to be his personal bodyguard. More impressive, Wendig has taken this battle droid, named Mister Bones because of the animal bones it wears as a sort of stylized armor, and because it was named by a 15-year-old, and turned it into something interesting and humorous.On the villain side, we are treated to Admiral Rae Sloane, who has captured Rebel/New Republic pilot Wedge Antilles, and has organized a meeting on the planet Akiva in an effort to reunite the fractured Empire. Among those gathered are a prominent banker and slaver, who is in the crosshairs of the bounty hunter, Jas.What could have been a pretty good Star Wars story in its own right takes on an epic scope with a series of interludes. In these vignettes, Wendig is able to explore the ramifications of the war between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, and the reader is able to get a deeper sense of the state of the galaxy, the threat the Empire still poses, and the process of rebuilding as the Alliance shifts gears towards becoming the democratic New Republic. I loved getting a peek into all these various corners of the galaxy and these characters responses to the conflicts affecting their lives, either directly or indirectly.Writing in third person, present tense - a stylistic choice that Wendig has used in his previous novels - the story is given a sense of graceful urgency, propelling the reader along through the action. Some have voiced their displeasure at this approach, but I have zero problems with it and, as with previous Wendig books, I was able to sink right in and enjoy.Star Wars: Aftermath is a good, fun start to a new series of books, and one that provides enough galactic intrigue to start building depth across the gap between this title and the release of the film, The Force Awakens, later this year. If, like me, you had no particular attachments to the previous Expanded Universe, it's a good time to dive in without worrying about continuity outside of the films. But, if you did have a strong attachment to those prior novels, I still encourage to approach this work with an open mind and decide for yourself.On a sliding scale to the film comparisons, I'd say it is not as terrible as The Phantom Menace, but at least as good as Attack of the Clones and a solid follow-on from Return of the Jedi. We might not be into The Empire Strikes Back territory, but the set-up promised in the final chapters of Aftermath looks like there's a very fun story ahead of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2FZ8NZRYRM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI489U#wasThisHelpful","R1C2FZ8NZRYRM9","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed Lisa von Biela's previous medical thriller, BLOCKBUSTER, and I think she's topped that effort here. BROKEN CHAIN presents take on the apocalypse, using GMOs - the early 21st Century go-to villain for sci-fi horror - and some fun concepts, like a peculiar doomsday prepper who operates under the nom de guerre ""The Fox.""The science at the book's core, presented through a CDC scientist searching for the cause behind a growing epidemic of violence, was scarily plausible. Equally plausible and frightening was the mismanagement of vaccinations under the thumb of Homeland Security and product development by the greedy corporation, Cornucopia, seeking to cash in on the doomsday scenario wreaking havoc with the food chain.BROKEN CHAIN is a quick and easy read that presents a great twist on the apocalypse genre, and fuses together a few present-day paranoias into a terrific story.[Note: I obtained a review copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGU9OWCXJNT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1950544850#wasThisHelpful","RJGU9OWCXJNT7","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rick Chesler's LUNA is a decent enough read, but it lacks surprises and I found the horror element to be pretty light, which is unfortunate.There's also a few big questions surrounding the nature of the threat itself - massive worms on the moon! - such as, how do these buggers survive on the barren, lifeless Moon? What do they eat, aside from the occasional and rather rare astronaut? How the heck did they evolve? These are fairly basic issues, but beyond the scope of this book and the science takes a backseat. Still, I'd like to have some exploration of these topics, but maybe that's a hang-up particular only to me.The worms themselves and the setting of the moon do make for an interesting concept with an intriguing setting for a horror novel, but I never found myself much invested in the threats presented or the characters risking certain doom.[Note: I borrowed this book through the Kindle Owner's Lending Library.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHQT5E08ZFRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I5PH0K#wasThisHelpful","R1HHQT5E08ZFRT","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian Morelands Darkness Rising sucked me in right from the very beginning, with a cold open revolving around the brutal murder of a couple by the lake. Their assailants are a trio of crazies clad in animal masks, a la Youre Next, armed with knives and a video camera to record their depravity.Cut to: hapless, love-struck, and oft bullied Marty, a janitor at the local university who tutors his object of affection in Shakespeare and poetry. Shes way out of his league, and he confines his expressions of desire to the poems he writes in his private journal, reading them to himself at the lake. Ah, the lakeAll the pieces were there  poor Marty, his lover from a distance, Jennifer, and the mad sickos who use the lake as their twisted playground for depravity. I thought I knew where this story was going, thought I knew what to expect.And boy was I wrong.Moreland flips the script on its head rather nicely, shocking me out of my own complacency and delivering a ridiculously solid horror novella to while away the day with. I was more than a little disturbed at some of the characters backgrounds and history, which is exactly what you want in this type of story, but theres never an excess of detail or overwrought, trying-too-hard fumbling attempts to shock or turn the material toward the extreme (at least for my tastes).Darkness Rising is a terrific, well-paced story of woe, revenge, and redemption that even manages to say and symbolically convey a few neat things about the act of writing, while delivering some satisfying twists and surprises.

"Over the handful of titles Ive read from Hunter Shea, the man has proved to be an adept storyteller and is capable putting some clever twists in his ideas. He crafts fun little page turners, and over the last year several more of his titles have wound up on my electronic TBR list, with The Montauk Monster and his Jessica Backman books waiting on my Kindle.When I saw The Dover Demon pop up on NetGalley, it shot up to the top of my reading queue. I knew nothing of the mythology surrounding the Dover demon, but when I saw the cover I was already sold. Here was Hunter Shea writing an alien book!Thankfully, Shea delivers, as expected. Theres a nice bit of extraterrestrial mythology woven into the plot that takes alien conspiracy theories to the next level, and plenty of history on the allegedly real-life 1977 sighting of the titular creature. Even if, like me, youd not heard of the Dover demon before, Shea brings the reader up to speed and turns this local legend into a strange and terrific pulpy adventure.Here, Sam Brogna, his friend Tank, and their girlfriends, Kelly and Stephanie, were smoking dope and traveling down the Dover back-roads in 1977 when their car nearly hit a strange creature standing in the middle of the road.Almost 40 years later, Brogna is now a comic book shop owner and most of his income is derived from selling Dover Demon paraphernalia. Kelly is a drunk and lives in a home outfitted with security cameras, her office study wallpapered in accounts of alien abductions, cryptid lore, and tales of missing people. Tank and Stephanie have married, with the former now an archeologist. During a massive winter snowstorm, each find mysterious tracks surrounding their homes but with no clear trail. Theyve simply appeared, as if out of nowhere.The four are forced to reunite under the threat of the demons return, but their mission is given further urgency when Sams son, Nicky, goes missing.I really liked the relationship between Sam and his son, and enjoyed the brief call-outs to current comic book pop culture. Their characterizations really helped solidify the human element, and I felt invested with the group as a whole and sympathetic with Kelly and the fashion in which her life has unraveled since their initial sighting of the cryptid.I was also frequently surprised at the depth and sense of scope that Shea brought to the Dover demon mythology, and the way he connected it with ancient history using Tanks archeologist viewpoint to great effect. There were a few times that I thought Id figured out what was really happening here, only to hit another twist.Fans of alien lore and The X-Files should find quite a lot to enjoy here, and Id like to take a minute to implore Jonathan Maberry to include Mr. Shea in a future X-Files short story anthology, because the dude would fit right in.[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher via NetGalley.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NOPD23BF3UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y05TTZS#wasThisHelpful","R14NOPD23BF3UW","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TENEBRIS is a perfectly good read, but lacks the usual drive of unimaginable horrors and fear-tinged curiosity that made me a fan of Tim Curran's other works, such as DEAD SEA and BLACKOUT in particular.That said, this is still a solid and enjoyable tale of a nightmarish thunderbird that draws largely on Native American myth. Jim is a schoolteacher and survivor of an attack from the monstrosity, intent on finding the bird and killing it. Aiding him in his quest are a pair of cryptid hunters, Pettis and Shiner. We get the usual skeptic/believer dynamic from them, and they reminded a bit of The Lone Gunmen from The X-Files in their good-natured ribbing of one another.The characters are nicely developed, and I particularly enjoyed the interactions between Jim and his neighbor Nina, a retired zoologist who's been burned by other cryptid seekers before and has a natural distrust of Jim's new associates. After establishing characters and the underpinning mythology behind the narrative, things heat up nicely for the book's final third, with a few squirmy delights, but I felt as if the ending just kind of tapered off and was a bit anticlimactic.So, overall this is a decent novella but not as unrelenting as other recent Curran titles published by DarkFuse (see DOLL FACE and NIGHTCRALWERS, for instance).Note: I received a free copy of this title through the DarkFuse Book Club.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J59J0TCZZ3SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01417EA6C#wasThisHelpful","R2J59J0TCZZ3SE","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In short, I dont give a damn what NY Daily News says, Zer0es is a sheer f-ing blast and might very well be my favorite novel of the year. Although, I do reserve the right to change this opinion after I finish reading Chuck Wendigs next novel, Star Wars: Aftermath, due out in about two weeks, in which Mr. Wendig gets to play around in the SW universe. And that, my friends, could very well be the book of the decade century. But, for now, let us discuss Zer0es.In case you cant tell, Im a huge fan of Mr. Wendig, and whenever his new titles release I make it a point to read/devour them immediately. I love his Miriam Black books, and The Harvest Trilogy, and am looking forward to meeting up with Mookie Pearl again one of these days, preferably with a plate of charcuterie between us. All of this is to say that I might be a bit biased, but I do honestly feel that Zer0es earns each of the five stars Im giving it.Also worth noting is that I have very little real-world knowledge of computers, programming, or hacking. Or really how much of anything technologically works beyond the knowledge required to start, shut off, or play video games or watch movies. I care little for the inner workings of these things, and most computer talk bores the hell out of me. Im probably the last person you want to call for IT help, in other words.So, is Zer0es technically sound and accurate? I dont have a flipping clue. And I dont care if it is or not. Because what it is is a rock-solid bit of entertainment filled with techno-thriller whizz-bang shenanigans, a terrific amount of wit, and a healthy dose of science-fiction. As far as Wendigs skill in plumbing the dark shadow world of hackers goes, its good enough for me to escape into and provides enough plausible scary horrors to sink my teeth into. The more fantastical realms that these characters find themselves in as things progress are fun and makes for an action-packed, rapid-fire read  and frankly I wouldnt have it any other way. This is a great big cinematic summer blockbuster set to prose, and it freaking rocks, man.To his credit, Wendig casts as our lead, Chance, a guy who is basically a phony. His hacking skills are nill, and hes caught up in a scheme far larger than his limited abilities can cope with. A real underdog, this guy, and it gives me, as a reader, the chance to enjoy the experience alongside him. Hes not some uber computer god who can algo his way out of any awful situation. In fact, he gets his ass handed to him more often than not. The real hackers hes surrounded by are the real deal  theres the troll Reagan who gets off on internet shaming her victims and possess snark to spare, DeAndre the credit card scammer, Earthman, whos basically an old-school BBS-version of Edward Snowden, and Aleena, a hacker intent on bringing true democracy to Syria. Each of them are recruited by an FBI agent named Hollis Copper, Mr. Government himself, to become white hat (good guy) hackers in exchange for not spending at least a decade-plus in prison for their various crimes.Each of these characters have their own quirks, personalities, politics, and culture to bring to the table. Some are fighting for social justice, others for government accountability, and some just for laughs. Theres elements of the hacking group Anonymous, coupled with the Arab Spring, fighting back against rape culture and the grotesqueness of the Stubenville events. (Even a bit of obsession with Greek mythology when it comes to the central antagonist, which is just darn cool.) In short, this is a cast of well-defined characters with different skill sets, abilities, and goals. Together, theyre a total band of misfits with little in common and even less of a reason to become friends. They spend a lot of time sniping at each other and arguing, yet they somehow mesh well together as each are put through their paces and become a unified team, made stronger by their differences and disparities.Ultimately, I have very, very few quibbles about Zer0es. I found it to be a complete thrill-ride from start to finish, with little in the way of lag. And kudos to Wendig for taking a topic as dry as coding and hacking and transforming into something thats as equally exhilarating as the violence and mayhem surrounding these characters and their antagonists (which is pretty damn exhilarating, by the way). Now, bring on the 0nes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5UEFITGH31D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q33FYZO#wasThisHelpful","R1N5UEFITGH31D","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Confederate-run Andersonville prison was a notorious display of horrors during the Civil War. Union soldiers that were captured and interred there were starved, beaten, subjected to harsh labor duties under the hot Georgia sun, and infected with lice and disease. A line of wooden rails ran across the prison, feet away from the stockade walls, and if the prisoners set so much as a hair over that dead line, they were shot by Confederate sentries manning the wall.  Trouble ran rampant within the Union ranks, as well, though, as the heavyweights formed a gang, the Raiders, and attacked, robbed, and killed their fellow inmates for food, clothing, housing, and tradeable goods. It was more concentration camp than prison, and Captain Henry Wirz ruled over the 20- to 40-thousand skeletal prisoners with an iron fist.The harsh reality of Andersonville is enough to make most blanch and it is a very nasty bit of history in its own right, a grim reminder that oftentimes humans are the most frightening monsters of them all.To take a subject like Andersonville prison and cast it through the prism of a horror novel, you have to be a very confident writer or else risk undermining that very real history as nothing more than tawdry spectacle.Edward M. Erdelac, thankfully, is very much in the former category and treats the history respectfully, while also weaving in a solid dose of supernatural worries that prove captivating. He draws much of his story straight from times past, with Wirz the natural primary villain. Our hero is Barclay Lourdes, a freeman from New Orleans with a penchant for voodoo and a Union spy, who has snuck into the prison to suss out the evils that lie within.And those evils? Well, theyre a doozy, but I dont want to spoil much here. The horrors  both natural and supernatural  that are on display here are well drawn and convincing, at times bloodcurdling. Ederlac does not shy away from the atrocities that men inflicted upon one another in war, or the racist perspectives held by both sides of the Civil War. This is a dark and brutal read, but one that is very well executed and captivating throughout.Those who have enjoyed Robert McCammons historical novels featuring Matthew Corbett should find quite a lot to enjoy here, particularly if theyre looking for a more straight-up horror-based historical read. Theres plenty of demons running amok in Andersonville, and not all of them are human.[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher via NetGalley.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155GZLMDWS3K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWDZZGK#wasThisHelpful","R155GZLMDWS3K7","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given all the hoopla, the insistence of several of my peers telling me, more than once, that I had to read this book, and the outpouring of fan-boy geekery surrounding the release of Armada, I thought it a good time to finally check out Ernest Clines debut, Ready Player One. Im only four years late, which isnt too bad all things considered.However, thats four year of praise, hype, and build-up, which can be a rather significant hurdle to cross. Im pleased to say that, for the most part, I enjoyed Clines work here quite a bit. Theres a few small caveats that Ill get to shortly, but this is a book that I largely enjoyed.Ready Player One is infused with 1980s pop culture  I suspect that how well you are versed in the minutiae of 8-bit video games, John Hughes movies, Star Wars, Dungeons & Dragons lore, and so very, very many more things of the like will play a critical role in how much you enjoy this book. This is a complete festival of nostalgia, and if you scratch your head wondering What the heck is Starlog or completely miss the importance of why our main character, Wade (aka Parzival), stands outside his love interests moon base holding a boom box over his head and blasting Peter Gabriels In Your Eyes then youve got a fair amount of homework ahead of you.But, you might protest, this book is supposed to be near-future sci-fi! And it is. You see, the story basically revolves a contest in which players compete in a massive, multiplayer gaming arena, called OASIS, to inherit the wealth of James Halliday. Halliday, the developer of OASIS, has not only left behind a massive pile of billions of dollars but is a total 1980s devotee. His career in game development was sparked by Atari, and hes an enormous fan of movies like Ladyhawke and War Games (more 1980s history for you study, if needed).The real-world setting is a dystopian mess. The world has been decimated by climate change, and Wade lives with his nasty aunt in the stacks. I really dug the idea of the stacks, which sees high-rise towers made out of motor homes for the poor and disenfranchised to live in. The corporate entity IOI is chasing after Hallidays loot, and Wade and his top-scoring friends quickly becomes enemy number one.I liked the 80s nostalgia and really enjoyed the trips down memory lane, even if, at times, it felt more like Cline was writing off a list of 80s references to incorporate. Some of them work, while others are mentioned just for the sake of it. I briefly wondered at the importance of Ecto-88, a souped up DeLorean modeled after the iconic time traveling car from Back To The Future with Ghostbuster and Knight Rider adds-on to accentuate it even further, which popped up ever so briefly being completely forgotten. Were told how incredible this car is, how worried Parzival is that it could be stolen, and why he, thus, protects it with all kinds of crazy magic spells. And then it just disappears entirely. For a very brief moment, this is Parzivals in-game hero car, but ultimately one of little consequence or importance as its really just Cline inserting more of himself into the narrative (go Google Ecto-88 and youll see). More interesting to me was his spaceship Vonnegut, a Firefly-class vessel (not a 1980s icon by any stretch of the imagination, but one that well let slide, because Firefly) piloted by none other than Max Headroom! That one got my geek flag f-f-flying high.Where Ready Player One stumbled a bit, for me, was in its depictions of life outside the immersive video game OASIS. Like Ecto-88 we get glimmers and flashes of interesting ideas, but not any that are suitably fleshed out nor explored as deeply as they should be. I wanted to know more about the run-down, awful world that Wade perpetually escapes from. I was genuinely curious about his self-image and why OASIS was his ultimate escape. Again, we get small tickles of insight, but they only ever barely scratch the surface. There are some truly deep and fascinating waters of the psyche to explore, and I wanted to know more about our narrator and the real-world, as opposed to the virtual-worlds, that he inhabits.That aside, its rather difficult not to just simply enjoy the ride. Ready Player One is fun, even if its not quite as deep as it could be. Its terrific brain candy and an enjoyable reminder of all those fun 80s games and gimmicks. For those who missed the 80s, your mileage may vary and you might even be asking yourself Wheres the beef? while not even understanding that reference at all. For the rest of us who remember Lloyd Dobler, cereal box surprises, Galaga arcade machines, phone phreaks, Ultraman, and Big Trouble In Little China with sincere fondness, this ones for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4023IVWRPY03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4WKUQ#wasThisHelpful","R4023IVWRPY03","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher via NetGalley.]I first became aware of Craig Saunders with the release of another DarkFuse title, Masters of Blood and Bone, in the early part of 2015. For me, that title was an elegantly written, and perfectly crafted, fusion of dark horror, fantasy, and noir. In short, its a tough title to beat and sets a rather lofty benchmark for Saunders to reach on subsequent novels. And so, I came into Left to Darkness with a certain measure of expectation.The setting is England, in the months prior to and the days following a meteor strike that heralds the apocalypse. Saunders bounces the narrative around his primary characters  the overweight Paul Deacon, a policeman who has settled into his career after many years, a pregnant Dawn Graves, whose husband was recently murdered, and hitman Frank Liebowicz. Life in the End Days puts them up against a cannibalistic cult, its members clad in sack cloth and barbed wire crowns, led by James Finley.And while the meteor-ruined landscape is an impressive locale, its the characters that are of prime importance here. Saunders displays a knack for developing each of them sufficiently well, enough that when danger befalls them there is an honest sense of worry and a few squirm-inducing moments that hit all the right oh s*** notes one would expect and demand of a post-apocalypse survival horror story.Frank pretty well steals the show here: not quite the hitman with a heart of gold pastiche, but still an easily relateable enough figure with an iron will. Hes a tough bastard, a friggin tank, bound and determined to survive, meteors be damned. Dawn, meanwhile, is utterly sympathetic  pregnant and alone, fending for herself and her unborn child, torn between the safety and security that being alone could bring, but needing to find and rely on other survivors for help in delivering her baby and keeping them safe. The cult members and killers they square off against are nicely drawn as well, but hanging out with Sid and Silvia is like stuffing your head inside a hornets nest. Theyre a real bag of crazy, those two.My only point of contention is that Left to Darkness lacks a truly satisfying resolution. The finale is action-packed and exciting, but theres a host of information missing between the final chapter and the epilogue. I was somewhat let down by the open-ended nature, but would certainly dig in to any follow-up immediately because the story here is damn compelling, enough that I must know what happens next (or perhaps in between).As I said earlier, I came into this story with a certain degree of expectation, which was mostly met. Saunders has a clean, straight to the point style that makes for a compelling voice, one that damn near happily drags you from word to word. This book might not have hit all the right notes that I savored in Masters of Blood and Bone, but he gets pretty close and has me fired up for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE291MZTDMLTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940544831#wasThisHelpful","RE291MZTDMLTS","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher via NetGalley.]Hunter Sheas latest finds the Padilla family, and their neighboring couple, Buck and Alexiana, toughing out life in a post-apocalyptic Yonkers where, seemingly, everyone and everything wants them dead, right down to the skunks and racoons.After a series of attacks on the US mainland force the Padillas into Bucks bomb shelter, they emerge to find a radically changed world. A chemical assault has killed off most of the human population, and animals all across the spectrum  from racehorses to domesticated dogs and cats  have gone berserk. Venturing out into this brave new world for the first time, Buck and Daniel, the Padilla patriarch, are attacked by a tidal wave of rats, forcing everyone out of the bomb shelter and into this stark, new reality.Shea is a proficient horror author and he drums up a few scenes here that are gut-twisting, including an early introduction into the horses gone wild and, later, a scene where Daniel and his wife, Elizabeth, are forced to confront a naked, knife-wielding lunatic with truly depraved intentions. The action is pretty frenetic and makes for a quick and propulsive read, with all kinds of different scenarios and variations on man vs. animal and man vs. man themes.My only complaint is that, for me, the characters felt somewhat flat. We learn enough about them to feel comfortable as theyre set off on their less-than merry way, and Elizabeth, a nurse, is called into action more than a few times, but we never really get to know their histories or the depths of their souls. The Padilla family is pretty large, which leads to most coming off as a bit one-note. Max is the angry teen, Gabby the scared the kid, Elizabeth the worried mother, etc.Where I cannot fault Shea is in giving each character a great moment to shine. Their father, Daniel, gets a nice scene where he performs a necessary evil that would have been impossible for him to carry out in a more civilized world, and when a certain tragedy befalls Alexiana, her reaction and fears are suitably realistic. The ordeals endured by the Padillas generate a solid dose of emotion and a few uncomfortable squirms that helps the material live up to the promise set forth in the title.All in all, Tortures of the Damned is an entertaining read, with plenty of great action scenes, but not one in which I felt terribly invested in character-wise. Still, the climax is resoundingly exciting, punchy, and more than a little brutal. I definitely recommend that fans of post-apocalypse survival fiction give it a shot, particularly if youre looking for some zombie-free fare but one with a nice little spin on the typical tropes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDA2RCCMJVIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53BX44#wasThisHelpful","RCDA2RCCMJVIJ","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a bit of a soft-spot for horror set in snowy climes, so I was very curious to see what David Bernstein would have in store for readers in SKINNER. For the most part, I was pretty pleased.The opening chapters hit all the right notes for me, satisfying expectations for a story of this type, but also offering up some intriguing differences. The group stops at a creepy old gas station along the mountain route to a cabin in the woods, and encounter the creepy old gas station attendant - pretty standard fare and an expected well-worn horror staple. When a crazy and sudden snow storm sets in and the travelers are forced off the mountain path in the wake of a car accident, the fun sets in. They find an abandoned shack in the woods, and tensions rise quickly as the supernatural element of the story barges in to wreak havoc and they find themselves surrounded by wolves.There were some good surprises in the group dynamic, as these friends are forced to confront some awful truths about themselves, and the survival elements bring in a heady dose of fun. The action is well done, and the writing is pretty solid and well-paced. In fact, the good elements in this story far outweigh my few nitpicks. One point of contention is that some of the supernatural stuff here feels cribbed from a Grimm's' Fairy Tale and felt a little too borrowed from the fantasy genre for my tastes. Another issue I had, and I'll issue a small SPOILER WARNING here is that multiple characters end up wandering down the tracks of similar trains of thought, mostly about how, when they escape, they're going to get filthy rich off their story. They get so wrapped up in their imaginings that they completely forget about how much danger they're in and have to be sucked back into reality by their buddies. I spent most of the story thinking this was a result of manipulations from the menace they face, but it happens a few times too often that I started to wonder if it was simply a one-note idea or if these characters were really all just that shallow. It's a minor gripe, and one I'm largely willing to overlook simply because the ride was enjoyable enough.So, as I said earlier, I dig snow-driven horror and climate-based survival stories are one of my favorite subgenres within horror. Ultimately, Bernstein delivered what I was looking for quite well. The fantasy elements weren't my cup of tea, but the character interactions and bursts of violence and ratcheting tension held my attention and kept me glued to the page. Mostly it was just an entertaining and fun bit of reading. Nicely done, Mr. Bernstein.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L43Y90R32CTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YATF8G8#wasThisHelpful","R2L43Y90R32CTN","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I received this title as a free bonus from the DarkFuse Book Club.My first introduction to Jon Bassoff was the 2014 release of his third novel, FACTORY TOWN, a dream-scape delirium of a read. THE DISASSEMBLED MAN is actually Bassoff's first novel, reissued here by DarkFuse, and I was a bit surprised at just how straight-forward it was, given the topsy-turvy nature of FACTORY TOWN.DISASSEMBLED falls squarely into the category of psycho-noir, following the self-important, ego-driven, and much-entitled oddball narrator, Frankie Avicious, from one murder to another. The character development is very well done, and serves as a lovely case study of how to craft a main character that is completely unsympathetic, repulsive, and eminently readable. It's pretty clear from page one that Frankie is not all right in the head and that more than a few screws are loose, if not long-since lost entirely. I did not like Frankie at all, but Bassoff imbues him with a measure of smarminess and off-beat humor that drove me through the novel waiting for this jerk's final comeuppance.This is a solid bit of noir fiction where murder sprees are the number one order of business. While Frankie is shallow and not terribly bright, don't expect an Elmore Leonard level of wit. Even the worst of Leonard's criminal dimwits and charming antiheroes would be shockingly, and rightfully, appalled with Frankie. Expect, instead, a read that is dark and unflinching, and sometimes just plain old brutal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMM9OTF708LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YN7EDUE#wasThisHelpful","R1EMM9OTF708LD","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the perks of being a member of the DarkFuse book club is free access to the online DarkFuse magazine. There's a wealth of content available to readers here, including behind-the-scenes narratives from authors where they discuss what inspired their works and the secrets behind their stories, as well as original, brand-new short stories, flash fiction (Horror d'oeuvres), and a new section that was recently unveiled dedicated to Tiny Terrors. This content is generated by authors on twitter, producing dark snippets of horrors in a single tweet. Readers get to nominate and vote on their favorites.DarkFuse Magazine has also begun making strides in publishing original, serialized content. Over the course of two weeks in June 2015, an original novella written by Keith Deininger, titled BURIED SOLDIERS, was published exclusively for magazine subscribers in ten parts and was an excellent way to introduce serials to the magazine. A second serial novella, THE WARDS, by Alan Ryker will be releasing soon.Magazine subscribers also get to download free and limited eBook releases that are otherwise unavailable in print or digital. DarkFuse also obtained the right to republish the entire library of Patrick Kill's humorous short horror stories, uploaded under the Cult of Kill section of the website.At only 99c a month, it's really hard to go wrong with a subscription to DarkFuse magazine. Readers get loads of content that span the range of original fiction, non-fiction, curated tweets, short stories, and serialized novellas.

"[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher through NetGalley.]Chuck Wendig returns to the Heartland one last time to wrap up his cornpunk opus in grand fashion.The previous novel, Blightborn, left our MC, Cael McAvoy in seriously dire straights, but Wendig wastes no time in resolving it and jumping right into the action one year later. Tasked with a mission by the Maize Witch to recover a decades-old weapon that could destroy the Empyrean empire for good, Cael and his Obligated, Wendy, are off to save the Heartland! Along the way, familiar faces from past novels return to reestablish the cast of friends and enemies as the tyrannical rule of the evil skylords grows ever more constrictive. As the Heartland inches closer to war, McAvoy and his old crew of Sky Scavengers are simultaneously reunited and torn apart by conflicting loyalties, emotional turbulence, and a devastating attack by the Harpies, a band of teenage female warriors with self-inflicted scarring across their faces.Across three novels, Wendig has expertly plumbed the emotional depths of his cast of characters, thrusting them into uniquely dark situations that make their hard-scrabbles lives all the more difficult and turbulent. The Harvest is no exception as, come hell or highwater, these new adults are forced to make very mature choices as they find their way in a very old world, fighting against a system that seeks only to oppress and dominate. The stakes are higher than theyve ever been, particularly for Cael who, previously, had no ambition to change the world but to simply make his small part in it better for him and his. With adulthood thrust upon him, Cael is learning that the world is larger than he imagined, and much bigger than merely himself.The world-building and mythology that has been developed in this series is utterly top-notch, drawing its cues from real-world food politics, comic books (I couldnt help but sense shades of X-Mens Dark Phoenix Saga in one characters progression through the story), and epic works, like Star Wars, which Wendigs trilogy, and The Harvest in particular, have drawn multiple allusions to and several loving odes. Naturally enough, the Lord and Lady has seen fit to have Wendig author an upcoming Star Wars title, which is due out soon and will most definitely be hitting the top of my TBR stack upon release.While I would certainly love to see Wendig return to this world in some capacity in the future, Im quite happy with the time I was able to spend among the Sky Scavengers. I suspect my appreciation and fondness for this body of work will only grow stronger in the coming years, and Ive grown a certain affection for this series across the three books. The Harvest is not only a solid work in its own right, filled with plenty of action and flotillas worth of heart and genuine emotion, but, equally important, it serves as a fitting finale to The Heartland Trilogy. Theres a sense of darkness to the proceedings here, but also a promise of hope and brightness. Fair warning, though: not everyone gets a happy ending, and not everyone walks away unscathed. But, thats just life in the Heartland.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRU9605AL4L1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBZFHXQ#wasThisHelpful","RRU9605AL4L1Y","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greg Gifune's latest grabbed me right off the bat and kept me glued to the pages for the whole ride through. For my tastes, DEVIL'S BREATH is a truly excellent read that hit a number of sweet spots: cultists, conspiracy theory, and a dash of cosmic horror and predeterminism that, combined, led to a heck of a WTF?! read. The climax of the book was perhaps a touch too hallucinogenic and crazy, but I can't fault the author for it as he crafts a fitting and necessary finale that worked well enough given the story's thematic elements.Gifune is an absolutely terrific writer, and his brand of horror/dark fiction is superb. I haven't made much of a dent in his back-list yet, but I am bound and determined to play catch-up. Of the handful of titles I have read by him, DEVIL'S BREATH stands at the top of the heap so far and had me feeling as if I were tumbling down the rabbit hole right alongside our dishwasher protagonist, Stan, into some truly terrifying dark corners of the world and the psyche.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EN64YPH7WIPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAS81H2#wasThisHelpful","R2EN64YPH7WIPD","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ania Ahlborn wastes no time getting into the nitty-gritty of her character's mindscape. Nell is a broken wreck of a human being - delusional, insecure, and psychotic, she's an emotional pinball machine who goes from ecstatic highs to troubling lows in the blink of an eye. Nell is an office drone and a black sheep among her coworkers, who target her for ridicule, while suffering daily verbal assaults by the gang of Puerto Ricans outside her cheap Brooklyn apartment.Ahlborn does a great job of setting the scene for this late-70s era story, with New York under threat from the Son of Sam, harkening back to an age free of computers, cell phones, and Google. But it's really the mental instability of her main character that's the big draw. There's some very rich character development and an engaging squirm-worthy back-story, so if you're looking for a good psycho-narrator read, dive on in. That said, I did not find THE PRETTY ONES to be very surprising, but it was completely engaging throughout. At a bit more than 100 pages, it's a very worthwhile and breezy read, and chock-full of crazy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17G0LYWUFMZ34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OL0U#wasThisHelpful","R17G0LYWUFMZ34","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally read Therin Knites Venus in Red as part of The Future Chronicles anthology, The Telepath Chronicles, and considered it to be among the best in that collection. This stand-alone piece is a fun sci-fi actioneer revolving around a corporate assassination with the telepathy aspect playing an integral part via high-tech cerebral upgrades. Its a serious bit of entertainment, and Knite brings her usual flair to the story, as exhibited in her earlier release, Othella (which you should also buy ASAP). It's a quick, brisk read chock full of awesomeness.

"Ernie Lindsey, writing here under the pseudonym of Desmond Doane, takes his first steps into the horror genre with The Dark Man, and it's, mostly, pretty darn effective.The premise revolves around a disgraced reality show ghost-hunter, Ford Atticus Ford, working to atone for his past sins. Two years ago, during a live Halloween special, Ford put the life of a five year old in incredible danger, squaring off against a supernatural threat in the Most Haunted House in America. His career was quickly canned and he's now a bit of a wandering ghost-hunter, attempting to track down the demon that changed his life forever while doing police consultancy on the side.Ford himself is a dynamic character and Lindsey gives him a solid bit of development and personality. Ford is, in short, kind of an a-hole. While he carries around a solid dose of guilt over endangering the life of a child, he also pines to resurrect his TV career and rebound bigger and better than before. His personal life is in shambles, as his friends and crewmates from the cancelled Graveyard: Classified want nothing to do with him, and his ex-wife isn't too thrilled with him either.Lindsey's foray into the paranormal brings with it a certain measure of authenticity, and I can't help but wonder just how many episodes of certain SyFy and Travel Channel reality TV shows he's consumed to help give Graveyard: Classified the sort-of 'behind the scenes' vibe. Regardless, it's an aspect of the story that works quite well.More importantly, he nails the creep-factor nicely and had me completely sold on the book's premise and invested in the outcome. There's a scene early on when Ford is investigating a haunted house and Lindsey gives readers their first taste of the otherworldly that raised the hair on the back of my neck and got me grinning.For much of its length, The Dark Man rockets along with the rapid-fire pace of an action story with splashes of humor, evoking shades of television's Supernatural. However, my main complaint is that the story fizzles out toward the end and lacks sufficient resolution. While the central murder mystery gets wrapped up, the overarching paranormal story is shelved for exploration in future installments. There's a strange shifting of gears in the novel's final chapters, with so much build-up leading toward the finish line and then...nothing. It's a rather anti-climactic finish to an otherwise well-told ghost story.That issue aside, I'm certainly game to see what comes of Ford Atticus Ford and his ghost-hunting partners in future installments, and am game for book two whenever it releases. See you on the other side!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V23VX7PMNIBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X04AXRI#wasThisHelpful","R1V23VX7PMNIBG","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I am a member of the DarkFuse book club and received a copy of this title for free.]For it's third anthology, small press publisher DarkFuse collects the works of six authors, each of them complete unknowns to me. This is a short and brisk read, and although each story is fair none rise to the level of exceptional. My biggest complaint is the lack of sheer surprise in any of these stories, with most of the authors broadcasting their intents far too early and undermining their own thunder.Lauren Gallo's RITUAL gave up its secrets way too quickly, but provided a pretty enjoyable central character in a plucky out-of-her-element heroine visiting family Japan. I liked Nicole Feldringer's CHANTERELLING well enough, despite being pretty simple and straight-forward; again, not many surprises. TO GET PAST IT was a good little revenge story with a couple nice hooks to it. THE MATCHBOOK SIGN was also pretty good, with a nifty descent into madness, and the strongest of the bunch. TAKING IT ALL AWAY and WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING round out the collection, with the former tackling the loss of a parent in a sad and evocative way. WINNING, on the other hand, deals with scoring big on a cruise ship casino and the awful consequences of greedy gambling.Although the writing is solid enough throughout, the stories don't pack much of an oomph and there's little in the way of twists to make them particularly memorable. Still, it's not by any means a bad way to burn off a few hours of the day.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R258CE5OZ3HP9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZV44VWI#wasThisHelpful","R258CE5OZ3HP9O","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Searls' COLD AS HELL is a mighty strong short story/novella that is driven by crisp writing, psychological suspense, and a mystery narrative straight out The Twilight Zone.While Christmas shopping with his family, Peter and his wife allow their kids to board a children's train ride around the outdoor shopping center, with Peter left behind as the designated watcher while she finishes shopping. Peter ducks into a nearby bar to beat the cold and catch a few minutes of a football game when he realizes his phone is somehow stuck on the time 6:42. Soon enough, he begins to worry about the missing time, and his missing children. What follows is a complex and twisty story that kept me glued to the page.COLD AS HELL is a lean read and short enough to plow through quickly.

"SKINSHIFT is a decent enough read, but not one that really struck a big chord with me. The writing is good, the pace is fast, and there's enough action and plot developments to really keep things moving along. That said, it just didn't grab me in the way her previous release did, which was a medical-thriller titled BLOCKBUSTER. The next paragraph has a few SPOILERS, so read on at your own risk.Here, von Biela trades in the scenarios of cutting edge medicine for the desert climes of Nevada to present a paranormal revenge thriller that is brief and entertaining, but which lacks sufficient depth. The characters don't have much development, aside from the central character, a killer named Dominic, but even his is scant at best. The driving force behind the narrative struck me as being too quickly resolved, with a finale that not only suddenly introduced a handful of new characters but that also left the climax feeling unearned and short-shrifted.Ultimately, SKINSHIFT left me feeling a bit cold and impartial. Still, it was an OK read, just not one that really set itself apart from the pack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5T4VBSHFBW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXYU692#wasThisHelpful","R1W5T4VBSHFBW4","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend to avoid stories with shapeshifter's in the lead, mostly because I tend to find that particular horror subgenre to be a bit lackluster, with contrived machinations and easy outs. However, I'm a big fan of the DarkFuse imprint and trust its editors and authors a great deal. Ultimately, I'm pretty darn happy that I gave SHADOWSHIFT a read!Peter Giglio crafts a might fine narrative here that is well-grounded in its characters, particularly that of teenager Hannah, her mother Tina, estranged father Chet, and Tina's new love, Kevin. The family dynamic between Tina, Chet, and their daughter is marked with strife, heartache, secrets, and abuse. Tina discovers her talents for writing and is often overcome with depression-driven self-recriminations, which is something I could relate to all too easily and I appreciate that Giglio handled this aspect with care and honesty. Hannah is a smart and mature teen, who has inherited a slightly different skill-set than her shape-shifting, criminal father (Chet most often transforms into a cockroach, and I can't help but mentally refer to him as Papa Roach as a result), and is learning to come into her own in the world and working to help her family rebuild.The writing is crisp and solid, and the author works up a very comfortable narrative flow that keeps the pages turning. If not for the daily rigors of life itself, I probably would have stayed glued to my Kindle and finished this one in a single sitting. SHADOWSHIFT has a lot of elements that help make it a winner - there's crime, along with a slight paranormal aspect that never feels disruptive nor does it ever overshadow the most important ingredient to this work, which are the characters themselves, each of whom possess a lot of depth and heart (or heartlessness, as needed). This book is also a great introduction to Peter Giglio, who is a new-to-me author, and I'll be browsing his backlist of titles shortly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T161OCDT726T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTTI3XW#wasThisHelpful","R2T161OCDT726T","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Thompson's WITH FURY IN HAND is a gritty and dark crime thriller revolving around a handful of characters who lives are either marked by or defined by violence. There's an emerging psychopath who is descending further into madness and envisions himself committing atrocious and random acts of violence, a prostitute who befriends a homeless girl, and a recovering drug addict fighting to leave behind his past. Over the course of several hours these figures converge upon one another, some through happenstance and others with deliberation, each with motives all their own.Flint, Michigan - a city once named the most dangerous in America only a few years ago - provides an appropriate backdrop for Thompson's story, and the author's depiction of the city, its demographics, and locales like the local University of Michigan campus, ring true. Thompson also provides enough details on his characters and their emerging relationships to satisfy, with Max in particular being a very troubled sort and a fairly uncomfortable head-space to root around in for very long.If you're looking for a quick, dirty, and dark bit of crime fiction, Thompson's latest should satisfy pretty easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UO3CIPSMVIIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB12VYG#wasThisHelpful","R3UO3CIPSMVIIY","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Midnight Order started off very strongly, but around the 40% mark it quickly became muddled with a few too many implausibilities that really strained my suspension of disbelief given how grounded the opening chapters were.While I very much liked the strong Gothic tones that Fulbright imbued this work with, the dangerous cult turned monster mash-up got to be a little too much for my tastes. There's a number of characters and concepts here that could have easily filled two or three other novellas, or been an excellent novel-length work with a bit more development, but packing it all into an 88-page read gave it an overly-stuffed feeling.

"Keith Deininger's WITHIN just made my list of best horror for 2015. It's moody, the writing is crisp and evocative, and the author provides just enough detail to make his scenes creepy and disquietingly evocative.WITHIN is more than a haunted house story - it's a haunted town story, as the entire area of Mesa Rapid, where the spooky Upshaw Mansion is situation, is brimming with ugly history and spilled blood. In fact, Deininger's telling of Mesa Rapid's history was one of the highlights of the book for me.Some readers might be a bit turned off by the slow build nature of the horror here, but once things start clicking into place the story becomes absolute dynamite, and there's atmosphere to spare. The finale is a top-notch finish, and one of the more unsettling endings I've come across in recent memory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NARZRQ2F72JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAWQHB4#wasThisHelpful","R1NARZRQ2F72JT","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received a copy of this title from the author in exchange for an honest review.]Over the course of his Orbs and Extinction Cycle series, Nicholas Sansbury Smith has risen to the top of my go-to list for rocking sci-fi/horror military thrillers.

Their incompetence and duplicity have led to several bad decisions over the course of this series, as these men are revealed to be less interested in saving the world than in covering their own rears. As such, they're a great force to root against and you're constantly waiting and hoping for them to get their comeuppance.The finale is also one of the strongest and most satisfying in the series thus far, mixing fist-pumping cheers with an excruciating denouement that left me screaming at my Kindle.Extinction Age is brimming with action and terrific set pieces that include a derelict aircraft carrier and the underground tunnels of a secret FEMA installation, along with a few new characters to root for and villains to despise. The supporting cast each get a chance to shine, as well, particularly Dr. Ellis, as well as wounded warrior Fitz, who seems to be building toward a more central role in the series.Smith does an excellent job balancing the bleak nature of this particular post-apocalyptic narrative with a sense of hope and optimism, despite how dark things get.

"[Note: I received an advanced copy of this title for review.]The Z Chronicles is the latest in Samuel Peraltas ever-growing series of The Future Chronicles anthologies. While Ive only read a couple of the previous collections, this zombie-themed antho is far and away my favorite of the bunch and represents one the strongest over-all anthologies that Ive ever read.There is a mighty fine assemblage of authors here, and a number of superb stories that, on their own, more than make the price of entry completely worthwhile. And, as with any good anthology, this has given me a nice starting point to delve deeper into the works of authors that are new to me. In fact, after reading several of the stories included here, I immediately hopped onto Amazon and bought a couple titles from writers like Ann Christy and Deirdre Gould. Following here, then, are a few thoughts on my favorites  consider this a LIGHT SPOILER WARNING and feel free to skip down to the bottom if you want to be completely blind going in.Christys story, VINDICA, kicks of The Z Chronicles in grand style with a story of insurrection in an underground habitat built for the rich. Its a strong stand-along story, but also provides a great taste of the authors Between series.KAMIKA-Z by Christopher Boore, and Will Swardstrons Z BALL are also very strong efforts, with the former featuring cyborg zombies unleashed upon the US during a war with China. This one is told across three viewpoints of a single family struggling to survive. Its dark, but the characters are richly developed and their own unique voices are allowed to shine across each chapter. My only complaint is that I really wanted to see more of these cyborg zombie things! Its such a cool concept, and Im keeping my fingers crossed that Boore expands on it in a larger work soon.Z BALL casts the zombie uprising through the bright lights of American sports. This one is a wonderful outside-of-the-box approach to the zombie apocalypse and the way society responds and adapts to changing circumstances. And, just for good measure, its all wrapped up in a nice shell of conspiracy and paranoia.Hugh Howey and David Adams play around a bit in Howeys own I, Zombie world. GLORIA is a story of a woman coming to grips with her own zombiefication, while Adams presents a similar story of a transgender individual who has been zombified. Both of these showcase a great bit of internal character development as they grapple with their post-death existence that finds their healthy mental states locked inside bodies they can no longer control thanks to the ravages of the plague.Peter Cawdrons FREE FALL is another excellent piece that begins with a bit of a sci-fi bent as an astronaut returns to a decimated Earth. The opening bit of this story is a terrific slow-burn as the spaceman attempts to establish contact with Houston Ground Control only to slowly realize things are not quite right. It slowly morphs into a more traditional zombie-survival story, one that is really well done. Fans of the comics Y: The Last Man and The Walking Dead should find quite a lot to appreciate here.CURING KHANG YEO finished off the anthology with a stunningly rich character piece that finds the title character cured after several years as a zombie. Reclaimed by a very different world than the one he left, Yeo discovers that there are worse things than being a zombie  namely, living with yourself in the wake of all that youve done and those youve killed. His sense of guilt is supremely palpable, with the struggle between his own desires and the wishes of his medical saviors (if you can really call them that) is effectively striking. Author Deirdre Gould scores a huge, huge win with this story and I loved it so much that I immediately grabbed a copy of the first installment in her After The Cure series. While YEO is set in that same series, it is certainly effective as a stand-alone, but I suspect readers discovering Gould for the first time will find it difficult to ignore her novel-length works after reading this one. I, for one, absolutely need to know more about the world shes constructed and the psychological and societal aftermath of this cure.As with any anthology, there were a couple stories that didnt strike a strong chord with me, but those that did, particularly those outlined above, were just incredibly top-notch efforts. Overall, this is a wickedly strong anthology and zombie fans should be devouring this one ASAP. If youre going through withdrawals of AMCs The Walking Dead, or looking for something to fill the gap left by Jonathan Maberrys ROT & RUIN series, this fix is now in.

"S. Elliot Brandis's opening volley in his latest series, Seven Worlds Saga, offers up a very promising start to what could very well become a high-water mark in the author's oeuvre.Elsie dreams of becoming the winning pearl diver in the annual competition that will score her a one-way ticket off her planet and to the central world of Dunamis. In the wake of her brother's death in a prior tournament, her parents viciously oppose her, forcing her to rebel.I won't say much more in regards to the plot, but to say Elsie gets more than she bargains for is putting it mildly.Brandis delivers the goods when it comes to Young Adult dystopian fiction: there is well-defined and atrocious threat, impossible odds, and a very strong, determined, and capable heroine. Elsie is just a terrific character and honestly written. It's utterly impossible not to root for her, and, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to hear her name-dropped alongside Katniss Everdeen some day soon.After having spent the last few days fully submerged in the world of The Pearl Diver, I'm now left eagerly waiting for the next installment in this series.

"While the Young Adult genre isn't my usual stomping ground when it comes to reading, I was very interested in seeing what E.E. Giorgi, who I discovered thanks to her book in the Apocalypse Weird bookverse, could bring to the table. To put it mildly, I was none too disappointed!The central premise revolves around the cybernetic siblings, Akaela and her brother Athel, searching for their missing father. While this is a very simple explanation, I don't want to give away too much of the finer details.The joy in this book comes from Giogri's exquisite world-building and the lived-in history of the Mayake people and their enemies, the Gaijins. And although there's a clear dystopian streak in the setting of the demolished Tower that the nearly-extinct Mayake call home, there is also a refreshing yearning for peace and rebuilding.That's not to say that it's all cupcakes and roses, though. There's a small, dark vein running through Akaela, but it's far from detracting and the work never feels bleak nor like it's drowning in sorrow. The finale has a note of sadness, which sets a grand stage for future Mayake Chronicles books, but wrapped around it is a promise of hope.If you're looking for a YA sci-fi adventure-mystery, I'd heartily recommend Akaela for it's strong characters and depth of setting. It's a terrific read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTC012C8DHPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTTSQ42#wasThisHelpful","R2VTC012C8DHPA","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great joys in discovering a fresh, new voice early on in their career is being able to watch and read how they have developed as an author over time. When I met Lucas Bale a year ago on KBoards and became familiar with his work via The Heretic, his first release, I was impressed with the crisp writing and clear authorial voice, as well as an engaging story that held so much promise for future works. I was eager to see where he would go, and I absolutely loved his second book, Defiance. And Im not saying all this because I consider Lucas a friend, nor because weve worked together in the past and will again in the near-future. Im approaching these works as a reader, first and foremost, as well as, now, a fan.As such, I hope it is with a measure of trust between us, dear reader, when I say that A Shroud of Night and Tears is by far his most accomplished work. In fact, I feel somewhat urged to not give this book five stars, simply because Bale gets better and better with each work. I could rightly give this title four starts knowing full-well that, in all due likelihood, his next book will top this. If I keep giving him five stars, where the hell does he go from there? This is likely a problem many of his fans face, as well, so perhaps there is some commiseration to be had. Still, Im giving it those coveted 5-stars because its easily one of the best sci-fi titles Ive read this year, and one of the strongest space opera books Ive read in ages. It is, in short, phenomenal!Those readers that were disappointed by the sudden change in characters in Defiance and the brief pause to tell a new story with the lawman, Weaver, and his prey, Natasha, will be heartened to know that Shepherd, Jordi, and the preacher from The Heretic all make their return here, in addition to those fresh, new faces introduced in the previous book.A Shroud of Night and Tears provides an awesome landscape in which to unite these disparate figures, pitting them together in a scenario that remarkably shifts the series overarching threat into something far grander than I had initially expected at the outset of Beyond The Wall. I know this sounds vague, but Im trying to avoid spoilers, because there is such a huge plot development in this penultimate work that twists everything I thought I knew about what was happening into something very, very different.In addition to elevating this developing story to a higher plane, Bale also manages to up the ante on a personal level, as well. There are threats galore, and back-stabbings aplenty, in addition to attempted murder by backpack bombs, and a few other surprises that I shall not spoil. Lets just say that uniting all these various personalities from the prior two books under the umbrella of a larger, looming nightmare does not make everything all hunky-dory. These are characters with conflicting personalities and personal agendas of their own, which provides a strong, tense backdrop to the proceedings. I really liked the espionage-like tone that Weavers mission took on in the books latter half, giving it a sort of Mission: Impossible vibe that I truly dug.So, theres one more book to go in this Beyond The Wall series, and I fully expect it to be wrought with peril and adventure. How Bale will tie everything up is the big question, and I can only hope there isnt too long of a wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JN90BN5XBRDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y92YQSC#wasThisHelpful","R1JN90BN5XBRDE","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've yet to read Hugh Howey's SAND, Smith's entry is very accessible and makes for smooth reading. SARFER was a well-written and engaging character study of a courier, Mattie, whose legs are lame and whose sand-surfing vehicle has become an extension of his self identity. At its core, it's a story of father and son, and the lessons and gifts passed on from one to the other. It's a brisk read and gave me enough insight into Howey's original world to prevent me from feeling lost. I'm also quite a bit more encouraged and eager to read SAND, so this story has worked on multiple fronts for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFDH55LQV90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUNLEMM#wasThisHelpful","REFDH55LQV90","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher via NetGalley.]I was instantly captivated by Ramez Naam's sci-fi debut, Nexus, and have loved reading how his characters and this near-future Earth have responded to the burgeoning transhuman movement. With Apex, Naam picks up the story threads left at the end of book two, Crux, and delivers a highly satisfying conclusion to his series.Apex is a large book, in both page count and scope. The advanced brain enhancement technology of the NexusOS has been causing a political stir for quite sometime, and it all comes to a head here. There are political coups, conspiracies, terrorism, riots, the rise of AI, and the threat of nuclear warfare.This is a dense novel, with multiple subplots revolving around the birth of the PLF, a pro-transhumanist terror group, technological heists between China and India stemming from the viral load of the once-human Su-Yong, and disputes over the US presidential election, and so many other moving pieces intersecting these various subplots that the book feels much longer than it really is.And that, really, is my only gripe. While Amazon lists the page count of this book at 608 pages, it feels twice as long and makes for a bit of a ponderous read. There is just so much happening, and so many characters involved, that it's hard not to feel the weight and pressure of the story. I recall the prior two books being rather briskly paced and energetic, whereas this one is more of a massive pot-boiler. While it took me some time to get through, it was certainly well worth it. There's also the issue of information delivery, with segments of the story being told in large chunks and then abandoned for a long while to focus on other issues, before circling back to pick up the threads on something else.All that said, I did find Apex to being a strong finish to the story with the characters meeting their natural conclusions and, in some cases, a few surprises along the way. I do wish more would have been done to make Sam less one dimensional here, as she's been a strong character previously with a very interesting background and journey throughout. It's a bit of a shame to have her reduced here to a simple worrywart, mother figure with little else to do. I was happy to see Ranjan Shankari with a more integral role this time around, though, and Kade's steps toward becoming a leader was very well done.Naam is due tremendous applause for keeping all the gears turning in this massive tome. As I said, there is an awful lot happening here, with a lot of spinning plates to keep an eye, but the author does a fabulous job of tying up the various thread and delivering an energetic and compulsively readable finale to not only Apex, but to the series as a whole.If you've been following the Nexus series thus far, then grabbing a copy of Apex is a no-brainer and it brings the series to a close with a rollicking finish replete with serious tension and action. If you haven't been, then I highly recommend you start at the beginning, where you'll likely find yourself becoming a fan in no time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZQWMNASHBIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4BA758#wasThisHelpful","R3FZQWMNASHBIV","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an ARC of this novel from the authors in exchange for an honest review.]Weapons of Mass Deception, a collaborative effort between two Navy guys, is a top-notch military thriller and one that I hope is only the beginning of a new series.The book is filled with as much heart as it is technical know-how and first-hand experience from the authors in the realm of naval operations and military intelligence.There is a lot of depth and many moving pieces to the narrative, which concerns Iraqs fabled weapons of mass destruction. In the story, Saddams nuclear arms were very much real and smuggled out of Iraq and into Iran just days before the US invasion in 2003. What follows is a sprawling narrative involving a trio of Naval Academy graduates that the writers track across more than a decade as they settle into their various career paths and remain united by the central terrorist operations of a rogue Iranian Quds Force agent.Co-authors Bruns and Olson bring a lot of knowledge to the table, having operated in the trenches of the US Navy and Commander Olsons twenty-one years as a naval intelligence officer and U.S. Naval Attach to Finland. Theres definitely an insiders feel to the level of detail and machinations in both the US Armed Forces and intelligence community, as well as the global operations of a terrorist network hellbent on achieving nuclear Armageddon.There is also an added layer of heart thanks to the interpersonal relationships between the trio of US Naval Academy graduates and the rocky on-again, off-again love story between Brendan and Liz, the former a SEAL and the latter now working for the FBIs Joint Terrorism Task Force. As the authors chart the lives of these two, as well as fellow Academy classmate turned CIA analyst Don Riley, over more than a decade of their careers, we really get to know each of them very well. The authors also spend a considerable amount of time developing their terrorists as well, particular Rafiq, which helps prevent the bad guys from being overly-simplistic, one dimensional stock villains. Theres a great amount of character development and depth across the board, along with a healthy dose of honor and mission-driven purpose on both sides of the aisle.Fans of Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, or Nelson DeMille should feel right at home with this story of lost nukes, Navy SEALS, intelligence agency operatives, and up-to-minute global politics. This is a terrific addition to the line-up of military thrillers and should not be missed. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KMIINPJOH0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=151181280X#wasThisHelpful","R10KMIINPJOH0S","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Meikle's latest, The Dunfield Terror, is a great bit of Lovecraftian horror revolving around a glowing fog and some mighty strange creatures wreaking havoc across Dunfield Island at the height of a snowstorm. The narrative unfolds across two timelines - one set in the 1950s and providing readers with the mad science-gone-wrong history of the horror lurking about the island, and the present day story as Dunfield residents begin disappearing and confronting the tentacled beasties while waiting for military rescue.Meikle is a prodigious author and a bit of staple to the DarkFuse brand, a joint effort that results in consistently great reads. He does a terrific job sketching in the post-atomic experiments that give rise to far worse discoveries, and delivers some shocking and gruesome moments throughout without ever going completely overboard on the gore, and keeping the fantastical well-grounded.The Dunfield Terror marks another strong entry for both the author and this small publishing imprint. Fans of Lovecraft will feel right at home with this story and it's monstrous effects on both the characters and the readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R646BS0KSHRZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNKKUJO#wasThisHelpful","R646BS0KSHRZV","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced review copy of this book from a contributing author.]The Dragon Chronicles is the latest in Samuel Peraltas The Future Chronicles anthology series. As with the prior entries, he has assembled a strong collection of diverse voices in the fields of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Each anthology presents an overarching theme to unify the various short stories, and weve seen collections centered around robots, artificial intelligence, aliens, and telepaths. Now, we get dragons!Although the Chinese zodiac calendar says 2015 is the year of the sheep, pop culture seems to think otherwise. And its a good thing, because I doubt as many intriguing stories could be told about sheep. This year seems to very much be the year of the dragon  Game of Thrones seems to have hit critical mass with the debut of season 5 and rampant speculation on when the sixth novel in George R.R. Martins beloved series will be released. Author Matthew Reilly put his own stamp on dragon lore with his theme park-centric story, The Great Zoo of China, earlier this year. Even the latest Apocalypse Weird novel, Genesis, by Stefan Bolz, hits on the element of dragons. While it may not be directly relevant, were even getting another Dragon Tattoo novel later in the year, with Lisbeth Salander making a return under the helm of a new author.Seems like dragons are everywhere these days. But, thats not necessarily a bad thing. Peralta collects here a group of authors who seem to love, respect, and admire these great mythical creatures, and who have some fun figuring out intriguing ways of presenting stories putting these winged fire-breathers front and center.As with any anthology, not every story hit the mark for me, but the majority of the entries here work quite well. Im also not a huge fantasy buff and have a hard time losing myself within this particular genre, so my hat is truly off to these writers for making it somewhat easy for me to find escapist entertainment within these covers. Im not going to discuss all twelve stories in this collection, but what follows are some brief thoughts about those works that really stood out for me.The Dragon Chronicles gets off to a very strong start with Ten Things You Should Know About Dragons by Elle Casey, who presents a story about a dragon-rider trainer named Ish. She captures his voice very well and pulls off the direct communication between narrator and reader very well, with some splashes of humor, particularly in relation to the name Ish. This is a very effective short story and a solid beginning to what follows. Its also rather funny-ish!Daniel Arensons Of Sand and Starlight takes a turn for a dark with an embittered protagonist who has turned to prostitution to make ends meet. She has the ability to transform into a dragon, but her powers are outlawed by the tyrannical empire ruling the land. Good characters, good ideas, and good world building, all wrapped up into a small story.More whimsical is KJ Colts Tasty Dragon Meat, about a butcher who discovers the profits of selling dragon flesh for consumption, and who learns about the horrible aftereffects of such dining when his child begins growing scales. This one was a lot of fun, with much of the story driven by the butchers increasingly bad choices, all made in an effort to fix his many mistakes, while also being emotionally resonant.Ted Cross does a beautiful a job with his tale of a treasure hunt gone horribly awry for a group of young Vikings trespassing upon a dragons lair. The youthful characters of Dragon Play are well done, and I couldnt help but feel a little bit of The Goonies vibe in their doomed sojourn. Kim Wells gives an interesting spin on dragon mythos, and the history of life on Earth itself, with The Book of Safkhet, an ancient scroll that tells the tales of a doomed civilization. Grey, by Chris Pourteau, presents a stirring tale of friendship between a female human child and an ancient dragon who is the last of its kind. The emotion and turbulence on display between these two very different species is wonderfully authentic and may be my favorite of the bunch.As I said before, not every anthology can please every reader. For my own tastes, this collection felt a little too long, and I was a bit surprised at the number of stories that relied on shape-shifting for its central conceit. It was an interesting approach at first, but one that became a bit dulled through repetition.Still, those small caveats aside, I found The Dragon Chronicles to be a pretty solid collection overall, and a sturdy addition to Samuel Peraltas ongoing Future Chronicles series. Dragon lovers should find a number of stories to enjoy here (in nicely digestible sizes at that).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHV19DYDM5AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993983219#wasThisHelpful","R1EHV19DYDM5AI","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher via NetGalley.]Ania Ahlborns latest, Within These Walls, might be the best horror book of 2015 thus far. Well written, and filled with depth of character and authorial confidence, its certainly among the best of the trio of Ahlborns releases that Ive read (although her next novel, Brother, due out in September sounds like it could pose some stiff competition).Taking center stage here is Lucas Graham, a washed-up true crime novelist whose marriage is on its last legs, and his angst-fueled twelve year old daughter, Virginia. Graham receives an offer from inmate Jeff Halcomb to pen the definitive account of a cult murder-suicide that occurred in Washington in 1983. The catch  because isnt there always a catch?  is that Lucas has to move into the home where the grisly murders occurred. Graham convinces himself this is a fair trade, and one that might not only salvage his career but win back the love of his wife.What follows is a complex but consistently engaging story of familial detachment, a charismatic cult leader and his sad followers, and a haunted house that hides the secrets of its past. The main narrative is fueled by a series of flashbacks to 1983, which thankfully never feel misplaced nor pose as a distraction that threaten to derail the steady pacing of the novel, along with excerpts from news broadcasts, police reports, and write-ups from paranormal investigators. Each of these elements provide necessary background and serve to enrich the core of this story, while Ahlborn entwines various threads of her narrative into a stunningly dark and brave finale that left me jarred.If youve not yet read any of Ahlborns work, now is the time! Or, if youre a fan of Stephen King, grab a copy and sit a while with this one; I think youll feel at home with it. Within These Walls is a gritty, haunting, and atmospheric read, and one that I expect to be a contender on a lot of Best Of lists by years end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSRB5EXWMLN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OKRO#wasThisHelpful","R2WSRB5EXWMLN5","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an ARC from the Apocalypse Weird crew for review.]One of the things Ive enjoyed most about the Apocalypse Weird bookverse is that it has been a wonderful gateway to a lot of new authors I might not have otherwise found. Nick Cole and Michael Bunker are pretty well known names, but its been a real treat discovering writers like Chris Pourteau, Jennifer Ellis, Kim Wells, and Forbes West, among others. The latest to join the AW roster is Stefan Bolz, with Genesis.Right from the start, Bolz had me deeply invested in his primary character, Kasey Byrne, who we meet as a child with a rebellious streak. Theres a terrific bit of insight into Kaseys young mindset that quickly brings us up to speed on who this girl is in a very short span. When her 18-year-old self takes the reins, I was already deeply invested and quite attached to Kasey and her role in the constantly-building apocalypse.So far, each of the AW writers have been able to put a suitable spin on each of their regional catastrophes, going bonkers with time travel, alien invasions, demonic motorcycle clubs, zombie bears, the mysterious and clearly crazy Dr. Midnite, and more. Bolz adds to the mix a New Jersey gone insane with mass suicides, a cool spin on the demonic motorcycle riders  dubbed here as Blood Riders  and a nasty shape shifter.Stefan takes the intriguing route of filtering his story through a young adult fantasy tale, the climax of which will no doubt have readers clamoring for book two. The White Dragon itself becomes an intriguing component of the finale, and promises to have a much grander role as this particular series progresses. And Kaseys overarching role in the apocalypse writ-large, and the developing myth-arc shaping up in the background in each of these books, promises to be epic. There is a definite sense of the Heros Journey in Kasey Byrnes life, and Im very eager to see it take shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSB5LL4AG7UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB222MY#wasThisHelpful","R3KSB5LL4AG7UF","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review.]Keith Ferrarios Monster begins with the discovery an unknown substance buried very deep in the Antarctic ice. As a huge fan of John Carpenters The Thing, I was immediately lulled in by Monsters description. Im a big fan of horror that uses extreme locations as its primary setting, and have a particular fondness for arctic climes. So, I figured this book would be right up my alley. Unfortunately (for me at least), the arctic horror is only, literally, half of the story.Monster is divided into two parts. In the first part, were introduced to Adam Hayes, who pilots a small team to the Antarctic base after the researchers housed there have stopped communicating. This is a solid enough story and hit many of the right notes for me and thenit just sort of ended.Part Two acts as a pretty hard reboot halfway through, introducing us to all new characters in an all new setting. All of the momentum and tension that Ferrario built up in the tight confines of the research base completely disappears as readers are put back at square one and thrust into a medical mystery.And this is really the main problem I had with Monster. It reads more like two novellas that were glued together by a faint thread. Its not until the book is nearly finished that Ferrario starts layering in the connections in explicit detail, but by then the story has been bogged down in reorienting readers to an entirely new situation and unveiling all the subterfuge and conspiracy stuff thats been happening around them.Unfortunately, theres just a little too much subterfuge for my liking here, on behalf of both the characters and Ferrario himself. Part Two snapped me so far out of the reading experience that I wasnt able to ground myself in the story again, and I wasnt nearly as interested in the happenings of the books second half as I was in the first. At a point where the driving force behind the story is at its highest, to suddenly have the rug pulled out from us and forced to start over felt more like a disheartening cheat than authorial cunning. Monster should have been rocketing toward its conclusion, instead of limping along with all-new introductions of everything. By the time the ending did near, I found myself increasingly indifferent to its resolution.Ill give Ferrario credit, though  upending readers expectations so ferociously and flipping the script entirely half-way through is an incredibly ballsy move. For me, it didnt quite pay off, even if I do think the core idea behind the plot is not only solid, but damn intriguing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM15GALVW6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619227770#wasThisHelpful","R2RM15GALVW6J","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review.]First Activation has really strong premise that gets saddled with some middling characterization and improbable behaviors by its leads. Now, that said, I mostly enjoyed the book and found it to be a pretty effective page-turner that could have benefited from a deeper content edit, despite shaking my head a few times and second-guessing certain actions throughout the story.The Wearmouths craft a fun little survival story about two Brits heading to New York for vacation, but suddenly find themselves thrust into an apocalyptic scenario upon landing. JFK Airport and the surrounding area are lifeless and the dead bodies are piling up. A sort-of plague compels people to kill one person and then commit suicide, in a twisted bit of get one, give one horror show. I found it to be a really inventive hook, and its a refreshing change of pace from the usual zombie fare that most apocalypses seem to involve nowadays. Its the kind of premise that instills an automatic distrust of other survivors and keep the tension high.The two Brits, Jack and Harry, find others survivors to aid them, but they never truly feel like the fish out of water that they are. Imagine being stuck in a foreign land, surrounded by suddenly crazed, homicidal, suicidal maniacs, and being completely lost. Honestly, that would frighten the hell out of me, but Jack and Harry never seem to be put out by the situation. The narration is told through first-person, so we also never get into any of the other characters heads and can only guess at their emotional states and motivations, which makes things a bit more frustrating. There are casualties that hit pretty close to home, too, but nobody seems bothered by that either, as character behaviors spin on a dime to suit the plot, rather than being an organic change or deeply explored and rooted within the story.Despite this, I still wanted to know what the heck was happening. I had questions and I wanted answers. How did this apocalypse begin, who was behind it, and why? The high concept of the story was enough to keep me reading, even while some other aspects of the story and its cast felt a bit ham-fisted and poorly thought out. I wanted to know what was coming next, and for that I have to give the authors their due.Overall, this is a pretty solid two-star read (meaning it was OK on the Goodreads scale, or 3-stars on Amazon), hampered by the questionable motives and actions of its cast, which can sometimes be ridiculously inexplicable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGR6DIX3RCU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIXMCRK#wasThisHelpful","RXGR6DIX3RCU6","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced copy of this book from the author for review.]With the apocalypse in full-swing in Los Angeles and Texas, Kim Wells brings the mayhem to the Louisianas French Quarter. In Hoodoopocalypse, we get voodoo, spellcasting, the birth of a massive hurricane, an angry demon god and his violent acolytes, a mysterious magic shop andgladiator fights?Yup, gladiator fights. Mad Max has apparently been a solid influence on the Apocalypse Weird writers, and Wells gets all nice and Thunderdome-y here, turning the Superdome into a bloody combat zone where fighters square off against one another, as well as lions, hyenas, and trigger-happy gunmen. Oh my.Theres a good amount of fun on display here, and those AW readers that have been paying attention to the growing series of books under this banner will recognize a ton of nods to Chris Pourteaus entry, The Serenity Strain. Those looking for some serious glimpses of interconnectivity between the disparate apocalypses need look no further than these two efforts.Wells puts on display a lot of tantalizing hints as to where future installments of her Hoodoo series will go, and Im eager to see her cash in on a number of these elements and the cross-over potential with the neighboring apocalypse in Texas. One weird element that I was really looking forward to was sadly fleeting, but I wont spoil the details, only that it comes during the books climax and that its an element that I hope to see more of in the next volume.Still, what Wells does pull together here is a nice primer for future Hoodoo stories, and it looks to be a solid epic in the making in its own right should the Tarot cards land properly. Hoodoopocalypse itself is yet another solid entry in the shared universe of Apocalypse Weird titles, and already has me craving more Cajun craziness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7ZN67Q8V342/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCUR560#wasThisHelpful","R2R7ZN67Q8V342","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tim Currans latest finds six twenty-somethings lost in the small-town of Stokes after an ill-advised shortcut off the highway following a night of partying. The de facto leader of the group, Chazz, is driving drunk and hits a manwho just so happens to not be a man at all, but a strangely configured collection of doll parts. And the town of Stokes? It shouldnt exist at all, after a fire wiped the town off the map. Separated by attacking doll creatures, the group stumble through Stokes while Curran delivers one scare after another.Few horror authors deliver as consistently, or get under my skin quite as effectively, as Tim Curran. He is a master at description, and he fills Stokes and its inhabitants with carefully sketched details, and his gory details are enough to send up shivers. Ive often referred to him as Michigans answer to Stephen King, and I think that Doll Face captures this assessment fairly well. The premise is rather outlandish, and would likely prove to be ridiculous, if not outright comical, in less capable hands, but Curran is able to, somehow, make it work. The murderous, doll-like villains are certainly not your average Barbies or even your basically creepy Hummel figurines. Theyre axe-wielding, rapey psychopaths hell-bent on murder, their lust for blood utterly insatiable. Curran kicks it up a notch further with an intriguing history of Stokes as a factory town, infusing his story with a solid dose of industrial horror and truly awful spidery creations and rampaging Frankenstein-ish weirdos.Anyone familiar with horror in general, and Curran in particular, know that these six lost souls are largely cannon fodder. Most of them are pretty well-developed, thankfully, and it makes losing them a bit hard to take given the perversely macabre ways of their dispatch. One meets an end that is not only revolting and squirm-inducing, but truly heart-breaking.I have only one complaint, and its that Doll Face gets a little too long in the tooth. The middle portion of the book dragged as the group basically finds themselves running in circles from one danger to the next, and I wished that Curran would just get to the point already. Still, that last third of the book is terrifically well-done and the climax is positively outstanding, with a chilling final sentence. While its not my favorite Tim Curran book (Dead Sea still holds top honors), it is certainly well worth reading. Go get it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZNIPEXNW2F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3WTBFW#wasThisHelpful","R2VZNIPEXNW2F5","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced readers copy of this title from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review.]Flex is a novel that grabbed me right off the bat, from its evocative cover art to the intense magic-as-a-drug fueled prologue, and sucked me in with Pauls struggles to cope with and help his tragically burned daughter.Ferrett Steinmetz is able to quickly construct a familiar world, one where not only is magic real and rightfully dangerous, but which can also be synthesized into a drug called Flex. Needless to say, magic is illegal, with its wielders forced into military service. In the books opening pages, Paul learns that he is gifted with mancy, but that its use has very real, very serious repercussions. Magic flexes the universe, but thats not something to simply toy around with because the universe flexes back. And while magic may break the physics that shape our world, it remains true that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. And karma, well, shes a bitch.After learning that a terrorist named Anathema, who uses the Flex blowback to target her victims, is responsible for nearly killing his daughter, and that the insurance company, who Paul works for, is refusing to cover her treatments, Paul goes into the Flex making business. This is where Steinmetz earns his Breaking Bad comparison, and its well-earned. If youre going to put a magical spin on recent pop culture phenomena, you could do a lot worse than look to that drug dealing drama for inspiration.One thing that I really appreciated in this title, though, is just how mundane it can be, and that really helps to ground the story. For instance, although magic is dangerous, its not exactly sexy. Pauls powers stem from his love of bureaucracy and filing paperwork, and hes able to tap into top-secret CIA documents and police reports by magically filing requisition forms. His partner-in-crime, Valentine, is a gamemancer  shes a video game addict, and her love of Wii and 3DS fuels her magical abilities, along with some healthy inspiration from the Metal Gear Solid series.It helps, too, that Steinmetz casts his characters are real people, first and foremost. These arent part-time models who strut around on the catwalk and then fight crime at night. Pauls a paper-pusher for an insurance company. An ex-cop, he lost a foot in the line of duty and has a robotic prosthetic that can be a bit ungainly. Valentine is a wonderfully natural heroine, a bit chubby, a bit geeky, a bit sarcastic, and she adopts Pauls mission as her own out of sincere compassion. They make for a dynamic team, and their relationship shows wonderful growth.I have to give Steinmetz a lot of credit for inserting as much realism and humanity into the story as he does, and this is a large part of the reason for why the book works as well as it does. Its clear that a lot of effort went into making the fantastic as relatable as possible, and theres a terrific amount of world building constructed around the disruption that magic, and its rules, brings to the table. Flex was an absolute delight to read, and my only real lament is that I cant cast some bureaucromancy of my own to conjure up the sequel right friggin now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJ83WTDA6Q1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNPF4BS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJ83WTDA6Q1U","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced reader's copy of this book from the author in exchange for review.]Fans of Nicholas Sansbury Smith's opening gambit in the Extinction Cycle series, Extinction Horizon, will find plenty to enjoy in this bio-tech military thriller. Extinction Edge picks up a short time after the fall-out of Book One's finale, with the nasty, and now evolving, Variants taking center-stage as the primary threat.Smith's readers probably know what to expect by now, and, as per his usual, the author continues to deliver the goods with knowing nods toward technothriller, horror, sci-fi, and post-apocalypse genres. There's also a lot of well-executed action and plenty of rousing man versus monster scenes that will leave readers ragged, as the remnants of the US military, with Reed Beckham's Delta team on the front-lines, perform a rescue mission to Fort Bragg, before launching Operation Liberty in an effort to reclaim New York from the Variants.For as good as it is - and it is very good - Extinction Edge suffers a teensy bit from middle-child syndrome. It has to carry on from the events of the previous book, without resolving too many story threads, while not only setting up Book 3 but acting as a gripping narrative in its own right. While the action is top-notch and Smith had my attention throughout, the medical thriller aspects that I loved in Extinction Horizon are forced to take a bit of a backseat to the military operations. Dr. Kate Lovato is stuck in a bit of a no-win scenario, and spends most of the book determined to believe that there is no way to cure the Variants and that they're an unstoppable force. This causes her to make a big decision that will no doubt play center-stage in the next installment, but finds herself in a rut for most of this book. However, there is a burgeoning romance between her and Beckham, with their connection to one another deepening nicely, and providing a reason for both of them to keep on fighting. I just wish she had a more pro-active role here.Smith introduces us to some new faces, such as a trio of survivors in New York, as well as some new military operators that join Beckham's team. The best of these is Fritz, a war vet who lost both of his legs to an IED and has blade prosthetics. I found this character to be solidly worth rooting for, particularly in the book's finale where he gets a standout bit of imagery as he emerges from the fog of war. It's great stuff, and I look forward to reading more about him!I'm really liking Smith's take on the apocalypse in the Extinction Cycle, blending together viral outbreaks, sort-of zombies, and military thriller. The story is well-crafted, the characters are believable, and the action makes for an exciting read. If you haven't yet read the previous installment, Extinction Horizon, then get on that pronto. This is definitely a series worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELYINXK7OMEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RICW37Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ELYINXK7OMEL","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced reader's copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley for review.]Although I've not read nearly enough of Greg F. Gifune's work, the few titles of his that I have are quickly making me a fan. He's a terrific writer and able to create believable characters in a short amount of time.I've only read Lords of Twilight and Oasis of the Damned previously, with this book, Orphans of Wonderland, being the first full-length novel, and what impresses me the most is his breadth as an author. So, while I only have three titles to base a judgement on his oeuvre, his work thus far has never struck me as derivative, and it's impossible to fancy him as a one-note author, hammering away at the same themes and concepts from book to book. There's a few writer's out there who have made a career out of writing basically the same novel for decades on end, but Gifune is quite clearly not one of them. Orphans is completely different from Oasis, which was a stark contrast to Lords of Twilight. And I freakin' love that!Orphans of Wonderland plays like traditional mystery, but with dashes of the weird. The main protag here is Joel, a small-town reporter who once made a big-time splash with his investigation of a young girl's murder at the hands of a Satanic cult. He's disappeared into obscurity, living with his wife and covering local events where he writes about school cafeteria lunch programs and reports little league scores. After a childhood friend, Lonnie, is killed, he's pulled back into investigating the dark events surrounding the murder, as well as his own past.Frankly, there's a lot going on here. It's a dense story, but Gifune juggles it well. The plot is infused with the occult, demons, mysterious radio broadcasts, and far-reaching conspiracies. Think The X-Files in its heyday, but with a stronger Kolchak influence, thanks to Joel's journalism pedigree. What I loved most about it was the layered sense of history, as Joel reflects on his childhood and the friends he's lost - and forced to suddenly reunite with - as he gets closer to uncovering the truth behind Lonnie's demise. And as Joel discovers those truths? Man, it's a powerhouse, and I could feel little parts of myself cracking in sympathy for him.The only complaint I have is that the ending wasn't quite as powerful as the events preceding it. It lacked some of the oomph I was expecting, and it didn't really dazzle or surprise, with the last-minute reveal acting as more of a confirmation of my suspicions rather than unexpected twist.But, that minor bit aside, I totally dug this book and find it an easy one to recommend. The story has so much going for it, and Gifune gets so many things right, that it's easily worth the time to read. Check it out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPOO1LBPUYOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619227746#wasThisHelpful","R3UPOO1LBPUYOD","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Meikle delivers a solid, if somewhat quiet, ghost story in Tormentor.Jim has escaped to Dunvegan, Scotland, following the loss of his young wife to cancer. Independently wealthy, he's able to buy a nice piece of property, but begins to learn that this centuries old house has secrets. Not such an uncommon thing, until he begins waking to soot marks scratched across his bathroom mirror, mysterious e-mails, and drawings of matchstick men with missing limbs.Meikle does a great job of recreating a chilling Scotland climate, and captures the culture of pub life and male friendship nicely. While this is a ghost story first and foremost, it's fairly light on terror. There's a few scenes of quiet dread and unease, and a well-crafted spooky atmosphere, particularly as Jim begins to realize what's happening in his old home and becomes driven by the mystery of it all. This story is certainly worth a read, and up to par with the usual top-notch production of the DarkFuse brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCU58AG5J1X6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW8UBKS#wasThisHelpful","RCU58AG5J1X6W","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced readers copy of this book from the author for review.]Although weve been to Texas before, in Michael Bunker and Nick Coles Texocalypse Now, that story was focused on five-year hence in the Apocalypse Weird bookverse. This gives Chris Pourteau a chance to establish how, exactly, the Lone Star State got so wonderfully fed up and what some of the survivors went through.Pourteaus entry is a wonderful hodge-podge of maniacs, genetic manipulation, and a struggle to survive. Our main protagonists are a separated couple and their daughter, this family forced to reunite under the looming threat of a series of hurricanes. All of this combines to create a cli-fi thriller with some dashes of horror that works tremendously well, and at the time of this writing, might even be my personal favorite in the Apocalypse Weird series thus far.To top it off, Pourteau introduces the demon Id, a specter birthed in the eye of a hurricane and who has a penchant for frying hapless victims with bolts of lightning. Im looking forward to her taking on an expanded role in future volumes, but shes established nicely here and I really dug the formation of a Charles Manson-esque cult devoted to her.At its core, The Serenity Strain is all about family drama. Whether its the anxiety generated from a feuding couple forced into confined spaces and relearning how to cope as a family unit in the wake of separation and distrust, or the burgeoning creation of a twisted hierarchy between the escaped prisoners as they seek Id. Its really compelling stuff and the twin tales work as counterpoint to the other, helping to elevate what could have simply been a tried-and-true good-versus-evil story into something thats far more emotionally resonant. Getting to know both of these families makes the powerful finale especially meaningful.I also have to give props to Ben Adams, who created a couple of illustrations for the book, one of Id and one of the books primary antagonists, Maestro. Theyre really beautiful work! (Im not sure if his art appeared any of the other AW titles, but finding them in this particular ARC was a wonderful surprise). Adams is also responsible for the stunning cover to Michael Bunkers forthcoming Brother, Frankenstein, so be sure to check out his work. Hes got lots of talent!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRU5K77V8A6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVCVRZ0#wasThisHelpful","RLRU5K77V8A6W","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[I received an advanced readers copy of this book from the author for review.]Ill be honest  when I found out that Nick Coles second entry in the Apocalypse Weird bookverse would be including a special needs character obsessed with Batman, I was little apprehensive. Would this just be a silly gag, or a manufactured attempt to tug at peoples heart-strings?Theres a certain amount of deftness that goes into creating and respectfully handling characters with special needs, and I worried that such a character might be improperly tended to, or that the balance required in fleshing out such a character properly would somehow be upset. It wasnt a matter of Cole being PC or not; I just didnt want the story or the character to feel cheap, and I didnt want this character to be, even worse, just a prop.Mostly, I just wasnt as familiar with Coles work as I should be, having only read his prior AW entry (sorry, but I havent gotten to Soda Pop Soldier or The Wasteland saga yet), and so I was unsure of his sensibilities as an author. And, shame on me for the apprehension. Cole handles this aspect of The Dark Knight with delicate aplomb and creates a character in Corey that is fleshed-out nicely. I really shouldnt have worried, and this character becomes one of the more engaging aspects of the book and takes center stage beautifully. I was a bit broken-heated over Coreys background, but not in a used, schmaltzy way. Cole quickly convinced me that he was writing a human being, with real human struggles, one that I could relate to and empathize with. I was worried about artifice, while Cole was serving up authenticity. I was right there with him, in the middle of this zombie plague, worrying for him and hoping hed make it through OK.Nicely done, Mr. Cole. Im sorry to have doubted you initially, but count me as a fan now, please.Regarding the rest of The Dark Knight, we pick up with the prior books survivors dealing with the personal fallout from that climax, and it proceeds in sensible fashion. Holiday isnt quite the drunk he was last time around, working to make amends, but whatever trust hed built up has been squandered. Theres a simmering tension between he and Frank, with the latter routinely calling out Holidays lack of foresight, and you just have to wonder how long itll be before these two snap and try to pound one another into the ground.And, although I enjoyed Book 1 in the WYRD series, The Red King, I did have a few quibbles with it and felt it carried a little too much on its shoulders. The Dark Knight is measurably better, in my opinion, and now that there are other Apocalypse Weird novels breaking out onto the scene it allows Cole to focus solely on his own story without having to tease, and leave unresolved, other weird disasters that AW authors will be tackling. The core of the story is dynamite, and its allowed now to exist on its own, with its own agency, and act as less of a set-up for other ancillary tales. That said, some of the dangling threads from the prior book are explored here in much greater detail, and far more satisfactorily, helping to showcase the unusual dual nature in mankinds fall by way of zombie horror and a detour towell, I wont say much more lest I ruin the fun!Were in a good spot with this AW bookverse now, and things are really shaping up nicely. With six titles in the wings, theres plenty of pages out there to determine the worth of this ongoing Apocalypse Weird enterprise, and, man, I really think it looks like a winner. Im excited to see what comes next, and will be anticipating my next fix of strange end of the world scenarios, along with the next WYRD book, naturally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HN12TDHZ7SBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508542538#wasThisHelpful","R2HN12TDHZ7SBW","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced readers copy of this book from the author for review.]Im a sucker for arctic survival stories, and have a particular soft-spot for thrillers and horror stories that are set against a snowy, frigid backdrop. So, when I learned that Apocalypse Weird would be venturing to the far north with Jennifer Elliss Reversal, I was eager to read it, particularly once I saw The Thing get name-dropped in the description.Ive mentioned in my other reviews of Apocalypse Weird titles that I was enjoying how this open-sandbox world was shaping up, and this entry is no different. As with the other titles kicking off the AW launch, there are certain touchstones to help unify it to the larger universe being constructed here but with enough room to maneuver to allow Ellis to tell her own unique story set in a very unique part of the world.We have mentions of Dr. Midnight, several mysterious URLs, demonic members of the 88, and a deeper look at the day of blindness. All of this is fairly naturally crafted into Elliss own narrative about the End Times, which sees a sudden and complete reversal of Earths polarity and a central mystery about what, exactly, is happening. And this mystery is where a good amount of fun questioning comes into play  how did a scientist from the antarctic end up in the arctic, why is the polar research station suddenly different, and whats with all these weird craters that have mysteriously appeared?This culminates in a heated finale that gives us, perhaps for the first time, a glimpse at the true inner-workings of the Apocalypse Weird universe and an indication of just how expansive the overarching mythology could prove to be as the story builds. As with the other entries, there is a shared expectation of what comes next and further musings over how and when these various series will intersect, but whatever culmination is on the horizon promises to be big. In the meantime, the journey, which is really only just getting started, mind you, is shaping up to be epic and well worth readers investment.

"[Note: I received an advanced reader's copy from the author for review.]Author E.E. Giorgi delves into the Apocalypse Weird world with Immunity. Set in New Mexico, the story focuses on two scientists, Anu and David, who are working to find a cure to the H7N7 flu virus that has devastated Los Angeles (see Nick Cole's The Red King for the scoop on that) and kicked off a zombie plague.The writing is crisp and straight-forward, and Giorgi kept me hooked all the way through. After reading Cole and Bunker's efforts, it was a bit refreshing to discover how tonally different Immunity was, despite being part of a shared universe. The first half of the book is a quieter effort than the other Apocalypse Weird books I've read, but certainly no less engaging. Giorgi is focused on the characters first and foremost, along with the science behind the bio-engineered autoimmune flu, and it makes for nifty reading, giving a bit more depth to the interrelated works without making the shared events feel repetitive.Giorgi draws in several of what are quickly shaping up to be Apocalypse Weird staples: there's the radio rantings of Dr. Midnight, and although the central villain, General Wick (perhaps short for Wicked?) Naga is not explicitly defined as one of the 88, the text makes it apparent that he is,  and he brings his Black Hand subordinates in tow.The inciting incident here is the day of darkness, when the whole world went blind for a day, as mentioned in Texocalypse Now, and it drives the back half of the book into all-out action as the plot's various elements are drawn together in a fiery, adrenaline-fueled climax.There's a dash of science, a good bit of conspiracy, and plenty of apocalyptic dread casting a large shadow over the work. Giorgi brings a subtle bit of welcome flavoring to the Apocalypse Weird smorgasbord by taking a techno-thriller approach to the End Times, while fleshing out the AW world in sensible fashion. Immunity is a solid addition to the apocalyptic tapestry taking shape so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJNTFFC17096/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUXICHG#wasThisHelpful","R1DJNTFFC17096","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keith Deininger's THE HALLOW is a quiet, psychedelic story of the world slipping out of place.Early on, James and girlfriend, Allie, discuss the end of the world and how they think it will happen - a viral outbreak, a meteor crashing into Earth, a zombie plague. Allie warns him that when the end comes, it'll be subtle, and that most won't even know that it's happened. As this short novella progresses, we get hints that the end has, in fact, come and that Allie knows more than she has let on.Deininger's story is subtle yet powerful.

"Masters of Blood and Bone is a hard work to pin-down, so steeped is it in a multitude of genres that it defies simple categorization. Craig Saunders has taken the detective genre, by way of urban paranormal noir, and run it through the blender with a strong measure of high fantasy, and written with a deft, contemplative style ripe with intense imagery.Honestly, Im not sure that I can adequately write about this work, because its one of those books that you just need to read for yourself and experience. Go drown yourself in the words and let those inky worms crawl over your flesh and consume you. (Trust me, that will make more sense after you read this book)Taking center stage in Saunderss narrative is a fat ex-cop named Holland. When we meet him, hes reading a book of significant power, and by the time his seventeen-year-old daughter, Ank, reads some of it, the damage has been done. An ancient wizard had cast himself into the books pages long ago, and Holland has inadvertently unlocked its cage. Now, his daughter is missing and an old evil is loose in the world.Saunders has a terrific writing voice, and hes able to blend these disparate genres seamlessly. I absolutely loved the twists of turns, and pitting a hard-boiled PI against ancient gods of lore in an effort to save his daughter was perfectly mesmerizing. I also really loved the characters  Holland is a great protagonist and his daughter is a wonderful character filled with an agency of her own. Ank is a real spit-fire and a far cry from the damsel in distress, despite being trapped in a rather peculiar and threatening situation.In short, I found Masters of Blood and Bone to be a perfect read, and I loved every page of it. Theres just so much literary panache and noir-cool that its utterly impossible for me to not fall in love with this book. Im keeping my fingers crossed for a return to this world in the near-future, and I think it could make for a fantastic series if Saunders is willing. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F97638OXJXMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSBZQWC#wasThisHelpful","R1F97638OXJXMY","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[I received a complimentary copy of this book from the authors for review.]Although I had a few criticisms with the way various subplots were laid out and resolved (or unresolved, in some cases) in The Red King, the opening gambit to the Apocalypse Weird brand of books was strong enough to hook me on the universe (or bookverse, if you will) as a whole. The premise behind Apocalypse Weird was intriguing enough, and I was excited to see where things were heading with future releases.The latest, Texocalypse Now, a collaboration between Michael Bunker and Nick Cole, is a solid, stronger, and more assured work, and gets right down to its nitty-gritty post-End of Days scenario. Theres plenty of Easter Eggs to be had, too, including brief teases of other AW reads and a nice homage to Stephen King via the books central antagonist, Mayhem (who, upon his introduction, is described as the man in black  a description Kings faithful will recognize immediately, along with the previous names Mayhem has gone by in the past).The Apocalypse Weird banner itself is intriguing in its own right, and Bunker has described it as a sort-of Marvel Universe of digital publishing that allows authors a massive sandbox to play around in with their various apocalyptic tropes. Coles The Red King kicked things off with a zombie uprising in LA. In Texocalypse Now, Bunker and Cole set their sights on Texas, five years after the apocalypse.After life unraveled in the blink of an eye, and humanity was cursed with blindness for twenty-four hours, the survivors struggle through the wastelands and their day-to-day lives. Twenty-something Ellis and his makeshift family of teens survive on a farmstead. Bunkers own life experiences as an off-gridder in Texas help make this scenario of daily survival read not only as entirely plausible but completely realistic. Bunker knows his stuff, and the pages devoted to farm life are well lived in, enough so that you might feel a bit dusty from toiling in the soil.Mayhems arrival in a nearby deserted town drives the books action and introduces us to the villainous Black Hands, after they are enlisted by Mayhem, a member of the demonic 88, to attack the farm.Having had time to adjust to Bunker and Coles episodic conceits to the line-up of stories taking place in the AW series, Im a bit more patient and lenient in my expectations. While I would have liked to have learned more about the 88 and the Black Hand, Im putting an awful lot of trust in these authors to sort things out and provide more background as these assorted series progress. While the authors may cite the Marvel Universe as inspiration, theres a fair amount of small-screen influences at work here, too, and its best to approach these stories as episodes rather than single, complete works.Given that, Im much more satisfied with the brief narrative on display in Texocalypse Now, and Im really looking forward to digging into (forgive the pun) Digger 2.0, as well as the other eclectic books that are forthcoming. Apocalypse Weird is just getting started, but Im marking it as a brand to watch and pay attention to.

"[Note: I received an advanced readers copy from the publisher via NetGalley for review.]Im kind of on the fence regarding Catherine Cavendishs The Pendle Curse. This is not by any means a bad book, but it was a little too staid, a little too cozy, for my tastes.The story is told between two narrators, Laura, who exists in the present-day, and James, a witch in the 1600s era of Pendle Hill. Laura has recently lost her husband and is haunted by him, both literally and emotionally. Needing a break from the mysterious haunting, she treks out to Pendle Hill, a site notorious for its history with witchcraft, and which has been appearing to her in her dreams.As she spends more time in Pendle Hill and becomes familiar with the locals, she becomes aware that something is just not right. Still haunted and torn between a growing passion for the co-owner of the inn she is staying at and her love for her departed husband, she begins to experience even more otherworldly phenomena.While Laura is a well-drawn character, I found myself more interested in the historical happenings of Pendle. James and his family, a coven a witches themselves, get the most action in the story, from summoning their familiars to faring against the accusations of their neighbors that plunge them into a witch trial. Its good stuff, and Cavendish shines in a few particular spots with some nicely horrific scenes of both the supernatural and more human varieties.There is a gothic flavor to the proceedings of The Pendle Curse, and the pacing is rather slow and deliberate. It struck me as a bit more of a cozy supernatural read, with a dash of romance, than an out-and-out horror show. But, as a I said its not a bad read by any means. The characters are strong and kept my attention throughout, and Cavendish does a great job handling the various aspects of witchcraft lore. She also puts a terrific twist on the finale that was both a logical conclusion to what had preceded it, while affirming my suspicions but still managing to surprise with a last-minute flip of the script.Mostly, I just had a different set of expectations going into the book, my first from Cavendish, and I do prefer my horror to be more firmly geared toward the dark and grisly, rather than the gentler touch Cavendish uses to handle the material. So, I wasnt quite satisfied by the overall story but I certainly dont regret the investment in reading time. Im giving this one a pretty solid 3-stars (out of 5, per the Goodreads and Amazon metrics) overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Z7CLZOK0M6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDJV2BY#wasThisHelpful","R36Z7CLZOK0M6X","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't completely sold on It's Only Death, Lee Thompson's foray into the crime genre for dark fiction publisher DarkFuse. My main stumbling block was what I couldn't help but see as a flawed premise.So, here's the scoop - Once upon a time, James was a stupid teenager who hated his father, a cop. He robbed a bank and his father was one of the first responders, and James killed him and took some potshots at father's partner, Don Gray. This incident put him on the lam and he spent ten years on the run. Now, his mother is on death's door and he's come back to town at his sister's behest.And the way this is executed was my central problem with the book. James makes his return known pretty quickly by getting into a clash with a biker gang in the middle of a strip club where his father's former partner, Don Gray, pulls a side job for a local mob boss. This is also where pretty much everyone James knows, outside of his mother, works or hangs out. It doesn't take long for seemingly every single person in Florida to know that James, a murderer on the run, is back in town to visit his dying mother. Gray, though, doesn't arrest James because he wants to kill him instead, as soon as James' mother passes.But, surely there must be other police in Florida who would be willing to arrest this cop-killer who is routinely seen coming and going from his mother's house and raising hell all around the neighborhood? And after getting into a second clash with the biker's at his sister's trailer park, which leads him to killing another biker and adding hit-and-run to his growing list of felonies, he actually drives back to the trailer park, now swarming with cops, with a stolen gun where his whole plan is to kill more bikers.So, yeah...compounding the unlikely event that Florida cops would just allow a cop-killer to wander around freely, James is also pretty frigging stupid. Low-key isn't his specialty, and he's not much of a thinker. When his sister is kidnapped, his big plan is to set fire to building she might be in. I, mean, really?This book was just too much of a frustrating mess for me, and stacked with implausibilities galore. Typically, it doesn't take too long for criminals as stupid as James to get caught, but somehow he survived on the run for 10 years. I'm having a hard time buying that. And this book certainly doesn't hold a candle to other crime thrillers, like Elmore Leonard, James Ellroy, Duane Swierczynski, or Charlie Huston. Despite a fairly well-done climax, the resolution to these tangled threads of It's Only Death fail to make up for a muddled story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9NVLMPYJE7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIVTJYO#wasThisHelpful","R1R9NVLMPYJE7B","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: I received an advanced readers copy from the publisher via NetGalley for review.]Kristopher Rufty knows how to lay his hooks into a reader, and he really drew me in with a knockout closing to the first chapter, which introduces the tiny and wicked threat of the wonderfully named Haunchies. There's just something about that name that I totally dig - it's somewhat innocuous but carries a bit of mysterious weight, a certain edginess to it.And these Haunchies...sheesh. Despite their diminutive stature, they're as bloodthirsty and nasty as you'd expect and desire in a work of dark horror. Rufty doesn't hold back, and, in fact, I'd dare say he brings every gruesome staple to the table here - there are impalings with rusty nails, stabbings, assaults, rape, and all kinds of other nasty business to curl your toes, including some truly creepy body horror that, on more than one occasion, made me squirm.Let's face it, though - if it weren't for an interesting story and solid characters, this book would be nothing more than a bloody mess. And while there's certainly an abundance of dirty deeds on display, the story at work was one I mostly appreciated, with some reservations. A group of social justice crusaders, many of whom have been victimized themselves, are working on rehabilitating an abandoned farmstead to serve as a recovery center for abused men and women. Only too late do they learn of the horrors surrounding their cheaply gotten property and of the fires that ravaged the now largely abandoned community of Doverton.Although The Lurking Season is a sequel to Rufty's earlier The Lurkers, I hadn't read the prior installment and never felt like I was missing any vital information, and this book works well enough to stand on its own two-legs. The precipitating details are related as urban legends, and work to fill in both new reader's like myself, as well as the book's cast of characters (and based on the info given therein, I'm certainly compelled to check out The Lurkers one of these days).As far as the characters go, well, I wasn't quite as sold on them as I was on the story and the turbulence upending the Doverton farm. Aside from Heather and Erin, two of the book's central females, I didn't particularly latch onto anyone, although the severely victimized Brooke was one to root for, if only because of the perils she found herself thrust into. The book has a pretty large cast, too, with the point-of-view shifting between multiple characters, but most of them lack a sufficient amount of depth and serve only as fodder to get run through the meat-grinder.Overall, I wasn't completely blown-away by The Lurking Season, but I did find it be an engaging read and will certainly check out Rufty's other books. The climax was suitably satisfactory, even though I found find a few moments to be stretching the bounds of credibility. However, those with sensitivities toward reading scenes of graphic sexual assault should be warned, as there are a number of rapes and threats of sexual violence throughout, which are quite disturbing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304JBAROUQE1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161922772X#wasThisHelpful","R304JBAROUQE1I","A3RO2SJMK6VFC4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RO2SJMK6VFC4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this compressor to air up the tires on family bikes and scooters and miscellaneous tasks. The compressor won't generate more than about 50 lbs of pressure, but that's enough for what I bought it for.

"Perhaps one of the most gifted writers of our time, Nick blends his characters with humor, tenacity, and smarts that makes you wish they were actually people you know. His books all manage to entertain and keep readers involved, making his work page turners to the highest degree. They also cause Pirogitis, with symptoms of morning red eye and sluggishness -the result of staying up late to read 'just one more chapter' before going to sleep. The only known antidote is to bag the workday and go finish the book.Nick's writing deserves the highest of recommendations, blowing the doors off of New York Times Bestsellers, showing the likes of writers like Patterson, Atkins, and more just how it's done. Looking for a great read? Start out with Nick Pirog. His collection of Unforseen, Gray Matter and Afrikkans is a great start, and you'll be moving on to Oz the Schnoz and the Elephant Rebellion, 3:00am and the Maddy books: Arrival and Borns in no time flat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ME2HO857SKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPEJME2#wasThisHelpful","R1ME2HO857SKX","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are foam tubes sliced down the side to fit over the plastic tubes that go over the ears on oxygen cannulas. I was disappointed that they fall off easily; the manufacturer really should have lined their interior with stickum so they would stay where they were put and not slide out of place or fall off. They're a good idea and provide welcome relief from the painful irritation of wearing an oxygen cannula, but they could be better. I tried using fabric tape to hold the protectors in place, but ended up just wrapping the cannula tube with the tape where it went over my ear.

"DJI is the de facto leader when it comes to multirotor aircraft. I own four Phantom 2s, one is a Vision and the other three are the standard Phantom 2 with Zenmuse brushless gimbals for my GoPro 3 and 3+ cameras.  While the Phantom is simple to fly, people will have issues with them if they don't calibrate their compass and IMU. Both of these are easily done. If your aircraft flies in a spiral, chances are good you need to calibrate the compass to prevent ""toilet bowling."" The Software Assistant permits you to create a ""geo fence,"" placing limits on how distant and how high the aircraft is permitted to go. Built in failsafe will return the aircraft to its takeoff point if it loses contact with the radio control or the battery level gets too low. The Phantom is a fun aircraft to fly, but it excels at aerial photography, permitting photos and videos that can't be taken any other way. It is necessary to wait for the aircraft to ""boot"" up, lock onto GPS satellites and to record its position for failsafe return. As long as you read and follow the instructions, you should have a great aircraft that will deliver around 20 or so minutes of flight time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MNYBST4HBV5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFBAT56#wasThisHelpful","R3MNYBST4HBV5V","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am actually reviewing all three of Paul Antony Jones' books in the Extinction Point series. Paul delivers us some great and believable characters and crafts an equally good story to carry them. By the very name of the series it's easy to know that this is an end of humanity story. That it happens as a punishment for mankind's waste of the earth's climate and resources is sadly become a thin and annoying, but at least Jones doesn't o on and on about it, choosing instead to focus on Emily, the book's heroine. This book, number 3 in the series, is the last of the three volume tale, which could be described as The Hunger Games meets The Wizard of Oz but that would be a bit trite and the book deserves better. While each book could be read standalone, it really only makes real sense if the series is read, in order. That said, the series is a good and enticing read and worth the purchase price. It would be good if the author released the series as a package that includes all three of the books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NYRAPFQ8D9L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3MKEGA#wasThisHelpful","R1NYRAPFQ8D9L7","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a book I couldn't stop reading, and once I'd finished it, I immediately bought its sequel, Edward Adrift. It's a wonderful tale that has you rooting for Edward unable to see what happens next.

"Bridgeman seems to make the characters the story rather than being a part of the story. She goes off plot on long and plodding aspects of the characters to the point I found myself scanning past entire pages looking for the plot lines buried in all of the irrelevancies. The author also paints the military as overly macho, denigrating women as a weaker sex and useless to their missions in a way reminiscent of 1950s sci fi.  She also writes in a lot of gratuitous violence which is oddly lacking in the action to support it. However, Bridgeman's story is a decent enough one that it keeps you reading in spite of its flaws. I think that this book could lose a lot of textual weight and be an exiting novella, but the sheer density of the book as it is, is overdone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGA3DDGY1ED0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMFEUQW#wasThisHelpful","R2SGA3DDGY1ED0","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't like that you have to press the charge button after plugging in the USB cable for the device you're charging and I hate that it shuts off the charge when it thinks your device has had enough rather than letting your device make that choice. I keep ending up only getting 3/4 of a charge rather than a top off. I have a few Anker devices and I like them a lot. I can keep a device plugged into it 24/7 and even recharge it while I'm charging devices. This won't permit that. On the whole I find myself constantly pressing the charge button because it has shut itself off while powering multiple devices.

"This is the second of these I bought from Amazon. I gave the first one I bought to my son because he liked it so much. Both of us adults ( sometimes it's hard to tell), we were chasing each other at night outside using the night vision cameras. I was using a Spy Car and he was using the Trakr. We also had fun with the Trakr driving it into rooms where the grandkids were and using it as a means of negotiating bedtimes or quietly eavesdropping on their comments about the movie they were watching. The Trakr can be programmed to do a number of tasks and you can download little programs that others have made from the company website.

"Having read and enjoyed Nuttall's Arc Royal I looked forward to The Nelson Touch. I wasn't disappointed. The author weaves a believable tale that continues the saga of a once dregs of the Royal Navy outdated starship that became the salvation of earth and her space colonies. I took a single star away because the author tends to be a little long winded and repetitive, but not so that we readers get bored, The Arc Royal, refitted and with many new crew due to promotions (or battle losses) leads a fleet to attack one of the alien enemy's core planets. The story moves well, causing great anticipation about what will happen next in the story. It leaves us wondering what will happen next with the venerable ship and her crews!At the end, the author asks if readers wish a new sequel that features the Arc Royal or a side step into an earth attack that happened as they fought operation Nelson, My answer is that I hope Mr. Nuttall continues to follow the ship, the central character and star of his writing. Like Arc Royal, this was a good read from a very prolific and talented writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SF206A836ONQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6DKWSM#wasThisHelpful","R2SF206A836ONQ","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smitherd hits on  unique situation and gives it a classic sci-fi treatment. He weaves a tale which is quite imaginable in contrast to a lot of recent entries into the genre. He grabs your interest early and keeps it with steady momentum all the way through. If I had an objection it would be that the book ends 88% through the pages. a full 10% of the books mass is a kind of self promotional statement that begs reviews. So believing that there was some twist or epilogue yet to come, instead the book ended rather suddenly. But that aside, Luke Smitherd wove a great tale and I encourage others who enjoy science fiction that is strong on the characters and merely uses sci-fi as the vehicle to read this book. It's a very decent work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUJD131QAOCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHJIJF2#wasThisHelpful","R1NUJD131QAOCL","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hawk Sky was for a time the recommended aircraft for 3D Robotic APM autopilot/flight controller and their FPV kit. I bought mine for this purpose. The initial factory assembly left a bit to be desired. I had to glue and use tape to give it the structural integrity needed to handle hard landings. But with  little preparation this is a great plane for either beginners or for those with advanced flight uses. Low throttle makes for a forgiving and controllable airplane and allows pilots to learn to use coordinated turns. More advanced fliers will find it takes well to thermals and so I can remain aloft surfing updrafts for a considerable time. As for advanced use, those who wish to build an autnomous programmable drone, combines with the APM autopilot or the Pixhawk flight controller kits from 3D Robotics you can have a very capable platform for under $750. This is an excellent deal for an aircraft cable of flying from waypoint to waypoint under GPS direction for geomapping, security, or aerial photography. Lease the landing gear off. Hand launch and body landing work best. I've flown mine in winds up to 10 mph, but that's the planes limits. Much stronger and you will need to bring it down or lose it. It has survived my treatment ad come back for more. The wings use a pass thru spar and are removable for transport and storage, Someone absolutely new to RC flight would find this a great trainer, and advanced fliers will find it excellent at flying thermals or performing clip wing mods (cut off the dihedral curved portion) to allow aerobatics. Insode it has more than enough space to handle the battery, electronics of a flight controller, the GPS receiver, and airspeed pitot system add-ons. I have been flying mine for five years almost, and have it equipped with the APM flight controller. I have gotten excellent HD aerial visuals usins a GoPro camera affixed to a mount I made from model aircraft plywood. For the price and durability, it's definitely one to consider as you choose the right aircraft for your uses.

"Brian Clarke weaves a great tale that follows the genre of Deep Impact and Armageddon combined with intrigue. That said, I found it a bit distracting that the story takes place in America and is written around American characters. However, Brian writes using UK English, spellings and expressions. A lot of this stood out like neon non-sequitors. The book should be edited and ""Americanized"" to eliminate the distractions of this obvious and glaring conflict. The book is based on the explosion of a star and the radiation storm it will unleash on the planet. I don't think saying this is a spoiler. While Mr. Clark does a good job of enumerating the catastrophic effects the radiation storm will wreck on the planet, he seems to have overlooked that the incineration of then entire earth's surface would remove most, if not all of the means of oxygen production. I pulled away one rating star because of his oversight on the atmosphere and for his British writing voice. Other than these two issues, Clarke does a great job with his story and the book is a worthwhile read. I heartily suggest it as both entertaining and informative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5ONQ25OJQAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P132ZA#wasThisHelpful","R2V5ONQ25OJQAF","A2PC9ZZIFV31B1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PC9ZZIFV31B1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been looking for a copy of Windows 7 to install so I can return to the productive environment I had before ""the upgrade"" but Microsoft has pulled it from the market, only selling system builder versions that require way more knowledge than most computer users possess.

"I have a Contour camera I paid the same price for and it outperforms this camera. The AS15 lacks a mount and requires that you use its waterproof case or one of its additional cost accessories to mount it. Unlike the Contour, it must be mounted upright, it doesn't permit image rotation except through software on a phone, tablet or PC. Its image stabilization shuts off if you set it to 170 degree wide angle. It only supports 120 degree. Its setup is not difficult, but working the side buttons can take some concentration and its easy to start filming or taking photos with the position and use of the shutter button as an 'enter' key. When you use the flip out LCD screen accessory, it's very difficult to work the side buttons because they're recessed so deeply. The waterproof case that comes with it is reminiscent of its Contour counterpart. All in all I'm disappointed with this camera, I expected better from Sony.

"I have a Wasabi charger for my GoPro batteries and like it fine, just as I do this one. They're basically the same charger built to accommodate different batteries.

"I was surprised that this color LCD only kicked on as a viewfinder. It doesn't display the settings or setup, you have to use the built-in camera postage stamp sized display. It adds a great deal of size to the camera, defeating the small size. It will display video and photos in a looping slideshow format dictated by the camera.

"I had always wanted to try one of the vibration alarms because I am NOT a morning person. I hate being woken up before I'm naturally ready to wake up. When iluv asked me to test this product in exchange for a review I was really excited!This is super simple to use, you just download an app from the app story (Apple or android) and set your alarms. You can tell it to make noise, vibration or both. You can set up to 10 alarms. I use about 3 usually just to make sure that I actually get out of bed. I only use the vibration because I hate alarms and it wakes me up much more naturally than an alarm noise (which usually scares the crap out of me)I have only charged the vibrator once and have been using it for about a week now. The listing says that it can last a month but I wouldn't go that long without a back up alarm...just in case.I am a side sleeper and don't feel it under my pillow. About the only time I notice it is if I hit it with my arm under my pillow. My favorite thing about it is that it doesn't wake my husband up when I get up with the kids in the morning!  As long as he doesn't wake up, I get to go back to sleep after they go to school!

"The nova smart hammock style back seat cover works GREAT for taking your dogs to get groomed or bathed. Every time we take our poodle terrier to get her hair cut, our car has fur all over it for weeks. With this cover, it keeps her in the back seat and the hair to a minimum.It's super easy to install, just click the straps around the driver, passenger and back seat head rests. It has a zipper option so you can just use one side of your back seat, but works way better as a whole seat cover. I have not tried washing it in the washer/dryer but it does spray off very easy with a hose and dries pretty quickly in the sun.We use it in our 2010 caravan and it completely covers the backs of the front seats and back seats and keeps her from jumping to the front. We received the hammock in exchange for our opinion. The only issue I have with it is that we have split back seats and occasionally she will slip in the center. We just started putting a couple pillows between the seats and it helped. It folds up nice and compact for in car storage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R364OG1X7WIGFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IRBJS0#wasThisHelpful","R364OG1X7WIGFF","A13LHBUYIK9TMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13LHBUYIK9TMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Omg amazing toy!! Literally the only complaint I have about it is that it doesn't come with a storage bag. If you put toys together In a drawer or what ever, they will get ruined. They peel and get yucky.It is rechargeable and activates with everything!  If you put it on the music setting, it activates to noise (not just music ;) and the touch setting activates it to any grip or squeezing. It is super quiet and holds a battery life for a long time.I recharge it over night after a good using and it is always fully charged in the morning.

"The utimi silicone vibrator is a great to for beginners or toy collectors too!  It's great for hitting the g spot and super easy to use. It runs on batteries (two double a batteries) that are simple to install. Just unscrew the bottom and put them in!To turn it on just push the power button and it turns on to basic vibration mode. To change the setting ( there are ten modes) just push the squiggly line button. Every time you push it the mode changes. Power button again to turn it off. I received the dildo in exchange for my opinion and I really enjoy it. It is very soft to the touch and easy to clean. Soap and water, dry it off and store itThe only reason that I downgraded the review to a four star is that I think the company needs to upgrade their storage bag. It's just a cheap, white, super thin little bag that doesn't even have a draw string.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IP41WDIC886N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM4INQY#wasThisHelpful","R3IP41WDIC886N","A13LHBUYIK9TMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13LHBUYIK9TMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The charging station fits very nicely on top of the Xbox one and charges well!  It does not have a light to tell you when the controllers are fully charged, but you can check that on your Xbox if you are worried about it. My kids (and husband) just put the controllers on the charger over night when they aren't using them.You don't have to have an extra outlet because it's just a USB cord that plugs into your Xbox. The front of the docking station has four USB ports so that you can plug in corded controllers or you can even use them to charge phones or what ever you would want to charge.It does have a light that tells you when it's on. The button on the right side of the front of the dock turns on the internal cooling fan. It works great when you have people on the Xbox all day, helps to keep it from over heating.

"This car storage organizer is great for large or small spaces. You can open it up to the large twenty one inch size or use it as a smaller eleven by eleven square. It has buckles that make it adjustable in size.

The ends of the bin have Velcro pouches that close, two smaller and one larger. It comes with a base ""board"" (plastic covered in the same fabric as the bin, I believe) that makes the bin sturdier and keeps its shape well.I use it in between my two front seats in my minivan and it fits perfectly.

"The Otterbox Symmetry series is designed for Samsung Galaxy S5. I already have a black Otterbox Commuter series case on my youngest daughters S5, so I switched that with the Symmetry.  I cannot personally attest to its degree of protection as I am unwilling to throw the phone on the floor/pavement, however, the Symmetry offers Certified Drop Protection -  24+ tests and 238+ hours of testing + one year warranty on the case.Unlike the Commuter, the Symmetry has no extra rubber insulator that surrounds the S5 with a hard plastic semi-enclosed case that snaps onto the rubber (see photo of Commuter series case taken apart). Instead, the Symmetry has just one rubberized lip that surrounds the S5 and a clear, rather rigid plastic backing that is wholly attached to this lip - a one piece case that goes on whole & encompasses the entire S5 phone except for the screen. It is very easy to put on the S5.The sleeker Symmetry also allows users to insert custom designs that can appear through the clear plastic backside. It also means that the rubberized lip is somewhat stiffer than its Defender counterpart. Since both my eldest daughter & husband carry their phones in high-risk mode - S5 bare phone with zero protection from a case - I am glad that Otterbox came out with this series. I am hoping to coax my errant zero-phone-case family members to ease into Symmetry's lighter, sleeker version.If you dislike the bulkiness of Otterboxs Defender or Commuter series, the Symmetry may be what youve been wishing for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HCHQJHIRX8UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TFNC#wasThisHelpful","R3HCHQJHIRX8UG","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost everything I wanted in a laundry tub - deep, sturdy material, center drain hole. Purchasers will need to drill out hole(s) for a faucet (faucet is not included). The laundry tub has a bright yellow Notice with black upper case letters stating ""FAUCET HOLES MUST BE DRILLED OPEN WITH A HOLE SAW. INDENTED LOCATORS ARE NOT TO BE USED AS 'KNOCK'OUTS'!"" These indentations are difficult to discern.My tub arrived with damage but the damage was cosmetic and not structural. I am keeping it since I may not have better luck with a replacement shipment & my box also had the legs. I think that the manufacturers need to rethink their packaging since the tub is placed in a double walled box with zero padding, zero cushioning - not even a plastic bag surrounding it. The photos show the shipping box as it arrived - note all the dust and particulates resulting from its shipping trip and the damage. It is no wonder that the tubs are arriving with damage. I think I should receive a damage discount for keeping the tub & not returning it...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLSYQEYWNOC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MBD2GI#wasThisHelpful","RJLSYQEYWNOC5","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed - Sun and Shade Mix is a product of the renowned Scotts line of lawn care products. My extended family relies only on this brand.My front lawn was ruined by a plumbing company that replaced my sewer & water main pipes. I wanted to try Scotts grass seed to see how well it would work for my lawn, which is partly sunny. I need to have my entire lawn regraded & leveled, so I decided to work on a smaller test area since this area will be ruined during the regrading process. I did not have much success with these seeds. I will wait to see what the spring brings since it became colder here and I intend also to reapply again in the spring and provide an update.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GR74IJBBEK88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8KLA38#wasThisHelpful","R3GR74IJBBEK88","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The RUSK Curl Freak works like the Babyliss Pro Nano Miracurl Steamtech Curl Machine but without the steam feature and for a lower price. I've tried both.The RUSK operates exactly the same way and has the same exact setting options (except for the steam) as the Babyliss and I saw no difference in my curls or with the longevity of the curls. I think that both curl machines are best used on people who have thicker hair. I had difficulty sectioning my ultra fine med-long strands of hair to the recommended width but this was a problem common to both machines for me. I used the RUSK and Babyliss on my 25-yr old daughter's healthy, medium thick, never color-treated hair and met with more success. Still, I find it tedious to complete the entire head and I cannot do the back of my own head due to range of motion issues.It is nice to have tools to create different hairstyles and we decided to keep this machine around for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJ2Y6VSNV2H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVAFHR6#wasThisHelpful","R2HJ2Y6VSNV2H2","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love Izze products. This item is sparkling water with such a teeny amount of sugar that one cannot taste it. Compared to other flavored sparkling beverages, it tastes as good but no different with the added sugar.I think it was a great idea to try out since we add a splash of juice to our flavored seltzer water drinks but we added the juice or some sugary Izze to this product anyway. I really like the packaging of the glass bottles (so sturdy & safe) and like drinking from a glass bottle too!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE70GYMC2BOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","R1NE70GYMC2BOE","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased these for my 25-yr old daughter for walking around campus. This pair was from Amazon's Warehouse deals and arrived in like new condition. My daughter prefers wearing boots around campus instead of jogging style shoes since she never knows when it might rain and she hates to have to be in wet shoes/socks all day - she commutes to college and parking is miles away.These boots have great traction on the bottom, the leather stretches to mold to one's foot, which adds comfort. She likes the look and the fact that there are no laces to deal with. She wears a size 7 and the size 7 fits well.

"Really cute item - reminds me of Wilton Armetale metalware (aluminum-based alloy metal) but it is not made as well. I can see bubbles in the surface. I like that the bottom part is ceramic - if the glaze is unleaded that is - there is no disclosure about which country manufactured the item & I could not discover this on the Internet, which makes me feel a little uneasy.I think it will look cute at a Thanksgiving table.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KESTA2JMOZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGXOO4Q#wasThisHelpful","R10KESTA2JMOZ3","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandmother only used the large Vanity Fair dinner napkins for family gatherings when I was growing up. I prefer Vanity Fair napkins to any other napkin, so I was very happy when Vanity Fair came out with the everyday, smaller-sized napkins.I use this brand of napkin exclusively and it is no wonder since it is such a high quality napkin compared to other brands.

"Once every year or two I make fried chicken. One of my favorite things as a kid was cold fried chicken on a picnic. My Mom/Grandmother used lard or Crisco but I've found that Peanut Oil is an excellent substitute for frying chicken.Planters peanut oil is an excellent brand of oil and I usually use the entire bottle between two large cast iron pans filled twice with fried chicken.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GSEFETDWOS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8GK544#wasThisHelpful","R32GSEFETDWOS2","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
